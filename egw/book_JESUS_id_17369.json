{"word": "Last night the Christmas [Eve] celebration was held in the [Battle Creek] Tabernacle, and it passed off well--modestly, solemnly, and with gratitude expressed in everything done and said, because Jesus the Prince of Life had come to our world a babe in Bethlehem to be an offering for sin. He came to fulfill the prediction of the prophets and seers, which He had instructed them to utter to fulfill the counsels of heaven, and in the great mission and work verify His own word. And for this, every soul is under the most solemn obligation and gratitude to God, that Jesus, the world's Redeemer, has pledged Himself to accomplish the full salvation of every son and daughter of Adam. If they do not accept the heavenly gift, they have only themselves to blame. The sacrifice was ample, wholly consistent with the justice and honor of God's holy law. The Innocent suffered for the guilty, and this should call forth gratitude full and complete.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 368}
