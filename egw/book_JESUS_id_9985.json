{"word": "232\nPRAYER FOR THE SICK SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT GOD\\92S WILL.\\97In prayer for the sick it should be remembered that \\93we know not what we should pray for as we ought.\\94 Romans 8:26. We do not know whether the blessing we desire will be best or not. Therefore our prayers should include this thought: \\93Lord, thou knowest every secret of the soul. Thou art acquainted with these persons. Jesus, their Advocate, gave His life for them. His love for them is greater than ours can possibly be. If, therefore, it is for Thy glory and the good of the afflicted ones, we ask, in the name of Jesus, that they may be restored to health. If it be not Thy will that they may be restored, we ask that Thy grace may comfort and Thy presence sustain them in their sufferings.\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 232}
