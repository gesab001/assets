Her husband was once a wealthy man, extensively engaged in manufacturing; but reverses came, and he was reduced to poverty. Sr. Dow lost her health, and went to our Sanitarium for treatment. There she received the present truth, which she adorns by a consistent Christian life. She has four fine, intelligent children, who are thorough health-reformers, \n                                                                           66\nand can tell you why they are so. Such a family can do much good in a community. They exert a strong influence in the right direction.",
