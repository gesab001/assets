    "word": "Many who are single, and can but barely live, choose to marry and raise a family, when they know they have nothing to support them. And worse than this, they have no family government. Their whole course in their family is marked with their loose, slack habits. They have but little control of themselves, are passionate, impatient, and fretful. Such embrace the message, and then feel that they are entitled to assistance from their more wealthy brethren; and if their expectations are not met, they complain of the church, and accuse them of not living out their faith. Who must be the sufferers in this case? Must the cause of God be sapped, and the treasury in different places exhausted, to take care of these large families of poor? No. The parents must be the sufferers. They will not as a general thing suffer any greater lack after they embrace the Sabbath than they did before.",
