    "word": "Be coworkers with Him. While distrust and alienation are pervading the world, Christ\u2019s disciples are to reveal the spirit that reigns in heaven. Speak as He would speak, act as He would act. Constantly reveal the sweetness of His character. Reveal that wealth of love which underlies all His teachings and all His dealings with humanity. The humblest workers, in cooperation with Christ, may touch chords whose vibrations shall ring to the ends of the earth and make melody throughout eternal ages.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, pp. 158, 159.",
