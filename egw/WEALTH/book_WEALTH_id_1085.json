    "word": "Duty of the wealthy. \n     \"The wealthy man or woman converted to God will begin to comprehend what good may be done with intrusted capital. They will see that institutions are established for the education of the youth, and that they are sustained by gifts and offerings. They will know that many youth must be trained for the missionary field, and the wealthy will become agents in the hands of God to set in operation the instrumentalities whereby men and women may become enlightened.\"--Review and Herald, Sept. 19, 1893.",
