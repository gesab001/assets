    "word": "The bruised and wounded, the lame of the flock, are \n\n138 \n\namong us, and these test the character of those who claim to be children of God. The Lord will not excuse the wrongdoer. He will never sanction partiality to the wealthy or oppression to the weak. He requires exact and impartial justice; more than this, He requires that His followers shall always have compassion for the suffering, pity and love for the erring.--Lt 74, 1896. (SpTMWI 17, 18.)",
