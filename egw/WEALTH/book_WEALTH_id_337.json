    "word": "Christian Character\n     To have fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, is to be ennobled and elevated, and made a partaker of joys unspeakable and full of glory. Food, clothing, station, and wealth may have their value, but to have a connection with God and to be a partaker of his divine nature, is of priceless value. Our life should be hid with Christ in God; and although it \u201cdoth not yet appear what we shall be,\u201d \u201cwhen Christ, who is our life, shall appear,\u201d \u201cwe shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.\u201d [1 John 3:2; Colossians 3:4.] The princely dignity of the Christian character will shine forth as the sun, and the beams of light from the face of Christ will be shed upon those who have purified themselves even as he is pure. The \n374\nprivilege of becoming sons of God is cheaply purchased, even at the sacrifice of everything we possess, be it life itself.\u2014Vol. 4, p. 357.",
