    "word": "The Christian in the market place who keeps his soul unspoiled has a credit in the heavenly courts. His means will not be used to carry out the devising of the enemy, but to do good, in the very lines that God has marked out. The Lord will teach us how to employ all our powers to the glory of His name. The gathering of wealth is to be used in the service of the Master. Thus used, it will bring a hundredfold in this life, and in the life to come glorious and eternal riches.",
