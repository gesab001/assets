    "word": "The qualities which shine with greatest luster in the kingdoms of the world, have no place in Christ's spiritual kingdom. That which is highly exalted among men, and brings exaltation to its possessor, such as caste, rank, position, or wealth, is not esteemed in the spiritual kingdom. The Lord says, \"Them that honour me, I will honour\" (1 Samuel 2:30). In Christ's kingdom men are distinguished according to their piety. . . .",
