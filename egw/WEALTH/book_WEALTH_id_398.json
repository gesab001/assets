    "word": "It is not rank, nor wealth, nor learning, nor power, that lends influence to a Christian; but a willing mind, and a heart consecrated to the cause of Christ. In the service of God there is a place for every one; and He is glorified when every one is satisfied in filling the place appointed him. To His servants He imparts grace sufficient for every duty. However humble may be their sphere of service, they may by His grace reveal that they are Christian gentlemen and Christian ladies.",
