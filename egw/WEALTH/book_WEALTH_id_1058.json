    "word": "In the providence of God, some may gather more wealth than do others. The Lord blesses them with health, with tact and skill, that they may receive of His goods and bestow upon others. The possession of means brings a test of character. All have a responsibility according to that which they have received; and from those who possess wealth, the Lord looks for bountiful gifts. To those who desire to be baptized with the Holy Ghost, I would say, Take up the work of God where you are, and with your gifts help the work in places nigh and afar off.",
