    "word": "If all were devoted to God in that Office, a precious light would shine forth from it, which would have a direct influence upon all who are brought in contact with it. But all need a work done for them. Some are far from God, variable, changeable, and unstable as water. Some, I saw, have no idea of sacrifice. When they desire any pleasure, or any article of dress, or any special indulgence, they do not sit down and consider whether they can do without the article, or deny themselves of the pleasure, and make a freewill offering to God. How many have considered that they were required to make some sacrifice? Although it may be of less value than that of the wealthy man in possession of his thousands, yet that which really costs self-denial would be a precious sacrifice, and an offering to God. It would be a sweet smelling savor, and come up from his altar like sweet incense.",
