    "word": "The end is fast approaching and many in our churches are asleep. Let all now make it their chief business to serve the Lord.

In their desire to follow the fashions of the world, they have lost their zeal for the truth, and they are in peril of losing eternal life. In proportion as God has prospered them, men should return to Him of the goods He has entrusted to their stewardship. . . .",
