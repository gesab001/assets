Many of them are more worthy than the wealthiest, for those who are rich have not all obtained their riches by the strictest principles of integrity. There are those who would not sacrifice principle or strict honest to possess any amount of means. This is the class that if the truth were presented to them in wisdom would receive it, and be reliable workers together with God. The laborer through the wisdom given of God will work in such a way as to draw these parties together in Christ Jesus.--Manuscript 66, 1894.",
