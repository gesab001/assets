    "word": "Do not suppose, as you associate with wealthy men, that you are at liberty to spend money freely. It is not dress or houses or lands that measures your worth. Your highest recommendation will be in doing just as Christ did. Study His life. Seek for His grace. All the wealth you could obtain would never bring back the health you have lost through self-indulgence.--Letter 178, 1902, pp. 1-3. (To W. O. Palmer, July, 1902.)",
