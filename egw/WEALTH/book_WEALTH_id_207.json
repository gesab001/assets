    "word": "Christ would have the young man understand that He required nothing of him more than to follow the example that He Himself, the Lord of heaven, had set. He left His riches and glory, and became poor, that man, through His poverty, might be made rich; and for the sake of these riches, He requires man to yield earthly wealth, honor, and pleasure. He knows that while the affections are upon the world, they will be withdrawn from God; therefore He said to the young man, \"Go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me.\" How did he receive the words of Christ? Was he rejoiced that he could secure the heavenly treasure? Oh, no! \"He went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.\" To him riches were honor and power; and the great amount of his treasure made such a disposal of it seem almost an impossibility.",
