    "word": "I saw that you have felt strong in yourself, felt that you had arguments which could not be gainsaid, and you have not relied upon the strength of the Lord. You have too often rushed upon Satan's ground to meet an opponent. You have not waited until you knew that the truth or the cause of God demanded a discussion, but have engaged with opponents where with a little forethought you would have decided that the truth could not be advanced or the cause of God benefited. Precious time has thus been spent.",
