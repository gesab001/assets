    "word": "\"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" This is a prescription for the healing of all mental and physical and spiritual ills. It is Christ's gift to those who seek Him in sincerity and in truth. He is the Mighty Healer. Then comes another invitation: \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Matthew 11:28-30. Wearing Christ's yoke and learning of Him the lesson of meekness and lowliness, we find rest in faith, and confidence and trust. We find that Christ's yoke is easy and His burden light. \n\n\n                                                 (125)",
