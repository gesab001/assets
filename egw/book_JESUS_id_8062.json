{"word": "Chap. 32 - Growing in Grace\n\n     \"But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" It is the privilege of the young, as they grow in Jesus, to grow in spiritual grace and knowledge. We may know more and more of Jesus through an interested searching of the Scriptures, and then following the ways of truth and righteousness therein revealed. Those who are ever growing in grace will be steadfast in the faith, and moving forward.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 121}
