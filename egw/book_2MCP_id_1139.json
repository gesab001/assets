{"word": "Look From the Human to the Divine.--There is something better for us to engage in than the control of humanity by humanity. The physician should educate the people to look from the human to the divine. Instead of teaching the sick to depend upon human beings for the cure of soul and body, he should direct them to the One who can save to the uttermost all who come unto Him. He who made man's mind knows what the mind needs. God alone is the One who can heal. Those whose minds and bodies are diseased are to behold in Christ the restorer. \"Because I live,\" He says, \"you shall live also.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 706}
