    "word": "Man, finite man, though using for himself the talents which God has reserved to publish salvation, to send the glad news of a Saviour's love to perishing souls, though hedging up the way by his selfishness, inquires: \"Wherein have we robbed Thee?\" God answers: \"In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me, even this whole nation.\" Verses 8, 9. The whole world is engaged in robbing God. With the money He has lent them, men indulge in dissipation, in amusements, revelings, feasting, and disgraceful indulgences. But God says: \"I will come near to you to judgment.\" Verse 5. The whole world will have an account to settle in that great day when everyone shall receive sentence according to his deeds.",
