    "word": "We need not go to foreign lands to become missionaries for God. All around us are fields \"white already to harvest,\" and whoever will may gather \"fruit unto life eternal.\" God calls upon many in Battle Creek who are dying of spiritual sloth to go where their labor is needed in His cause. Move out of Battle Creek, even if it requires a pecuniary sacrifice. Go somewhere to be a blessing to others. Go where you can strengthen some weak church. Put to use the powers which God has given you.",
