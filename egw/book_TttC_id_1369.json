    "word": "The simplicity of the gospel is fast disappearing from professed Sabbathkeepers. I inquire a hundred times a day, How can God prosper us? There is but little praying. In fact, prayer is almost obsolete. Few are willing to bear the cross of Christ, who bore the shameful cross for us.

I fear that He will turn His face from it. I was shown that physicians and helpers should be of the highest order, those who have an experimental knowledge of the truth, who will command respect, and whose word can be relied on. They should be persons who have not a diseased imagination, persons who have perfect self-control, who are not fitful or changeable, who are free from jealousy and evil surmising, persons who have a power of will that will not yield to slight indispositions, who are unprejudiced, who will think no evil, who think and move calmly, considerately, having the glory of God and the good of others ever before them. Never should one be exalted to a responsible position merely because he desires it. Those only should be chosen who are qualified for the position. Those who are to bear responsibilities should first be proved and give evidence that they are free from jealousy, that they will not take a dislike to this or that one, while they have a few favored friends and take no notice of others. God grant that all may move just right in that institution. \n\n                                               -",
