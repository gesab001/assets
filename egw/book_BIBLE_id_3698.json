{"word": "In England, Latimer maintained from the pulpit that the Bible ought to be read in the language of the people. The Author of Holy Scripture, said he, \"is God Himself;\" and this Scripture partakes of the might and eternity of its Author. \"There is no king, emperor, magistrate, and ruler . . . but are bound to obey . . . His holy word.\" \"Let us not take any by-walks, but let God's word direct us: let us not walk after . . . our forefathers, nor seek not what they did, but what they should have done.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 351}
