    "word": "God's Purpose Fulfilled \n\n     Christ desires by the fullness of His power so to strengthen His people that through them the whole world shall be encircled with an atmosphere of grace. When His people shall make a wholehearted surrender of themselves to God, this purpose will be accomplished. The word of the Lord to those connected with His institutions is: \"Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\" Isaiah 52:11. In all our institutions let self-seeking give place to unselfish love and labor for souls nigh and afar off. Then the holy oil will be emptied from the two olive branches into the golden pipes, which will empty them selves into the vessels prepared to receive it. Then the lives of Christ's workers will indeed be an exposition of the truths of His word.",
