{"word": "That which is spoken in the first hour is of far more value if the sermon closes then.--Those who shall be mouthpieces for God should know that\n200\ntheir lips have been touched with a live coal from off the altar, and present the truth in the demonstration of the Spirit. But lengthy discourses are a taxation to the speaker and a taxation to the hearers who have to sit so long. One half the matter presented would be of more benefit to the hearer than the large mass poured forth by the speaker. That which is spoken in the first hour is of far more value if the sermon closes then than the words that are spoken in an added half hour. There is a burying up of the matter that has been presented.--TM 256.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 199}
