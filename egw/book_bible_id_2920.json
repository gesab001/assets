{"word": "The Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of those things easy to be understood, or prevent us from wresting truths difficult of comprehension. It is the office of heavenly angels to prepare the heart so to comprehend God\\92s word that we shall be charmed with its beauty, admonished by its warnings, or animated and strengthened by its promises. We should make the psalmist\\92s petition our own: \\93Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.\\94 Psalm 119:18. Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one cannot readily remember God\\92s promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons. But angels are round about those who are willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of great necessity they will bring to their remembrance the very truths which are needed. Thus \\93when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.\\94 Isaiah 59:19\\97(The Great Controversy, 599, 600.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 95}
