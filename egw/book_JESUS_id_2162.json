{"word": "An Effective Helper \n\n     The true teacher will try by precept and example to win souls to Christ. He must receive the truth in the love of it and let it cleanse his heart and mold his life. Every teacher should be under the full control of the Holy Spirit. Then Christ can speak to the heart, and His voice is the voice of love. And the love of God, received into the heart, is an active power for good, quickening and enlarging the mind and soul. With his own heart warm with divine love, the teacher will lift up the Man of Calvary, not to give the students a casual glimpse, but to fasten their attention until Jesus shall seem to them the \"chiefest among ten thousand,\" and the One \"altogether lovely.\" Song of Solomon 5:10, 16.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 67}
