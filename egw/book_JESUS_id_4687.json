{"word": "Christ \"loved the church, and gave himself for it.\" Ephesians 5:25. It is the purchase of His blood. The divine Son of God is seen walking amid the seven golden candlesticks. Jesus Himself supplies the oil to these burning lamps. He it is that kindles the flame. \"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\" John 1:4. No candlestick, no church, shines of itself. From Christ emanates all its light. . . . The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the light thereof.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 280}
