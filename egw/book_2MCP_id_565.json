There are many who believe, without a reason on which to base their faith, without \n\n536 \n\nsufficient evidence as to the truth of the matter. If an idea is presented that harmonizes with their own preconceived opinions, they are all ready to accept it. They do not reason from cause to effect. Their faith has no genuine foundation, and in the time of trial they will find that they have built upon the sand.--Lt 4, 1889.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 535}
