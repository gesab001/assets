{"word": "It is not always pleasant for our brethren to live where the people need help most; but their labors would often be productive of far more good if  they would do so. They ought to come close to the people, sit with them at  their tables, and lodge in their humble homes. The laborers may have to take  their families to places not at all desirable; but they should remember that  Jesus did not remain in the most desirable places. He came down to earth that  he might help those who needed help.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 148}
