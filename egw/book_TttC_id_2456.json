Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own \n                                                                           332\nflesh?\" Read the next verse, and notice the rich reward promised to those who do this. \"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily.\" Here is an abundantly precious promise for all who will interest themselves in the cases of those who need help.
