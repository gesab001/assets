{"word": "All Receive Life From God.--All created things live by the will and power of God. They are recipients of the life of the Son of God. However able and talented, however large their capacities, they are replenished with life from the Source of all life. He is the spring, the fountain, of life. Only He who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light and life, could say, \"I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again.\"-- MS 131, 1897.
