{"word": "You are shutting out from you every ray of heaven's light, and a great gulf is coming between you and the only ones who can help you. If you proceed in the way you have started, misery and woe are before you. God's hand will arrest you in a manner that will not suit you. His wrath will not slumber. But now He invites you. Now, just now, He calls upon you to return unto Him without delay, and He will graciously pardon and heal all your backslidings. God is leading out a people who are peculiar. He will cleanse and purify them and fit them for translation. Every carnal thing will be separated from God's \n\n680 \n\npeculiar treasures until they shall be like gold seven times purified.--1T 430, 431 (1864).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 679}
