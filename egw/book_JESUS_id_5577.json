{"word": "People who are self-sufficient, and feel that so much depends upon themselves, give Jesus no room to work, and but little credit when he does work. They trust in their own ability, forgetting the words of Christ, \\93Without me ye can do nothing.\\94 [John 15:5.] The man that is self-righteous, and wise in his own eyes,\\97 rich and increased in goods, having need of nothing, \\97cannot ask in faith, and receive, because he trusts in himself, and feels no lack. His works testify that he labors out of Christ. It is those who feel themselves sinful before God, poor and helpless, that Jesus \n459\nloves to help; for they will appreciate his aid. They have a longing desire to do the Master's work, and, knowing that the power is not of themselves, they take hold of the mighty arm of God, and by faith claim his promises.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 458}
