    "word": "\"Edson, I hope that you will adorn your profession by a well-ordered life and godly conversation. Oh, be earnest! be zealous and persevering in the work. Watch unto prayer. Cultivate humility and meekness. This will meet the approval \n                                                                           663\nof God. Hide yourself in Jesus; let self-love and self-pride be sacrificed, and you, my son, be fitting with a rich Christian experience, to be of use in any position that God may require you to occupy. Seek for thorough heartwork. A surface work will not stand the test of the judgment. Seek for thorough transformation from the world. Let not your hands be stained, your heart spotted, your character sullied, by its corruptions. Keep distinct. God calls: 'Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.' 'Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.'",
