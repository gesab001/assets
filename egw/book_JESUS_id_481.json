{"word": "Let us turn to the story of the paralytic at Bethesda. The poor sufferer was helpless; he had not used his limbs for thirty-eight years. Yet Jesus bade him, \\93Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\\94 The sick man might have said, \\93Lord, if Thou wilt make me whole, I will obey Thy word.\\94 But, no, he believed Christ\\92s word, believed that he was made whole, and he made the effort at once; he willed to walk, and he did walk. He acted on the word of Christ, and God gave the power. He was made whole.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CSA", "page": 30}
