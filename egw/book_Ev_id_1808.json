{"word": "The Lord's Plans for a United Work.--But the world's need today cannot be met fully by the ministry \n                                                                           520\nof God's servants who have been called to preach the everlasting gospel to every creature. While it is well, so far as possible, for evangelical workers to learn how to minister to the necessities of the body as well as of the soul, thus following the example of Christ, yet they cannot spend all their time and strength in relieving those in need of help. The Lord has ordained that with those who preach the Word shall be associated His medical missionary workers,--Christian physicians and nurses, who have received special training in the healing of disease and in soul winning. --Counsels to Teachers, p. 468.
