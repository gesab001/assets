{"word": "Satan's Sophistry \n\n     It is the sophistry of Satan that the death of Christ brought in grace to take the place of the law. The death of Jesus did not change or annul or lessen in the slightest degree the law of Ten Commandments. That precious grace offered to men through a Saviour's blood establishes the law of God. Since the fall of man, God's moral government and His grace are inseparable. They go hand in hand through all dispensations. \"Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other\" (Psalm 85:10).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 30}
