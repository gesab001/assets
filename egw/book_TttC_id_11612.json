    "word": "Many of those carrying heavy responsibilities need to be converted. Christ says to them as He said to Nicodemus: \"Ye must be born again.\" \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" John 3:7, 3. Many are controlled by an unchristian spirit. They have not yet learned in the school of Christ His meekness and lowliness, and unless they change, they will yield to Satan's temptations. Year after year they carry sacred responsibilities, yet prove themselves incapable of distinguishing between the sacred and the common. How long shall such men continue to wield a controlling influence? How long shall their word be permitted to exalt or to cast down, to condemn or to lift up? How long shall they hold such power that no one dare make a change in their methods? \n                                                                           150",
