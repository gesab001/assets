{"word": "We cannot afford to lose heaven. We ought to have our conversation on heavenly things. There there is no death nor pain. Why are we so \n340\nreluctant to talk of these things? Why do we dwell upon earthly things? The apostle exhorts us to have our conversation in heaven. \\93For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ\\94 (Philippians 3:20). . . . Christ will soon return to gather those who are prepared, and take them to this glorious place. \\93So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation\\94 (Hebrews 9:28).", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 339}
