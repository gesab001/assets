{"word": "GOD WILL HONOR JESUS\\92 NAME IN OUR PRAYERS.\\97Every promise in the word of God furnishes us with subject matter for prayer, presenting the pledged word of Jehovah as our assurance. Whatever spiritual blessing we need, it is our privilege to claim through Jesus. We may tell the Lord, with the simplicity of a child, exactly what we need. We may state to Him our temporal matters, asking Him for bread and raiment as well as for the bread of life and the robe of Christ\\92s righteousness. Your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things, and you are invited to ask Him concerning them. It is through the name of Jesus that every favor is received. God will honor that name, and will supply your necessities from the riches of His liberality.\\97(Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 133.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 221}
