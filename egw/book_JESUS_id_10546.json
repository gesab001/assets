Teach the people to practice strict temperance in all things, and to be champions in favor of obedience to physical laws.  Stand firmly for God's truth.  Exalt before the people the banner bearing the inscription, \"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus\" (Revelation 14:12)....", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "RY", "page": 22}
