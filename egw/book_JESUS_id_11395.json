{"word": "4, 5. A Change of Raiment.--Poor, repentant mortals, hear the words of Jesus, and believe as you hear: \"And he answered [the accusing charge of Satan] and spake unto those [angels] that stood before him [to do His bidding], saying, Take away the filthy garments from him.\" I will blot out his transgressions. I will cover his sins. I will impute to him My righteousness. \"And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.\"", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "4BC", "page": 1178}
