    "word": "Affection may be as clear as crystal and beauteous in its purity, yet it may be shallow because it has not been tested and tried. Make Christ first and last and best in everything. Constantly behold Him, and your love for Him will daily become deeper and stronger as it is submitted to the test of trial. And as your love for Him increases, your love for each other will grow deeper and stronger. \"We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory.\" 2 Corinthians 3:18.",
