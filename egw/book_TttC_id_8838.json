    "word": "Why should not the members of a church or of several small churches unite to sustain a missionary in foreign fields?

I beseech you to do something for Christ, and to do it now. Through the teacher whom your money shall sustain in the field, souls may be saved from ruin to shine as stars in the Redeemer's crown.",
