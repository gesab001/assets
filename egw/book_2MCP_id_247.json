{"word": "All Faculties Can Be Cultivated.--Many are not doing the greatest amount of good because they exercise the intellect in one direction and neglect to give careful attention to those things for which they think they are not adapted. Some faculties that are weak are thus allowed to lie dormant because the work that should call them into exercise, and consequently give them strength, is not pleasant. All the powers of the mind should be exercised, all the faculties cultivated. Perception, judgment, memory, \n\n442 \n\nand all the reasoning powers should have equal strength in order that minds may be well balanced.--3T 32, 33 (1872).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 441}
