Isaiah Was Sawn Asunder.--Isaiah, who was permitted by the Lord to see wonderful things, was sawn asunder, because he faithfully reproved the sins of the Jewish nation. The prophets who came to look after the Lord's vineyard, were indeed beaten and killed. \"They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goat-skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented\"--men of whom the world was not worthy. They were cruelly treated, and banished from the world (ST Feb. 17, 1898).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4BC", "page": 1137}
