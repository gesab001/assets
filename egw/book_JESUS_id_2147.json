{"word": "\"God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation,\" the apostle Paul writes, \"through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth,\" 2 Thessalonians 2:13. In this text the two agencies in the work of salvation are revealed--the divine influence, and the strong, living faith of those who follow Christ. It is through the sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth that we become laborers together with God. Christ waits for the co-operation of His church. He does not design to add a new element of efficiency to His word; He has done His great work in giving His inspiration to the word. The blood of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, the divine word, are ours. The object of all this provision of heaven is before us-- the salvation of the souls for whom Christ died; and it depends upon us to lay hold on the promises God has given, and become laborers together with Him. Divine and human agencies must co-operate in the work.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 22}
