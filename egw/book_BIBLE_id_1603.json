{"word": "In France, before the name of Luther had been heard as a reformer, the day had already begun to break. One of the first to catch the light was the aged Lefevre, a man of extensive learning, a professor in the University of Paris, and a sincere and zealous papist. In his researches into ancient literature his attention was directed to the Bible, and he introduced its study among his students. Lefevre was an enthusiastic adorer of the saints, and he had undertaken to prepare a history of the saints and martyrs, as given in the legends of the church. This was a work which involved great labor, but he had already made considerable progress in it, when, thinking that he might obtain useful assistance from the Bible, he began its study with this object. Here indeed he found saints brought to view, but not such as figured in the Romish calendar. A flood of divine light broke in upon his mind. In amazement and disgust he turned away from his self-appointed task, and devoted himself to the Word of God. The precious truths which he there discovered, he soon began to teach. In 1512, before either Luther or Zwingle had begun the work of reform, Lefevre wrote: \\93It is God who gives us, by faith, that righteousness which by grace justifies unto eternal life.\\94 Dwelling upon the mysteries of redemption, he exclaimed, \\93Oh, the unspeakable greatness of that exchange,\\97the Sinless One is condemned, and he who is guilty goes free; the Blessing bears the curse, and the curse is brought into blessing; the Life dies, and the dead live; the Glory is whelmed in darkness, and he who knew nothing but confusion of face is clothed with glory.\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 212}
