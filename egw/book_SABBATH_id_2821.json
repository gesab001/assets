{"word": "The Teacher's Example\n\n     The one who shall accept the responsibility of teacher, if not fully qualified, if he senses the responsibility of his position, will do his utmost to learn. He will cultivate reverence, cheerfulness, and firmness. Let the deportment be of that character that your class will be educated to have solemn thoughts and reverence toward God. While the ideas may be presented in simplicity, the language, when speaking of God, of Christ, His sufferings, His resurrection, as realities to you, should carry the minds up high above earthly things, and make them feel that they are in the presence of the Infinite One. The Sabbath-school is no place for that class who skim the surface, who talk fluently and in a spirit of levity of eternal, testing truths, which are higher than the heavens and broader than the worlds. The behavior of a class will represent the character of a teacher in the example which they have before them. If they are rude, and continue so, if irreverent, then there is a cause, and the matter needs to be thoroughly probed. The teacher may have reverence and \n97\nyet be cheerful. And in the place of flippancy of manner, he should be a searcher for the deep things of God. Any affectation will not be natural. Let the class receive the impression that religion is a reality, that it is desirable; for it brings peace and rest and happiness. Let not your class receive the impression that a cold, unsympathetic character is religion. Let the peace and glory of Christ's presence within make the face speak His love, the lips utter thankfulness and praise.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 96}
