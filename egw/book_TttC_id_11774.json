    "word": "By His life and death Christ taught that only in obedience to God's commandments can man find safety and true greatness \"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\" Psalm 19:7.

In course of time the Israelites went into Egypt, where for many years they suffered grievous oppression at the hands of the Egyptians. After they had been in slavery for nearly four hundred years, God delivered them by a wonderful manifestation of His power. He revealed Himself to the Egyptians as the Ruler of the universe, One greater than all heathen deities.",
