    "word": "How did Christ manifest His love for poor mortals? By the sacrifice of His own glory, His own riches, and even His most precious life. Christ consented to a life of humiliation and great suffering. He submitted to the cruel mockings of an infuriated, murderous multitude, and to the most agonizing death upon the cross. Said Christ: \"This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for \n                                                                           691\nhis friends. Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\" We give evidence of being the friends of Christ when we manifest implicit obedience to His will. It is no evidence to say, and do not; but in doing, in obeying, is the evidence. Who are obeying the commandment to love one another as Christ has loved them? Brother B, you must have a firmer, deeper, and more unselfish love than you have ever yet possessed, if you obey the commandment of Christ.",
