{"word": "COMPILATIONS OF MRS. WHITE'S WRITINGS ARE HELPFUL, FOR THEY OFFER A CONVENIENT WAY TO SEE QUICKLY WHAT SHE HAS SAID ON A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS. THE GOAL IN PRODUCING COMPILATIONS IS TO REPRESENT HER THOUGHT ACCURATELY AND WITHOUT BIAS. THUS, IN MOST CASES, BEFORE ANY SELECTION OF MATERIAL IS MADE, THE FULL RANGE OF HER WRITINGS ON A GIVEN TOPIC IS BROUGHT TOGETHER. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN FOLLOWED IN PREPARING THIS BOOK. WHERE ELLEN WHITE HAS SAID MUCH, MUCH HAS BEEN INCLUDED. WHERE SHE HAS SAID LITTLE, LITTLE HAS BEEN INCLUDED.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 14}
