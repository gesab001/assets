{"word": "Molded By The Holy Spirit \n\n     Never will the human heart know happiness until it is submitted to be molded by the Spirit of God. The Spirit conforms the renewed soul to the model, Jesus Christ. Through its influence, enmity against God is changed into faith and love, and pride into humility. The soul perceives the beauty of truth, and Christ is honored in excellence and perfection of character.--OHC 152 (1896).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 65}
