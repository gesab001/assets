{"word": "Christ lived in accordance with the principles of God\\92s moral government, and fulfilled the specifications of the law of God. He represented the beneficence of the law in His human life. The fact that the law is holy, just, and good is to be testified before all nations, tongues, and peoples, to worlds unfallen, to angels, seraphim, and cherubim. The principles of the law of God were wrought out in the character of Jesus Christ, and he who cooperates with Christ, becoming a partaker of the divine nature, will develop the divine character, and become an illustration of the divine law. Christ in the heart will bring the whole person, soul, body, and spirit, into captivity to the obedience of righteousness. Christ\\92s true followers will be in conformity to the mind and will and character of God, and the far-reaching principles of the law will be demonstrated in humanity. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 59}
