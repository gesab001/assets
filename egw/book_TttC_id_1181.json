When God calls them to account, when He requires of them the talents He has lent them, with usury, what can they say? What excuse can they make? Were they heathen who know nothing of the living God, and in their blind idolatrous zeal throw themselves under the car of Juggernaut, their cases would be more tolerable.

For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" They let worldly cares entangle them. \"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.\" They worship their earthly treasure, as the ignorant heathen does his idols.",
