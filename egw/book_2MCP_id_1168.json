{"word": "God has not given one ray of light or encouragement for our physicians to take up the work of having one mind completely control the mind of another so that one acts out the will of another. Let us learn the ways and purposes of God. Let not the enemy gain the least advantage over you. Let him not lead you to dare to endeavor to control another mind until it becomes a machine in your hands. This is the science of Satan's working.--Lt 121, 1901.
