{"word": "113\n     In His charge to Peter, the Saviour first bade him, \\93Feed My lambs,\\94 and afterward commanded, \\93Feed My sheep.\\94 In addressing the apostle, Christ says to all His servants, \\93Feed My lambs.\\94 When Jesus admonished His disciples not to despise the little ones, He addressed all disciples in all ages. His own love and care for children is a precious example for His followers. If teachers in the Sabbath-school felt the love which they should feel for these lambs of the flock, many more would be won to the fold of Christ. At every suitable opportunity, let the story of Jesus\\92 love be repeated to the children. In every sermon let a little corner be left for their benefit. The servant of Christ may have lasting friends in these little ones, and his words may be to them as apples of gold in pictures of silver.\\97G.
