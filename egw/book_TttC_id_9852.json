    "word": "While we review, not the dark chapters in our experience, but the manifestations of God's great mercy and unfailing love, we shall praise far more than complain. We shall talk of the loving faithfulness of God as the true, tender, compassionate shepherd of His flock, which He has declared that none shall pluck out of His hand. The language of the heart will not be selfish murmuring and repining. Praise, like clear-flowing streams, will come from God's truly believing ones. \"Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\" Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there \n                                                                           368\nis none upon earth that I desire beside Thee.\" Psalm 23:6; 73:24, 25.",
