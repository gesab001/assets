Every child lives by the life of his father. If you are God's children, begotten by His Spirit, you live by the life of God. In Christ dwells \"all the fullness of the Godhead bodily\" (Colossians 2:9); and the life of Jesus is made manifest \"in our mortal flesh\" (2 Corinthians 4:11). That life in you will produce the same character and manifest the same works as it did in Him. Thus you will be in harmony with every precept of His law; for \"the law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul.\" Psalm 19:7, margin. Through love \"the righteousness of the law\" will be \"fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" Romans 8:4.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MB", "page": 77}
