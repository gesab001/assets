    "word": "My heart aches day after day and night after night for our churches. Many are progressing, but in the back track. \"The path of the just . . . shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\" Their march is onward and upward. They progress from strength to strength, from grace to grace, and from glory to glory. This is the privilege of all our churches. But, oh, how different has it been with them! They need divine illumination. They must face square about. I know what I say. Unless they shall become Christians indeed, they will go from weakness to weakness, divisions will increase, and many souls will be led to perdition.",
