{"word": "Physical Sin. \n  37. The transgression of physical law is transgression of God's law. Our Creator is Jesus Christ. He is the author of our being. He is the author of the physical law as he is the author of the moral law. And the human being who is careless and reckless of the habits and practises that concern his physical life and health, sins against God. God is not reverenced, respected, or recognized. This is shown by the injury done to the body in violation of physical law.-- U. T., May 19, 1897.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HL", "page": 17}
