    "word": "The fourth commandment alone of all the ten contains the seal of the great Lawgiver, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Those who obey this commandment take upon themselves His name, and all the blessings it involves are theirs. \"The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel saying unto them, \n                                                                           351\n\"The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: \n The Lord make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: \n The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. \n And they shall put My Name upon the children of Israel; \n And I will bless them.\" Numbers 6:22-27.",
