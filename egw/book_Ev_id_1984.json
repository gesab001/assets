{"word": "The Stranger in Our Midst \n\n     Reaching All Nationalities, Ranks, and Creeds.-- Christ recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed. The scribes and Pharisees desired to make a local and national benefit of the gifts of heaven, and to exclude the rest of God's family in the world. But \n                                                                           569\nChrist came to break down every wall of partition. He came to show that His gift of mercy and love is as unconfined as the air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh the earth.--Ministry of Healing, p. 25.
