{"word": "Receiving Congregational Response.--Brother -----'s meetings were largely attended, and the people listened to his words with spellbound interest; the interest continued from first to last. With his Bible in his hand, and basing all his arguments on the Word of God, Brother ----- traced out before them the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. His own words were few; he made the Scriptures themselves explain the truth to the people. After giving them the truth, Elder ----- would draw an expression of opinion from his congregation. \"Now,\" he would say, \"those who see the truth of what I am saying, raise your hands\"; and in response many hands would be raised. I can only poorly represent to you the interest his work has created.--Letter 400, 1906. \n                                                                           198", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 197}
