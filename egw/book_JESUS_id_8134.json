{"word": "Dear children and youth, Jesus has done all in His power to give you a home in the mansions that are prepared for them that love and serve Him here. He left His heavenly home, and came to a world marred by sin,--came to a people who did not appreciate Him, who did not love His purity and holiness, who slighted His teachings, and finally put Him to a most cruel death. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 346}
