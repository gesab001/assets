{"word": "Hard for Youth to Bear Burdens.--The young can exert a powerful influence if they will give up their pride and selfishness and devote themselves to God; but as a general thing they will not bear burdens for others. They have to be carried themselves. The time has come when God requires a change in this respect. He calls upon young and old to be zealous and repent. If they continue in their state of lukewarmness, He will spew them out of His mouth. Says the True Witness, \"I know thy works.\" Young man, young woman, your works are known, whether they be good or whether they be evil. Are you rich in good works? Jesus comes to you as a counselor: \"I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see\" (Revelation 3:18).--1T 485 (1867). \n\n\n                                                    285", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 284}
