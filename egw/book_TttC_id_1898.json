    "word": "You, my dear sister, have been jealous, envious, and fault-finding. You have thought you were neglected and despised. \n                                                                           80\nYou have been too much neglected, but you have a work to do for yourself which no one can do for you. It will require effort, perseverance, and earnestness to obtain the victory over long-established habits which have become as second nature. We have the tenderest feelings for you, with all your errors and faults; and while we shall take the liberty to tell you your faults, we pledge ourselves to help you in every way we can.",
