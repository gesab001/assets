{"word": "The More Indulgence, the Harder the Management.-- Parents, make home happy for your children. By this I do not mean that you are to indulge them. The more they are indulged, the harder they will be to manage, and the more difficult it will be for them to live true, noble lives when they go out into the world. If you allow them to do as they please, their purity and loveliness of character will quickly fade. Teach them to obey. Let them see that your authority must be respected. \n                                                                           272\nThis may seem to bring them a little unhappiness now, but it will save them from much unhappiness in the future.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 271}
