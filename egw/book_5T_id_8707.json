    "word": "It is to the thirsting soul that the fountain of living waters is open. God declares: \"I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.\" To souls that are earnestly seeking for light and that accept with gladness every ray of divine illumination from His holy word, to such alone light will be given. It is through these souls that God will reveal that light and power which will lighten the whole earth with His glory. \n\n                                               -",
