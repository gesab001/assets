{"word": "422\n     We are wanting in simple faith; we need to learn the art of trusting our very best Friend. Although we see him not, Jesus is watching over us with tender compassion; and he is touched with the feeling of our infirmities. No one in his great need ever looked to him in faith and was disappointed. Brethren, do not express doubt; do not let your lips utter one complaining, repining word. Begin now to fix your minds more firmly upon Jesus and heavenly things, remembering that by beholding we become changed into the same image.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 422}
