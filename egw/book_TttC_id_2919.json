    "word": "Those who are acquainted with your course will say that your profession, your teachings, and your life do not agree. They see that your fruits are not good, and decide that you do not believe the things you teach to others. They conclude that all ministers are like yourself, and that sacred and eternal truths are, after all, a deception. Who will be responsible for such impressions and such deplorable results? May you see the heavy weight that rests upon you in consequence of your selfishness, which is a curse to yourself and to all around you.",
