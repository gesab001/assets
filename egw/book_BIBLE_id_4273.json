{"word": "The great want in the Sabbath-school is not the want of machinery, but the want of knowledge in spiritual things. How greatly do the workers need a baptism of the Holy Spirit, that they may become true missionaries for God. They should learn to tax their minds to the utmost, that they may acquire a better knowledge of Bible truth. The teachers in the Sabbath-school should pray daily for the enlightenment of heaven, that they may be able to open to the minds of the youth the treasures of the sacred Word. Why not humble yourselves before the Lord, and let the impression of the Holy Spirit be manifested upon your character and \n74\nwork? There is far too much self-complacency among those who engage in Sabbath-school work, too much machinery and routine, and all this tends to lead the soul away from the Fountain of living water.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 73}
