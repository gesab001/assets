{"word": "But in order to reach this experience, definite steps must be taken. The methods and plans by which the work is to be done must be after the Lord's order, not after your individual ideas, and the results will more than compensate for the outlay. Missionary effort will become more general, and the example of one zealous worker, working in the right direction, will influence others, and they also will go forth to preach the gospel. The missionary spirit will pass from house to house, and the brethren will find something to talk about of more interest than their grievances. They will be interested in displaying the jewels of truth which the Bible contains, and churches will be established, meetinghouses erected, and many will come to the help of the Lord. The brethren will be united in bonds of love, and will realize their unity with experienced Christians in all parts of the world, as they are one in their plans, one in the object of their interest. An advance step taken by those at the head of the work will be felt by those in this country and in all lands, and those in foreign countries will respond to the effort made at the center of the work in following our great Leader; and so, through the conversion of souls to the truth, a volume of praise will rise to Him who sitteth upon the throne.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 208}
