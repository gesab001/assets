{"word": "GOD\\92S PEOPLE ARE AT HOME IN THE NEW EARTH.\\97In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called \\93a country.\\94 Hebrews 11:14-16. There the heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to fountains of living waters. The tree of life yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are for the service of the nations. There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared for the ransomed of the Lord. There the wide-spreading plains swell into hills of beauty, and the mountains of God rear their lofty summits. On those peaceful plains, beside those living streams, God\\92s people, so long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a home.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Hvn", "page": 143}
