{"word": "I did not realize that I was unfaithful in thus questioning and doubting, and did not see the danger and sin of such a course, until in vision I was taken into the presence of Jesus. He looked upon me with a frown, and turned His face from me. It is not possible to describe the terror and agony I then felt. I fell upon my face before Him, but had no power to utter a word. Oh, how I longed to be covered and hid from that dreadful frown! Then could I realize, in some degree, what the feelings of the lost will be when they cry to the mountains and rocks, \"Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.\" Revelation 6:16.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 79}
