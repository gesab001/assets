{"word": "9. Glory of Cloud Emanated From Christ.--The cloud that guided Israel, stood over the tabernacle. The glory of the cloud emanated from Jesus Christ, who from the midst of the glory talked with Moses, as He had talked with him from the burning bush. The brightness of God's presence was enshrouded in the darkness of the cloud which He made His pavilion, that the people could endure to look upon the cloud, as seeing Him who is invisible. This was God's plan whereby He might approach man (MS 126, 1901).", "paragraph": 12, "bookcode": "1BC", "page": 1103}
