{"word": "During the wedding feast at Cana of Galilee, at which Christ was present, it was discovered that from some cause the supply of wine had failed. This caused much perplexity and regret. It was unusual to dispense with wine on festive occasions, and its absence would seem to indicate a want of hospitality. As a relative of the parties, Mary had assisted in the arrangements for the feast, and she now spoke to Jesus, saying, \"They have no wine\" (John 2:3). These words were a suggestion that He might supply their need. But Jesus answered, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come\" (verse 4).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 366}
