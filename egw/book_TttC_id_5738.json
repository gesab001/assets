    "word": "I was referred to Christ's Sermon on the Mount. Here we have the injunction of the Great Teacher: \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\" This command of Christ is of the highest importance and should be strictly obeyed. It is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. How many carry out in their lives the principle Christ has here enjoined, and deal with others just as they would wish to be dealt with under similar circumstances? Reader, please answer.",
