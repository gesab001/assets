{"word": "The purpose of both illustration and the incarnation is to teach the unknown through the known.--In Christ's parable teaching the same principle is seen as in His own mission to the world. That we might become acquainted with His divine character and life, Christ took our nature and dwelt among us. Divinity was revealed in humanity; the invisible glory in the visible human form. Men could learn of the unknown through the known;\n195\nheavenly things were revealed through the earthly; God was made manifest in the likeness of men. So it was in Christ's teaching: the unknown was illustrated by the known; divine truths by earthly things with which the people were most familiar.--COL 17.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 194}
