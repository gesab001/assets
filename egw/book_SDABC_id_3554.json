    "word": "13 (2 Timothy 4:7, 8). God Honors the Faithful Aged.--There are living upon our earth men who have passed the age of fourscore and ten. The natural results of old age are seen in their feebleness. But they believe God, and God loves them. The seal of God is upon them, and they will be among the number of whom the Lord has said, \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.\" With Paul they can say, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished by course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also which love his appearing.\" There are many whose grey hairs God honors because they have fought a good fight and kept the faith (Letter 207, 1899).",
