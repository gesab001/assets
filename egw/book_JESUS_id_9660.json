{"word": "22: Personal Evangelism\n \n\n     Personal work cannot be looked upon as of secondary importance.--The ministers of Jesus Christ will have more than a mere casual interest for the people. They will seek to know the state of their spiritual being, even as a physician seeks to understand the physical difficulties of his patients. They will engage in personal conversation, and adapt their counsel to every individual case according to the need of the soul. This personal work cannot be looked upon as of secondary importance. The minister is the Lord's appointed under-shepherd to the flock of God, and it is his business to minister to the sin-sick, tempted, and erring. This very work is needed among all classes and in all places.--RH March 11, 1902.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 131}
