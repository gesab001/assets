    "word": "Brethren, be careful, very careful. There is a work being done by the medical missionaries which answers to the description given in verses 48-51. The Lord is working to reach the most depraved. Many will know what it means to be drawn to Christ, but will not have moral courage to war against appetite and passion. But the workers must not be discouraged at this; for it is written: \"In the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\" 1 Timothy 4:1. Is it only those rescued from the lowest depths that backslide? There are those in the ministry who have had light and a knowledge of the truth, who will not be overcomers. They do not restrict their appetites and passions or deny themselves for Christ's sake. Many poor outcasts, even publicans and sinners, will grasp the hope set before them in the gospel and will go into the kingdom of heaven before the ones who have had great opportunities and great light, but who have walked in darkness. In the last great day many will say: \"Lord, Lord, open unto us.\" But the door will be shut, and their knock will be in vain.",
