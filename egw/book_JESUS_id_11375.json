{"word": "6. Live Coal Symbolizes Purity and Power.--The live coal is symbolical of purification. If it touches the lips, no impure word will fall from them. The live coal also symbolizes the potency of the efforts of the servants of the Lord. God hates all coldness, all commonness, all cheap efforts. Those who labor acceptably in His cause, must be men who pray fervently, and whose works are wrought in God; and they will never have cause to be ashamed of their record. They will have an abundant entrance into the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, and their reward will be given them,--even eternal life (RH Oct. 16, 1888).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "4BC", "page": 1141}
