{"word": "Concert of Action.--One point will have to be guarded, and that is individual independence. As soldiers in Christ's army, there should be concert of action in the various departments of the work. . . . Each laborer should act with reference to the others. Followers of Jesus Christ will not act independently one of another. Our strength must be in God, and it must be husbanded, to be put forth in noble, concentrated action. It must not be wasted in meaningless movements.--5T 534, 535 (1889).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 266}
