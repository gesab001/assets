{"word": "To Keep a Firm Hold on Bible Truth.--The Christian is to be \"rooted and grounded\" in the truth, that he may stand firm against the temptations of the enemy. He must have a continual renewal of strength, and he must hold firmly to Bible truth. Fables of every kind will be brought in to seduce the believer from his allegiance to God, but he is to look up, believe in God, and stand firmly rooted and grounded in the truth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 361}
