And he will acknowledge the source of his power. . . . Self-knowledge leads to humility and to trust in God, but it does not take the place of efforts for self-improvement. He who realizes his own deficiencies will spare no pains to reach the highest possible standard of physical, mental, and moral excellence. No one should have a part in the training of youth who is satisfied with a lower standard.--SpTEd 50, May 15, 1896. (CT 67.)", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 4}
