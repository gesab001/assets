{"word": "We should earnestly seek to know and appreciate the truth, that we may present it to others as it is in Jesus. We need to have a correct estimate \n308\nof the value of our own souls; then we would not be as reckless in regard to our course of action as at present. We would seek most earnestly to know God\\92s way; we would work an opposite direction from selfishness, and our constant prayer would be that we might have the mind of Christ, that we might be molded and fashioned after His likeness. It is in looking to Jesus and beholding His loveliness, having our eyes steadfastly fixed upon Him, that we become changed into His image. He will give grace to all that keep His way, and do His will, and walk in truth. . . .", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 307}
