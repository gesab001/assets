    "word": "The thoughtless, unkind words that are spoken grow with every repetition. One and another adds a word, until the false report assumes large proportions. Great injustice is done. By their unrighteous suspicions and unrighteous judgments the talebearers hurt their own experience and sow the seeds of discord in the church. If they could see things as God sees them they would change their attitude. They would realize how they have neglected the work He has given them to do as they have found fault with their brethren and sisters.",
