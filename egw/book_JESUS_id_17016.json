{"word": "The truth, if received, is capable of constant expansion and new developments. It will increase in brightness as we behold it, and grow in height and depth as we aspire to grasp it. Thus it will elevate us to the standard of perfection, and give us faith and trust in God as our strength for the work before us. We need the truth as it is in Jesus. . . . As His representatives and witnesses we need to come to a full understanding of the saving truth which we must know by an experimental knowledge.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 340}
