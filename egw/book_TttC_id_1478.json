WE LACKED HEAVENLY WISDOM IN THIS MATTER AND THUS ERRED FROM THE RIGHT PATH. WE ACKNOWLEDGE OURSELVES TO HAVE BEEN, AT THIS TIME, LACKING IN THAT DEEP CHRISTIAN SYMPATHY THAT WAS CALLED FOR BY SUCH GREAT AFFLICTION, AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN TOO SLOW TO SEE THE HAND OF GOD IN THE RECOVERY OF BROTHER WHITE. HIS LABORS AND SUFFERINGS IN OUR BEHALF ENTITLED HIM TO OUR WARMEST SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT. BUT WE HAVE BEEN BLINDED BY SATAN IN RESPECT TO OUR OWN SPIRITUAL CONDITION.",
