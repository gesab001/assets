Some endure at one point but fall off at the next. At every advance step the heart is tested and tried a little closer. If any \n\n348 \n\nfind their hearts opposed to the straight work of God, it should convince them that they have a work to do in overcoming, or they will be finally rejected of the Lord. --RH, Apr 8, 1880.
