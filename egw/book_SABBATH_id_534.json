{"word": "Who can have so deep a love for the souls of men and women for whom Christ died as those who are partakers of His grace?  Who can better represent the religion of Christ than Christian women, women who are earnestly laboring to bring souls to the light of truth?  Who else is so well adapted to the work of the Sabbath school?  The true mother is the true teacher of children. If with a heart imbued with the love of Christ, she teaches the children of her class, praying with them and for them, she may see souls converted, and gathered into the fold of Christ. I do not recommend that woman should seek to become a voter [WOMEN WERE NOT GRANTED THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL 1920. WHEN THIS WAS WRITTEN SOME ALREADY WERE ATTEMPTING BY VARIOUS MEANS TO CHANGE THE LAW] or officeholder; but as a missionary, teaching the truth by epistolary correspondence, distributing reading matter, conversing with families and praying with the mother and children, she may do much, and be a blessing.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 18}
