{"word": "Christians should not be hard-hearted, unapproachable; Jesus is to be reflected in our deportment, and we are to have a character beautiful with the graces of heaven.

Those around you are to realize that the atmosphere of heaven surrounds you.--Review and Herald, Sept. 20, 1892.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 75}
