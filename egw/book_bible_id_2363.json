{"word": "Holiness, dignity, honor, and felicity [happiness] in the presence of God are things now unseen except by the eye of faith. But the things which  are seen, worldly honor, worldly pleasure, riches, and glory, are eclipsed by the excellency, the beauty, and resplendent glory of the things now unseen. The things of this world are temporal, enduring only for a time, while the things which are not seen are eternal, enduring through endless ages. To secure this infinite treasure is to gain everything and lose nothing (The SDA Bible Commentary, Ellen G. White Comments, vol. 6, pp. 1099, 1100).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 250}
