{"word": "\"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you\" (Romans 8:11). O how precious are these words to every bereaved soul! Christ is our Guide and Comforter, who comforts us in all our tribulations. When He gives us a bitter draught to drink, He also holds a cup of blessing to our lips. He fills the heart with submission, with joy and peace in believing, and enables us to say submissively, Not my will, but Thy will, O Lord, be done. \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord\" (Job 1:21). With this submission hope is resurrected, and the hand of faith lays hold upon the hand of infinite power. \"He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you\" (Romans 8:11).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 270}
