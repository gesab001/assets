{"word": "To Be Honored and Respected.--The old standard-bearers who are still living should not be put in hard places. Those who served their Master when the work went hard, who endured poverty and remained faithful to the truth when our numbers were small, are ever to be honored and respected. I am instructed to say: Let every believer respect the aged pioneers who have borne trials and hardships and many privations. They are God's workmen and have acted a prominent part in the building up of His work.--7T 289 (1902).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 751}
