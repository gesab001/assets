    "word": "Paul exhorted Timothy: \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" \"But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.\"",
