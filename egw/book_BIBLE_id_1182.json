PUBLISHED IN SDA BIBLE COMMENTARY, VOL. 6, PP. 1070, 1071. \n\n\n     As the penitent sinner, contrite before God, discerns Christ's atonement in his behalf and accepts this atonement as his only hope in this life and the future life, his sins are pardoned. This is justification by faith. Every believing soul is to conform his will entirely to God's will and keep in a state of repentance and contrition, exercising faith in the atoning merits of the Redeemer and advancing from strength to strength, from glory to glory.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 103}
