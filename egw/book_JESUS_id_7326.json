{"word": "Christ's favorite theme was the paternal tenderness and abundant grace of God; He dwelt much upon the holiness of His character and His law; He presented Himself to the people as the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Let these be the themes of Christ's ministers. Present the truth as it is in Jesus. Make plain the requirements of the law and the gospel. Tell the people of Christ's life of self-denial and sacrifice; of His humiliation and death; of His resurrection and ascension; of His intercession for them in the courts of God; of His promise, \"I will come again, and receive you unto myself\" (John 14:3) (Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 39, 40). \n                                                                           109", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 108}
