{"word": "I have very solemn feelings as I consider the condition the world is in. O how careless, how full of crime and disobedience and sin, how sad, how terribly sad is the fact that the world does not recognize the love of God in giving Jesus Christ as our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, who was equal with God. \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). Sin has for ages disturbed, or I might say, impeded the great work of divine benevolence by obstructing the channel through human agencies that refuse to receive the heavenly gift and therefore cannot impart the same.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 354}
