    "word": "Christ came to do His Father's will. Are we following in His steps? All who have named the name of Christ should be constantly seeking for a more intimate acquaintance with Him, that they may walk even as He walked, and do the works of Christ. We should appropriate the lessons of His life to our lives. Christ \"gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\" \"Hereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\" Here is the work of self-denial upon which we must enter with cheerfulness, in imitation of the example of our Redeemer. The Christian's life must be one of conflict and of sacrifice. The path of duty should be followed, not the path of inclination and choice.",
