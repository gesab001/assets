{"word": "Immortality, promised to man on condition of obedience, had been forfeited by transgression. Adam could not transmit to his posterity that which he did not possess; and there could have been no hope for the fallen race, had not God, by the sacrifice of his Son, brought immortality within their reach. While \\93death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned,\\94 Christ \\93hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.\\94 [Romans 5:12; 2 Timothy 1:10.] And only through Christ can immortality be obtained. Said Jesus, \\93He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life.\\94 [John 3:36.] Every man may come in possession of this priceless blessing if he will comply with the conditions. All \\93who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality,\\94 will receive eternal life. [Romans 2:7.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 533}
