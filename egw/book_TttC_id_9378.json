    "word": "Wherever schools are established, wise managers must be provided, \"able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness,\" men who will do their very best in the various responsibilities of their positions. Business ability they should have, but it is of still greater importance that they walk humbly with God and are guided by the Holy Spirit. Such men will be taught of God, and they will seek counsel of their brethren who are men of prayer.",
