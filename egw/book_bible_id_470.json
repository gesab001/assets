{"word": "A great work can be done by presenting to the people the Bible just as it reads. Carry the word of God to every man's door, urge its plain statements upon every man's conscience, repeat to all the Saviour's command: \"Search the Scriptures.\" John 5:39. Admonish them to take the Bible as it is, to implore divine enlightenment, and then, when the light shines, to gladly accept each precious ray and fearlessly abide the consequences.  5T 38847", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 62}
