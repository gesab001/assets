    "word": "Peter exhorts the churches to \"be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.\" \"The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.\" Again he says: \"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.\"",
