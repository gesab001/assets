As they arose and again surrounded the Son of God, Peter drew his sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off an ear. Jesus bade him to put up the sword, saying, \"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?\" I saw that as these words were spoken, the countenances of the angels were animated with hope. They wished then and there to surround their Commander and disperse that angry mob. But again sadness settled upon them, as Jesus added, \"But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\" The hearts of the disciples also sank in despair and bitter disappointment, as Jesus suffered Himself to be led away by His enemies.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 167}
