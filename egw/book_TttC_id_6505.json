    "word": "The lapse of time has brought great changes. Light has increased and has become widespread. While the people who are anxious for truth have been calling, \"Watchman, what of the night?\" the answer has been given intelligently, \"The morning cometh, and also the night.\" By a thorough investigation of the prophecies we understand where we are in this world's history; and we know for a certainty that the second coming of Christ is near. The result of these investigations must be brought before the world through the press. And as the work has enlarged and increased, greater facilities have been demanded from year to year; improvements have gone steadily forward. It has been a cause of wonder to the world that with this unpopular truth such prosperity should attend the work. But with increased light and confirmed truth, and greater advantages in every way for the advancement of the cause, our works do not correspond with our faith.",
