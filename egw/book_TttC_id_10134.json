    "word": "Those who love and serve God should feel the deepest interest in all that concerns the glory of His name. Who could see an institution where the truth has been magnified, where the Lord has so often revealed His presence, where instruction has been given by the messengers of God, where the truth has been sent forth in publications that have accomplished great good--who could bear to see such an institution pass into the hands \n                                                                           455\nof worldlings, to be used for common, worldly purposes?

Should this take place, men would say that it was because the Lord was not able to prevent it.",
