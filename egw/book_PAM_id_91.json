{"word": "Canvassing must not be made a prerequisite to ministry.--Some who did not receive their counsel from God, prepared a resolution, which was carried, that no one should labor as a minister unless he first made a success in the canvassing field. The Spirit of the Lord did not indite that resolution. It was born of minds that were taking a narrow view of God's vineyard and his workmen. It is not the work of any man to prescribe the work for any other man contrary to his own convictions of duty. He is to be advised and counselled, but he is to seek his directions from God, whose he is, and whom he serves.--PM 260.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 47}
