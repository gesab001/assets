{"word": "Souls Invigorated by Contact With the Infinite.--We should contemplate God in nature--study His character in the work of His hands. The mind is strengthened by becoming acquainted with God, by reading His attributes in the things which He has made. As we behold the beauty and grandeur in the works of nature, our affections go out after God; and though our souls are awed and our spirit subdued, our souls are invigorated by coming in contact with the Infinite through His marvelous works. Communion with God through humble prayer develops and strengthens the mental and moral faculties, and spiritual powers increase by cultivating thoughts upon spiritual things.--YI, July 13, 1893.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 732}
