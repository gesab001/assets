{"word": "He who presides over His church and the destinies of nations is carrying forward the last work to be accomplished for this world. To His angels He gives the commission to execute His judgments. Let the ministers awake, let them take in the situation. The work of judgment begins at the sanctuary. \"And,  behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.\" Read Ezekiel 9:2-7. The command is, \"Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and \n                                                                           432\nwomen: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.\" Saith God, \"I will recompense their way upon their head.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 431}
