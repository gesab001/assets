{"word": "The First Two Plagues \n\n     When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship the beast and his image and receive his mark (Revelation 14:9, 10), will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt when God was about to deliver Israel, were similar in character to those more terrible and extensive judgments which are to fall upon the world just before the final deliverance of God's people. Says the revelator, in describing those terrific scourges: \"There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshiped his image.\" The sea \"became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea\" [Revelation 16:2, 3].--GC 627, 628 (1911).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 244}
