{"word": "Through disloyalty, God's chosen people developed a character exactly the opposite of the character He desired them to develop. They placed their own mold and superscription upon the truth. They forgot God, and lost sight of their high privilege as His representatives. The blessings they had received brought no blessing to the world. All their advantages were appropriated for their own glorification. They robbed God of the service He required of them, and they robbed their fellow men of religious guidance and a holy example. Like the inhabitants of the antediluvian world, they followed out every imagination of their evil hearts. Thus they made sacred things appear a farce, saying, \"The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these,\" while at the same time they were misrepresenting God's character, dishonoring His name, and polluting His sanctuary (SW Jan. 10, 1905).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4BC", "page": 1181}
