{"word": "684\n     EXODUS 15:17: \\93THOU SHALT BRING THEM [THE PEOPLE] IN, AND PLANT THEM IN THE MOUNTAIN OF THINE INHERITANCE, IN THE PLACE, O LORD, WHICH THOU HAST MADE FOR THEE TO DWELL IN; IN THE SANCTUARY, O LORD, WHICH THY HANDS HAVE ESTABLISHED.\\94 WITHOUT TAKING TIME OR SPACE TO GIVE AN EXPOSITION OF THE TEXT, IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE PRESENT PURPOSE TO REMARK THAT IT DISPROVES THE IDEA OF THE EARTH BEING THE SANCTUARY. WHATEVER CONSTRUCTION MAY BE PLACED UPON THE TEXT, IT TEACHES THAT THE PEOPLE WERE NOT THEN IN THE SANCTUARY; BUT THEY WERE IN THE EARTH. THEN IT IS CLAIMED THAT IT REFERRED TO THAT PART OF THE EARTH INTO WHICH THEY WERE TO BE BROUGHT, NAMELY, PALESTINE. THIS IS DISPROVED BY THE SECOND TEXT.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 684}
