{"word": "Solemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of the atonement. Momentous are the interests involved therein. The Judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For more than forty years this work has been in progress. Soon\\97none know how soon\\97it will pass to the cases of the living. In the awful presence of God our lives are to come up in review. At this time above all others it behooves every soul to heed the Saviour's admonition, \\93Watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is.\\94 [Mark 13:33.] \\93If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\\94 [Revelation 3:3.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 490}
