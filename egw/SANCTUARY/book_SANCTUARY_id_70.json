{"word": "Were Peter upon the earth now he would exhort the professed followers of Christ to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul. And Paul would call upon the churches in general, to cleanse themselves from \"all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" And Christ would drive from the temple those who are defiled by the use of tobacco, polluting the sanctuary of God by their tobacconized breaths. He would say to these worshipers, as He did to the Jews, \"My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\" We would say to such, your unholy offerings of ejected quids of tobacco defile the temple and are abhorred of God. Your worship is not acceptable, for your bodies, which should be the temple for the Holy Ghost, are defiled. You also rob the treasury of God of thousands of dollars through\n60\nthe indulgence of unnatural appetite.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Con", "page": 59}
