{"word": "There are coarse and even sensual minds among physicians. God forbid that this should be the character of one who claims to believe sacred truth. The Spirit of God will shield us from all evil, and will give us an appreciation of the reality of spiritual and eternal things. The solemn truths which we profess will sanctify the soul if we bring them into the inner sanctuary of the heart. Oh, that every physician would be what God would have him--pure, holy, undefiled, shielded by the grace of God, knowing that Christ is his personal Saviour.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 149}
