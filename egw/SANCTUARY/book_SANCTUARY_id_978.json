{"word": "In the balances of the sanctuary the Seventh-day Adventist church is to be weighed. She will be judged by the privileges and advantages that she has had. If her spiritual experience does not correspond to the advantages that Christ, at infinite cost, has bestowed on her, if the blessings conferred have not qualified her to do the work entrusted to her, on her will be pronounced the sentence: \"Found wanting.\" By the light bestowed, the opportunities given, will she be judged.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "8T", "page": 247}
