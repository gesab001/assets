{"word": "Then the Lord required the people to bring a free-will offering, to make him a sanctuary, that he might dwell among them. \"And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the Lord's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought bracelets, and ear-rings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold; and every man that offered, offered an offering of gold unto the Lord.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SP", "page": 269}
