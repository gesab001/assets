{"word": "The foundation firmly laid, we need wisdom that we may know how to build. When Moses was about to erect the sanctuary in the wilderness, he was cautioned, \"See ... that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount.\" Hebrews 8:5. In His law, God has given us the pattern. Our character building is to be after \"the pattern showed to thee in the mount.\" The law is the great standard of righteousness. It represents the character of God, and is the test of our loyalty to His government. And it is revealed to us, in all its beauty and excellence, in the life of Christ. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 62}
