{"word": "When this church is weighed in the balance of the sanctuary, it is found wanting, having left its first love. The True Witness declares, \"I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted\" (Revelation 2:2, 3). Notwithstanding all this, the church is found wanting. What is the fatal deficiency?--\"Thou hast left thy first love.\" Is not this our case? Our doctrines may be correct; we may hate false doctrine, and may not receive those who are not true to principle; we may labor with untiring energy; but even this is not sufficient. What is our motive? Why are we called upon to repent?--\"Thou hast left thy first love.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 370}
