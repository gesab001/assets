{"word": "ANGELS CARRY OUR PRAYERS TO THE HEAVENLY SANCTUARY.\\97Angels hear the offering of praise and the prayer of faith, and they\n63\nbear the petitions to Him who ministers in the sanctuary for His people, and pleads His merits in their behalf. True prayer takes hold upon Omnipotence, and gives men the victory. Upon his knees the Christian obtains strength to resist temptation.\\97(Review and Herald, February 1, 1912.)", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 62}
