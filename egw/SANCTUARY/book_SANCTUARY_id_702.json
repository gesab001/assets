{"word": "In the days of ancient Israel, when at the foot of Sinai Moses told the people of the divine command, \"Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them\" (Exodus 25:8), the response of the Israelites was accompanied by appropriate gifts. \"They came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing\" (Exodus 35:21), and brought offerings. For the building of the sanctuary, great and expensive preparations were necessary; a large amount of the most precious and costly material was required; yet the Lord accepted only freewill offerings. \"Of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering\" (Exodus 25:2), was the divine command repeated by Moses to the congregation. Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice \n                                                                           174\nwere the first requisites in preparing a dwelling place for the Most High.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 173}
