{"word": "As the sanctuary on earth had two apartments, the holy and the most holy, so there are two holy places in the sanctuary in Heaven. And the ark containing the law of God, the altar of incense, and other instruments of service found in the sanctuary below, have also their counterpart in the sanctuary above. In holy vision the apostle John was permitted to enter Heaven, and he there beheld the candlestick and the altar of incense, and as \"the temple of God was opened,\" he beheld also \"the ark of his testament.\" [Revelation 4:5;  8:3; Revelation 11:19.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 261}
