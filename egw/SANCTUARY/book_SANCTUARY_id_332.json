{"word": "434\n     The law of God in the sanctuary in Heaven is the great original, of which the precepts inscribed upon the tables of stone, and recorded by Moses in the Pentateuch, were an unerring transcript. Those who arrived at an understanding of this important point, were thus led to see the sacred, unchanging character of the divine law. They saw, as never before, the force of the Saviour's words, \\93Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in nowise pass from the law.\\94 [Matthew 5:18.] The law of God, being a revelation of his will, a transcript of his character, must forever endure, \\93as a faithful witness in Heaven.\\94 Not one command has been annulled; not a jot or tittle has been changed. Says the psalmist: \\93Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled in Heaven.\\94 \\93All his commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever.\\94 [Psalm 119:89; 111:7, 8.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 434}
