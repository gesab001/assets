    "word": "There are many dreams arising from the common things of life with which the Spirit of God has nothing to do. \"There are also false dreams, as well as false visions, which are inspired by the spirit of Satan. But dreams from the Lord are classed in the word of God with visions and are as truly the fruits of the spirit of prophecy as visions. Such dreams, taking into the account the persons who have them, and the circumstances under which they are given, contain their own proofs of their genuineness.\" [VOL. 1, P. 569 (1867).]",
