{"word": "The Spirit of Controversy.--Do not cherish a spirit of controversy. Little good is accomplished by denunciatory speeches. The surest way to destroy false doctrine is to preach the truth. Keep to the affirmative. Let the precious truths of the gospel kill the force of evil. Show a tender, pitiful spirit toward the erring. Come close to hearts.--Letter 190, 1902.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 304}
