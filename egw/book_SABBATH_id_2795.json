{"word": "It will do no good to reprimand, and accuse, and fret at your scholars when they manifest a spirit of unrest and mischievousness. Remember you are to be a patient laborer together with God, and that all heaven is interested in the work you are doing, and any part in the work of God means toil and travail of soul. \\93Quit you like men, be strong.\\94 Ask of your Master, who submitted to humiliation, and who endured the death of the cross, what He would have you to do. Take all your intrusted talents with you into the work, and put them out to the exchangers. Through the grace of Christ you will be able to do a precious work for the Master. The wealth of divine resource is at your command, and through prayer and faith you may lay hold on the promises of God, and appropriate them to your need. Consecrate yourself and your all to the service of Him who hath loved you, and hath given Himself for you. Jesus says, \\93Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples.\\94 This means in the Sabbath-school work as much as in the work of the minister. Now is the golden opportunity to sow precious seed that will spring up and bear fruit unto eternal life. Now you may be a savor of life unto life; for when you can impart to others \n70\ntruth that you have gained through a deep experience, it has a life-giving power that will impress hearts and draw them to Jesus. When Jesus is drawing, and His colaborers are working in harmony with Him, hard indeed must be the heart that will not be impressed and subdued by the power of divine love.\\97S.S.W., July, 1892.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 69}
