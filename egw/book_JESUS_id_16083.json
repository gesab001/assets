{"word": "The children and youth are Christ's purchased possession; He has bought them with an infinite price. Jesus loves the little ones. He looks with pity upon the young, for He knows how Satan will seek to attract them into the broad way, making it look enticing to their eyes; and Jesus bids the angels to take special charge of these inexperienced souls, in their homes, in their school life, and in the Sabbath-school. The Spirit is continually striving with them, seeking to draw them to God; and the laborer together with God will feel his responsibility, and will earnestly work to win souls to Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 44}
