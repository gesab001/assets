{"word": "Inadequate wages demonstrate disrespect for ministers.--When their accounts are audited, if selfish men shall, with voice or stroke of pen, limit the worker in his wages, they discourage and depress him. Every minister must have a salvage compensation to work upon, that he may have something with which to lead out in good enterprises, pushing the work with zeal. He tells us, \"thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.\" This is a figure of those who work under the eye of God to advance His cause in lifting the minds of men from the contemplation of earthly things to heaven. These God loves, and He would have men respect their rights.--East Michigan Banner March 29, 1905.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 107}
