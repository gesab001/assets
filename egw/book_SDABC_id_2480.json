    "word": "The Ministration of Death.--The holy law of God is both brief and comprehensive; for it is easily understood and remembered; and yet it is an expression of the will of God. Its comprehensiveness is summed up in the following words: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. . . . Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" \"This do, and thou shalt live.\" \"Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.\". . .",
