{"word": "It is the will of God that each professing Christian shall perfect a character after the divine similitude. By studying the character of Christ revealed in the Bible, by practicing His virtues, the believer will be changed into the same likeness of goodness and mercy. Christ's work of self-denial and sacrifice brought into the daily life will develop the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. There are many who wish to evade the cross-bearing part, but the Lord speaks to all when He says, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:24).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 171}
