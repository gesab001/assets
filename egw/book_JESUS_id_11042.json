{"word": "Temptations will assail, cares and darkness will oppress. When heart and flesh are ready to fail, who throws around us His everlasting arms? Who applies the precious promise? Who brings to our remembrance words of assurance and hope? Whose grace is given in rich measure to those who ask it in sincerity and truth? Who is it imputes to us His righteousness and saves us from sin? Whose light rolls back the fog and mist and brings us into the sunshine of His presence? O who but Jesus? Then love Him, then praise Him. \"Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice\" (Philippians 4:4). Is Jesus today a living Saviour? \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God\" (Colossians 3:1). We are risen with Christ. Christ is our life. Through His mercy and gracious love we are declared to be chosen, adopted, pardoned, and justified. Then let us magnify the Lord.--Letter 7, 1892.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 245}
