{"word": "Even through children and youth the light of life may shine upon those who sit in darkness. Then watch and pray, and obtain a personal experience in the things of God. Your parents may teach you, they may try to guide your feet into safe paths; but it is impossible for them to change your heart. You must give your heart to Jesus, and walk in the precious light of truth that He has given you. Faithfully take up your duties in the home life, and, through the grace of God, you may grow up into the full stature of what Christ would have a child grow to be in Him. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 256}
