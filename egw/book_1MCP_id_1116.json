{"word": "Dwell Not on Satan's Power.--It is by beholding that we become changed. By dwelling upon the love of God and our Saviour, by contemplating the perfection of the divine character and claiming the righteousness of Christ as ours by faith, we are to be transformed into the same image. Then let us not gather together all the unpleasant pictures--the iniquities and corruptions and disappointments, the evidences of Satan's power--to hang in the halls of our memory, to talk over and mourn over until our souls are filled with discouragement. A discouraged soul is a body of darkness, not only failing himself to receive the light of God but shutting it away from others. Satan loves to see the effect of the pictures of his triumphs, making human beings faithless and disheartened.--5T 744, 745 (1889). \n\n338", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 337}
