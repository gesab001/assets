{"word": "Counsel Is Needed.--The inexperienced need to be guided by wise counsel when in trial and assailed with temptation; they must be taught that attainments in spiritual things will cost them steadfast, well-directed effort. We must repeat it often to those newly come to the faith, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him\" (James 1:5). These words are to be presented in the spirit of the Master who gave them, for they are of more value than gold or silver or precious stones.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 764}
