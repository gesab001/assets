{"word": "The words and promises of God are the only foundation of our faith. Take the word of God as truth, as a living, speaking voice to you, and obey faithfully every requirement. God is faithful, who hath promised. He will work with the efforts of superintendents and teachers. Our blessings are limited by the weakness of our faith. God is not unwilling to bestow; He is a reservoir of power. We must cherish meekness and holiness of heart. We may have rich evidences of His love and mercy daily in our self-denying efforts to do others good. I entreat the workers in our Sabbath schools to put on the whole armor of God, and, as faithful soldiers of Jesus Christ, show their fidelity. God will reward every work that is done to His glory.--TSS 26-29. \n                                                                           73", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 72}
