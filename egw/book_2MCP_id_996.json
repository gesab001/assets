{"word": "Chap. 73 - Right Thinking\n[SEE CHAPTER 88,\n\"NEGATIVE INFLUENCES ON THE MIND.\"]\n\n\n     Power of Thought a Gift From God.--The mind is a trust from God. The powers of the mind are to be cultivated. They are to be so wisely used that they will increase in strength. Each one is to use his entrusted talents in a way that the greatest good will be done. The mind is to be educated that the best energies of the soul will be brought out and every faculty be developed. We must not be contented with a low standard. We are to move onward from one advanced line of work to another. --Lt 106, 1901.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 665}
