{"word": "Oh, that every man, woman, and child who deals with human minds, may have the truth inwrought in the soul, that it may be revealed in spirit, in word, in character, and in action! The sanctifying power of the truth should lead every one who teaches in the Sabbath-school, or holds a position in our institutions, to have such an experience that he may say, \\93I know whom I have believed.\\94 There is transforming power in the religion of Jesus Christ, and this power must be seen upon us in far greater humility, in more earnest, living faith, that we may become a light to the world. Self must be humiliated, and Christ exalted. Why is it that those to whom God intrusts some work in His moral vineyard are so easily \n86\nlifted up? Why is it that many seem to think that a responsible position exalts the man? Why do they become so self-sufficient, when they are so utterly dependent upon the atoning Sacrifice? Why is there with some so great a want of tenderness, so little heart work?\\97It is because those who are self-sufficient have not fallen upon the Rock and been broken. This is why there is so little trust in God, so little earnest, contrite repentance, so great a lack of fervent prayer. Well may the questions be put by every instructor: \\93Have I received the Holy Ghost since I believed? Have I received Christ as my personal Saviour?\\94 Let these questions be solemnly answered.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 85}
