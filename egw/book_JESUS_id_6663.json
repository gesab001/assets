{"word": "There is no limit to the help that the Saviour is willing to bestow on us. He asks us to bring into our lives the grace that will keep us from sin. From the cross of Calvary there comes to us liberty, hope, and strength. Do not dishonor your Redeemer by doubting His power. Trust Him all the time. Take hold of the riches of His grace, saying, \"I will believe; I do believe that Jesus died for me.\" The way before you may seem dark, but Jesus can make it light.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 275}
