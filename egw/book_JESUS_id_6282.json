{"word": "It is our own character and experience that determine our influence upon others. In order to convince others of the power of Christ's grace, we must know its power in our own hearts and lives. The gospel we present for the saving of souls must be the gospel by which our\n8\nown souls are saved.

If we would draw sinners out of the swift-running current, our own feet must be firmly set upon the Rock, Christ Jesus.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HDL", "page": 7}
