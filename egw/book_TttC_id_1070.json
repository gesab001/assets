    "word": "Satan looked on and witnessed the heavy blow which Brother Hull dealt to spiritualism in Battle Creek. Spiritualists understood his organization, and felt assured it would not be in vain to make a determined effort to overthrow him who injured their cause so much. In discussing with spiritualists you have not merely to meet man and his arguments, but Satan and his angels. And never should one man be sent forth alone to combat with a spiritualist. If the cause of God really demands that we confront Satan and his host as represented by a spiritual medium, if enough is at stake to call for such a discussion, then several should go forth together that with prayer and faith the host of darkness may be driven back and the speaker shielded by angels that excel in strength.",
