{"word": "Physical Habits Affect the Brain.--The brain is the citadel of the being. Wrong physical habits affect the \n\n382 \n\nbrain and prevent the attainment of that which the students desire--a good mental discipline. Unless the youth are versed in the science of how to care for the body as well as for the mind, they will not be successful students. Study is not the principal cause of breakdown of the mental powers. The main cause is improper diet, irregular meals, a lack of physical exercise, and careless inattention in other respects to the laws of health. When we do all that we can to preserve the health, then we can ask God in faith to bless our efforts.--CT 299 (1913).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 381}
