{"word": "Chapter 22 \n\n     2-4 (Luke 14:16, 17). The Heavenly Banquet.--The spiritual banquet has been set before us in rich abundance. We have had presented to us by the messengers of God the richest feast--the righteousness of Christ, justification by faith, the exceeding great and precious promises of God in His Word, free access to the Father by Jesus Christ, the comforts of the Holy Spirit, and the well-grounded assurance of eternal life in the kingdom of God. We ask, What could God do for us that He has not done in preparing the great supper, the heavenly banquet (RH Jan. 17, 1899)?", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1097}
