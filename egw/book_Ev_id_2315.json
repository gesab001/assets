{"word": "In Full, Round Tones.--The ability to speak plainly and clearly, in full, round tones, is invaluable in any line of work. This qualification is indispensable in those who desire to become ministers, evangelists, Bible workers, or canvassers. Those who are planning to enter these lines of work should be taught to use the voice in such a way that when they speak to people about the truth, a decided impression for good will be made. The truth must not be marred by being communicated through defective utterance. --Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 380. (1900)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 665}
