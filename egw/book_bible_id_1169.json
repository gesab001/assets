{"word": "What Sin Is \n\n     The soul must first be convicted of sin before the sinner will feel a desire to come to Christ. \"Sin is the transgression of the law\" (1 John 3:4). \"I had not known sin, but by the law\" (Romans 7:7). When the commandment came home to Saul's conscience, sin revived, and he died. He saw himself condemned by the law of God. The sinner cannot be convinced of his guilt unless he understands what constitutes sin. It is impossible for an individual to experience Bible sanctification while he holds that if he believes in Christ it is immaterial whether he obeys God's law or disobeys it.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 31}
