{"word": "Laying the Foundation for Spiritism.--He [Satan] sometimes comes in the form of a lovely young person, or of a beautiful shadow. He works cures, and is worshiped by deceived mortals as a benefactor of our race. . . . Thousands are conversing with, and receiving instructions from, this demon-god, and acting according to his teachings. The world, which is supposed to be benefited so much by phrenology and animal magnetism, never was so corrupt. Satan uses these very things to destroy virtue and lay the foundation of Spiritualism.--Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 296, 297. (1862)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 604}
