{"word": "Young Men Study How to Present Symbolic Truth. --The Lord has been working with Elder S, teaching him how to give to the people this last warning message. His method of making the words of the Bible prove the truth for this time, and his use of the symbols presented in Revelation and Daniel, are effective. Let the young men learn as for their lives what is truth and how it should be presented. We are living in the last days of the great conflict; the truth alone will hold us securely in this time of trouble. The way should be prepared for Elder S to give the message, and our young men should attend his evening meetings. --Letter 349, 1906. \n                                                                           206", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 205}
