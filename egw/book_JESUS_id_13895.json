{"word": "Chapter IV - The Methodist Church.\n\n     My brother Robert and myself still attended the Methodist class-meeting. One evening the presiding elder was present. And, filled with the love of God, I related what he had done \n                                                                           22\nfor me, that I had at last found the blessing I had so long sought for--entire conformity to the will of God. I rejoiced in the soon coming of Jesus. I expected they would rejoice with me, but was disappointed. After I ceased speaking Elder B. asked me if it would not be more pleasant to live a long life of holiness here, and do others good, than to have Jesus come and destroy poor sinners. I told him I longed for Jesus to come. Then sin would have an end, and we should enjoy sanctification forever where there would be no tempting Devil to lead our steps astray.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 21}
