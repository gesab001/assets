    "word": "If the life we live in this world is wholly for Christ, it is a life of daily surrender. He has the freewill service, and each soul is His own jewel. If we can impress upon our sisters the good which it is in their power to do through Christ, we shall see a large work accomplished. If we can arouse the mind and heart to co-operate with the divine Worker, we shall, through the work they may accomplish, gain great victories. But self must be hidden; Christ must appear as the worker.",
