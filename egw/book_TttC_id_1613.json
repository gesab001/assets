    "word": "\"AT THIS MEETING WE INTRODUCED THE CASE OF SISTER HANNAH MORE, NOW SOJOURNING IN NORTHWESTERN MICHIGAN WITH FRIENDS WHO DO NOT OBSERVE THE BIBLE SABBATH. WE STATED THAT THIS SERVANT OF CHRIST EMBRACED THE SABBATH WHILE PERFORMING MISSIONARY LABOR IN CENTRAL AFRICA. WHEN THIS WAS KNOWN, HER SERVICES IN THAT DIRECTION WERE NO LONGER WANTED, AND SHE RETURNED TO AMERICA TO SEEK A HOME AND EMPLOYMENT WITH THOSE OF LIKE FAITH. WE JUDGE, FROM HER PRESENT LOCATION, THAT IN THIS SHE HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED. NO ONE IN PARTICULAR MAY BE WORTHY OF BLAME IN HER CASE; BUT IT APPEARS TO US THAT THERE IS EITHER A LACK OF SUITABLE PROVISIONS CONNECTED WITH OUR SYSTEM OF ORGANIZATION, FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF SUCH PERSONS AND TO ASSIST THEM TO A FIELD OF USEFUL LABOR, OR THAT THOSE BRETHREN AND SISTERS WHO HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING SISTER MORE HAVE NOT DONE THEIR DUTY. A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS THEN GIVEN TO INVITE HER TO FIND A HOME WITH THE BRETHREN IN THIS VICINITY UNTIL GENERAL CONFERENCE, WHEN HER CASE SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO OUR PEOPLE. BROTHER ANDREWS, BEING PRESENT, FULLY ENDORSED THE ACTION OF THE BRETHREN.\"",
