{"word": "The world is full of all manner of error of a misleading nature, and it is essential that both pupils and teachers know that they know what is truth. There is need that we reverence the word of God and recognize His voice in the living oracles, that we may practice its precepts and live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Those \n                                                                           28\nthat do the will of God shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, for no deception will cloud their minds. God calls every one, both old and young, to make a diligent search in His word, that they may discover the rich jewels of truth. Ministers and people, teachers and scholars, are all called to the work of studying the Bible.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 27}
