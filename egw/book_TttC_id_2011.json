    "word": "Dear Brother D has not understood the condition of his own heart. Selfishness has found a lodgment there, and peace, healthful, calm peace, has departed. What you all lack is the element of love--love to God and love to your neighbor. The life that you now live you do not live by faith in the Son of God. There is a lack of firm trust, a fearfulness to resign all into the hands of God, as though He could not keep that which is committed to His trust. You are afraid some evil is designed which will do you harm unless you assume the defensive and commence a warfare in your own favor. The children of God are wise and powerful according to their reliance upon His wisdom and power. They are strong and happy according to their separation from the wisdom and help of man.",
