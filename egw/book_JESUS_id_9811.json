{"word": "Faith, the first round Round two: Virtue\n     Faith is the first round in the ladder of advancement. Without faith it is impossible to please God. But many stop on this round, and never ascend higher. They seem to think that when they have professed Christ, when their names are on the church record, their work is completed. Faith is essential; but the inspired word says, \\93Add to your faith virtue.\\94 Those who are seeking for eternal life, and a home in the kingdom of God, must lay for their character building the foundation of virtue. Jesus must be the chief cornerstone. The things that defile the soul must be banished from the mind and life. When temptations are presented, they must be resisted in the strength of Christ. The virtue of the spotless Lamb of God must be woven into the character till the soul can stand in its integrity. \\93Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\\94", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PCP", "page": 16}
