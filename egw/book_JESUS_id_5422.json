{"word": "It is a case of life or death with us. We have been stricken with spiritual paralysis, and every one \n226\nneeds the help of the Great Physician. He alone can reach our case. He is only waiting to be invited by us with earnest heart, with sincere desire. Nothing is wanting but a preparation of heart, and earnest, believing prayer, to bring Jesus to our side as a mighty helper. He longs to come. If we will but listen to his voice and open the door, he will come in.\\97MS.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 225}
