{"word": "Church members, let the light shine forth. Let your voices be heard in humble prayer, in witness against intemperance, the folly, and the amusements of this world, and in the proclamation of the truth for this time. Your voice, your influence, your time-all these are gifts from God and are to be used in winning souls to Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "9T", "page": 38}
