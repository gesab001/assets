{"word": "Chap. 6 - Sabbath-School Influences\n \n    The Sabbath-school should be one of the greatest instrumentalities, and the most effectual, in bringing souls to Christ. Our Sabbath-school workers need to be especially imbued with the Spirit of Christ. They can not be co-workers with Christ unless they have Him abiding in their hearts by faith. . . . The children need a more decided effort in regard to religious culture. The leading workers and the teachers should labor for perfect harmony. There should be cooperation on the part of parent, children, and teachers. Let every worker labor for wisdom and tact, that he may put forth that well-directed effort which God requires. We are to cultivate tact and sharp discernment, to be quick to see opportunities to do good, and to seize these opportunities and make the most of them. Teachers of the different classes should bring every child into their heart, and under their special watchcare.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 20}
