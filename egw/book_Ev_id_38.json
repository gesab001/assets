{"word": "The Call to Strong Young Men.--Where are the men who will go forth to the work, fully trusting in God, ready to do and to dare? God calls, \"Son, go work today in My vineyard.\" God will make the young men of today heaven's chosen repositories, to present before the people truth in contrast with error and superstition, if they will give themselves to Him. May God roll the burden on strong young men, who have His word abiding in them and who will give the truth to others.--Manuscript 134, 1898.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 24}
