    "word": "My physical strength had been prostrated by the blow, yet the power of divine grace sustained me in my great bereavement. When I saw my husband breathe his last, I felt that Jesus was more precious to me then than He ever had been in any previous hour of my life. When I stood by my first-born, and closed his eyes in death, I could say: \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\" And I felt then that I had a comforter in Jesus. \n                                                                           111\nAnd when my latest born was torn from my arms, and I could no longer see its little head upon the pillow by my side, then I could say: \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\" And when he upon whose large affections I had leaned, with whom I had labored for thirty-six years, was taken away, I could lay my hands upon his eyes, and say: I commit my treasure to Thee until the morning of the resurrection.",
