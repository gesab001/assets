{"word": "Jesus died, dear youth, not to save you in your sins, but from your sins. He wants you to follow the example which He has set before you--to deny self, take up your cross daily, and follow Him. He claims your service, your heart's best and holiest affections. If you will walk in obedience to His will, learning cheerfully and diligently the lessons of His providence, by and by He will say, \"Child, come up higher to the heavenly mansions which I have prepared for you.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 261}
