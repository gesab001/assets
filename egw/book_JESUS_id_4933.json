{"word": "So we see that the highest line of earthly education may be obtained, and yet the men possessing it may be ignorant of the first principles which would make them subjects of the kingdom of God. Human learning cannot qualify for that kingdom. The subjects of Christ's kingdom are not made thus by forms and ceremonies, by a large study of books. \"This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou has sent.\" The members of Christ's kingdom are members of His body, of which He himself is the head. They are the elect sons of God, \"a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,\" that they should show forth the praises of Him who has called them out of darkness into His marvelous light.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 413}
