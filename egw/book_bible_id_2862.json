{"word": "274\n \n \n \n \n \nValue of Small Group Bible Study\n \n\n     Little groups that meet together for Bible study receive spiritual muscle.--Let little companies meet together to study the Scriptures. You will lose nothing by this, but will gain much. Angels of God will be in your gathering, and as you feed upon the Bread of Life, you will receive spiritual sinew and muscle. You will be feeding, as it were, upon the leaves of the tree of life. By this means only can you maintain your integrity.--TDG 11.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 274}
