{"word": "A proper fear of God, in believing His threatenings, works the peaceable fruits of righteousness, by causing the trembling soul to flee to Jesus. Many ought to have this spirit today, and turn to the Lord with humble contrition, for the Lord has not given so many terrible threatenings, pronounced so severe judgments in His Word, simply to have them recorded, but He means what He says. One says, \"Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law,\" Paul says, \"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men\" (RH Oct. 21, 1890).", "paragraph": 8, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1100}
