{"word": "The Bible gives the true seeker an advanced mental discipline, and he comes from contemplation of divine things with his faculties enriched; self is humbled, while God and His revealed truth are exalted. . . . The Bible contains just that quality of food that the Christian needs, in order that he may grow strong in spirit and intellect. . . . Through the study of the Bible, converse is held with patriarchs and prophets. The truth is clothed in elevated language, which exerts a fascinating power over the mind; the thought is lifted up from the things of earth, and brought to contemplate the glory of the future immortal life.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 108}
