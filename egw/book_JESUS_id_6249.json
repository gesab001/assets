{"word": "In all our work we are to remember that the same Jesus who fed the multitude with five loaves and two small fishes, is able today to give us the fruit of our labor. He who said to the fishers of Galilee, Let down your nets for a draught, and who as they obeyed, filled their nets till they broke, desires His people to see in this an evidence of what He will do for them today.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HFM", "page": 56}
