No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breath of mind, a nobility of character, that is rarely seen in these times.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 135}
