{"word": "The Love of Christ Wins Its Way.--Only He who reads the heart knows how to bring men to repentance. Only His \n\n80 \n\nwisdom can give us success in reaching the lost. You may stand up stiffly, feeling, \"I am holier that thou,\" and it matters not how correct your reasoning or how true your words; they will never touch hearts. The love of Christ manifested in word and act will win its way to the soul when the reiteration of precept or argument would accomplish nothing.--MH 163 (1905).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 79}
