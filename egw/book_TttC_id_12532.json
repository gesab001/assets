    "word": "Teaching the Principles of Health Reform \n\n     As a people we have been given the work of making known the principles of health reform. There are some who think that the question of diet is not of sufficient importance to be included in their evangelistic work. But such make a great mistake. God's word declares: Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\" 1 Corinthians 10:31. The subject of temperance, in all its bearings, has an important place in the work of salvation.",
