{"word": "We may ask of God great things and He will give them us. We shall be strong in His strength. You will receive opposition from the clergy as you live up to, and present to others, the high standard of the religion of the Bible; contempt and jeering, slander and falsehood will follow you. Your motives, your words, your actions will be misunderstood and misrepresented and condemned.

You will receive the sympathy of all those who are honest and reasonable.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 60}
