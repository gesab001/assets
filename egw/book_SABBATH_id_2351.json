{"word": "Many Sabbathkeepers who are wealthy are guilty of grinding the face of the poor. Do such think that God takes no notice of their little acts of meanness? If their eyes could be opened they would see an angel following them wherever they go, making a faithful record of all their acts in their families and at their places of business. The True Witness is on their track, declaring: \"I know thy works.\" As I saw this spirit of defrauding, of overreaching, of meanness, even among some professed Sabbathkeepers, I cried out in anguish of spirit. This great evil, this terrible curse, is folding around some of the Israel of God in these last days, making them a detestation to even noble-spirited unbelievers. This is the people professedly waiting for the coming of the Lord.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 480}
