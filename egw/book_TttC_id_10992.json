    "word": "We are to learn from past experience how to avoid failure. We pray to our heavenly Father, \"Lead us not into temptation,\" and then, too often, we fail to guard our feet against leading us into temptation. We are to keep away from the temptations by which we are easily overcome. Our success is wrought out by ourselves through the grace of Christ. We are to roll out of the way the stone of stumbling that has caused us and others so much sadness. \n\n                                               -",
