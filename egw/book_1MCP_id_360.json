{"word": "Chap. 14 - Exercise\n\n\n     The Law of Obedient Action.--All the heavenly beings are in constant activity, and the Lord Jesus, in His practical lifework, has given an example for every man. God has established in the heavens the law of obedient action. [NOTE: THE LAW OF OBEDIENT ACTION IS WORTHY OF CAREFUL STUDY. ACTION NOT ONLY ADVANCES PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT BRINGS US INTO HARMONY WITH OTHERS AND WITH THE UNIVERSE.] Silent but ceaseless, the objects of His creation do their appointed work. The ocean is in constant motion. The springing grass, \"which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven,\" does its errand, clothing the fields with beauty. The leaves are stirred by the wind, and yet no hand is seen to touch them. The sun, moon, and stars are useful and glorious in fulfilling their appointed mission. And man, his mind and body created in God's own similitude, must be active in order to fill his appointed place. Man is not to be idle. Idleness is sin.--Lt 103, 1900.
