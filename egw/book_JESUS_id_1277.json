{"word": "Representatives of Jesus--It would be well if those occupying positions of trust in our institutions would remember that they are to be representatives of Jesus.  True goodness, holiness, love, compassion for tempted souls must be revealed in their lives.  Christ gave Himself to the world, that He might save those who would believe in Him.  Shall not we, partakers of this great salvation, value the souls for whom He gave His life!  Let us labor with a perseverance and energy proportionate to the value Christ places \n8\nupon His blood-bought heritage.  Human souls have cost too much to be trifled with, or treated with harshness or indifference.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "ChL", "page": 7}
