{"word": "As the wickedness of the wicked increases, opposition will be brought to bear upon you closer and closer. Satan has many batteries prepared to open upon the people of God. You will have troubles and difficulties to meet, such as you never experienced before, \n198\nand there will seem to be no way of escape. But if you have learned to trust in God, you know that he will not leave you; you have the assurance that he will hear your prayers, for he has been to you all that he has promised. You can hang your helpless soul on Jesus, and in the time of trial he will prove to you a never-failing helper.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 197}
