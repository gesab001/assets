    "word": "Follow on, young men, to know the Lord, and you will know that \"His going forth is prepared as the morning.\" Hosea 6:3. Seek constantly to improve. Strive earnestly for identity with the Redeemer. Live by faith in Christ. Do the work He did. Live for the saving of the souls for whom He laid down His life. Try in every way to help those with whom you come in contact. Strive continually to improve. Let your life fulfill the words: \"Thou through Thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies.\" Psalm 119:98. Talk with your Elder Brother, who will complete your education, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. A close connection with Him who offered Himself as a sacrifice to save a perishing world will make you acceptable workers. When you can lay your hand on truth and appropriate it, when you can say, \"My Lord and my God,\" grace and peace and joy in rich measure will be yours. \n\n                                               -",
