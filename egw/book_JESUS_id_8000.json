{"word": "My prayer this morning is most earnest and importunate, that in the Christian warfare we shall not fail nor be discouraged. \"There is light above,\" a Voice says to me, and in response I withdraw my eyes from the earthly and the discouraging and look to the heavenly, praying earnestly that God's people may more distinctly and forcibly realize the dignity that our heavenly Father has conferred upon us in calling us to represent before the world, in sinful flesh, His goodness and mercy. Upon us, as well as upon the unthankful and the unholy, He pours unnumbered blessings. We are to express our thankfulness to Him that we are accepted as workers to cooperate with the Lord Jesus Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 255}
