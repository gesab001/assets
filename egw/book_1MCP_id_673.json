{"word": "Evidences a New Principle of Life.--When men are bound together, not by force or self-interest, but by love, they show the working of an influence that is above every human influence. Where this oneness exists, it is evidence that the image of God is being restored in humanity, that a new principle of life has been implanted. It shows that there is power in the divine nature to withstand the supernatural agencies of evil and that the grace of God subdues the selfishness inherent in the natural heart.--DA 678 (1898).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 210}
