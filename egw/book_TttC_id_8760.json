    "word": "Ezekiel, the mourning exile prophet, in the land of the Chaldeans, was given a vision teaching the same lesson of faith in the mighty God of Israel. As he was upon the banks of the river Chebar, a whirlwind seemed to come from the north, \"a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber.\" A number of wheels of strange appearance, intersecting one another, were moved by four living creatures. High above all these was \"the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.\" \"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.\" \"And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.\"",
