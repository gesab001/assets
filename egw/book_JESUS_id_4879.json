{"word": "You have the Pattern, Christ Jesus; walk in His footsteps, and you will be qualified to fill any and every position that you may be called upon to occupy. You will be \"rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.\" You are not to feel that you are a bondslave, but a son of God; that you are highly favored in that you have been regarded of so great value that God has made you His by paying an infinite ransom for your freedom. Jesus says, \"I call you not servants; \n                                                                           304\n. . . but I have called you friends.\" When you appreciate His wondrous love, love and gratitude will be in your heart as a wellspring of joy.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 303}
