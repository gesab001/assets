    "word": "Let these words ring like musical bells in our ears and heart. \u201cFor God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d How urgently my soul pleads for the heavenly endowment. Of myself I can do nothing. The power and the glory is all of God. \u201cThe Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do: for what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\u201d \u201cBelievest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself; but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works.\u201d I see the work of God is so sacred, that I dare not \n38\ntouch it without the presence of Jesus by my side. All might, all power and all glory belong to Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.",
