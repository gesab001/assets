    "word": "David composed many of the psalms in the wilderness, to which he was compelled to flee for safety. Saul even pursued him there; and David was several times preserved from falling into the hands of Saul, by the special interposition of Providence. While David was thus passing \n                                                                           387\nthrough severe trials and hardships, he manifested an unwavering trust in God, and was especially imbued with his Spirit as he composed his songs which recount his dangers and deliverances, ascribing praise and glory to God, his merciful preserver. In these psalms is seen a spirit of fervor, devotion, and holiness. He sung these songs, which express his thoughts and meditations of divine things, accompanied with skillful music upon the harp and other instruments. The psalm contained in 2 Samuel 22, was composed while Saul was hunting him to take his life. Nearly all the sacred songs of David were arranged in the earlier period of his life, while he was serving the Lord with integrity and purity of heart.",
