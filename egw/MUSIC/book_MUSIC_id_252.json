    "word": "And as the redeemed shall ascend to heaven, the gates of the city of God will swing back, and those who have kept the truth will enter in. A voice, richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, will be heard saying, \u201cCome, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\u201d Then the righteous will receive their reward. Their lives will run parallel with the life of Jehovah. They will cast their crowns at the Redeemer\u2019s feet, touch the golden harps, and fill all heaven with rich music.\u2014ST April 15, 1889 quoted in CS 350.",
