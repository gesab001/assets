    "word": "Youth to Press to the Front \n\n     As Christians, we should stand firmly in defense of temperance. There is no class of persons capable of accomplishing more in the cause of temperance, than our God-fearing youth. If the young men who live in our cities would unite in a firm, decided army, and set their faces as a flint against every form of selfish, health-destroying indulgence, what a power they might be for good! How many they might save from becoming demoralized by visiting the halls and gardens that are fitted up \n                                                                           9\nwith music and every attraction to allure the youth! Intemperance, Licentiousness, and Profanity are sisters.",
