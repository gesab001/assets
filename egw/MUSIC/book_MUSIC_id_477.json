    "word": "Chapter 27 \n\n     1, 32-34 (Proverbs 11:14; 24:6). Wide Distribution of Responsibility Lessened Burdens.--In planning for the administration of the affairs of the kingdom, after David abdicated in favor of Solomon, the aged king and his son and their counselors regarded it as essential that everything be done with regularity, propriety, fidelity, and dispatch. So far as possible, they followed the system of organization given Israel soon after the deliverance from Egypt. The Levites were assigned the work connected with the temple service, including the ministry of song and instrumental music, and the keeping of the treasures. The men capable of bearing arms and of serving the king were divided into twelve courses of twenty-four thousand each. Over every course was a captain. \"The general of the king's army was Joab.\" \"The courses. . . came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year.\" Thus every group of twenty-four thousand served the king one month during each year.",
