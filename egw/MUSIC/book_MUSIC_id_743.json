    "word": "The Victor's Palm and Shining Harp--In every hand are placed the victor's palm and the shining harp. Then, as the commanding angels strike the note, every hand sweeps the harp strings with skillful touch, awaking sweet music in rich, melodious strains. Rapture unutterable thrills every heart, and each voice is raised in grateful praise: \"Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in \n                                                                           467\nHis own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.\" Revelation 1:5, 6.--GC 646.",
