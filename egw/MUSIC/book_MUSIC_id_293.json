    "word": "When all the company were assembled, Brother Carter read a hymn. All had books, and joined heartily in singing. One, who was an accomplished musician, played the organ. I then opened the meeting by prayer, and again all joined in singing. I spoke from the words of John: \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He \n                                                                           234\nshall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.\" 1 John 3:1,2.",
