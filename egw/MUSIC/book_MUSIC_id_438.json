    "word": "Music forms a part of God's worship in the courts above, and we should endeavor, in our songs of praise, to approach as nearly as possible to the harmony of the heavenly choirs.

Singing, as a part of religious service, is as much an act of worship as is prayer.--Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 594.",
