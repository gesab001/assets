    "word": "The soul may ascend nearer heaven on the wings of praise. God is worshiped with song and music in the courts above, and as we express our gratitude we are approximating to the worship of the heavenly hosts. \"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth\" God (Psalm 50:23). Let us with reverent joy come before our Creator, with \"thanksgiving, and the voice of melody\" (Isaiah 51:3) (Steps to Christ, pp. 103, 104).",
