We must not pet our faults and sins, but put them away, and make haste to set our hearts in order. When this is done, let us take the key of faith, and unlock the storehouse of God's rich blessings. . . . There is an infinite fullness to draw from; and we have the promise of our divine Lord, \"According to your faith be it unto you.\" We may win the crown of life, a place at God's right hand, and as we enter the pearly gates, hear the words, sweeter than any music, \"Well done, good and faithful servant . . . : enter thou into the joy of thy lord\" (Matthew 25:23) (Signs of the Times, Aug. 18, 1887). \n                                                                           267",
