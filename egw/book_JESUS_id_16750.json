{"word": "True happiness is to be found, not in self-indulgence and self-pleasing, but in learning of Christ, taking His yoke, and bearing His burden. Those who trust to their own wisdom and follow their own ways, go complaining at every step, because the burden which selfishness binds upon them is so heavy and its yoke so galling. They might change all this if they would but come to Jesus and by His grace put off the yoke that links them to Satan, . . . take the burden which Christ gives them, and let His yoke bind them to Him in willing, happy service.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 121}
