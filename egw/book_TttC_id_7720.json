    "word": "There is work for you to do in the church and out of the church. \"Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.\" The fruit we bear is the only test of the character of the tree before the world. This is the proof of our discipleship. If our works are of such a character that as branches of the living Vine we bear rich clusters of precious fruit, then we wear before the world God's own badge as His sons and daughters. We are living epistles, known and read of all men.",
