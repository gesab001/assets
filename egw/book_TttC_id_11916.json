    "word": "God has not changed toward His faithful servants who are keeping their garments spotless. But many are crying, \"Peace and safety,\" while sudden destruction is coming upon them. Unless there is thorough repentance, unless men humble their hearts by confession and receive the truth as it is in Jesus, they will never enter heaven. When purification shall take place in our ranks, we shall no longer rest at ease, boasting of being rich and increased with goods, in need of nothing.",
