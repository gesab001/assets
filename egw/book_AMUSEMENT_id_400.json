{"word": "Chap. 135 - Dancing\n\n     The true Christian will not desire to enter any place of amusement or engage in any diversion upon which he cannot ask the blessing of God. He will not be found at the theater, the billiard hall, or the bowling saloon. He will not unite with the gay waltzers, or indulge in any other bewitching pleasure that will banish Christ from the mind.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 398}
