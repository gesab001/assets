    "word": "You have been afflicted with disease for quite a length of time. You are a nervous dyspeptic. The brain is closely connected with the stomach, and its power has so often been called to aid the weakened digestive organs that it is in its turn weakened, depressed, congested. While in this state, your mind is gloomy, naturally dwelling upon the dark side, imagining that the frown of God is upon you. You have thought that your life has been useless, that it has been filled with errors and wrong moves. Dear sister, your diseased state of health leads you to this despondency and discouragement. God has not left you; His love is yet toward you. I saw that you should trust in Him as a child trusts itself in the arms of its mother. God is merciful and kind, and full of tender pity and compassion. He has not turned His face from you. \n                                                                           319",
