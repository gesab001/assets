    "word": "I saw that houses and lands would be of no use to the saints in the time of trouble, for they would then have to flee from their possessions, before infuriated mobs, and at that time they could not be disposed of to advance the cause of present truth. I was shown that it was the will of God that the saints should cut loose from every encumbrance before the time of trouble comes, and make a covenant with God by sacrifice. If they have their property on the altar, and earnestly inquire of God for duty, he will teach them when to dispose of these things. Then they will be free in the time of trouble, and have no clogs to weigh them down.",
