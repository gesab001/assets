    "word": "Every human agency connected with the Lord's work needs to appreciate the work in which he is acting a part. The work in God's institutions is to be carried on without friction, without hasty speech, without dictatorial words. The workers are to be pure, clean, and holy in thought, in word, in act. They are to be Christ's witnesses, testifying that they are born again.",
