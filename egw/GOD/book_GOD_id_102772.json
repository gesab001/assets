    "word": "Some of the supposed advantages for which the Lord's money is spent are concocted by Satan, to confuse God's people and lead them in false paths. As he succeeds in inducing the workers to leave the right track, he comes closer and closer, framing lies for their acceptance. He insinuates the thought that the gospel ministry is standing in the way of the great and grand work that might be done. Dissension, strife and disunion are the result. The work may be good in itself, but men have become exalted in regard to their own wisdom. Thus great trial is brought upon God's workers. Wearing, vexatious issues are brought about that should never come up.",
