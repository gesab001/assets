    "word": "Look at this matter in a rational light, and you will see that the building is innocent of any crime. The disgrace has been brought on it by men who have perverted their God-given powers. The building itself has done nothing wrong. The behavior of wicked men has given it a bad name. Not the building, but the men who have dishonored their Creator by a wrong use of it, should be stigmatized. They have perverted their powers by the use of strong drink--a curse that has made thousands of buildings a hell on earth.--Ms 127, 1901, pp. 2-4.
