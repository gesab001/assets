    "word": "When Jeroboam [king of ten tribes of Israel after Solomon] saw the altar rent and the ashes from it poured out on the ground, he cried out in wrath, \u201cLay hold on him.\u201d\u201cAnd his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.\u201d In alarm he said to the prophet, \u201cEntreat now the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the Lord, and the king\u2019s hand . . . became as it was before.\u201d",
