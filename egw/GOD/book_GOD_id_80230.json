    "word": "Let me tell you what I know of this heavenly guest. The Holy Spirit was brooding over the youth in the school hours; but some hearts were so cold and dark that they had no desire for the Spirit's presence, and the light of God was withdrawn. That heavenly visitant would have opened the understanding, would have given wisdom and knowledge in all lines of study, that would have been employed to the glory of God. The Lord's messenger came to convince of sin, and to soften the heart hardened by long estrangement from God. He came to reveal the great love wherewith God has loved those youth. They are God's heritage, and educators should possess the \"higher education \" before they are qualified to be instructors and guides of youth.",
