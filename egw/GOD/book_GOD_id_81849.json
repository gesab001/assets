    "word": "God wants every one to walk in the light he has given. If men do not take heed to the warning, seeds will be sown that will create disaffection and uneasiness. This influence will strengthen. No one can tell how it came; but it did come, and has entered the hearts of those who ought to be, after the light that has been given, sincere and as true as steel to principle.",
