    "word": "The commission of a known sin silences the witnessing voice of the Spirit and separates the soul from God. \"Sin is the transgression of the law.\" And \"whosoever sinneth [transgresseth the law] hath not seen him, neither known him\" (1 John 3:6). Though John in his Epistles dwells so fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to reveal the true character of that class who claim to be sanctified while living in transgression of the law of God. \"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected\" (chap. 2:4, 5).",
