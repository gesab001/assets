    "word": "Cheerfulness and Love. Dear Sister Salisbury: I have been shown your case, that you have had many things to discourage you. But do not despair; God loves you. \"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His.\" You have been doubting and have had but little hope or courage, but do not let go your hold upon God or upon the truth. Jesus lives to make intercession for you. He wants you to come back to Him with all your burdens, your perplexities, your cares. Sickness and gloom have taken from you much of the joy of life. But do not look on the dark side. Be cheerful, knowing that Jesus knows every pang of anguish which the soul suffers. He will not leave you bruised and broken. \n\n\n                                    -329-",
