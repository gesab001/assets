    "word": "The manner of Jesus in working his miracles was very different from that of his apostles. His language was that of one who possessed power in himself: \"Be thou clean.\" \"Peace, be still.\" Neither did he hesitate to accept the honor offered him on these occasions, nor seek to divert the minds of the people from himself, as though his miracles were not wrought by his own power, for his own glory. But the apostles wrought miracles only in the name of Jesus, and refused to receive the least honor to themselves. They claimed to be only instruments of that Jesus whom the Jews had crucified, but whom God had raised and elevated to his right hand. He was to receive all the honor and praise.",
