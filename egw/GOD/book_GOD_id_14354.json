    "word": "The Second Angel's Message\n[SEE APPENDIX.]\n\n\n     As the churches refused to receive the first angel's message, they rejected the light from heaven and fell from the favor of God. They trusted to their own strength, and by opposing the first message placed themselves where they could not see the light of the second angel's message. But the beloved of God, who were oppressed, accepted the message, \"Babylon is fallen,\" and left the churches. \n                                                                           238",
