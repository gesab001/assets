    "word": "Mark the features of Christ's work. He moved in the greatest simplicity. Although his followers were fishermen, he did not advise them to go first into the school of the rabbis before entering upon the work. He called his disciples from their fishers' nets, and said: \"Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.\" He called Matthew from the receipt of customs, and said, \"Follow me.\" All that they were required to do was to follow Jesus, to do as he commanded \n                                                                           137\nthem, and thus enter into his school, where God could be their teacher. As long as time shall last, we shall have need of schools. There will always be need for education; but we must be careful lest education shall absorb every spiritual interest.",
