    "word": "The voice is an entrusted talent, and it should be used to help and encourage and strengthen our fellowmen. If parents will love God and keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgement, their language will not savor of sickly sentimentalism. It will be of a sound, pure, edifying character. Whether they are at home or abroad their words will be well chosen. They will descend to no cheapness. They are bought with a price, and they are to glorify God in their body and spirit which are His. They belong to God, and their deportment is to be consistent.",
