    "word": "In the home and in the church the true missionary for God is a living exposition of truth. He eats the flesh and drinks the blood of the Son of God, and his life is moulded according to the divine similitude. He understands and assimilates the Word, saying, \"I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\" True missionary work leads those connected with it to bow before God in self-humiliation and in unfeigned gratitude to God for the past and present manifestation of his power. They hide self in Christ, praising and glorifying him as the One altogether lovely.",
