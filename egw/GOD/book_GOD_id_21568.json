    "word": "Satan is constantly seeking to deceive men, and lead them to call sin righteousness, and righteousness sin. How \n193\nsuccessful has been his work! How often censure and reproach are cast upon God's faithful servants because they will stand fearlessly in defense of the truth! Men who are but agents of Satan are praised and flattered, and even looked upon as martyrs, while those who should be respected and sustained for their fidelity to God, are left to stand alone, under suspicion and distrust.",
