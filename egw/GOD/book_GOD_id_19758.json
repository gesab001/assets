    "word": "Eli was gentle, loving, and kind, and had a true interest in the service of God and the prosperity \n84\nof his cause. He was a man who had power in prayer. He never rose up in rebellion against the words of God. But he was wanting; he did not have firmness of character to reprove sin and execute justice against the sinner, so that God could depend upon him to keep Israel pure. He did not add to his faith the courage and power to say \u201cNo\u201d at the right time and in the right place. Sin is sin; righteousness is righteousness. The trumpet note of warning must be sounded. We are living in a fearfully wicked age. The worship of God will become corrupted unless there are wide-awake men at every post of duty. It is no time now for any to be absorbed in selfish ease. Not one of the words which God has spoken must be allowed to fall to the ground.\u2014Vol. 4, p. 513.",
