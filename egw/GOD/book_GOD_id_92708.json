    "word": "I beg of you, to each one of you, humble yourselves before God. Let your brother's faults alone, Go to God and beg of Him not to show you your brother's heart but your own heart and your own wrongs; and when each one of you humbles yourself before God, let self die. There will be no trouble. You can but love one another and be united by strong cords of love and fellowship.",
