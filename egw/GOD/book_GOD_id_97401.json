    "word": "God brought Daniel into favor with the prince of the eunuchs because he behaved himself. He kept before him the fear of the Lord. His companions never saw in his life anything that would lead them astray. Those who had charge over him loved him because he carried with him the fragrance of a Christlike disposition. You may say, But I have not a good disposition. If in the past your disposition has been bad, now is the time to seek to make it good. The term is just about to commence. Begin now to obtain the victory over self. God will help you.",
