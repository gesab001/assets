    "word": "One night this week, I think it was Sunday, I did not sleep any through the entire night; and again on Wednesday I had a wakeful night. I slept for a short time before three o'clock. While I lay awake, I spent the time in prayer that God would give to His people sanctified and converted minds, that individually they might comprehend their duty, and learn to reveal the power of the truth in sound speech that cannot be condemned.",
