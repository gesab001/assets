    "word": "The Mother's First Responsibility.--The mother's influence never ceases. It is ever active, either for good or for evil; and if she would have her work abide the test of the Judgment, she must make God her trust and labor with an eye single to His glory. Her first duty is to her children, to so mold their characters that they may be happy in this life and secure the future, immortal life. She should not be influenced by what Mrs. So-and-So does, nor by the remarks of Mrs. A. or B. in reference to her being so odd, so different from other people in her dress or in the arrangement of her house for comfort rather than display or in the management of her children.",
