    "word": "Human love is weak and changeable, but God's love is full and deep and unchangeable. Why then are our souls not aglow as we contemplate this love? Why do we close our eyes to it? God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, will shine into the hearts of all who believe, to give the light of the knowledge of His glory in the face of Jesus Christ. \"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\" Oh, what amazing love. Language cannot measure it. It is without a parallel. \"He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\"",
