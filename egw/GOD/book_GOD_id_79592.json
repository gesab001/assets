    "word": "I am instructed to tell the people of God that, while there is so much dissension among them, they cannot be in harmony with Christ. \"Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\" Revelation 3:2, 3.",
