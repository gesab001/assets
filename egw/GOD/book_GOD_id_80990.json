    "word": "I am sorry that Eld. Smith, who has been considered so mild, so kind, and so tender that he shrank from reproving wrongs in the office, or performing his duty in the church and in his own family, is for some unexplainable reason found on the side of the accuser. I can but think that this is due to some influence which has blinded his eyes and confused his senses. I cannot say to Bro. Smith, God speed you in this work, for it is wrong. He must meet its results hereafter. His position of trust and his long experience, render him more accountable for this state of things than any other one in the church. Had he been right, he could have prevented the disgrace and the sin.",
