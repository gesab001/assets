    "word": "There is something to come out from. You cannot mix or mingle with the world and at the same time be united with Jesus Christ. \"Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\" James 4:4. \"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.\" John 15:18-20.",
