    "word": "A little has been done in Washington, and in other cities of the South and East; but in order to meet the mind of the Lord we shall have to plan for the carrying forward of a far-reaching and systematic work. We must enter into this work with a perseverance that will not allow of any slacking of our efforts until we shall see of the salvation of our God. This will give us confidence to continue the work in still other places.",
