And say, Thus saith the \n\n64. \n\nLord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the Lord.",
