    "word": "The Lord has sent a message to arouse his people to repent, and do their first works; but how has his message been received? While some have heeded it, others have cast contempt and reproach on the message and the messenger. Spirituality deadened, humility and childlike simplicity gone, a mechanical, formal profession of faith has taken the place of love and devotion. Is this mournful condition of things to continue? is the lamp of God's love to go out in darkness? The Saviour calls; listen to his voice: \"Be zealous and repent.\" Repent, confess your sins, and you will be forgiven. \"Turn ye, turn ye; for why will ye die?\" Why will you try to rekindle a mere fitful fire, and walk in the sparks of your own kindling?",
