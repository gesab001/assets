    "word": "Leader Must Have Courage To Do Battle--God calls upon the individual members of the churches in these two Conferences to arouse and be converted.  Brethren, your worldliness, your distrust, your murmurings, have placed you in such a position that it will be exceedingly difficult for any one to labor among you.  While your president neglected his work and failed in his duty, your attitude was not such as to give him any encouragement.  The one in authority should have acquitted himself as a man of God, reproving, exhorting, encouraging, as the case demanded, whether you would receive or reject his testimony.  But he was easily discouraged, and left you without the help that a faithful minister of Christ should have given.  He failed in not keeping up with the opening providence of God, and in not showing you your duty and educating you up to the demands of the time; but the minister's neglect should not dishearten you, and lead you to excuse yourselves for neglecting duty.  There is the more need of energy and fidelity on your part.--Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 281.",
