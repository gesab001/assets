    "word": "The fashion of the world, the desire of the eye, and the lust of the flesh or vain glory, are connected with the fall of the unfortunate. That which is pleasing to the natural heart and carnal mind is cherished. If the lust of the flesh had been rooted out of their hearts, they would not be so weak. If our sisters would feel the necessity of purifying their thoughts, and never suffer themselves to be careless in their deportment, which leads to improper acts, they need not stain in the least their purity. They would, if they view the 'matter as God has presented it to me, bear such an abhorrence to impure acts and deeds that they would not be found among the number who had fallen through the temptations of Satan, no matter who the medium might be whom Satan should select.",
