    "word": "Angels of God are watching the development of character, and are weighing moral worth. If you bestow your attention upon those who have no need, you are doing harm to the recipients, and you will yourself receive condemnation rather than reward. Remember that when, by your trifling conversation, you descend to the level of frivolous characters, you are encouraging them in the path that leads to perdition. Your unwise attentions may prove the ruin of their souls. You degrade their conceptions of what constitutes Christian life and character; you confuse their ideas, and make impressions that may never be effaced. They can not harmonize your course with the position you occupy, and they come to look upon even the officers of the church, and the ministers, as no better than themselves. Then where is their example? The harm thus done to souls that need to be strengthened, refined, and ennobled, is often a sin unto death.",
