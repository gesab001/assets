    "word": "Ministers of the gospel, Satan is watching for your souls. Some will fall suddenly who have long been tested and tried, but who are unprepared to close up their earthly account with joy. Let our ministering brethren keep their souls guardedly. Those who claim to be children of God should keep the heart with all diligence, guarding every point of attack, lest Satan take us unawares. Temptations will come to every soul. \n     [Hebrews 3:5-8, 12-14, quoted.]--Letter 46, 1909 \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. April 14, 1988. Entire Letter.",
