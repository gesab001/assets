    "word": "The faith in Christ that saves the soul is not what it is represented to be by many. \"Believe, believe,\" is their cry; \"only believe in Christ, and you will be saved. It is all you have to do.\" While true faith trusts wholly in Christ for salvation, it will lead to perfect conformity to the law of God. Faith is manifested by works. And the apostle John declares, \"He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\" (1 John 2:4).",
