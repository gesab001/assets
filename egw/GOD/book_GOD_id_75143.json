    "word": "Wherever you may labor, there is need that you \n\n                     - 49 - \n\nblend your efforts with those of other efficient laborers. You are not a complete whole; you cannot successfully complete a series of meetings by yourself, but you can do your part with other laborers. This may be humiliating to you; but it should not be, for God has given a variety of gifts, and he desires that these gifts blend in perfect harmony.",
