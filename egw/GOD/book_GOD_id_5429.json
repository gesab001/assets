    "word": "The Wrong Direction--Brethren, do not depend on the President of your Conference or the President of the General Conference to think for you.  God has given \"to every man his work.\" When men look to the President of the Conference as their helper in all their difficulties, the bearer of their burdens, the counselor in their perplexities, they are doing the very opposite of that which Christ told them to do.--Manuscript 11, 1883, p. 1.",
