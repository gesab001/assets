    "word": "It is not merely the profane swearer, the murderer, the adulterer, the liar, the deceiver, who must feel the wrath of God because of disobedience and neglect of this great salvation, first spoken by Christ and afterwards confirmed by His disciples. Those who have enlightened minds and consciences and who have a full knowledge of the truth and the requirements of God, yet continue to live in a state of indifference and spiritual sloth, are virtually neglecting this great salvation and cannot expect to escape the penalty of this neglect. The example to others is such that they hinder them and sanction in them the same neglect they are guilty of themselves.",
