    "word": "The work of God is a great work. Wise men are needed to keep Bible principles free from a particle of worldly policy. Every worker is being tested. Paul speaks of those who bring to the foundation wood, hay, and stubble. This represents those who bring in as truth that which is not truth, even their own suppositions and fabrications. If these souls are saved it will be as by fire, because they conscientiously thought they were working in harmony with the Word. They will only be as brands snatched out of the burning.",
