    "word": "When men close their eyes to the light that God sends them, they will reject the most evident truth, and believe the most foolish errors. It is Satan that leads men to take false positions. Well might we ask, as did Paul in his day concerning brethren who had turned away from sound doctrine, \"Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth?\" Those \n                                                                           417\nwho claim to be children of God, are, in their ignorance, working against Him, rebelling against His providence, opposing His plans, and refusing to do the work that He has placed upon them. Instead of doing their duty, they strive to bring everything into harmony with their own narrow views. Instead of bringing their will into subjection to God, that His purpose may be accomplished, they choose their own rebellious ways, and will not yield to His guidance.",
