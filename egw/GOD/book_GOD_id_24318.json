    "word": "The exhortation of the apostle is, \u201cCleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.\u201d It is by engaging in this work, and by exercising living faith in God, that we are to perfect Christian character. The work of cleansing the soul-temple and preparing for Christ's appearing must be done while we are in this world of temptation. Just as Christ finds us in character when he comes, so we shall remain.",
