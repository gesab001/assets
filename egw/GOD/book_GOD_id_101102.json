    "word": "Oh what a triumph Satan would have if you should fail or be discouraged! Talk light. Talk hope. Do not feel that you are compelled to bear any man's sins. Christ is the sin bearer. Every soul is His property. You grieve the Spirit of God when you find fault and fret. It hurts your soul, and grieves away the Spirit of Christ.",
