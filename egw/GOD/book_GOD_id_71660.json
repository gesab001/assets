    "word": "What is genuine sanctification? Read Exodus 31. In that chapter we shall understand the term, for God Himself has defined it. The Lord Jesus had given the special directions how to build the tabernacle. As the children of Israel had been compelled to work on the Sabbath, the sacredness of the day was not preserved. As slaves in Egypt, they had largely lost the knowledge of the Sabbath. This is the reason the commandments of God were given in awful grandeur upon Mount Sinai. The Lord would guard His Sabbath in particular, and He knew the people would forget the commandment of the Sabbath, and in their zeal the workmen would say, \"This work is the Lord's, and under His supervision, and we can do His work without observing the Sabbath. . . .\" Therefore the seventh day was distinguished as God's memorial and was to be kept holy unto the Lord that the people \"may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify\" them. This is genuine sanctification. . . .",
