    "word": "Can we afford to say, My father did not keep the commandments, and I think he was right? Well, if your father lived today, and he was a Christian living according to every ray of light, when the light came that the law of God was being transgressed, he would on his knees inquire, is this so? and then he would have said, \"Children, we have made a decided mistake. We have been keeping an institution that has not a single syllable for its sanctity in the Word of God. I am sorry that I have not been a man of the Bible before. I am sorry that I have not seen the precious light of truth. Now it has come to me and I am responsible for it, I do not want to be found a lawbreaker but a subject of the King. I want to hear Him say to me, 'Sit ye on my right hand.' 'Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the city.'\" (See Revelation 22:14.)",
