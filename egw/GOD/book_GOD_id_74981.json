    "word": "Mingling of Believers With Unbelievers.\n\n     Let not God's people in any of our institutions sign a truce with the enemy of God and man. The duty of the church to the world is not to come down to their ideas, and accept their opinions, their suggestions, but to heed the words of Christ through his servant Paul, \"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\" This means in, a special sense, marriage with unbelievers, but it covers more ground than this: it means in our instrumentalities ordained of God, in our institutions for health, in our colleges, in our publishing houses. The matter is placed before us in the correct light. The question is asked, \"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing.\" What does this mean?--The suggestions, the evil workings in the children of disobedience. You are not in any case to become contaminated with the spirit or influence of unbelievers. Be afraid of uniting or binding up in bundles with them. Be afraid of communicating the works connected with the Lord's cause, to \n\n\n                       - 11 - \n\nthose who have no part with God, or sympathy with those who love the truth of God. \"And I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\"",
