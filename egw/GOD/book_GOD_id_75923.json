    "word": "Wake up, my brethren and sisters. We have no time to spend in wringing our hands and in mourning that the Sanitarium has been destroyed. A wider outlook has been given us. Let us inquire of the Lord his mind and will. Will not the managers of the institution make thorough self-examination? Attempt after attempt has been made to burn the Sanitarium. Do not these things speak to the managers, telling them to look back at the way in which they have carried out their plans? Again and again reproof has come to them from God, but these messages have not led them to take heed. Message after message has been sent that plants shall be made in many places. A most solemn review should now be made. God has been speaking, sometimes by unacknowledged mercies, oftentimes by threatened judgments. By blessings bestowed and blessings removed he has sought to bring about the needed change of action. Well may he say, \"What could have been done more in my vineyard that I have not done in it?\" Shall the word be spoken, \"Ye would none of my counsel, ye despised all my reproofs. Ye would not come unto me that ye might have life\"? \n                              Ellen G. White. \n                                                                           11",
