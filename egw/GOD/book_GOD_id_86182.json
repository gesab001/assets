    "word": "I have much more to say to you, but have not the time, being pressed with many things. I have written plainly in regard to Dr. Caro, lest, when in a strait place for help, you might link up with one who is not fitted to build up, in the Lord's way and according to His methods, an institution that is to stand as a memorial for the truth. The Lord designs that all His institutions--sanitariums, publishing-houses, and schools--shall be a means of preparing a people to stand in the day of God. We have a decided evangelistic work to do in the cities, and we must not tie our hands, so that we can not do this work. We are to have faith in God. We are not to link up with men who would put self in front and all else in the background.",
