    "word": "PRAYER A NECESSITY TO DANIEL.\u2014Daniel was subjected to the severest temptations that can assail the youth of today; yet he was\n20\ntrue to the religious instruction received in early life. He was surrounded with influences calculated to subvert those who would vacillate between principle and inclination; yet the word of God presents him as a faultless character. Daniel dared not trust to his own moral power. Prayer was to him a necessity. He made God his strength, and the fear of God was continually before him in all the transactions of his life.\u2014(Fundamentals of Christian Education, 78.)",
