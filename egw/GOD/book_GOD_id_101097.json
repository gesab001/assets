    "word": "I greatly desire that you shall heed the words of God. You put your whole soul into whatever you take hold of, and if you think your brethren are remiss in their interest and duty, you afflict your soul. Your interest is identified with a grand and noble work, and you think that every one who claims to believe the truth should feel as deeply as you, and work in your lines. You feel that many err in not manifesting an interest in the things which you see are of such great importance. There may be many who are deficient, but do not judge them.",
