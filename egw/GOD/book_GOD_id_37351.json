    "word": "The way to measure the effectiveness of your preaching is through visiting with families to whom you preached.--How are you to know that the word spoken in the desk has been a savor of life unto life unless you visit in families, praying with them, and drawing out the true state of their minds, the real condition of their experience, that you may point them to the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world?

The churches need to be enlightened in regard to practical religion in the home life.--Address to Ministers (Ph 118) 17.",
