I ask God to forgive me for this careless neglect \n\n\n                                     -435- \n\non my part, waiting for my brethren to do a work which God has given me. I have had no evidence that He has laid the burden upon them. These matters I have trusted would be impressed in their relative importance upon their minds, and it would not need any particular urging from my pen, or from my voice, to have it stand where God designed it should, but if the burden has been given me, if the matter has been presented to me in its sacred, solemn importance to present a light appropriate to do a work for this very time, I must see that it stands in its proper place, and I must not cast down the burden at the feet of my brethren, as though they would understand and appreciate these things as I have felt them and their importance as God has made me to feel them.",
