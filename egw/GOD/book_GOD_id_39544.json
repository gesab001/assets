    "word": "PRAY DAILY FOR THE BLESSING THE SABBATH BRINGS.\u2014All who regard the Sabbath as a sign between them and God, showing that He is the God who sanctifies them, will represent the principles of His government. They will bring into daily practice the laws of His kingdom. Daily it will be their prayer that the sanctification of the Sabbath may rest upon them. Every day they will have the companionship of Christ and will exemplify the perfection of His character. Every day their light will shine forth to others in good works.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, 353.)",
