    "word": "Remember that in working with Christ as your personal Saviour lies your strength and your victory. This is the part all are to act. Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. He declares: \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" John 15:5. And the repentant, believing soul responds: I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\" Philippians 4:13. To those who do this comes the assurance: As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\" John 1:12.",
