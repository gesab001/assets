    "word": "You must not think that theory is evidence of your acceptance with God. Your assurance is the word of God. Believe that the Lord identifies His interest with suffering humanity, that He knows your burdens, and will lift with you if you will only trust Him. He cannot yoke up with you while you fret and complain against your brethren. But you will be victor if you take Christ as your companion, and live and speak as if you were directly in the presence of the divine intelligences.",
