    "word": "It is a very poor policy for men to seek to improve on God's plan, and invent a makeshift, averaging up their good impulses in this and that instance, and offsetting them against all that is required of God. God calls upon you to give every jot of influence to his own arrangement and ordinances. We are to strike true and faithful figures in tithing and then say to the Lord, I have done as thou hast commanded me. If you will honor me by trusting me with thy goods to trade upon, I will be thy faithful steward, doing all in my power to bring meat to thy house, and I will seek to instruct others how to work in the same lines.",
