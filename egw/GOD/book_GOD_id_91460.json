    "word": "I was pointed back many months ago and saw a heavy mist come over him which increased to a black cloud. His situation was represented to me as being fearful, dreadful. He has given way to his own passions until they have obtained the victory and he is bound by the strong foe. Said the angel, as he pointed to Sardis, \"Dishonesty, deception, covetousness, and vileness.\" He has long been a reproach to God's cause. These things have cursed the church until God is waiting to free them. If Sardis will even now make thorough work, humbly confess his wicked course, submit to the judgment and will of his father, the Lord will have mercy and pity him. Unless he sees his wrong and makes thorough work, he will surely lose everlasting life and be separated from his people forever. In this age the child takes the place of the father, and in order to have peace the parents take the place of the child, and this is reversing the order in which God has placed these things. Children have no just sense of the respect and regard due their parents who have suffered so much care and anxiety for them. These things cause the frown of God to rest upon the church, and there must be a reform in order to remove the frown of God from His people.",
