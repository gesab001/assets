    "word": "7-12 (see EGW on Matthew 7:21-23; Revelation 14:9-12;  17:1-5). Satan's Miracles \"Right in your Sight.\"--The time is coming when Satan will work miracles right in your sight, claiming that he is Christ; and if your feet are not firmly established upon the truth of God, then you will be led away from your foundation. The only safety for you is to search for truth as for hid treasures. Dig for the truth as you would for treasures in the earth, and present the word of God, the Bible, before your Heavenly Father and say, Enlighten me; teach me what is truth. . . . You should store the mind with the word of God; for you may be separated, and placed where you will not have the privilege of meeting with the children of God (RH April 3, 1888).",
