    "word": "\"Elmshaven\" Sanitarium, July 6, 1902 \nTo The General Conference Committee and the Medical Missionary Board: \n\nDear Brethren: \n\n\n     Over and over again instruction has been given me that all must be done that can be done to draw our people away from Battle Creek. I was shown that the Sanitarium there was deteriorating for the want of men of capability and consecration to carry it forward in pure, upward lines, in accordance with Bible principles. Very clearly it has been presented to me that it would be in God's order for the work of the Battle Creek Sanitarium to be divided, and plants made in many other places, in the cities that are in need of sanitariums. More true medical missionary work would then be done; and from many centers the light of truth would shine forth with saving power.",
