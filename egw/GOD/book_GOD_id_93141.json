    "word": "How to Deal With Temptation. As God's chosen ministers assemble for council, those who have been living tried and tempted lives will be tempted to give expression to their feelings. They have been severely tried; difficulties have arisen before them as they try to advance. But if they keep Christ enthroned in the heart, ever looking to Him who has bought them with a price, they will not give expression to sentiments that would leave upon the minds of their brethren a disagreeable impression of unChristlikeness. They will discern spiritual things. They will follow Christ's way of managing difficulties, remembering that He is the Finisher of their faith as well as the Author of their faith. They will remember that if they wear Christ's yoke, they must do as He did. They will leave in God's hands the things to be done and the things to be suffered, remembering that they are not under the control of self, but \n\n\n                                 -170- \n\nthat they have given themselves up to be laborers together with Christ, forming characters for eternal life, and that they are to learn from Him the way to overcome evil with good in all that they are called upon to suffer. We have a heaven to win, and precious victories to gain.",
