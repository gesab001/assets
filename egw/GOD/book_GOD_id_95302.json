    "word": "My brethren, I write these things to you because they are truth, and you all need them. All faultfinding, all criticizing, all envy, jealousy, and evil-surmising, must be put away with all evil-speaking. You are to prepare the highways of the Lord. You are to strive to be one with Christ in God. \n\n\n                                     -50- \n\nThen there will be given to the world an evidence of the great goodness of God in sending His Son to die for men. True, genuine love will be expressed, for Christ is abiding in the heart. Then your prayers will be offered in the spirit and power of God, and God will be revealed. Where you are now standing, in disunion, the atmosphere about your souls is of Satan's creating. It is his own breath. Obey the Word, and love as brethren, and God will bind you together with the great love wherewith He loved His Son. This is the love you each are to express to the world.--Letter 40, 1899. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nMay 10, 1990. Entire Letter.",
