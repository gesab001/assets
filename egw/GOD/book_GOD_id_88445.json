    "word": "MR No. 830 - Work of Angels\n\n     If the youth come to school determined to obtain instruction that will fit them for the higher grade, ministering angels will attend them at every step. The still, small voice is speaking to them, saying, \"This is the way, walk ye in it.\" They must so conduct themselves that they will be susceptible to the influences of the Holy Spirit. Angels in the appearance of men will walk by the side of the student who will submit his will to God's will.",
