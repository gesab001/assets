    "word": "There is one blessing all may have who seek for it in the right way. It is the Holy Spirit of God; and this is a blessing that brings all others in its train. If we will come to God as little children, asking for His grace and power and salvation, not for our own uplifting, but that we may bring blessing to those around us, our petitions will not be denied. Then let us \n\n\n                              -603- \n\nstudy the Word of God that we may know how to take hold of His promises, and claim them as our own. Then we shall be happy. The enemy will be unable to destroy our peace. As we come into right relation to God, we shall see of His salvation.",
