    "word": "I testify to you today that the most precious work that God has given me to do is the opening of new fields, where people have never heard the truth. Every time I see a human being out of the fold, I think of the heaven above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. It was He who wrought out our salvation for us, and at what a cost! No language is of sufficient force to describe that cost. We might dwell upon this theme from now until the close of time, and still we should fall short of an understanding of it.",
