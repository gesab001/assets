    "word": "When men think that they can decide who has accomplished the most good, and treat God's workers accordingly, they often make serious mistakes. The man who is humble, and does his work as unto God and not to man, may not make as great a show as the man who is full of bustle and show; but his work counts for more. Often the one who makes a great parade calls attention to himself, interposing himself between the people and God, and his work proves a dead failure.",
