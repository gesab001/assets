    "word": "If I had a vision in meeting many would say that it was excitement, and that some one mesmerized me. Then I would go away alone in the woods, \n7\nwhere no eye could see, or ear hear but God's, and pray to him, and he would sometimes give me a vision there. I then rejoiced, and told them what God had revealed to me alone, where no mortal could influence me. But I was told by some that I mesmerized myself. O, thought I, has it come to this that those who honestly go to God alone to plead his promises, and to claim his salvation, are to be charged with being under the foul and soul-damning influence of mesmerism? Do we ask our kind Father in Heaven for \u201cbread,\u201d only to receive a \u201cstone,\u201d or a \u201cscorpion?\u201d These things wounded my spirit, and wrung my soul in keen anguish, well nigh to despair, while many would have me believe that there was no Holy Ghost, and that all the exercises that holy men of God have experienced were only mesmerism, or the deceptions of Satan.",
