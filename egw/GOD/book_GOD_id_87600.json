    "word": "Take Back Your Forbiddings \n     I am bidden to say to conference presidents: Do not interpose yourselves between God and His servants. Break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free. Do not take upon yourselves the responsibility of permitting or forbidding. This is not a time to turn from the living and true God to be taught of men. You who feel that you are empowered to tell God's messengers where and how they shall labor, Take back your forbiddings. You know not but Satan is using your controlling power to cut off the light from some soul to whom God would have it come.--Manuscript 117, 1907, p. 3.",
