    "word": "The words of Christ should ever be borne in mind: \"As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank.\" Appetite bears sway over mind and conscience in this age. Gluttony, winebibbing, liquor drinking, tobacco using prevail; but Christ's followers will be temperate in eating and drinking. They will not indulge appetite at the expense of health and spiritual growth. \"They married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.\" We see the same manifestation now in regard to marriage. Youth, and even men and women who ought to be wise and discerning, act as if bewitched upon this question. A Satanic power seems to take possession of them. The most indiscreet marriages are formed. God is not consulted. Human feelings, desires, and passions bear down everything before them, until the die is cast. Untold misery is the result of this state of things; and God is dishonored. The marriage \n\n\n                    -23- \n\nvow covers every kind of lustful abomination. Shall there not be a decided change in reference to this matter?",
