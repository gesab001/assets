    "word": "And while God's people are justified in a lawful manner to secure church property, they should be careful to maintain their peculiar and holy character. I saw that unconsecrated persons would take advantage of the position the church have recently taken, and will overstep the bounds, carry matters to extremes, and wound the cause of God. Some will move without wisdom or judgment, and engage in lawsuits that might be avoided, mingle with the world, partake of their spirit, and influence others to follow their example. One professed Christian who moves unadvisedly, does much harm to the cause of present truth. Evil takes root much more readily than good, and flourishes when good and right languish, unless they  are carefully nourished.",
