    "word": "\u201cThe importance of the Sabbath as the memorial of creation is that it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to God\u201d\u2014because He is the Creator, and we are His creatures. \u201cThe Sabbath therefore lies at the very foundation of divine worship, for it teaches this great truth in the most impressive manner, and no other institution does this. The true ground of divine worship, not of that on the seventh day merely, but of all worship, is found in the distinction between the Creator and His creatures. This great fact can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.\u201d\u2014J. N. Andrews, History of the Sabbath, chap. 27.",
