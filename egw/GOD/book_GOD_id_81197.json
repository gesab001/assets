    "word": "And let not the poor feel that there is nothing that they can do, because they have not the wealth of their brethren. They can sacrifice in many ways. They can deny self. They can live devotedly. And in their words and acts they can honor their Redeemer. The sisters, especially, can exert a strong influence, if they will cease their gossiping, and devote their time to watchfulness and prayer. They can honor God. They can let their light so shine, that others by seeing their good works will be led to glorify our Father which is in Heaven.",
