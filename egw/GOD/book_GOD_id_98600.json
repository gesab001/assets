    "word": "God has given His Son as a sacrifice to save all who will be saved in His appointed way, through obedience to all His commandments. After having begun to save man, having evidenced His purpose by delivering His people by His own strong hand, having invited all to lay hold of His own outstretched arm, He will use all the heavenly resources to consummate man's salvation. His people will magnify His name by exercising implicit faith in Him and placing their entire dependence upon Him. He will fulfill every promise. \"And I will strengthen them in the Lord; and \n\n\n                      -331- \n\nthey shall walk up and down in His name, saith the Lord\" [Zechariah 10:12].",
