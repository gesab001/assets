    "word": "There are many souls being rescued, wrenched from Satan's hand, by faithful workers. Some one must have a burden of soul to find those who have been lost to Christ; and one soul redeemed over whom Satan has triumphed, causes joy among the heavenly angels. There are those who have destroyed the moral image of God in themselves. The gospel-net must gather in these poor outcasts. Angels of God will cooperate with those who are engaged in this work, who make every effort to save perishing souls, to give them opportunities which many never have had. There is no other way to reach them but in Christ's way. He ever worked to relieve suffering and to teach righteousness. Only thus can they be taken from the depths of hell.",
