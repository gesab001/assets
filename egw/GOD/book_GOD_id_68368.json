    "word": "The talents God has entrusted will call for proportionate returns. God accepts \"according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not\" (2 Corinthians 8:12). He does not expect from the man who has only one talent that which He expects from him who has five. If the wealthy choose to gratify every selfish desire, to enjoy the good things of this life, they will be judged accordingly. They refuse to honor Christ by humble obedience, to lift His cross. They live to please and gratify self, and thus dishonor God; and He declares, \"Them that honour me I will honour\" (1 Samuel 2:30). . . .",
