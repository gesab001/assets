    "word": "Since the Lord Jesus employs every means to convert the sinner and save the soul rather than to ruin or destroy, would it not be well for those who claim to have light and knowledge to follow the example of Christ? Are we in partnership with Jesus? Our course of action will determine whether we are following in Christ's lines or following the imagination of our own heart. What are we before God? We are those who have received the grace of Christ, and by His grace we are what we are. Then let us glorify God in our weakness, having a sense of our inefficiency.",
