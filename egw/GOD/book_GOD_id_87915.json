    "word": "Those who have a leading influence in the institutions should be men and women who possess devotion and piety, who are not narrow and selfish in any matter, but conscientious, self-denying, and self-sacrificing, ever dealing with the workers as they would wish to be dealt with, having an eye single to the glory of God. Men of such a character will keep the way of the Lord. The workers should seek to make it as easy as possible for those who bear the burden of responsibility, and have many cares and perplexities to engage their attention. All need to have right principles placed before them in a judicious manner. Men of investigative minds will thus receive the key of knowledge, and will bring out treasures of thought for the enriching of other minds--thought that will result in the saving of souls. Circumstances will call forth words and decisions in favor of the right, and many will thus be swayed to the right direction. Words and works flowing from the heart imbued with the love and fear of God become a widespread blessing--a blessing that is carried into the highways and byways of life. . . .",
