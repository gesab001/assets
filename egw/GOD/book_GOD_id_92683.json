    "word": "A converted Jew spoke well. This Jew was attending the theological college in Basel. He came to our Swiss conference and seemed to be interested. He understands Hebrew. He was desirous that our people should give him employment, but as long as he did not esteem the truth of that value to step out upon it from real conviction of duty, we felt he should not be hired to obey the truth. If the truth was not of that value to him that he could make any and every sacrifice for the truth's sake--moving from principle and not be bribed or bought--the work is between God and his own soul.",
