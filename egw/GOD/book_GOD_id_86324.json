    "word": "There are those who have had great light, who are far from God, who in heart are apostates. If they do not meet a higher standard, if they do not take their stand for Christ, if they pursue in the future the course they have pursued in the past, and neglect to search the Scriptures, neglect to pray, refuse to humble their hearts, to deny self and lift the cross, fail to obey the injunctions of the Scriptures, there will be portioned to them an experience of grief and shame. \"Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" The harvest is sure.
