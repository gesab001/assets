    "word": "When Christ made His first advent the same unbelief was manifested, and it has always been the same--that unbelief rejects the very truth that is necessary to their salvation. Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. We must encourage faith and abandon unbelief, for it is a barrier to our spiritual prosperity. We must listen to the message of the third angel. This message is now due and it presents to us a present truth. Therefore we must search the Scriptures and lay aside our opinion, and be governed by the teachings of the Bible. We need to seek God in prayer that we may not be deceived, for it is a matter of great consequence that we take hold of truth.",
