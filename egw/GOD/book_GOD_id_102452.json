    "word": "\"Wherefore it is contained in the Scripture, behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.\" Mark the figure represented in verse five: \"Ye also as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.\" Then these lively stones are exerting a tangible, practical influence in the Lord's spiritual house.
