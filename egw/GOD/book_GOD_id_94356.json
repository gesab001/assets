    "word": "The Lord accepted Samuel from his very childhood because his heart was pure, and he had reverence for God. He was given to God, a consecrated offering, and the Lord made him, even in his childhood, a channel of light. A life consecrated as was Samuel's is of great value in God's sight. If the youth of today will consecrate themselves as did Samuel, the Lord will accept them and use them in His work. Of their life they may be able to say with the psalmist, \"O Lord, Thou hast taught me from my youth, and hitherto have I declared Thy wondrous works.\"",
