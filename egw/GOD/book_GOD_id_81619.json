The children in these things were not as much to blame as their parents. And Bro. Bell should not have been so very sensitive over the errors of his pupils, even if he knew their parents did credit all they repeated to them. He should have considered that all that parents or scholars might say of him did not affect his character in the sight of God. But that which they had said to his injury did affect seriously their characters in the sight of our Heavenly Father. It was more in accordance with the feelings of their unsanctified hearts to judge another's conscience, and to pick flaws at his supposed faults. This produced less pain, less self-humiliation, than to closely examine their own hearts, and with just, discerning eyes see their own faults, and pronounce judgment against themselves.",
