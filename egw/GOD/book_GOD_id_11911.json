    "word": "Again, there are brought into our periodicals selections which can be found in other papers and books, and which need not be repeated. It costs money to issue these matters that have no bearing on the times or the spiritual interests of our people. The long accounts of the war can be obtained in any political or daily paper. It is not the business of the householder, whom God has appointed, to bring before the people subjects that may be found in the publications of the world, and the less these things are brought into our religious papers, and the more space given to that class of matter which is spiritual food,-- in living experience, in Bible studies, in plain, simple, earnest appeals,--the better will it be for the spiritual good and advancement of the work.-Manuscript 95, 1898.",
