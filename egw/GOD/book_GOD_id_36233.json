    "word": "Christ is the greatest of all physicians. He is a physician of the soul as well as of the body. Had He not come to this world to redeem us from Satan's hellish power, we would have had no hope of gaining eternal life. . . . Let us not point minds to erring human beings. Let us say, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29.",
