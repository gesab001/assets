    "word": "Some have failed on this point. God has blessed them with ability to do acceptable service, but they have failed to learn lessons of economy, of self-denial, and of walking humbly with God. Their demands for high wages were granted, and they became extravagant in the use of means, they lost the influence for good they should have had, and the prospering hand of God was not with them. . . . Beware of placing too great confidence in those who demand high wages before they will engage in the Lord's work. I write you this as a caution. Letter 330, 1906, pp. 1, 2. (To Elder S. N. Cobb, October 23, 1906.)",
