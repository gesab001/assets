    "word": "Some who profess to have true religion sadly neglect the Guidebook given by God to point the way to heaven. They may read the Bible, but merely reading God's Word, as one would read words traced by a human pen, will give only a superficial knowledge. Talking of the truth will not sanctify the receivers. They may profess to be working for God, when, were Christ among them, His voice would be heard, saying, \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God\" (Matthew 22:29). Such cannot know what true religion means.",
