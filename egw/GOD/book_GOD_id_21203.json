    "word": "Let us bear in mind that Jesus is in our midst. Then an elevating, controlling influence from the Spirit of God will pervade the assembly. There will be manifested that wisdom which is \"from above,\" which is \"first pure, then peaceable, . . .full of mercy and good fruits,\" [James 3:17.] which cannot err. In all the plans and decisions there will be that charity that \"seeketh not her own;\" that is \"not easily provoked;\" that \"thinketh no evil;\" that \"rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;\" that \"beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.\" [1 Corinthians 13:5-7.] \n\n                                               -",
