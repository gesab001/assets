    "word": "There are many who cry, \"Believe, only believe.\" Ask them what you are to believe. Are you to believe the lies forged by Satan against God's holy, just, and good law? God does not use His great and precious grace to make of none effect His law, but to establish His law. What is the decision of Paul? He says: \"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law. . . . For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and [the commandment then ended?--No.] I [Paul] died. . . . Wherefore the law is [standing directly in the way of my having liberty and peace?--No.] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Romans 7:7-12).",
