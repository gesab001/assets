I was first shown the case of Brother Hungerford--that he was far from God. He realized but little what it was to be a true Christian, a follower of Christ. I saw that religion did not consist in making a noise, but that Brother Hungerford was in the habit of going into meeting and praying long and loud, and after the meeting closed, his heat and excitement were gone, and then he was light and trifling. He seemed to have no foundation, no heartwork--did not show the fruits of a Christian. His conduct out of meeting was such as God abhors. He was too familiar with the sisters, his life was not at all in accordance with his profession, and every day he gave his profession the lie.",
