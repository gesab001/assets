First part missing.) \n\n\n     . . . stood one feeble man as authority for everything. He has not undertaken to bring the people up and to perfect every man in Christ Jesus. The ideas he has had upon these things have not been according to the light God has given me, and yet Elder Matteson has accomplished a large work. The error was in sending him alone at the beginning. There should have been several to unite in the work. Oh, that God would help His people with proper understanding to broaden, to extend! Oh, that Heaven's light may shine forth upon the responsible men and upon those who go forth to labor! We can work successfully only through God.",
