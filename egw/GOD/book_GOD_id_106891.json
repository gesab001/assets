    "word": "God does not require his servants all to work in precisely the same way. Each worker should thank God that he has a part in the Lord's vineyard, and each should believe that the Lord is leading his brother workers as verily as he believes that the Lord is leading him. The words of Christ, \"All ye are brethren,\" should ever be kept in mind. The spirit that leads workers to measure themselves among themselves, and to estimate the value of the workers according to human judgment, is not the spirit of Christ.",
