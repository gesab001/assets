    "word": "I have been called to hear the loud voices in the determination of decisions against one and another who are chosen of God and precious. Some things in these persons did not please the men in authority, and their case was not dealt with according to the law of God, in kindness, but according to human prejudices. Also, much of this work has been done by men who have not the Spirit of God, but are really agents through whom Satan can perform his work.--Letter 15, 1895. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. July 9, 1987. Entire Letter.",
