    "word": "We cannot bear the thought that the King of glory, the mighty Counselor shall have come to our world and died for us in vain. We want to accept the great gift, and to be laborers together with God in obeying the principles of His Word. Let us live a life of simplicity. We are not living for the world. We are not seeking its flattery or its compliments. There is a world to save. Christ has done all that He can do for its salvation, and He desires us to do what we can do to raise up churches for Him in new places.",
