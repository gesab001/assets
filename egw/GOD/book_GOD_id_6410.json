    "word": "As Long as Probation Lasts.--As long as probation continues, there will be opportunity for the canvasser to work. When the religious denominations unite with the papacy to oppress God's people, places where there is religious freedom will be opened by evangelistic canvassing. If in one place the persecution becomes severe, let the workers do as Christ has directed. \"When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\" If persecution comes there, go to still another place. God will lead His people, making them a blessing in many places. Were it not for persecution they would not be so widely scattered abroad to proclaim the truth. And Christ declares: \"Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.\" Matthew 10:23. Until in heaven is spoken the word, \"It is finished,\" there will always be places for labor, and hearts to receive the message.--Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 478. (1900)",
