    "word": "James White Doing the Work of Three Men--Your father and mother are worked down. I am looking old and poor for the very reason that there is no rest for us. We work hard. Your father does the work of three men at all these meetings. I never saw a man work so energetically, so constantly as your father. God does give him more than mortal energy. If there is any place that is hard, your father takes it. We pray God that we may have strength to do the work necessary to be done in these special occasions.--Letter 39, 1876, pp. 1,2. (To W. C. White, August 17, 1876.)",
