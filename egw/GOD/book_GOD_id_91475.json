    "word": "After the discourse we had a most precious meeting. Our brethren of all nationalities spoke of being greatly blessed, and of being very grateful to God for the word spoken. One brother who has been laboring in Naples, Bieglia by name, had been unwilling to come under the control of the conference. Yet he depended on them for means to carry on the work in his own way. He had manifested a spirit of independence. He expressed himself with deep feeling, and confessed his unconsecrated condition. He said, \"I have heard and read about the mission of Sister White, but now I have seen and handled this matter myself. I acknowledge that the power of God has come to my heart through her testimony. I receive it as from God. I humble myself \n\n\n                               -348- \n\nbefore God. God's voice in reproof of my sins has come to me through Sister White.\"",
