    "word": "According to the light God has given me, this is the work which you, Brother F, have been attempting to do.

They are ready to assent to your statements; they see nothing in them but that which is correct. But they are misled because you have woven together much Scripture in constructing your theory. Your arguments appear conclusive to them.",
