    "word": "You can see from these Scriptures that it is no virtue in anyone to be faithless. The Son of God came to save to the uttermost all who would come unto God by Him. Though your sins are as scarlet, yet if you will come to Christ confessing your sins, He is faithful and just to forgive you your sins, and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Will you not exercise faith in the one upon whom the Lord has laid all power? \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father which hath sent Him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.\" [John 5:22-24].",
