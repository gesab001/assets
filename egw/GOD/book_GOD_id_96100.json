    "word": "I saw that there was not that spirit of sacrifice in Bedford that there should be, that some were not careful enough to study, when they decided to attend meetings, whether they were going to gratify themselves or to glorify God. Those who know the truth and are established in it should deprive themselves of privileges in order to assist other souls who are hungry and starving for present truth in other places. There is too much of a spirit and feeling like this--that those who are diligent in their affairs at home, and deprive themselves of the privileges of attending meetings abroad, were worldly minded, when the truth of the matter was they were making a sacrifice of their inclinations and desires, and with their hands were laboring to obtain something for the necessity of God's servants. All these things were noticed of God.",
