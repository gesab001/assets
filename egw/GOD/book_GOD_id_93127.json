    "word": "We want missionaries, but where shall we find them? Those who have had every spiritual advantage, who should have been increasing their talents that they may have more talents to use, that they may return to the Lord His own with usury, have dwarfed intellects and sacrificed their spirituality on the altar of lust. Their discernment is perverted; they know not that they are without a genuine conversion. But what will these have to say in the day of God? Let them consider before it shall be forever too late.--Ms 10, 1892. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. Dec. 17, 1987. Entire Ms.",
