    "word": "If men would use aright the wisdom God has given them, this world would be a place resembling heaven. God has given them light, educating them and endowing them with capabilities and with ability to choose the path of holiness, the path of obedience to the divine requirements. But the transgression of Adam and Eve has been perpetuated from generation to generation. Men have chosen to follow the suggestions of Satan, instead of the directions of God, and they have become active workers in the enemy's service, making void the law binding upon every member of the human family. They have exalted Satan's principles above the principles which rule in the heavens. By working contrary to God's commandments they have united with the great deceiver, and have brought unrighteousness into the world. God has given men a Sabbath, ordained and founded by Himself, but they have changed the rest-day which God sanctified in Eden, which bears the mark of His government, placing in its stead a spurious sabbath, which bears the mark of the man of sin.",
