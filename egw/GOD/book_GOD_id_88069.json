    "word": "The ear of the Lord is open to the cry of every soul that is poor in spirit. Even before the prayer is offered, or the yearning of the soul made known, the Spirit of God goes forth to meet it. Never has there been a genuine desire, however weak, never a prayer lifted to God, however faltering, never a tear shed in contrition of soul, but grace from Christ has gone forth to meet the grace working upon the human heart.--Ms. 40, 1899, pp. 2-3, 5. (\"I Will Have Mercy and Not Sacrifice,\" March 26, 1899.)",
