Those who have not vital union with God are swayed one way and another; they put men's opinions in the front, and God's Word in the background. They grasp human assertions, that judgment against sin is contrary to God's benevolent character, and, while dwelling upon infinite benevolence, try to forget that there is such a thing as infinite justice.",
