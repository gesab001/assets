    "word": "Nothing wounds the soul like the sharp darts of unbelief. When trial comes, as it will, do not worry or complain. Silence in the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. \u201cThen are they glad because they be quiet\u201d (Psalm 107:30). Remember that underneath you are the everlasting arms. \u201cRest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him\u201d (Psalm 37:7). He is guiding you into a harbor of gracious experience.",
