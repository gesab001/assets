    "word": "There are not many, even among educators and statesmen, who comprehend the causes that underlie the present state of society. Those who hold the reins of government are not able to solve the problem of moral corruption, poverty, pauperism, and increasing crime. They are struggling in vain to place business operations on a more secure basis. If men and women would give more heed to the teaching of God\u2019s Word, they would find a solution of the problems that perplex them.\u2014Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, pp. 12, 13.",
