    "word": "Trifling Excuses for Neglect \n\n     Parents plead trifling excuses for not interesting themselves in the lessons with their children, and they fail to become conversant with the Scriptures. Fathers as well as mothers excuse themselves from disciplining their own minds. They do not seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, but exalt the temporal above the spiritual and eternal. This forgetfulness of God and neglect of His word is the example they give their children, which molds their minds after the worldly standard and not after the exalted standard erected by Christ. \n                                                                           20",
