    "word": "Mrs. White Meeting the Problems of Depression.-- Brother M.'s family are industrious workers if they can only get work to do. We will not see them go hungry or destitute of clothing or become discouraged. They are bought, bought by the blood of Christ, and are of value with God. While in this country we will continue to help the poor and distressed as far as possible. Brother M. is in debt on his place; I met the last quarter's interest, seven pounds, for which I expect nothing, but I would not, could not, see the family turned into the street. . . . We pray most earnestly that the Lord will work in behalf of this dear family.",
