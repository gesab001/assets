    "word": "I don't expect my testimony is pleasing, yet I shall bear it in God's fear. God knows there is a preparation going on here to fit these ministers for the work, and unless we are converted God does not want us. I hope Brother Morrison will be converted and handle the Word of God with meekness and the Spirit of God. These truths will stand just as long as time shall last. You want the eyesalve that you can see, and Jesus will help you if you will come to Him as little children. May God help us to seek Him with all our hearts.--Manuscript 9, 1888.",
