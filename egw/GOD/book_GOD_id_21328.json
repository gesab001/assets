    "word": "20\n     The Son of God himself was sent to plead with the impenitent city. It was Christ that had brought Israel as a goodly vine out of Egypt. [Psalm 80:8.] His own hand had cast out the heathen before it. He had planted it \u201cin a very fruitful hill.\u201d [Isaiah 5:1-4.] His guardian care had hedged it about. His servants had been sent to nurture it. \u201cWhat could have been done more to my vineyard,\u201d he exclaims, \u201cthat I have not done in it?\u201d [Isaiah 5:1-4.] Though when he \u201clooked that it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes,\u201d [Isaiah 5:1-4.] yet with a still yearning hope of fruitfulness he came in person to his vineyard, if haply it might be saved from destruction. He digged about his vine; he pruned and cherished it. He was unwearied in his efforts to save this vine of his own planting.",
