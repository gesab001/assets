    "word": "To Teachers \n\n     I was a few nights since in my dreams in conversation with the teachers in the school or chapel room. I was speaking to the teachers and said, \"I have a message for you.\" and in substance I presented that which I now write. I was speaking to the teachers in regard to their responsibility of being at all times under the control of the Spirit of God. I repeated these words, \"Abide in me, and I in you.\" \"As the branch can not bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.\" \"I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.\"",
