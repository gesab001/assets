    "word": "\"Every man needs to walk humbly with God. Grow in grace and in a knowledge of God and your Saviour Jesus Christ. By looking unto your Saviour, beholding with open face as in a glass the glory of the Lord, you will be changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. As I work with you and you abide in me, you will reveal perfection of character. You will be made perfect in one. John Kellogg, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, that you may see that of your own self you can do nothing. You can not possibly atone for your own sins. Through faith in Christ Jesus purify your soul from all dross, and reveal the righteousness of Christ, which is of God by faith. Christ has marked your desires when His Spirit has striven with you.\"",
