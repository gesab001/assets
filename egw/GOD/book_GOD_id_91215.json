    "word": "And yet these very ones who are so blind to their own faults are often quick to perceive the faults of another, quick to criticize his words, and condemn him for something he did or neglected to do. They do not realize that their own errors may be much more grievous in the sight of God. They are like the man represented by Christ as seeking to pull a mote out of his brother's eye while he had a beam in his own eye. The Spirit of God makes manifest and reproves the \n\n\n                                  -174- \n\nsins that lie hidden, concealed in darkness, sins which if cherished will increase, and ruin the soul; but those who think themselves above reproof resist the influence of the Spirit of God. In their efforts to correct others they do not manifest patience, kindness, and respect. They do not show an unselfish spirit, the tenderness and love of Jesus. They are sharp, rasping and positively wicked in their words and spirit.",
