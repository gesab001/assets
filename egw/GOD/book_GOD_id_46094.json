    "word": "When Perfection of Character Is Reached.--Are we striving with all our God-given powers to reach the measure of the stature of men and women in Christ? Are we seeking for His fullness, ever reaching higher and higher, trying to attain to the perfection of His character? When God's servants reach this point, they will be sealed in their foreheads. The recording angel will declare, \"It is done.\" They will be complete in Him whose they are by creation and by redemption.-- Manuscript 148, 1899.",
