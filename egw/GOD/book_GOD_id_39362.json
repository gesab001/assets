    "word": "God has sent us to work in His vineyard. It is our duty to do all we can. \u201cIn the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either \n100\nthis or that.\u201d We have too little faith. We limit the Holy One of Israel. We should be grateful that He condescends to use any of us as His instruments. For every earnest prayer put up in faith, an answer will be returned. It may not come just as we have expected; but it will come at the very time when we most need it. \u201cIf ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\u201d(Review and Herald, March 23, 1897.)",
