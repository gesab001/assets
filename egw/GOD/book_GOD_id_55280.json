    "word": "The different parties of professed Advent believers have a little truth, but God has given all that to his children who are being prepared for the day of God; also truths that neither of these parties know, and will not understand. Things which are sealed up to them, the Lord has opened to those who will see, and are ready to understand them. And if God has any new light to communicate, he will let his chosen and beloved understand it, without their going to hear those who are in error and darkness to have their minds enlightened.",
