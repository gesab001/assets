    "word": "In all the sufferings and afflictions of man, there is an Eye to pity, a Heart to love. \"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.\" God's tenderest care is exercised over us. He pities us in our weakness and in our sorrow. We may be despondent, even despairing; the heavy clouds of affliction may be over us; but there is light ahead. Beyond the gloom is a sympathetic, compassionate Friend, One who does not willingly grieve or afflict the children of men.",
