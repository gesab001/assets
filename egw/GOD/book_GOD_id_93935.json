Address me: Mrs. E. G. White, Healdsburg, Cal., Box 65. I seek to preserve every thought and every matter written when I am burdened and feel urged to write, and especially when the matter lies open before me as clearly as that did at the time I wrote. I wish it could have been received by you as truth, but as nothing seems to move you from your own determined purpose, I can say nothing further.",
