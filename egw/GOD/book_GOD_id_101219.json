    "word": "My brethren, preach Christ. We need to keep him lifted up before the world, that men may behold his mercy and righteousness. Meditate upon the lessons Christ gave to his disciples to be given again to the world. This is the word which became flesh and dwelt among us. The world's eternal interest depends upon men knowing Christ as their individual, personal Saviour. \"This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.\" The pen of inspiration has traced the words which Christ spoke in order that those who believe in him may give to others the words which he has given to them. Ministers should set before the people the lessons which are to be brought into the home life. Parents are to be taught to feel a solemn responsibility to teach their children the lessons given them by Christ in both the Old and the New Testament. The children have been strangely neglected, and the people must be enlightened in regard to what constitutes home-religion.",
