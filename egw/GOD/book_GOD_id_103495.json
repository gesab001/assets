    "word": "And each worker, as he goes forth to labor, should realize that he is as surely sent of God as were the first disciples. God's eye follows them; His Spirit goes with them. To those who accept His great commission He gives the assurance, \"Lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.\" \"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.\" The Psalmist declares, \"I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in Him will I trust. Surely (642) He shall deliver me from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence; He shall cover thee with His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust; His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.\" Servants of God, you have great advantage, which you should appreciate.",
