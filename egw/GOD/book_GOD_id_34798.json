    "word": "The sacrifice of Christ as an atonement for sin is the great truth around which all other truths cluster. In order to be rightly understood and appreciated, every truth in the Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, must be studied in the light which streams from the cross of Calvary, and in connection with the wondrous, central truth of the Saviour\u2019s atonement. Those who study the Redeemer\u2019s wonderful sacrifice grow in grace and knowledge.",
