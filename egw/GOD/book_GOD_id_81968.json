    "word": "Now, my dear friends, who will be laborers together with God? Who will take up the burden of service? Who will see those that \n\n\n                   -16- \n\nare afar off, having a hard time, and knowing nothing of the truth? Who will bring them in? Who will use their efforts to make them sons and daughters of God? When you enter within the gates into the city, and the crown of life is placed upon your brow, and on the brows of the very ones you have worked to save, they will cast themselves upon your neck, and say, \"It was you that saved my soul; I should have perished if you had not saved me from myself. You had to take a good while; but you were patient with me, and won me to a knowledge of the truth.\"",
