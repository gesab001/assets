    "word": "The Minister's Need. \n\n     The ministers need to humble their souls before God, and cleanse the soul-temple of every moral and spiritual defilement, that they may attain unto the likeness of Christ in spirit and character, and know how to watch for souls. This they can never do without the impartation of the divine nature and Spirit. Love must be the abiding principle of the soul that would win others to Christ. But how little love is there for God, or for man formed in his image.",
