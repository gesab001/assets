    "word": "There are among professing believers many who know little of what is comprehended in the third angel's message. They have not followed the straight pathway of truth. They have not purified their souls by obeying the word. They are unconverted. They need to \"seek the Lord while he may be found, and to call upon Him while he is near.\" \"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\"",
