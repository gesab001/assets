    "word": "Let us strive to obtain an abundant entrance into the kingdom of our Lord. Let us diligently study the gospel that Christ came in person to present to John on the Isle of Patmos--the gospel that is termed \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass\" (Revelation 1:1). Let us remember always that \"blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand\" (verse 3).--Signs of the Times, Feb. 4, 1903.",
