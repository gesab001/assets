    "word": "When Jesus is comprehended by faith, and brought into the inner sanctuary of the soul, the Holy Spirit will mold and fashion the character after the likeness of Christ. Lessons will then be daily learned in the school of Christ. The character of the tree will be known by its fruits. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" The Christian will shine as a light amid the moral darkness of the world. He will be tender of heart, and considerate of the feelings of others. The Word of God instructs us to be \"wise as serpents, and harmless as doves,\" and it is the duty of every Christian to bring himself under discipline to the rules of the Bible, that he may be \"a workman that needeth not to be ashamed.\" The work coming from the hands of those who do this, will be as lasting as eternity. It will not be mingled with a shred of selfishness, and it will not be loose, careless work.",
