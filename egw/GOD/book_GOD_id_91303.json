    "word": "You have signally failed on your part. You have neglected to do your duty. You have considered yourselves, your convenience, and your interest, regardless of the inconvenience and interest of those whose hospitalities you share.

They would have cheerfully inconvenienced themselves to a much greater extent for your sakes, feeling that they were serving God and His cause in so doing. \n\n\n                                  -233-",
