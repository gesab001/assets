    "word": "You know how my husband was interested in all such cases. If he found a brother willing to labor in the cause of God, he was \n                                                                           1269\nalways willing to help him. Now the question is, how much is being done at the present time for such cases? I have had the best reports of this brother, in regard to his sincerity and his capability to do a good work. Let us consider the proposition presented at the Minneapolis meeting. Some who did not receive their counsel from God, prepared a resolution, which was carried, that no one should labor as a minister unless he first made a success in the canvassing field. The Spirit of the Lord did not indite that resolution. It was born of minds that were taking a narrow view of God's vineyard and his workmen. It is not the work of any man to prescribe the work for any other man contrary to his own convictions of duty. He is to be advised and counselled, but he is to seek his directions from God, whose he is, and whom he serves. If one undertakes the canvassing work, and is not able to sustain himself and his family, it is the duty of his brethren, so far as lies in their power, to help him out of his difficulty, and disinterestedly open ways whereby this brother may labor according to his ability, and obtain means honestly to sustain his family.",
