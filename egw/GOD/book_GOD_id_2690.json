    "word": "Why, then, Christ has said, should those who bear the truth of God to the world be discouraged and fainthearted? \u201cIf the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.\u201d Ye \u201care not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\u201d They will \u201crevile you, and persecute you, and . . . say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\u201d\u201cYea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.\u201d",
