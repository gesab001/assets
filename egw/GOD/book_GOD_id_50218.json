    "word": "\"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. We have also a more sure word of prophesy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. \n                                                                           149\nFor the prophecy came not in old time by the will of men: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\" \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.\" \"Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.\" \"For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord endureth forever.\"",
