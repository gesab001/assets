    "word": "We thank God that our Sabbath-schools have contributed enough to advance many a precious enterprise. Children and youth have given their pennies, that like little rivulets have supplied a stream of beneficence. Children should be educated in such a way that they may perform unselfish acts which Heaven will rejoice to see. When the dew of youth is upon them, children should be trained how to do service for Christ. They should be taught self-denial.",
