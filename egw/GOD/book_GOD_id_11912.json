    "word": "Exalt Christ.--In our periodicals we are not to exalt the work and characters of men in positions of influence, constantly keeping human beings before the people. But as much as you please you may uplift Christ our Saviour. \"We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory [from character to character], even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\" Those who love and serve God are to be the light of the world, shining amid moral darkness.--Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 480. (1899.)",
