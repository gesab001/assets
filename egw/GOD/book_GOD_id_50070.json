    "word": "The youth educated in large cities are surrounded by influences similar to those that prevailed before the flood. The same principles of disregard for God and his law; the same love of pleasure of selfish gratification, and of pride and vanity are at work at the present time. The world is given up to pleasure; immorality prevails; the rights of the weak and helpless are disregarded; and, the world over, the large cities are fast becoming hotbeds of iniquity.",
