    "word": "\"Our brethren have not discerned that in helping us to do this work, they would be helping themselves. That which is given to start the work here will result in strengthening the work in other places.

We shall have sufficiency, not only to carry on the work here, but to impart to other fields. Nothing is gained by withholding the very means that would enable us to work to advantage, extending the knowledge of God and the triumphs of truth in regions beyond.\"",
