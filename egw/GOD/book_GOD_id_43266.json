    "word": "The Lord has not laid the burden upon men to revive the mistakes and errors of the living or the dead. He would have His laborers present the truth for this time.  Speak not of the errors of your brethren who are living, and be silent as to the mistakes of the dead.  Let their mistakes and errors remain where God has put them -- cast into the depths of the sea.  The less that is said by those who profess to believe present truth in regard to the past mistakes and errors of the servants of God, the better it will be for their own souls, and for the souls of those whom Christ has purchased with His own blood.  -- RH Nov. 30, 1897.",
