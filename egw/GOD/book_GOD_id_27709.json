There is something very touching in this narrative. It shows that the Saviour is willing to reveal Himself to those who are devoted to Him and to His service,-- those who desire above all things else to maintain a living connection with heaven. As Mary recognized her Lord after His resurrection by His voice and His general demeanor, so I believe we shall be able to recognize again our sister who now sleeps. While we cannot hear her voice in this world any more, yet her influence lives; and in the resurrection morning, if \n                                                                           479\nwe remain faithful, and have a part with the people of God in that glad hour, we shall hear her voice once more, and we shall recognize her. My dear friends, there is a living connection between heaven and this earth still, and the promises the Lord has made to His people will be verified. Not one word will fail of fulfillment. May the Lord help us all to be among those who shall meet their Lord in peace, and who shall have the privilege of greeting our sister in the kingdom of heaven. May God grant it for His name's sake.\"",
