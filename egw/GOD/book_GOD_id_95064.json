Jones.) \n\n\n     I have been conversing with you in the night season. I have carried the burden of your case upon my soul because the Lord has presented to me the dangers of your expressing your strong natural traits of character. These traits come to be distinguished in an objectionable way if you encourage them. Your soul and your mind and your character, unless under the influence of the Holy Spirit of God, lead you to extremes in spirit and in language, after the natural mind.",
