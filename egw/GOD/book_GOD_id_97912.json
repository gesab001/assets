    "word": "Well-ordered and well-disciplined families are an example that God gives to our world. You want a well-ordered house. God wants the light of His love to rise upon you. He wants that His ministers should search for the careless ones--His heritage bought with His own blood. The children are God's property that you have in charge. It is no light matter to know how you shall deal with God's heritage--that you may have that wisdom that is from above, that at last you may be able to say, Here, Lord, are the children Thou hast committed to my charge.",
