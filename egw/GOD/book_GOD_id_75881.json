    "word": "It was not in the order of God that another medical institution was started in Boulder. God did not send this second sanitarium to Boulder. There are places enough in the world where the physician could have gone without establishing himself beside an institution which had cost our people so much, and which needed all the influence and patronage it could secure. It has been presented to me that God wants the one institution to stand there, and He wants it to make progress. The establishment of another institution so near left a sadness, a discouragement, and a gloom, on the minds of those connected with the Boulder Sanitarium. It brought burden of heart to those who were struggling hard to do their very best.",
