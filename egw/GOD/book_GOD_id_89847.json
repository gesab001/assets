    "word": "The whole Christian life is to be a preparation for the future, immortal life; and under whatever circumstances you may be placed you may be happy if you are true to God and to yourselves. Money cannot bring the peace which Christ can give you. Seek the hidden pearl, the jewels of truth, and let not worldly ambitions ruin your prospects of heaven. Satan is ready to present the worldly bribe. He says to you. \"All this will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.\" But will you do it? Will you give Satan the supreme affection of your heart? The apostle says, \"But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed\" [James 1:14]. He is turned from the true path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord because he has fixed his heart upon some attractive object of the earth. He catches at Satan's bait and is entrapped in his snare.",
