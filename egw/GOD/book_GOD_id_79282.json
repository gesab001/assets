    "word": "God calls for us to advance step by step in the building up of His work. We are now doing what should have been done twenty years ago. Some have thought that we as a people were unable to stem the current and criticism. But I have been shown that if we had advanced in the way of reform as the light came to us, we would have a very different showing than now appears. In following the instruction of our great leader, difficulties would have been overcome; the consciousness of the approval of God would have made our ministers and physicians, and the teachers in our schools valiant men of God. In the fullest sense of the word, they would have been laborers together with God.",
