    "word": "How Satan Would Cripple Our Work \n\n\n     All must now be guarded in regard to embracing the most extreme views upon health reform. The Lord desires to lead us all gently and consistently. It is the enemy who seeks to drive us to extremes. He would be pleased to see the conscientious advocates of health reform require that which God does not require. He would be pleased to see them placing on their own tables and on the tables at the sanitarium food that is not acceptable. Let not those who come to the sanitarium see that Seventh-day Adventists have lost good common sense.",
