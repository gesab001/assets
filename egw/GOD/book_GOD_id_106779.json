    "word": "A copy of the proposed agreement between the Medical Association and those establishing branch sanitariums, was read to me by Sister Druillard. A few day afterward I was praying, a scene passed before me representing the unfavorable results of the transactions that would follow the signing of this agreement. Other scenes also passed before me similar to those presented to me when I was at Summer Hill, a few weeks before our return to America. At that time representations of movements in America passed before me. I saw agreements drawn up for presentation to our people. In these agreements there were terms and conditions that should not be accepted. On no account should our brethren bind themselves by agreeing to such propositions. I was instructed that we know but little of what is before us, and that God forbids us to bind ourselves by contracts in order to secure means.",
