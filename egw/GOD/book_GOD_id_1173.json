    "word": "Jesus Still Invites the Mothers.--Christ, the Majesty of heaven, said, \"Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\" Jesus does not send the children to the rabbis; He does not send them to the Pharisees; for He knows that these men would teach them to reject their best Friend. The mothers that brought their children to Jesus did well. . . . Let mothers now lead their children to Christ. Let ministers of the gospel take the little children in their arms and bless them in the name of Jesus. Let words of tenderest love be spoken to the little ones; for Jesus took the lambs of the flock in His arms and blessed them.",
