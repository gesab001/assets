    "word": "We need canvassers, evangelists, ministers, who have received the Holy Spirit, and who are partakers of the divine nature. We need workers who are able to talk with God, and then with the people. I am alarmed as I see how many obstructions are coming in to divert men from evangelistic work, and thus hinder the work of God. As our restaurants are presented to me, they are not doing the work that they should be doing to bring souls into the truth. I warn those who should be in the canvassing work, circulating the books so much needed everywhere, to be careful not to turn from the work that the Lord has called them to. Let not the men that God has called to do gospel work become entangled \n64\nwith business perplexities. Let them keep their souls in the atmosphere most favorable to spirituality. Let them not place themselves where they will find many temptations, where they will be absorbed in cares that will lead them to be regardless of the preparation necessary for the courts above. God wants every worker who claims to believe the present truth to consecrate himself, body, soul, and spirit, to the work of seeking to save the perishing souls around him.",
