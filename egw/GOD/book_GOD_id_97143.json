    "word": "We want to know, brethren, if you are going to make the surrender to God. We want to know if you will consider that everything has been done for you that a God could do. We want to know if you consider that all heaven--just think of it!--all heaven has been poured out to you in one gift, with Jesus Christ. When God gave His Son He gave with Him the richest treasures of heaven. It is yours, if you will cooperate with Him. He gave all heaven; all heaven He gave in that one gift. All heaven is at our command. All heaven we may claim. When the minister goes forth to labor he can say, \"I go in the strength of the God of Israel. I have no confidence in self. I have no confidence in my finite ability, but I have a standing promise from One who says, 'I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.'\" You have no lack of power then. What more assurance do you want? \"If he abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you\" [John 15:7]. Do you believe it? Do you believe the promise?",
