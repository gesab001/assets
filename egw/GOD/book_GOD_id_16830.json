    "word": "Your heavenly Father will take from you the garments defiled by sin. In the beautiful parabolic prophecy of Zechariah, the high priest Joshua, standing clothed in filthy garments before the angel of the Lord, represents the sinner. And the word is spoken by the Lord, \"Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. . . . So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.\" Zechariah 3:4, 5. Even so God will clothe you with \"the garments of salvation,\" and cover you with \"the robe of righteousness.\" Isaiah 61:10. . . .",
