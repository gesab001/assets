    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     John says, \u201cI saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.\u201d [Revelation 18:1.] Then, as at the Pentecostal \n384\nseason, the people will hear the truth spoken to them, every man in his own tongue. God can breathe new life into every soul that sincerely desires to serve him, and can touch the lips with a live coal from off the altar, and cause them to become eloquent with his praise. Thousands of voices will be imbued with the power to speak forth the wonderful truths of God's word. The stammering tongue will be loosed, and the timid will be made strong to bear courageous testimony to the truth. May the Lord help his people to cleanse the soul-temple from every defilement, and to maintain so close a connection with him that they may be partakers of the latter rain when it shall be poured out.",
