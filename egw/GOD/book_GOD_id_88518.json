    "word": "I am to say to you that it is your privilege to walk humbly with Christ Jesus. Unless you do this you will be in grave danger of receiving spurious ideas from other minds. The truth of God, like gold, does not lie on the surface, but it is obtained only by earnest effort. As you study the life of Christ, you may, if receptive, receive a knowledge that will expand the mental powers and will be a savor of eternal truths that you may bring before the people.--Letter 58, 1910, pp. 2, 5 (June 15, 1910.)",
