    "word": "Upon the crystal sea before the throne, that sea of glass as it were mingled with fire--so resplendent is it with the glory of God--are gathered the company that have \"gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name.\" With the Lamb upon Mount Zion, \"having the harps of God,\" they stand, the hundred and forty and four thousand that were redeemed from among men; and there is heard, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of a great thunder, \"the voice of harpers harping with their harps.\" And they sing \"a new song\" before the throne, a song which no man can learn save the hundred and forty and four thousand. It is the song of Moses and the Lamb--a song of deliverance.",
