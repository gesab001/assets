    "word": "If men and women would acknowledge the true Sabbath, they would not, as they now do, despise the Word of God. The observance of the seventh day would be a golden chain binding them to their Creator. But the commandment which points out who the true God is\u2014the Creator and Ruler of the earth\u2014is dishonored and disobeyed. This is the reason why there is so little stability in the world. The churches have refused God\u2019s sign and misrepresented His character. They have torn down God\u2019s sacred rest day, exalting a spurious sabbath in its place. Oh, that men and women would cease to lock themselves out of heaven by their own perversities.\u2014Manuscript Releases, vol. 5, p. 82.",
