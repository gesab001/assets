    "word": "Before the believer is held out the wonderful possibility of being like Christ, obedient to all the principles of the law. . . . The holiness that God's Word declares he must have before he can be saved is the result of the working of divine grace as he bows in submission to the discipline and restraining influences of the Spirit of truth. Man's obedience can be made perfect only by the incense of Christ's righteousness, which fills with divine fragrance every act of obedience.",
