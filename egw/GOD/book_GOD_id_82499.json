    "word": "There is a sentiment among our people,--opposed by some, it is true, but held by many--that each one connected with God's service may be sharp, keen, and designing, in order to make the best possible showing, indicating that his line of work is a success. Those who continue to hold to this idea will be bitterly disappointed when at the judgment they find that they have no place in the kingdom of God. False principles will never prevail in heaven. Not one thread of selfishness is to be brought into any part of God's service in His work upon the earth.",
