    "word": "Cleansed From All Selfishness \n\n     Those who are connected with the service of God must be purified from every thread of selfishness. All is to be done in accordance with the injunction, \"Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all\" (Colossians 3:17) \"to the glory of God\" (1 Corinthians 10:31). God's laws of justice and equity must be strictly obeyed in the transactions between neighbor and neighbor, brother and brother. We are to seek for perfect order and perfect righteousness, after God's own similitude. On these grounds alone will our works bear the test of the judgment. . . .",
