    "word": "My brethren and sisters, old and young, when you have an hour of leisure, open the Bible and store the mind with its precious truths. When engaged in labor, guard the mind, keep it stayed upon God, talk less, and meditate more. Remember: \u201cEvery idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\u201d Let your words be select; this will close a door against the adversary of souls. Let your day be entered upon with prayer; work as in God\u2019s sight. His angels are ever by your side, making a record of your words, your deportment, and the manner in which your work is done. If you turn from good counsel and choose to associate with those who you have reason to suspect are \n157\nnot religiously inclined, although they profess to be Christians, you will soon become like them. You place yourself in the way of temptation, on Satan\u2019s battleground, and will, unless constantly guarded, be overcome by his devices.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, 588, 589.)",
