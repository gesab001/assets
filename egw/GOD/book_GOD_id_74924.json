    "word": "A Sanitarium Chapel. \n\n     I have received from _____ a letter of inquiry in reference to the building of a chapel for the Sanitarium. I have written him that this proposition appears to me consistent; years ago I was shown that such a building should be erected. The teaching in the Tabernacle is often too strong for babes. It is such advanced truth as is appropriate for those who have progressed step by step, but is not suited to those who have not a knowledge of the truth. The doctrinal discourses are not of a character to melt and subdue the heart. These souls need to be taught of Jesus Christ and him crucified, of the sanctification of soul, body, and spirit, of the amazing love of God. In the simplicity and meekness and lowliness of Christ let the word be spoken. The seekers after truth will inquire to know the reasons of our faith; they will desire that lessons be given upon the Sabbath question, and then the truth can be unfolded to them gradually as they are able to bear it. All who have a knowledge of the truth should realize their responsibility, and be exceedingly careful to make straight paths for their own feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way.",
