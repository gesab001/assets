    "word": "Danger in Hesitation. \n\n     One of the dangers to which God's people will be exposed in the many delusions that are coming upon a world that has turned from the truth. These will be of such deceptive power, that Christ declares, \"If it were possible they shall deceive the very elect.\" Our work now is to confirm our souls in the faith,--that faith which is a working faith, which works by love and purifies the soul. Faith, living, active, working faith, we must have. Christ demands this of us. Verily Christ hath need of us now to represent him; not the cold, harsh, denunciatory, overbearing, and ruling power of the prince of darkness. Those who are Christ's friends will now do whatsoever he commands them. Stand, therefore, having on the whole armor, and having done all to stand. Let the soul-temple be cleansed of prejudice, of that \n\n\n                      - 24 - \n\nroot of bitterness, hatred, whereby many are being defiled. Cling to the Mighty One. Communicate light to others, with cheerful words, and with courage in the Lord. Labor to diffuse that faith and confidence that has been your own consolation. Let it be heard from every lip and voice, \"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\" \"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.\" \"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.\"",
