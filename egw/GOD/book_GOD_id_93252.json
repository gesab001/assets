    "word": "[This entry from Journal No. 20, pp. 351, 352.] \n     Elmshaven, Nov. 28, 1902. I am deeply troubled in mind. I rose from my bed at twelve o'clock. During the night in the visions God has given me I have been in one company assembled together in Battle Creek, another in New York City, another at Nashville. I cannot clearly write out all these things this day; my strength is not sufficient. Oh, how sad it is that men will permit the enemy to deceive their souls, and they will be wrought upon by the enemy [to the extent] that they will dare venture to exalt their own finite judgment and express word and devise plans and methods which I have been instructed are \n\n\n                                  -221- \n\ndecidedly contrary to the expressions and plans of God in behalf of His people. In thus doing they compel me to stand under the load of refuting the banner under which they stand and declaring that plan and that course of action that the Lord has been laying out distinctly before me again and still again, in advancing the work, that His truth shall not be leavened with men's diseased ideas of truth.",
