    "word": "You seem to have special bitterness against Eld. Smith, and \n                                                                           702\nsome others of our brethren, and you have talked out these feelings in your family, thus leavening them. The Lord has seen fit to counsel Eld. Smith, to give him words of reproof because he had erred; but is this an evidence that God has forsaken him?- No. \"As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.\" The Lord reproves wrongs in his people, but is this an evidence that he has rejected them?- No. There are errors in the church, and the Lord points them out by his own ordained agencies, not always through the testimonies. Now shall we seize these reproofs and make capital of them, and say that God is not imparting to them his light and love?- No. The very work that God is trying to do for them shows that he loves them, and wants to draw them away from paths of danger.",
