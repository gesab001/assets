    "word": "It is a great thing to believe on Jesus Christ. We have altogether too little faith. I am instructed to say to you that individually we each have our work to do. The Master has given to every man his work. And because others may not do just exactly the work you have to do, do not feel that you must criticize everything they do. No, indeed! No one ought to devote to faultfinding the time that he ought to spend in hunting for souls, fishing for souls, using every capability and power in his appointed work. When your powers are used in this way, you may know that the Lord God of heaven is right by your side, to strengthen and to guide.",
