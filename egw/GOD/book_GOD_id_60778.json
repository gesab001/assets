    "word": "Of the Amorites the Lord said: \"In the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\" Although this nation was conspicuous because of its idolatry and corruption, it had not yet filled up the cup of its iniquity, and God would not give command for its utter destruction.
