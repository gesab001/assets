    "word": "The churches have not been educated altogether as they should have been educated. They have been educated to depend upon the ministers to pray and to open the Scriptures to the people who assemble to worship God. God would have the people hear the voice of God, and go to work for the Master to become a blessing to the world. Thousands might be at work who are not ordained to preach the gospel, but are commissioned of Christ to do His work. To every man He has given his work.",
