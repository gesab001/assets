    "word": "MR No. 600 - Living Up to Our Privileges and Opportunities\n\n     There has been presented before me as an illustration a class that has had every opportunity and privilege, as compared with another class that has far less qualifications and information, but which keeps the fear of God before it. Those who belong to this latter class regard their talents as entrusted to them. Their opportunities are limited, but they try to comprehend the grand lesson inculcated in the parable of the talents. They strive to use well their probationary time, vigilantly working in the contemplation of Christ's coming. By a thorough training in the educational lines within their reach, they discipline themselves, that they may be prepared to learn and digest all true knowledge. Under a sense of accountability to God, they strive to make the most of the gifts entrusted to them.",
