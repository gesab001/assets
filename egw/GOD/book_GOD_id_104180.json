    "word": "Sometimes the father casts reflections on the mother. He sternly disciplines the children, as if to disparage the mother's tenderness and love. Because of this the mother thinks she must bestow on them increased affection, and gratify and indulge their inclinations. Thus she seeks to counteract the father's impatience and severity; but oh, how God is dishonored. The family is demoralized, and the children are confused in regard to true discipline and correct education.",
