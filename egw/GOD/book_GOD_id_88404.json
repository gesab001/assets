    "word": "Present the Word of God as the way in which a holy faith and a pure character may be attained. Offer a full and free salvation, not as coming from yourselves, but from Christ. Show your hearers their need of returning through repentance and faith to their loyalty: for all are on a level, all are condemned alike by that great moral standard of righteousness. Proclaim remission of sins through Christ, the only sin-bearer, the only sin-pardoner. Proclaim the remission of sins through repentance toward God and faith in Christ, and God will ratify your testimony. With all assurance you \n\n\n                                    -291- \n\ncan proclaim the means by which a holy character may be obtained--as Enoch obtained it through Christ Jesus.",
