    "word": "The best citizens of this great republic are those who have learned the lessons that Christ came to teach, those who love and to obey the higher law that God has written in His Word. Abiding in Christ, their example is a power in favor of the truth. Let every Christian show his high birth by his circumspect conversation and modest bearing. Let God's workers be witnesses for Him, in every word and act testifying that they are citizens of heaven. Let not one careless word or unkind action mar their work for God. As high as the heavens are above the earth, should the ways and work of the Christian be above the ways and works of the worldling.",
