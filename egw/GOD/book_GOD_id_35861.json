    "word": "The \u201ctime of trouble, such as never was,\u201d is soon to open upon us; and we shall need an experience which we do not now possess and which many are too indolent to obtain. It is often the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before us. The most vivid presentation cannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal. In that time of trial, every soul must stand for himself before God. \u201cThough Noah, Daniel, and Job\u201d were in the land, \u201cas I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.\u201d Ezekiel 14:20.",
