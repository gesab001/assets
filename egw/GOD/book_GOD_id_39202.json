    "word": "MUCH PRAYER IS NEEDED TO KNOW HOW TO APPROACH INDIVIDUALS WITH TRUTH.\u2014It is not everyone who can labor judiciously\n44\nfor the salvation of souls. There is much close thinking to be done. We must not enter into the Lord\u2019s work haphazard and expect success. The Lord needs men of mind, men of thought. Jesus calls for co-workers, not blunderers. God wants right-thinking and intelligent men to do the great work necessary to the salvation of souls.",
