    "word": "Luxuries. \n\n     I dreamed I was visiting those who believe the truth; and I saw in their houses trinkets and ornaments. But while I felt like weeping like a little child, over the future prospects -- on account of lack of means -- in regard to advancing the cause of Present Truth, \n\n\n                                 -83- \n\nthe Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and I said, \"In this house are many idols.\" If these things that can do your souls no good were sold, and the money put in the Lord's treasury, there would not be the deprivation of any of your comforts, and the means would help advance the cause of God.\" I went from house to house and pointed out the needless things that the Lord's money entrusted to his stewards had bought. That very means could have been a great blessing to help build our school buildings in the land, also our meetinghouses, that as churches are raised up we must hire. There are many campmeetings to be held in new places, and how to obtain the means is a problem.",
