    "word": "The members of the church of God should be well organized, for they are to be as one. Their bond of union should be the living oracles of truth, for they should be united under the yoke of Christ. The yoke of Christ is the only yoke they should take upon them. The church is the Lord's even though all within its covenant circle are not perfect in character. Judas was among the twelve, yet he was not perfect, for he betrayed his Lord. Any confederacy with the world is strictly forbidden by the Scriptures. God would have His people distinct from all worldly confederacy.",
