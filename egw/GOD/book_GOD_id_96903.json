    "word": "The Minister's Relationship to God's Word\n[A SERMON\nPREACHED IN THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH IN DES\nMOINES, IOWA, DECEMBER 1, 1888.]\n\nText: 2 Timothy 4:1-11\n\n     Here we have presented before us the work of him who shall open the Scriptures to others. It is a most solemn work, and all who engage in it should be men of prayer. It is not enough for the minister to stand up in the desk and give an exposition of the Scriptures. His work has but just begun. There is pastoral work to do, and this means to reprove and exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine; that is, he should present the Word of God, to show wherein there is a deficiency. If there is anything in the character of the professed followers of Christ, the burden should certainly be felt by the minister, and not that he should lord it over God's heritage. To deal with human minds is the nicest job that was ever committed to mortal man.",
