    "word": "MR No. 883 - All-Round Christian Education\n\n     Distrust of Self Is Essential--In His Word the Lord enumerates the gifts and graces that are indispensable for all who connect with His work. He does not teach us to ignore learning, or to despise education, for when controlled by the love and fear of God, intellectual culture is a blessing; yet this is not presented as the most important qualification for the service of God. Jesus passed by the wise men of His time, the men of education and position, because they were so proud and self-sufficient in their boasted superiority, that they could not sympathize with suffering humanity and become co-laborers with the Man of Nazareth. In their bigotry they scorned to be taught by Christ.",
