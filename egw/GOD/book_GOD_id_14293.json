But Paul was grieved; for this crying after them diverted the minds of the people from the truth. Satan's object in leading her to do this was to disgust the people \n                                                                           204\nand destroy the influence of the disciples. Paul's spirit was stirred within him, and he turned and said to the spirit, \"I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her\"; and the evil spirit was rebuked, and left her.",
