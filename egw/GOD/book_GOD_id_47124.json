    "word": "(Ch. 16:24; 9:23.) Symbol of Submission to God's Will.--We are to bear the yoke of Christ that we may be placed in complete union with Him. \"Take my yoke upon you,\" He says. Obey My requirements. But these requirements may be in direct opposition to the will and purposes of the human agent. What then is to be done? Hear what God says: \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\" The yoke and the cross are symbols representing the same thing,--the giving up of the will to God. Wearing the yoke unites finite man in companionship with the dearly beloved Son of God. Lifting the cross cuts away self from the soul, and places man where he learns how to bear Christ's burdens. We cannot follow Christ \n                                                                           1091\nwithout wearing His yoke, without lifting the cross and bearing it after Him. If our will is not in accord with the divine requirements, we are to deny our inclinations, give up our darling desires, and step in Christ's footsteps. . . .",
