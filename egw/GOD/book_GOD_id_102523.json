    "word": "\"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, Dec. 12, 1900 \nDr. J. H. Kellogg \n\nMy dear brother: \n\n\n     You speak as though you had no friends. But God is your friend, and Sister White is your friend. You have thought that I had lost confidence in you; but, my dear brother, as I have before written to you, I know that the Lord has placed you in a very responsible position, standing as you do,.....a man to whom the Lord has given understanding and knowledge, that you may do justice and judgment, and reveal the true missionary spirit in the institution which is to represent truth in contrast with error.",
