    "word": "Do not talk of the faults of others. Take care of your own garden. See that your own heart is cleansed by the power of God. When trouble comes, instead of getting out of patience, instead of fretting and worrying, go to the Lord, and tell Him all about it. . . . Do not go to human friends, for they have all the burdens they can bear. . . .",
