    "word": "What is faith? It \"is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" Then what? \"Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\" (James 2:17.) Therefore we lay hold upon the merits of the blood of a crucified and risen Saviour. Our lives are hid with Christ in God. There we have the whole of it. We can do nothing of ourselves, but the fire of God's love is burning on the altar of our hearts. We are not following cunningly devised fable, no indeed; but we have been revealing Christ our righteousness. If you boast in your own good works, you cannot boast in Christ. . . .",
