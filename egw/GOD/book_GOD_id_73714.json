    "word": "We have only one channel of approach to God. Our prayers can come to Him through one name only--that of the Lord Jesus our Advocate. His Spirit must inspire our petitions. No strange fire was to be used in the censers that were waved before God in the sanctuary. So the Lord Himself must kindle in our hearts the burning desire, if our prayers are acceptable to Him. The Holy Spirit within must make intercessions for us, with groanings that cannot be uttered.",
