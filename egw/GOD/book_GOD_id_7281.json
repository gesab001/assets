    "word": "As Elijah, divinely directed in seeking a successor, passed the field in which Elisha was plowing, he cast upon the young man's shoulders the mantle of consecration. . . . To him it was the signal that God had called him to be the successor of Elijah. ... Elisha must count the cost--decide for himself to accept or reject the call. If his desires clung to his home and its advantages, he was at liberty to remain there. But Elisha understood the meaning of the call. . . .

Without hesitation he left a home where he was beloved, to attend the prophet in his uncertain life.",
