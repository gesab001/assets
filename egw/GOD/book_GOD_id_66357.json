    "word": "Do not, I beg of you, sink down into a faithless position. Arise and shine, for the glory of the Lord is risen upon you. Believe, believe without a doubt that God hears your prayers. If you feel weak and unworthy, He is your strength. The Word is abundant \n67\nin promises from God to us, and the Spirit helps our infirmities to plead these promises.
