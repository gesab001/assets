    "word": "In the full light of the sun, surrounded by thousands\u2014men of war, prophets of Baal, and the monarch of Israel\u2014stands the defenseless man, Elijah, apparently alone, yet not alone. The most powerful host of heaven surrounds him. Angels who excel in strength have come from heaven to shield the faithful and righteous\n131\nprophet.

And the people answered him not a word.\u201d\u20143T 280.",
