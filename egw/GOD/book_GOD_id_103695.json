    "word": "\"Our medical missionary work in Los Angeles should be in a much more favorable condition than it is. The Lord designs that much more shall be done in this city than has been done there. But I cannot speak freely about this at present, for fear that men will take advantage of what I say, and will endeavor by my words, to vindicate wrong plans. Some of the brethren in Los Angeles have at times lacked spiritual discernment. They have not always been able to see what could be done by proper efforts on their part. A large work had been done in some lines, but the methods followed have not been such as to bring glory to God in the saving of souls.\" (840) Various changes now came to the medical work in southern California, which resulted in opening a small sanitarium, not in the country, but in the city of Pasadena. Instead of prosperity, reverses come to the work which strained its credit and resulted in such heavy financial losses that the brethren were led to pass some very stringent measures against incurring further indebtedness in an effort to carry forward the medical missionary work.",
