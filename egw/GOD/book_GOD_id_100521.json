    "word": "Our only safety is to believe that which is truth because it is true, not because it harmonizes with our preconceived opinions and it is pleasant and agreeable to believe that which we want to believe because it harmonizes with our ideas. Do we accept the words of Christ as verity and truth because He is a divine Witness whose testimony is to be accepted, studied, and revered because He is the Sent from God? The raising of Christ from the dead establishes Christ as a witness to the wonderful truth--which means so much to us--of the resurrection of every one who believes in Jesus Christ.",
