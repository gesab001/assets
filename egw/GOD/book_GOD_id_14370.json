    "word": "As the people of God united in the cry of the second angel, the heavenly host marked with the deepest interest the effect of the message. They saw many who bore the name of Christians turn with scorn and derision upon those who had been disappointed. As the words fell from mocking lips, \"You have not gone up yet!\" an angel wrote them. Said the angel, \"They mock God.\" I was pointed back to a similar sin committed in ancient times. Elijah had been translated \n                                                                           248\nto heaven, and his mantle had fallen upon Elisha. Then wicked youth, who had learned from their parents to despise the man of God, followed Elisha, and mockingly cried, \"Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.\" In thus insulting His servant, they insulted God and met their punishment then and there. In like manner, those who have scoffed and mocked at the idea of the saints' going up, will be visited with the wrath of God, and will be made to feel that it is not a light thing to trifle with their Maker.",
