    "word": "Look Away From Self to Jesus--1850.--Said the angel, \"Have faith in God.\" I saw some tried too hard to believe. Faith is so simple, ye look above it. Satan tried to deceive some of the honest children and had got them looking to self to find worthiness there. I saw they must look away from self to the worthiness of Jesus and throw themselves just as dependent and unworthy as they are upon His mercy and draw by faith strength and nourishment from Him.--Letter 8, 1850.",
