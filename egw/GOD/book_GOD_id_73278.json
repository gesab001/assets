    "word": "What light there is in the Word! In Isaiah we read, \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew My people their transgressions.\" This is the work we are to do. Note the expression, \"My people.\" Why should the prophet say, \"My people\"? They were not walking in accordance with the light of truth, but God desired to save them from their sins. The truth was to be brought to them anew in its simplicity.",
