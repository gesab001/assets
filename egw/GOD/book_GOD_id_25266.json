    "word": "The apostle entreats his brethren to consecrate their bodies to God. . . . When we pursue a course to lessen mental and physical vigor--in eating, drinking, or in any of our habits--we dishonor God, for we rob Him of the service He claims of us. When we indulge appetite at the expense of health, or when we indulge habits which lessen our vitality and mental vigor, we cannot have a high appreciation of the atonement and a right estimate of eternal things.",
