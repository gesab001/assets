    "word": "There is a Watcher standing by the side of all those who are filling positions of trust, ready to reprove and convict of wrong-doing, or to answer the prayers for help. He watches to see if the men privileged to bear responsibilities will look to God for wisdom, and avail themselves of every opportunity to perfect a character after the divine similitude. If they deviate from straightforward rectitude, God turns from them: if they do not earnestly strive to understand the will of God concerning them, he cannot bless or prosper or sustain them.",
