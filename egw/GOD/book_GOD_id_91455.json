    "word": "I saw that Sister B had not received or believed the message that had been given her, but had felt like concealing it from everyone. She can make no progress until she makes straight work of the past, overcomes affectation and complaining, and exercises the strength the Lord has given her. Although she may suffer pain, yet she should not give up to every feeling of infirmity and repining. Bear up against it. Giving up to every infirmity pleases the enemy and magnifies these infirmities until the life is useless. The course that should be pursued is to seek God earnestly for strength. Bear up, bear up; talk faith, act faith; manifest courage. Although the body feels the effects of the curse, there must be a pressure against it. [Sister] B sinks under it. She thinks she is worse off than she is. She talks of her infirmities, thinks of them, and makes no effort to overcome them--all of which makes life miserable. \n\n\n                              -333-",
