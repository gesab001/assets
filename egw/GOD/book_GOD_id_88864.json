    "word": "Critics of J. H. Kellogg Should Help Him--Dr. Kellogg has done a work that no man I know of among us has had qualifications to do. He has needed the sympathy and confidence of his brethren. There should have been a tender compassion for him in his position of trust, and they should have pursued a course that would have gained and retained his confidence. God would have it thus. But there has been instead a spirit of suspicion and criticism.",
