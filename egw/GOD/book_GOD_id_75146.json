    "word": "Does Not Belittle the Gospel Minister. \n\n     I sincerely hope that no mind will receive the impression that it belittles a minister of the gospel to canvass. Hear the apostle Paul's testimony: \n\n\n                     - 51 - \n\n\"Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\" The eloquent Paul, to whom God manifested himself in a wonderful manner, went from house to house, with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations.",
