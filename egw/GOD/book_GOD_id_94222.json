I have felt the movings of the Spirit of God. Sunday and Monday nights I could not sleep past one o'clock. I was in an assembly where the very sentiments you referred to in your letter were expressed. The \"exclusively\" was dwelt upon, and urged as a contract in the sale of our publications, pamphlets, and books.",
