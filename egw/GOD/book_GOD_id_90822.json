    "word": "MR No. 1117 - Gospel Workers Need Total Commitment to God and His Word\n\n     (Written April 6, 1897, from Sunnyside, Cooranbong, N.S.W., to Edson and Emma White.) \n\n\n     I was conversing with you in the night season. We were having some serious conversation together. You opened before me freely that which you intended to do. We conversed very pleasantly and you proposed many things. But after we had canvassed these things thoroughly, you said, \"Mother, the only safe path for me is to follow out implicitly the light the Lord has given me in the testimonies you have sent me.\" You looked up with light and hope expressed in your countenance, and continued, \"I see my way clearly after this conversation. I have not that freedom, that spiritual uplifting, that I had directly after I gave myself to the Lord, to do His will and His way, irrespective of consequences. I am disposed to take myself into my own hands, and work myself, in the place of giving myself unreservedly to God to be worked by His holy mind and will.",
