    "word": "Elder I. H. Evans read the story of the raising of Lazarus from the dead, as recorded in the eleventh chapter of John. Jesus has declared: \"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die.\" Elder Evans also read, from the apostle Paul's inspired testimony in 1 Corinthians 15, many positive and \n                                                                           480\ncomforting assurances concerning the resurrection of the righteous. \"If there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.\" \"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.\" \"In Christ shall all be made alive.\" \"Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\" \"Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.\" \n\n\n     \"We may sleep, but not forever; \n       There will be a glorious dawn; \n      We shall meet to part, no, never, \n       On the resurrection morn. \n      From the deepest caves of ocean, \n        From the desert and the plain, \n      From the valley and the mountain, \n        Countless throngs shall rise again.\"",
