    "word": "We are called now to be educated, that we may do the work that God has assigned to us, and it will not crush out our life.

We must now do all in our power to seek personal consecration to God. It is not more mighty men, not more talented men, not more learned men, that we need in the presentation of the truth for this time; but men who have a knowledge of God and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent.",
