    "word": "We are not to institute schools of scholastic philosophy or for the so-called \"higher education.\" We are to understand that our greatness consists in honoring God by simple, practical experience in the humble, everyday life. We need to walk with God, to bring Him into our homes. Grasp the hand of Christ and say, I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me. He will respond, Keep near to Me; I will hold your hand. My grasp shall never relax. Possess your soul in patience, in humbleness, in meekness, and yet say, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee\" [Isaiah 60:1].",
