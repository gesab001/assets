    "word": "The Lord has accepted all who have put forth unselfish effort for the uplifting of these, the most needy of his creatures. God desires men and women to labor for the colored people, keeping in view their essential good. He does not favor the most favored, to the neglect of the colored and white people who are of a lower grade. He does not leave those in need of assistance without help or notice.",
