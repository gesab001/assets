    "word": "Here are an ignorant people; they do not know anything about the truth; they have been educated by the ministers that this is so and that is so. When the Word of God is explained to the people, when it is presented in its purity, and they see what the Word of God says, what are they going to do? There are very few that will take their position on that Word. But I tell you, be very careful how you handle the Word, because that Word is to make the decisions with the people. Let the Word cut, and not your words. But when they make their decision, what will it be?--Manuscript 42, 1894.",
