My husband should do all he can do with calmness, with unselfish motives, and then welcome all to act their part in planning and executing. Should they fail in any of their undertakings, they should not therefore be deemed unqualified for the work; for to err is human. They should not become discouraged, but should endeavor to learn by every apparent failure how to make a success of the next effort. And if they connect with the Source of wisdom they will surely succeed.",
