    "word": "Satan was not a rough specimen of humanity. He had been one of the highest angels next to Christ. All his beauty, and intelligence, and excellence was derived from God. But he misapplied his powers, broke his connection with God, and apostatized. And by practice he has an ever-increasing knowledge of transgression. He has an ever-increasing energy in using that acquired knowledge. Thought is poisoned, and the force of wickedness, the abuse of his powers to hurt and destroy God's heritage, will measure the daring of humanity, and their cruel satanic treatment of man against his fellow man. The more pain they can cause, the more complete is their work in destroying God's heritage, and the more joy they give to the fallen apostate.",
