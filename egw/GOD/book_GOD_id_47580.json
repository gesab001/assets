    "word": "17, 18 (Romans 8:18; 1 Peter 1:6, 7; see EGW on 2 Corinthians 12:4). Trials God's Workmen.--[2 Corinthians 4:17, 18 quoted.] If Paul, troubled on every side, perplexed, persecuted, could call his trials light afflictions, of what has the Christian of today to complain? How trifling are our trials in comparison with Paul's many afflictions! They are not worthy to be compared with the eternal weight of glory awaiting the overcomer. They are God's workmen, ordained for the perfection of character. However great the deprivation and suffering of the Christian, however dark and inscrutable may seem the way of Providence, he is to rejoice in the Lord, knowing that all is working for his good (RH May 6, 1902).",
