    "word": "Elder Rice has been very imprudent with Mrs., or Sister Heald, and I have handled this familiarity with decision in the fear of God under a great burden. Elder Rice was warned but he persistently kept on his course. He stated that it was his privilege for the superintendent to ride with the matron, and he told me, quite aggrieved, that the church members had much talk of his always taking Sister Heald to the meeting. When the matter came up in the camp meeting at Oakland in the presence of about twenty, he justified himself that he had, he said, been spoken to in regard to Sister Heald's riding with him and her husband's not being with them, but he knew that this was no moral wrong and therefore he went on just the same.",
