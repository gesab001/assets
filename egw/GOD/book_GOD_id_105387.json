    "word": "General Interests of the Cause \nDear Brother: \n\n\n     At half past two in the morning, while the house is locked in slumber, I commence penning these lines to you. I think of the large church at Battle Creek, and of the important interests centered there, which makes it a missionary field in the highest sense. People are coming from all parts of the world to the Sanitarium, and many youth from the different States are attending the College. That field requires the very best methods of labor, that the strongest religious influence may be constantly exerted upon all. God would have men cultivate their abilities, that they may have broader ideas in planning and executing his work. When this is done, the saving power of the grace of Christ will be manifested by those who believe present truth.",
