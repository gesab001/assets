    "word": "Christ is moving upon hearts. Shall those who have had the messages of truth for years continue to need a reconversion? Some give evidence that they do not discern the working of the Spirit of God. They manifest a spirit to tear down and pull down. Every thread of a spirit of domineering needs to be taken away. The Lord has a mighty work to be done by those who will let themselves be worked by Him.--Letter 314, Oct. 2, 1906, to O. A. Olsen, president of the Australian Union Conference.",
