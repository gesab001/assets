    "word": "I long to see you improving the capabilities given you by God so that you can respond to the inquiry, \"What must I do to be saved?\" Let the words fall from sanctified lips, \"Be saved by accepting Christ by faith as your personal Saviour.\" God is love. The sinner need not perish if he will exercise faith in the wonderful efficacy of the cross of Christ. The cross is the stupendous expedient by which is harmonized the love and justice of God. It is the sinner's only means of salvation.",
