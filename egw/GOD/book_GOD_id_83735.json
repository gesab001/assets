    "word": "We are not to spend means unnecessarily, but we must do an extensive work to gather in souls, for time is short. The Lord is coming. He that is to come will come and will not tarry. We are not told the appointed time, but we know that the coming is very near. We have been so backward in giving the real message! Unless we arouse, we can not be saved ourselves, for we have not gained the experience of being workers together with God. We are to be His instrumentalities, His agents. With all the strength of our influence, we are to try to bring souls to a knowledge of the truth.",
