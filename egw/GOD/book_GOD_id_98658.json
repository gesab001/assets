    "word": "The Lord will sustain and up hold Dr. Kellogg as his man of opportunity just as long as Dr. Kellogg will stand true and steadfast to the principles of truth. The Lord sees the work he is doing in the medical missionary line. This work is not in any way to stand separate from the ministry. The ministry must not be divorced from this work, and the Lord would have the church act a part in this work. Every talent in our churches should be employed in the work of doing good. The rough places of nature, the wild places, God has made attractive, by placing beautiful things among the most unattractive. This is the work we are called to do. But the medical missionary work must not become disproportionate. It must be a work that is in order with the rest of the work.",
