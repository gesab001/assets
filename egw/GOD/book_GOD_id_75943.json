    "word": "The Rebuilding of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. \n\n\n     The Battle Creek Sanitarium was erected against the expressed will of God. Presidents of Conferences and others were consulted, it is true, and they assented to the plans presented, because they did not desire to differ with the leader of the medical work when they could possibly agree with him. And besides, they had not received all the messages that he had received. Those who had not seen the testimonies that the leaders in the medical work had seen, were not responsible for what they did not know.",
