    "word": "The sinner must be labored for perseveringly, earnestly, wisely, until he shall see that he is a transgressor of God's law, and shall exercise repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. When the sinner is conscious of his helpless condition, and feels his need of a Saviour, he may come with faith and hope to \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Christ will accept the soul who comes to Him in true repentance. A broken and a contrite heart He will not despise.",
