    "word": "But I must not write more. I have for three mornings been up at two o'clock to write, but I have only written a small amount of that which I designed to send.

Care must be used, economy practiced from the very highest motives, leaving all expenditures with God Himself, for it is God's money we are handling, and we can limit the supply by our want of foresight.",
