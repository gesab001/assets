    "word": "As you stand here today, and see the defects of your characters in the light of God's great moral standard, will you not say, \"I will redeem the past; I will go to work in the Lord's vineyard\"? By living faith will you not grasp the promises of God, and appropriate Christ's righteousness, and find the light of heaven shining in your life? You are to bring Christ into your every thought and action. A defective link in a chain makes it worthless, and a defect in your character will unfit you to enter the kingdom of heaven. You must set everything in order. But you cannot do this great work without divine aid. Are you ready to accept the promises of God, and to make them your own by living faith in his immutable word?",
