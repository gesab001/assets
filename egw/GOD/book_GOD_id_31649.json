    "word": "To Train Every Power of Mind and Body.--God has given to every human being a brain. He desires that it shall be used to His glory. . . . We have none too much brain power or reasoning faculties. We are to educate and train every power of mind and body--the human mechanism that Christ has bought--in order that we may put it to the best possible use. We are to do all we can to strengthen these powers, for God is pleased to have us become more and still more efficient colaborers with Him.--Sermon at St. Helena Sanitarium, Jan 23, 1904. (1SM 100.)",
