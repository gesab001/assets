    "word": "Brother _____ does too much, while Brother _____ needs to weave into his work more life and spirit. His temperament is more sluggish, and needs the quickening influence of the Spirit of God. He needs greater earnestness and vitality, to represent the importance of the truth to the people. He should be more thoroughly devoted to the work, and not have his interests divided. He allows things of minor importance to draw his mind away from the work, when it should be concentrated on his ministerial duties.",
