    "word": "Today in His great harvest-field God has need of sowers and of reapers. Let those who go forth into the work, some to sow and some to reap, remember that they are never to take to themselves the glory for the success of their work. God's appointed agencies have been before them, preparing the way for the sowing of the seed and the reaping of the harvest. \"I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor,\" Christ said; \"other men labored, and ye are entered into their labors.\" [John 4:38.]",
