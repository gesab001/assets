    "word": "A sacred trust. \n\n\n     \"Every child born into the home is a sacred trust. God says to the parents, 'Take this child and bring it up for me, that it may be an honor \n                                                                           22\nto my name, and a channel through which my blessing shall flow to the world.' . . . Something more is called for than a partial, onesided education. . . . The first lessons are of great importance. It is customary to send very young children to school.\"--Sp. T. on Ed., pp. 36, 37.",
