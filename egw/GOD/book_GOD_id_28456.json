    "word": "In Christ is the tenderness of the shepherd, the affection of the parent, and the matchless grace of the compassionate Saviour. His blessings He presents in the most alluring terms. He is not content merely to announce these blessings; He presents them in the most attractive way, to excite a desire to possess them. So His servants are to present the riches of the glory of the unspeakable Gift. The wonderful love of Christ will melt and subdue hearts, when the mere reiteration of doctrines would accomplish nothing. . . . Christ is sitting for His portrait in every disciple. Every one God has predestinated to be \"conformed to the image of his Son\" (Romans 8:29). In every one Christ's long-suffering love, His holiness, meekness, mercy, and truth are to be manifested to the world (The Desire of Ages, pp. 826, 827). \n                                                                           221",
