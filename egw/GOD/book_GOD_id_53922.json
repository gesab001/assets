    "word": "The instructions given in the word of God in regard to helping the poor do not touch such cases, but are for the unfortunate and afflicted. God in his providence has afflicted individuals to test and prove others. Widows and invalids are in the church to prove a blessing to the church. They are part of the means God has chosen to develop the true character of Christ's professed followers, and to call into exercise the precious traits of character manifested by our compassionate Redeemer.",
