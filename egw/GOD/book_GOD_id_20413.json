    "word": "Our faith is weak, our sense of God's requirements feeble. We must awake to duty. We must be endowed with power from on high. Instead of resting satisfied with our present attainments, let us cherish a longing desire that our lips may be purified, and touched with a live coal from off the altar. The words of God to us must come to the people, not in a hesitating, doubting manner, but with earnestness and power. We must pray more fervently, more perseveringly, that God may work in us and by us. In these days of multiplied popular fables, there is no way to reach the people only as God works through our efforts. Angels are commissioned to be our helpers. They are passing between earth and heaven, bearing upward the record of the doings of all the children of men.",
