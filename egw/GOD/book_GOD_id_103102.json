They would better be falling into line; for their own soul's sake and for the sake of the souls of others. \"If we walk in the light as He is in the light, the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.\" It is nothing to the credit of any man to start on a new track using scriptures to substantiate theories of error, leading minds into confusion, away from the truths that are to be indelibly impressed on the minds of God's people, that they may hold fast to the faith. \n                           (Signed) Ellen G.
