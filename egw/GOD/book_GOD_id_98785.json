    "word": "My brother, humble yourself, and follow in the footsteps of Christ. When you do this, you will be a happy man. When you walk in Christian companionship with God's ministers, recognizing the fact that God has given a work to them, as verily as He has to you, there will be sweet fellowship among you. But just as surely as you seek for the preeminence, so surely will you show your weakness by supposing that you should have the glory for that which you have accomplished.",
