    "word": "I am instructed that those who believe in the present truth, and who are set as guides to the people of God, are not to become engaged in commercial pursuits. Their minds must not become so absorbed that they cannot distinguish between the sacred and the common. A strife for victory in business deals will develop a pugilistic spirit, a spirit that is spoiling the record of some of our brethren in Los Angeles. Such a course will develop in these brethren characters that may not now be clearly discerned. We are to educate the mind in pleasant considerations of divine things. But those who suppose that they are to guide other minds, must in a most earnest manner seek the Lord.",
