    "word": "Through every hour, through all ages, God's love stands revealed as without a parallel. When the fulness of time was come, a suitable channel was prepared in Christ Jesus, through whom the streams of heavenly grace could be poured into the world. God so loved that He made a gift to the world which defies all computation. That the abundance of His grace should be revealed, he could not give less than the fulness, nor was it possible for Him to give more.--Manuscript 25, 1890. (Written at Battle Creek, Michigan, January 7-9, 1890.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.C. December, 1983",
