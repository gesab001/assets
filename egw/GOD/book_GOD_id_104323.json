    "word": "Growing in Grace \n\n     No Christian reaches the highest point of attainment that overloads himself with worries about this world or in carrying his pet sins along with him. We can and should breathe a purer atmosphere and taste more heavenly joys. We need Jesus every day and with His strength we may gain strength, yes, grow in grace for heavier conflicts and obtain inspiring views of heavenly things. The pierced hand of our divine Master holds the signal for us to come up higher. \"This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\" O that we might arise and shine, for our light has come and the glory of the Lord hath arisen upon us. The more closely we copy the Pattern the more wisdom and intelligence we will have of His matchless loveliness.--MS. 10, 1889.",
