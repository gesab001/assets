    "word": "There are many novices in the medical profession, men who have wicked hearts, who take advantage of their position, and corrupt not only the souls but the bodies of those under their care. Their reward in the day of final account will be according to their works. Only daily faith in Christ will make and keep the physician pure before God; for Satan will stand at the side of the physician to tempt him, to open avenues to practice dishonesty, to commit grave sins under the cloak of his profession.

He reads \n                                                                           213\nmy every thought, and notices my every action. I will be a faithful servant of Jesus Christ. I will be one who shall preserve honor, honesty, and truth. I will have the tenderness, the compassion, the mercy, and longsuffering of Jesus. I will comfort, I will bless this sufferer. If Jesus will work with me, I will be a helper to the needy.\"",
