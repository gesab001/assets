    "word": "Every man who praises himself, brushes the lustre from his best efforts. A truly noble character will not stop to resent the false accusations of enemies; every word spoken falls harmless; for it strengthens that which it cannot overthrow. The Lord would have his people closely united with himself, the God of patience and love. All should manifest in their lives the love of Christ. Let none venture to belittle the reputation or the position of another; this is egotism. It is saying, \"I am so much better and more capable than you, that God gives me the preference. You are not of much account.\"",
