    "word": "Thus the commandments of God were made of little account by their traditions, while their own ideas and notions were binding heavy burdens and grievous to be borne. They were separating themselves such a great distance from the people that their influence could not reach them. They were giving altogether a wrong impression of the truth. There would be just such impressions given as would please Satan, that the Sabbathkeeping Adventists be regarded as a set of fanatics and extremists. The Lord's precious cause is not exalted, but the impression given to unbelievers is that it is the doctrine that makes them unkind, uncourteous, and really unchristian, in their character.",
