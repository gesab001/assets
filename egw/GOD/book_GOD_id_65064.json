A Public Evangelist [THE EVANGELIST TO WHOM THESE LETTERS \n    WERE WRITTEN SOMETIMES CONDUCTED SEVERAL SERIES OF MEETINGS IN ONE \n    AREA, THEN MOVED AWAY TO THE NEXT WHILE HIS WIFE REMAINED TO CARRY \n    ON WITH THE INTEREST AND FOLLOW UP WITH BIBLE STUDIES. THIS \n    SITUATION WAS FAR FROM IDEAL. HE FINALLY FELL INTO THE SIN OF \n    ADULTERY AND EVEN REJECTED THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY AND THE COUNSEL \n    OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE LEADERS. THE REVIEW AND HERALD ANNOUNCED \n    THAT HIS CREDENTIALS WERE REVOKED. A FEW YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH HE \n    REPENTED AND RETURNED TO THE LORD.] \n\n\n     Strong to Move Crowds, Weak to Manage Self. You will see before this reaches you that the Lord has again visited \n                                                                           167\nHis people by giving me a testimony. In this view I was shown that you were not standing in the clear light and you are in danger of bringing a reproach upon the cause of God by moving as you happen to feel. It is Satan's intent to destroy you. He is seeking to keep your mind in a constant state of agitation, stirring it up that it may cast up mire and dirt instead of the peaceful fruits of righteousness. . . .",
