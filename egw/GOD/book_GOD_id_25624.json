    "word": "Christ gave Himself a sacrifice for the world. He cheerfully gave His own life as a ransom for an apostate world, and he does not design that selfishness and worldliness shall exist in the hearts of His followers. Conformity to the world is expressly forbidden by the Word of God. . . . God's chosen ones are to be just what He meant they should be, and what the apostle declares they are--\"a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men\" (2 Corinthians 4:9).",
