    "word": "Man's Stewardship.--There is a yet deeper significance to the golden rule. Everyone who has been made a steward of the manifold grace of God, is called upon to impart to souls in ignorance and darkness, even as, were he in their place, he would desire them to impart to him. The apostle Paul said, \"I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.\" By all that you have known of the love of God, by all that you have received of the rich gifts of His grace, above the most benighted and degraded soul upon the earth, are you in debt to that soul to impart these gifts unto him.-- Mount of Blessing, p. 193.
