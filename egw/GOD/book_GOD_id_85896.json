    "word": "\"The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\" What a representation. Is there not danger, great danger, of the appetite for story books being cultivated? Is there not danger of many becoming intoxicated by a class of reading that gives no real strength to the mind or solidity to the character? Let there be less recommendation of books which are fables. Do not encourage the publication of books of this character. The word of God, if earnestly pursued and diligently studied, will make man wise unto salvation.--Letter 76, 1900, p. 2. (To Elder G. A. Irwin, May 22, 1900.)",
