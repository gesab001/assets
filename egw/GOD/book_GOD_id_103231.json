    "word": "Let us remember that there is need of sanctified pens and sanctified tongues. When we as a people live as God would be pleased to have us live, we shall see the deep movings of His Spirit. Much will then be done for those who have never heard the truth. In our work for unbelievers we may expect to hear much that is not ordered by God. But let us remember that those who speak these words do not know any better. Let us pray for them, and approach them in discretion and with Christlike tenderness. Those who oppose the counsel of God against themselves need gentle dealing. God can at any time so move upon hearts by His Holy Spirit that they will be prepared to receive the truth and unite with His commandment-keeping people. \n                              Ellen G. White. \n\n                                               -",
