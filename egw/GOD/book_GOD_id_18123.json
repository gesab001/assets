    "word": "These lessons Christ gave in His teaching, showing that the ritual service was passing away, and possessed no virtue. \"The hour cometh,\" He said, \"and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God is a Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.\" True circumcision is the worship of Christ in spirit and truth, not in forms and ceremonies, with hypocritical pretense.",
