    "word": "Tithing Founded on Principle. \n\n     The special system of tithing was founded upon a principle which is as enduring as the law of God. This system of tithing was a blessing to the Jews, else God would not have given it to them. So also will it be a blessing to those who carry it out to the end of time. Our heavenly Father did not originate the plan of systematic benevolence to enrich himself but to be a great blessing to man. He saw that this system of beneficence was just what man needed.",
