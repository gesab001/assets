    "word": "The members of the Christian church are designed expressly by God to live the Christ-life, and to diffuse the influence of the cross. When this is done as God requires, Christian missions will furnish a striking illustration of the power of the principles of Christ. The wonderful efficacy of the cross will be seen and felt. The power of the love of Christ, \"that passeth knowledge,\" will be revealed. The kingdom of God is founded upon infinite love, compassion, and purity. In perfect obedience is found perfect joy.",
