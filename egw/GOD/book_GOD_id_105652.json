Strother.\nDear Brother:\n     I have this morning received and read your letter. I am sorry because of your discouragement. I am sorry that your feelings are not so pleasant as you could wish them to be. But you must not feel that an exalted, uplifted feeling is the sign of your acceptance with God. You need to exercise faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. You must not be discouraged. Feeling is\n115\nnot always reliable. You have the written Word. To love and fear God is the duty of every believing soul.",
