    "word": "\u201cAs I was fully convinced,\u201d says Miller, \u201cthat all Scripture given by inspiration of God is profitable; [2 Timothy 3:16.] that it came not at any time by the will of man, but was written as holy men were moved by the Holy Ghost, [2 Peter 1:21.] and was written \u2018for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, [Romans 15:4.] I could not but regard the chronological portions of the Bible as being as much entitled to our serious consideration as any other portion of the Scriptures. I felt therefore that in endeavoring to comprehend what God in his mercy had seen fit to reveal to us, I had no right to pass over the prophetic periods.\u201d",
