    "word": "When Christ cried, \"It is finished,\" God's unseen hand rent the strong fabric composing the veil of the Temple from top to bottom. The way into the Holiest of all was made manifest. God bowed His head satisfied. Now His justice and mercy could blend. He could be just, and yet the justifier of all who should believe on Christ. He looked upon the victim expiring on the cross, and said, \"It is finished. The human race shall have another trial.\" The redemption price was paid, and Satan fell like lightning from heaven.",
