    "word": "Lord's Business Demands Order--The Lord is not pleased with the present lack of order and accuracy among those who do business in connection with His work.  Even in the business meetings of the conference, much time could be saved and many mistakes avoided, by a little more study and punctuality.  Everything that bears any relation to the work of God should be as nearly perfect as human brains and hands can make it.--Gospel Workers, p. 460.",
