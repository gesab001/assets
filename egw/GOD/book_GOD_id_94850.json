    "word": "When I heard of this favor that the Lord had bestowed upon His old, faithful workers, I thanked Him with heart and soul. These brethren have borne the burden in the heat of the day. They carried on their shoulders the burden of raising funds for the building up of our institutions in the beginning. Together with my husband and myself, they bore all the load under which they could stand. They united with us in the early stages of the work, and ever since then their one aim has been the upbuilding of the cause of God in our world.",
