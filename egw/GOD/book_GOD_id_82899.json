    "word": "I am instructed to say to our colored laborers: Be kind in your families. Do not bring into the home circle any of the spirit or the customs of slavery. \n\n\n                                      -79- \n\nLet no harsh words be heard in your homes. Overcome disorderly habits. Never indulge a harsh, authoritative manner. Never treat your wife as your slave. Remember that you are members of the Lord's family, and that in this world you are to give an example of what the Lord expects the members of His family to be. Your lips are to be sanctified to the Lord's service. You are to be Christlike in word and act. You may have witnessed much tyranny on the part of those who looked upon the Negro as their property, to be treated as they pleased, but because of this you are not yourself in your home to be a tyrant. God is the owner of all human beings.",
