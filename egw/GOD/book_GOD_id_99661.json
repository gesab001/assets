    "word": "Satan finds ample opportunity to sow tares in the soil that is all prepared for the seed. If he can secure for his agents those who know the truth, through them he can come to others who have assembled to worship God, and the seeds of unbelief cherished in one mind, will find an entrance into the minds of many others. But although Satan may work diligently, we need not be discouraged; for the Captain of the Lord's host has said, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;\" \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world;\" \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\"",
