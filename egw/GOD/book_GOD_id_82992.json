    "word": "I had some conversation with Elder Matteson in regard to whether children of unbelieving parents would be saved. I related that a sister had with great anxiety asked me this question, stating that some had told her that the little children of unbelieving parents would not be saved. This we should consider as one of the questions we are not at liberty to express a position or an opinion upon, for the simple reason that God has not told us definitely about this \n\n\n                                    -147- \n\nmatter in His Word. If He thought it was essential for us to know, He would have told us plainly.",
