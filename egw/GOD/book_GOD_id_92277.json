    "word": "When you see yourself as God sees you, you will possess genuine humility, not humility put on for special occasions but a principle that is abiding. You cannot be clear before God and prepared for His appearing unless you put away every wrong from you. It will be a most difficult lesson for you to learn true humility. While you appear to be at times very humble, there is a self-esteem, a self-devotion, a high opinion of yourself which leads to dangers that you do \n\n\n                                   -101- \n\nnot discern.

There is earnest work before you. You must be a different man.",
