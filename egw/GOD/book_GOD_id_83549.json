    "word": "(Walling's Mills, Colorado,) Sabbath, July 27, 1872. We arose this beautiful morning with some sense of the goodness and mercy of God to us. This is our first Sabbath among the mountains. James, Sister Hall, and myself took a blanket and walked out to the shelter of the fragrant evergreens, rolled up a stone for seats, and I read a portion of my manuscript to my husband. In the afternoon. . . . we read about sixty pages of Great Controversy, or Spiritual Gifts. . . . We closed the Sabbath of the Lord with prayer.",
