    "word": "I am sorry that San Francisco and Oakland could not have had labor which God designed should be the case while we were in California to help with our testimony. The purpose of God has not been carried out. Someone who has neglected duty will be held accountable. I hope it is not you, but I dreamed it was you that held laborers from coming to California by wrong views and ideas of your own, and men would have come had you not hindered them by your version of things. Your very words, your very attitude, were given me in a plain dream. These men would have been at work now if you had not hindered them. I was forbidden in a dream from saying one word more in urging men to come who had been publicly invited.",
