    "word": "During the Conference at Battle Creek, when the question of the law in Galatians was being examined, \n                                                                           405\nI was taken to a number of houses, and heard the unchristian remarks and criticisms made by delegates. Then these words were spoken: \"They must have the truth as it is in Jesus, else it will not be a saving truth to them.\" \"Without me,\" says Christ, \"ye can do nothing.\" When finite men shall cease to put themselves in the way, to hinder, then God will work in our midst as never before.",
