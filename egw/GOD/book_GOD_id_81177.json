    "word": "In trading with the merchants at Allegan, Bro. and St. Rumery do not take a course which is pleasing to God. They will dicker to get things as cheap as they possibly can, and linger over a few pennies difference, and talk in regard to it as though money was their all--their God. If they could only be brought back, unobserved, to hear the remarks that are made after they leave, they \n                                                                           35\nwould get a clearer idea of the influence of penuriousness. Our faith is brought into disrepute, and God is blasphemed, by some, on account of this close, selfish dealing. Angels turn from this close, penny deal, in disgust. Everything in Heaven is noble and elevated. All are seeking the interest and happiness of others. No mind is devoted to looking out and caring for self. It is the chief joy of all holy beings to witness the joy and happiness of those around them.",
