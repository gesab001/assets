    "word": "There the loves and sympathies that God has planted in the soul will find truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy beings, the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the faithful ones of all ages, the sacred fellowship that binds together \"the whole family in heaven and earth\"--all are among the experiences of the hereafter. . . .
