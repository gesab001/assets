    "word": "The Holy Spirit is promised to all who will ask for it. When you search the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit is by your side, personating Jesus Christ. The truth is a living principle made to shine in precious clearness to the understanding, and then, oh, then, it is time to speak words from the living Christ. \"We are labourers together with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). Christ said to the woman of Samaria, \"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. . . . A well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (John 4:10-14).",
