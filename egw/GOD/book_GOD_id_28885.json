    "word": "The judgment will be conducted in accordance with the rules God has laid down. By the law which men are now called upon to obey, but which many refuse to accept, all will be judged. As by it character is tested, every man will find his proper place in one of two classes. He will either be holy to the Lord through obedience to His law, or be stained with sin through transgression. . . . He will place the sheep on His right hand, and the goats on His left. Then men and women will see that their course of action has decided their destiny (Review and Herald, June 18, 1901).",
