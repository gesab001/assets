    "word": "O that our brethren and sisters might appreciate the value of truth, and become purified through the truth. O that they might realize their duty to communicate the truth to others. But they do not feel the importance of living the truth, of being doers of the words of Christ. They are self-sufficient, and cannot carry out in practice the missionary spirit that should animate the disciples of Christ. If they knew what it was to have travail of soul for others, angels of God would work through them to communicate the knowledge of truth to others, and to make them channels of blessings to others. They would know the truth, and the truth would make them free. Spiritual truth is needed to penetrate the masses everywhere. Then money would no longer be expended in adding building to building, but would be used in opening up new fields, in planting the standard of truth in cities that have not yet been worked. The elevating, purifying, ennobling principles would be introduced, and would work like leaven in society. But O how little do many know who are bearing responsibilities, and who think they know much of the practical truth as it is in Jesus.",
