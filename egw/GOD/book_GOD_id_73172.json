    "word": "Part of the Sanctuary System--In bringing to the temple the sacred ark containing the two tables of stone on which were written by the finger of God the precepts of the Decalogue, Solomon had followed the example of his father David. Every six paces he sacrificed. With singing and with music and with great ceremony, \"the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place.\". . . As they came out of the inner sanctuary, they took the positions assigned them. The singers--Levites arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps-- stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets. [See 2 Chronicles 5:7, 12.]--PK 38, 39.",
