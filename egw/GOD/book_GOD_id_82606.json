    "word": "The visions are either of God or the devil. There is no half-way position to be taken in the matter. God does not work in partnership with Satan. Those who occupy this position cannot stand there long. They go a step farther and account the instrument God has used a deceiver and the woman Jezebel. If after they had taken the first step it should be told them what position they would soon occupy in regard to the visions, they would have resented it as a thing impossible. But Satan leads then on blindfolded in a perfect deception in regard to the true state of their feelings until he takes them in his snare. Letter 8, 1860, pp. 16, 17. (To Brother John Andrews, June 11, 1860.)",
