    "word": "I want you both to feel that now is your day of grace, your day of repentance. Now, while it is called today, harden not your hearts. Seek for the renewing grace of Christ. Learn to be as lenient toward others as you wish God and others to be toward you. Have the forgiving love of Jesus in your hearts, that Jesus may forgive you. The spirit of retaliation must be banished from the heart before the Holy Spirit can abide in the soul. [Ephesians 4:23, 24, 29-32, quoted.]",
