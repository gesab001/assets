    "word": "Those who sow the seed, who present before large and small gatherings the testing truths for this time, at the cost of much labor, may not always gather the harvest. After they have done their work and rest from their labors, other men of God's appointment may go over the ground, and under their labors many souls may see the truth. Adversity, sorrow, loss of property, changes of God's providence, recall to their minds with vivid distinctness the words spoken by the faithful servants of God many years before. Thus the way is prepared for the finishing of the work of the sower, for the reaping of the harvest. There is much rejoicing as the precious fruit is gathered.",
