    "word": "Circumstances will not justify anyone in working upon the Sabbath for the sake of worldly profit. If God excuses one man, He may excuse all. Why may not Brother L, who is a poor man, work upon the Sabbath to earn means for a livelihood when he might by so doing be better able to support his family? Why may not other brethren, or all of us, keep the Sabbath only when it is convenient to do so? The voice from Sinai makes answer: \"Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.\" Exodus 20:9,10.",
