    "word": "The benefits that God bestows are daily renewed, and should be gratefully remembered and acknowledged. Should the Lord deal with men according to their sins, according to their underhand dealing, their departure from righteousness, how changed all would be. His blessings would be withdrawn; his indignation and wrath would be manifested. But he bears long. He allows misfortune and loss to come upon the wrong-doer. If this does not bring him to repentance, he comes close to him in affliction. If none of these things succeed in drawing him to the Saviour, he cuts down the fruitless tree.",
