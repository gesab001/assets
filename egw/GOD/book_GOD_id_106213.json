    "word": "But the Lord loves you yet. Now let us praise God for that. Now let us take hold of the work in a new way. Let us take hold of the work with heart and mind and soul. Do not pick flaws any more. If I see a lot of buzzards, and I see a lot of vultures that are watching and waiting for dead bodies,--and we don't want anything of that. We want no picking of flaws in others. Attend to No. 1, and you got all that you \n\n\n                             -174- \n\ncan do.

God help you; I beseech of him to help you, every one of you, and to help me. I want help; I want strength.",
