    "word": "Every church, although imperfect, is dear to the heart of Christ. He knows every member by name. Those who are meek and lowly in heart are precious in his sight. He will be sanctified in those that draw near unto him. The man who loves and fears God will cease to think highly of his outward advantages. He will not aspire to be the greatest.",
