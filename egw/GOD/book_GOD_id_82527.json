    "word": "God's people are to stand as lights in the world. They are to realize that upon them rests the solemn responsibility of reflecting rays of light upon the pathway of those who are not keeping the commandments of God. Christ Himself has declared, \"Ye are the light of the world\" (Matthew 5:14). We are to seek to be light bearers. And when the light of divine truth shines forth with distinctness from the words and works of God's children, will there be seen any quarreling, any backbiting, among the light bearers? The world will see no dissension in the lives of those from whom the light of heaven is shed abroad. Brethren and sisters, as you let your light shine before men, they will \"see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 5:16). A precious influence will go forth as the result of these good works, that will bring salvation to those who behold it. God desires \n                                                                           259\nthat we keep our light constantly shining. Ms 95, 1906, p. 3.
