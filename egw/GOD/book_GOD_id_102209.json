    "word": "Lot's Experience \n\n     The state of the world now is similar to that which existed in the days of Lot, when Sodom's corruption called for the angels visit to that wicked city, to see whether the cries coming up before heaven were of such a character that the inhabitants of beautiful Sodom--a city that had been so highly favored of God--had so corrupted their ways before the Lord that there was no hope of redemption. God's wrath was revealed so signally because the corruption of the Sodomites was extended so deep. The heavenly visitants could see for themselves that the Sodomites had passed the limits of divine forbearance.",
