Tenny and wife, Eld. Daniells and wife, Bro. Stockton and Bro. Smyth, we had indeed a most precious season. We were all blessed. We felt that Jesus was in our midst. I did believe the Lord would restore me. That night I slept little, the next day arms and shoulders relieved, walked better, but not restored. The two last days have been days of pain, and suffering. But I am sustained by the grace of Christ. How thankful I should be and I am indeed that I am a child of God. I do not doubt this, I have seen those who had no hope in God, no faith in His word, when thus afflicted, cursing and swearing and my heart is constantly praising the Lord, because I can look to Him, as One able to help me. One who loves me, who will restore me, in His own good time. Will I trust myself in His hands? I will, He has been very nigh unto me, the last five months of trial. He does not willingly afflict or grieve His children of men.",
