    "word": "You will feel the death of your mother very keenly; but let me tell you that I sorrow not for the righteous dead, but for the living. I know that you have laid your mother in the tomb in the full hope that she will come forth when the trump of God shall sound. . . . I know what it means to bury loved ones. My father, mother, brothers and sisters, my husband and two of my sons, are sleeping in their graves. My sister Mary and I and my two sons are all that are left.--Letter 98, 1903. \n                                                                           262",
