    "word": "(289) Brother and Sister Burden, you are to unite in being a blessing in spiritual lines. The Lord will bless you, and make you a blessing. You must not be encouraged to take upon yourselves the responsibility of conducting a large business in the health food line. We must all fill our appointed places, and become like-minded with God. Then we shall not fail nor be discouraged. The strength and power and influence of the Word will be revealed in Christ-like tenderness, through the softening subduing influence of the Holy Spirit of God.",
