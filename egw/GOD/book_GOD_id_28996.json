    "word": "God does not expect that with their different temperaments His people will each be prepared for any and every place. Let us all remember that there are varied trusts. It is not the work of any man to prescribe the work of any other man, contrary to his own convictions of duty. \n15\nIt is right to give counsel and suggest plans, but every man should be left free to seek directions from God, whose he is, and whom he serves.",
