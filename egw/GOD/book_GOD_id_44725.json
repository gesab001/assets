    "word": "The Lord had entrusted to the unfaithful servant not a large capital, but only one talent. That one talent the man did not invest for the interest of God; he hid it in the earth, complaining that the Lord was a hard Master, reaping where He had not sown, and gathering where He had not strown. The selfishness he manifested, and the complaints he made, as though God would require of him that which He had no right to claim, showed that he did not know God, or Jesus Christ, whom He had sent. Everything he possessed was the Lord's own property, and was entrusted to him to use for God. When he says, \"I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth\" (Matthew 25:25), he acknowledged that the talent was from God.",
