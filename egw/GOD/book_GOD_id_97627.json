    "word": "This is labor; this is the kind of work that devolves upon every minister of Christ. And the reason why some of our ministers are almost faithless, why they are desponding and walking under a cloud, is because they do not work as faithful shepherds should, watching for souls as they that must give an account. True watchmen are faithful shepherds. The qualification of a minister is not his brilliant talents, for this knowledge might prove his ruin. It is the entire surrender of the heart to God, to be molded and impressed as God chooses.",
