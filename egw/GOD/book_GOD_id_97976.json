    "word": "-126- \n\n     There has been a class of work that has been handled, the publishing of some work here, that has not been for the very best influence about the institution or to give improvement to those that handle it, because God wants us, every one of us, to be His husbandmen. \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" Now consider that. You can do no more than the beast of the field without God. You can do no more in spiritual lines, anyone. It is to have God with you. \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" That is just why He gave us Jesus. He gave His only begotten Son to come down to this world, lay aside His glory, and clothe His divinity with humanity. He came here to bear all the trials that every human soul will bear, and far ahead, because according to His glorious character were His temptations such as the human soul can understand but little about.",
