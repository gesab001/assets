    "word": "During the Washington Council-meeting, Dr. Kellogg surrendered, and yet his spiritual discernment still seems beclouded. I speak plainly now; I have not spoken before, because of my hope that he would go to the root of these difficulties. But he has not done thorough work, and he gives evidence of great spiritual blindness; therefore I feel free to write as I have written, in order that my brethren may understand that Sister White is still under the supervision of God, and will not be led astray by any deceptive influences, --not even by Dr. Kellogg. I have suffered intensely. The Doctor feels that we are pressing him to the wall; but I can not do otherwise than that which I have done. I am now awaiting developments.",
