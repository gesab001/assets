    "word": "But what spiritual good, I ask, has been imparted to believers and unbelievers? What effort has been made to exalt the world's Redeemer? Christ has paid for your redemption with the infinite price of His precious blood. Had you accepted with gratitude this Gift, and appreciated it as you should, you would have sought to uplift Him before others, saying, The Saviour has given His precious life for you and for me. How do you suppose the Lord regards the half-hearted service that has been given Him? The \"Well done\" cannot be spoken of imperfect service; the Lord has not been honored in your daily experience. I now entreat of you to take upon yourselves the responsibility that you have not yet accepted of being laborers together with God, and fulfill faithfully the duties He requires of you.",
