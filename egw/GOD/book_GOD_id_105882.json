    "word": "Satan is the destroyer; and God is the restorer. He calls upon us to cooperate with Him by doing our utmost, by precept and example, to restore the moral image of God in man. It is our duty to engage in the work of helping our fellow men to stand in their God-given freedom, men of self-control, vessels unto honor. We can show ourselves of much value as colaborers with God by elevating the standard of temperance, by trying to raise our brethren from degradation, so that Christ shall not have died for them in vain. Thus we show our nobility as sons of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, and manifest our fitness for the immortal inheritance, which Christ has gone to prepare for us. All this we may be and do if we submit to the control of God.",
