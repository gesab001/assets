    "word": "Lay every care at the feet of the Redeemer. \"Ask, and ye shall receive.\" Work, and pray, and believe with the whole heart. Do not wait until the money is in your hands, before doing anything. Walk out by faith. God has declared that the standard of truth is to be planted in many places. Learn to believe, as you pray to God for help. Practice self-denial; for Christ's whole life on this earth was one of self-denial. He came to show us what we must be and do in order to gain eternal life.",
