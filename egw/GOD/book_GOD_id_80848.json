    "word": "Your course is causing great perplexity among those best acquainted with you. You seem to have a power \n\n\n                       [74] \n\nwhich many would think it is a sin to term anything but the power of God; but your influence does not tend to strengthen, establish, settle them as to the operations of the Spirit of God. They see you acting in direct opposition to your own work and your own teaching, and that which they suppose to be a divine influence seems to be so blended with the perversity of your nature that they know not how to distinguish between the two. The Lord has shown me that you employ human influence to move upon minds. In your labors it is often the case that that which is attributed to divine power is from a human source; you yourself have at times been amazed that your brethren and sisters should regard you as moved by the power of God. You are deceiving and being deceived.",
