    "word": "God has different sets of work men for the different branches of his cause. When those whom he has called to do a certain work, have carried that work along as far as they can with the ability he has given them, the Lord in his providence will call and qualify other men to come in and work with them, still making advance moves, that together they may carry it still farther, and lift the standard higher. He will never allow his work to diminish in strength for efficiency, if those to whom he has given their work will act their part with unswerving fidelity. There must be no (belittling) the men whom God has accepted as his workmen.",
