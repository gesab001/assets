    "word": "\u201cThere was a beautiful pink flower in the garden called the rose of Sharon. I remember approaching it and touching the delicate petals reverently; they seemed to possess a sacredness in my eyes. My heart overflowed with tenderness and love for these beautiful creations of God. I could see divine perfection in the flowers that adorned the earth. God tended them, and his all-seeing eye was upon them. He had made them and called them good. \n145\n'Ah,\u2019 thought I, \u2018If he so loves and cares for the flowers that he has decked with beauty, how much more tenderly will he guard the children who are formed in his image.\u2019 I repeated softly to myself, \u2018I am a child of God, his loving care is around me, I will be obedient and in no way displease him, but will praise his dear name and love him always.\u2019",
