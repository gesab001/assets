    "word": "If it were left to us to manage the interest of the cause of God in our own way and according to our disposition and strength, we would not need to expect much; but if self is hid with Christ in God, all our plans and methods will be wrought in God. God has imparted to us our moral powers and all our religious susceptibilities. We must draw nigh to God. We must be laborers together with Him, else weakness and mistakes will be seen in all we undertake. Let us have faith in God at every step. While we realize our own weakness, let us not be faithless, but believing. Let us learn the precious lesson you recently learned in Ballarat.",
