    "word": "Love has a twin sister, which is duty. Love and duty stand side by side. Love exercised while duty is neglected will make children headstrong, willful, perverse, selfish, and disobedient. If stern duty is left to stand alone without love to soften and win, it will have a similar result. Duty and love must be blended in order that children may be properly disciplined. Bro. and sister Smith's children are coming up unlovable and unloved. This is not as God would have it. This is a neglect of duty on their part, a work which they must take up and no longer neglect.",
