    "word": "\"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.\" I contemplate the great possibilities and probabilities in these last days for the people of God whose privilege it is to walk in the light as He is in the light. As we approach the end of earth's history we shall have increased power, proportionate to the trials to which we are subjected. We are not to keep ourselves in a state of worry and doubt, binding up our souls in the perplexities of unbelief and worldliness, in worrying and scolding and fretting, but wait on the Lord, in perfect obedience to His will, and we shall see the \n\n\n                                    -330- \n\nsalvation of God from day to day. He always gives strength as our day shall be--strength and grace proportionate to the trials and tests and conflicts we are obliged to meet.",
