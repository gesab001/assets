    "word": "Do not make it a business to serve yourselves and become indifferent in regard to the claims of God upon you. You are His property. Have fixed principles. Consider Jesus has bought you at an infinite cost. Your thoughts should be kept pure; they are the Lord's. Give them to Him. We can merit nothing from God. We can give Him nothing which is not His own. Will we keep back from God what is His own? Do not rob God and pawn His time, His talents, and His strength with the world. He asks your affections. Give them to Him. They are His own. He asks your time, moment by moment: give it to Him. It is His own. He asks your intellect: give it to Him. It is His own.",
