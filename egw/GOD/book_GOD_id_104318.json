    "word": "The Lord is speaking through His apostle to those who claim to be Christians. He is not speaking to those who have made no profession of righteousness. We are to make no concessions to the enemy. We are not to change one principle of the truth that we have received from God. We cannot hold converse with those who are in league with evil angels. Christ never purchased peace by compromise.--Undated MS. 131. \n\n                                               -\n  {1NL 124.10} \n \n                   New Glories of the Word of God \n\n     In the Scriptures thousands of gems of truth lie hidden from the surface-seeker. The mine of truth is never exhausted. The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will be your interest, and the more you will feel like exclaiming with Paul: \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\"  {1NL 124.11}  \n     Every day you should learn something new from the Scriptures. Search them as for hid treasures, for they contain the words of eternal life. Pray for wisdom and understanding to comprehend these holy writings. If you would do this, you would find new glories in the Word of God; you would feel that you had received new and precious light on subjects connected with the truth, and the Scriptures would be constantly receiving a new value in your estimation.--5T 266.  {1NL 124.12}  \n\nChap. 39 - Brace Your Souls for Action\n\nBy Ellen G. White\n\n     I ask the believers in Los Angeles to seek for a deeper, higher experience in the things of God. The Father seeketh such to worship Him. Arise, and brace your souls for action. Take an extensive survey of the work that is to be done. Read your Bibles with an increasing determination to have a larger experience in the things of God. Stand in the light of the Sun of Righteousness.",
