    "word": "John saw a company standing around the throne of God, and the angel asked him, Who are these in white robes? He answered, thou knowest. And the angel said, \"These are they who have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\" (See Revelation 7:13, 14). There is a fountain in which we may wash from every stain of impurity. And says the angel, \"He shall lead them to fountains of living waters, and shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\" (See v. 17.) This will be the happy privilege of those that have kept the commandments of God in the earth.",
