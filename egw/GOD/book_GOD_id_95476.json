    "word": "My heart is filled with gratitude for the goodness and mercy of God. My prayer goes up to heaven for grace, and the peace that passeth understanding is given me. I can trust the Lord Jesus to care for my weary body. I find in Him a present help in every time of need. His presence seems so real and is the evidence of His compassion. Sick or well, I feel that every power of body and mind should be employed in glorifying God. We are not our own, to please and gratify self. We have been purchased by the blood of Christ, and it is our daily duty as well as our privilege to consecrate all that we have and are to the Saviour.",
