    "word": "The Canvasser. \n\n     It is the canvasser's duty to cultivate the talents God has given him, to maintain his connection with God, to help always where he can. He has positive and constant need of the angelic ministration; for he has an important work to do, a work that he can not do in his own strength. \"Thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph through our Lord Jesus Christ, and maketh manifest the favor of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God as a sweet savor in Christ, in them that are saved and in them that perish. In the one we are as a savor \n                                                                           10\nof death unto death; and to the other the savor of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?\"",
