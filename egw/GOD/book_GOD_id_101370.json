    "word": "Your wife and children have not the love of God abiding in their hearts. Their love of selfish indulgence is so strong that they are stumbling blocks in the way of others. Those with whom they associate are not made better, but worse, by the association. Are you as a family, living epistles of God, known and read of all men? The spiritual life of the soul is quenched by the love of things of the world. Practical truth is not desired by you, Brother Lindsay, or by your family; therefore God can not preside in your hearts. As human agents, we are probationers, fitting for eternity. In giving you Jesus, God has given you all heaven. If you receive Him, you will have moral power to overcome all evil, and you will be a partaker of the divine nature. God calls upon you to eat of the bread of life, and drink of the water of life, by which He designs that you shall receive strength to be co-workers with God.",
