    "word": "In church capacity there are many things that we must do if we would be laborers together with God. If we would study Christ's methods, we would see many things to be reproved and corrected. But in doing this, we are to be sure to follow Christ's methods. Christ fellowship reveals duties to be performed and responsibilities to be borne. In all we are to follow Christ's example. In failing to deal faithfully with one who has erred, in refusing to speak kindly to him, we commit a grievous sin in the sight of God. In acting a harsh, stubborn part, in treating the one has made a mistake in accordance with our own unchristlike traits of character, we may discourage a soul that is in danger, and leave him to settle down into spiritual dwarfage, or to relapse into spiritual death.",
