    "word": "The Bible condemns every species of dishonesty and demands right-doing in all things. He who makes the Bible the guide of his youth, the light of his path, will obey its teachings in all things. He will not transgress one jot or tittle of the law in order to carry out his will or accomplish his object, even if he has to make any and every sacrifice in consequence. If he believes the Bible, he knows the blessing of God will not rest upon him if he departs from \n\n\n                                  -307- \n\nthe strict path of rectitude. Although he appears for a time to prosper, he will surely reap the fruit of his doings.",
