    "word": "The Father's Mercy. \n\n     When Moses besought God to show him his glory, the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, \"The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.\" It grieves the heart of God, as our Father, to let justice smite. He \"suffereth long and is kind.\" While men are hard-hearted, condemnatory, and willing to abandon the one who needs help that his soul may be saved from death, the Father, with heart filled with love for the sinner, opens his arms, and says, \"Child, come back to me.\" If the Lord were not full of mercy and abundant in goodness, we should not be the subjects of his grace and love today. He pardons abundantly, He entreats the sinner to confess his sin, to come to him and accept forgiveness. \n\n\n                     -16-",
