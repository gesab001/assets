    "word": "Those who are tempted and tried, whom you regard as so weak, may be nearer to the kingdom of God than yourself. The Lord requires that you should help those who need help most. Do not withdraw from them because they do not meet your ideas, or the consequence will be that you will indulge in a spirit of judging, and will manifest harsh dealing toward them. Whatever may be your profession, this kind of doing places you in the ranks of the enemy, where you execute his orders, and do his work. You may be entirely deceived in yourself, and in spirit say, \"Come, friends, see my zeal for the Lord,\" but the family in heaven do not take delight in any such exhibitions.",
