    "word": "I longed to hear those who had considered it a virtue to brace themselves against light and evidence acknowledge the movings of the Spirits of God, cast away their unbelief, and come to the light. I knew that unless they did this their path would become darker, for light unconfessed and unacknowledged and unimproved becomes darkness to those who refuse to receive it and walk in it. Up to this late date there are souls still in darkness, who know not at what they stumble. And it will be much harder now for them to go back and gather up the rays of light which they have scorned to receive, and to acknowledge the light God graciously gave them to heal them of their spiritual diseases.",
