    "word": "It is these men who feel so intensely as James White, J.N. Andrews and yourself that wear and are bruised in spirit. Now if they would heed counsel and would educate and train themselves to endure what cannot be cured and just lean more heavily and continuously upon divine power, then the wear and the friction would almost entirely cease. The peace of Christ comes into the soul. God means we shall trust in Him and enjoy His goodness; He lays out day by day before us. And we must have eyes and perceptive powers to take these things in.",
