    "word": "John, in looking down through time, saw a remnant that would be gathered from the world, who would be in harmony with the precepts of Jehovah; and he exclaims: \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\" Revelation 14:12. \"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament.\" Revelation 11:19. What was it that the ark contained? It was the law of God that points out our duty. \n\n\n                                     -78- \n\nJohn saw the people's attention called to those ten precepts, and as the light is seen we shall be held responsible if we reject it.",
