    "word": "How to Make the Workroom a Bethel.--Ever keep a winning, courteous, kind spirit, and every room may be transformed into a Bethel. Angels of God will work with your efforts. If our publishing houses, our health institutions, our colleges and missions, are conducted on right principles, the unbelievers who visit them will be favorably impressed, and will be more inclined to accept the truth. . . . If the heart is purified through obedience to the truth, there will be no selfish preferences, no corrupt motives. There will be no partiality, no hypocrisy; love-sick sentimentalism will not be developed. Strict guard must be kept, that this curse shall not poison or corrupt our institutions. --Lt 74, 1896. (SpTMWI 8, 9.)",
