    "word": "When the lives of God's people are cleansed from moral and spiritual pollution; when their eyes are anointed with the heavenly eyesalve, they will see that they are poor, and wretched, and miserable, and blind, and naked. They will come to the fountain that has been opened for Judah and Jerusalem, and apply the cleansing blood of Christ to their poor, sin-sick souls. God grant that they make no delay in securing the advantages that He has prepared for all who love Him and keep His commandments. --Letter 259, Nov. 23, 1903, to Mrs. L. M. Hall, a close friend and for many years matron of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.",
