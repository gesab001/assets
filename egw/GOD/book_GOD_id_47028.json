Zerubbabel had gone to Jerusalem to build the house of the Lord. But he was compassed with difficulties. His adversaries \"weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,\" \"and made them to cease by force and power.\" But the Lord interposed in their behalf, and the house was finished.
