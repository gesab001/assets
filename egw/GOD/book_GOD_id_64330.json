    "word": "God's servants are to be \"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" Listlessness and inefficiency are not piety. When we realize that we are working for God we shall have a higher sense than we have ever had before of the sacredness of spiritual service. This realization will put life and vigilance and persevering energy into the discharge of every duty.",
