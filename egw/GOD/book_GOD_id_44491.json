    "word": "Chap. 2 - Early Fanaticism to be Repeated\n-\n\n                Removing the Landmarks \n\n     Our people need to understand the reasons of our faith and our past experiences. How sad it is that so many of them apparently place unlimited confidence in men who present theories tending to uproot our past experiences and to remove the old landmarks! Those who can so easily be led by a false spirit show that they have been following the wrong captain for some time--so long that they do not discern that they are departing from the faith, or that they are not building upon the true foundation. We need to urge all to put on their spiritual eyeglasses, to have their eyes anointed that they may see clearly and discern the true pillars of the faith. Then they will know that \"the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his\" (2 Timothy 2:19). We need to revive the old evidences of the faith once delivered to the saints.",
