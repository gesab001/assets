It is the prerogative of God to have to reconstruct, not to destroy. The Son of God was given to die before the foundation of the world. The existence of sin is unexplainable; therefore, not a soul knows what God is until he sees himself in the light reflected from the cross of Calvary, and detests himself as a sinner, in the bitterness of his soul. When his soul cries out in great need for a sin-pardoning Saviour, then God is revealed as gracious, full of comparison and forgiveness and love, longsuffering and patience. Individually, as church-members, we are, if faithful, servants of Jesus Christ, laborers together with God. When one is bruised by the enemy, and wounded, and commits error, as faithful and true to the Master, as workers together with God, we must take up the missionary work next to us, we must work to heal, not to ruin and to destroy. The hope we have in Christ is because we are sinners. We have a right to claim a Saviour. Then when there are those in any of our institutions associated together, who err, let not men act the part of denouncing, condemning, and destroying, as though they were faultless. \n\n                         - 4 -",
