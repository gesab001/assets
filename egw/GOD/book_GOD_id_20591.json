    "word": "To Timothy, a youthful minister, the apostle Paul wrote, \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" [2 Timothy 2:15.] The work of winning souls to Christ demands careful preparation. Men cannot enter the Lord's service without the needed training, and expect the highest success. Mechanics, lawyers, merchants, men of all trades and professions, are educated for the line of business they hope to enter. It is their policy to make themselves as efficient as possible. Go to the milliner or the dressmaker, and she will tell you how long she toiled before she had a thorough knowledge of her business. The architect will tell you how long it took him to understand how to plan a tasteful, commodious building. And so it is in all the callings that men follow.",
