    "word": "I have never seen any persons crowned in the kingdom of God, only on conditions that if they were faithful they would receive the crown of immortal life in the kingdom of glory. I have never stated that this one or that one was doomed or damned. I never had a testimony of this kind for anyone. I have ever been shown that God's people should shun these strong expressions which are peculiar to the first-day Adventists. These very expressions have been used unsparingly by John Howell, the first husband of Mrs. Burdick. But I never uttered them myself to any living mortal. These very fanatics have made these wholesale statements, and have talked of God as irreverently as they would of a horse or of common things. Sacred things are brought down upon a level with common things. The elevated dignity of the religion of Christ is lowered unto the very dust.",
