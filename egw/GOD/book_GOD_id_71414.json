    "word": "The Lord is a God of knowledge. In His Word, He is represented as weighing men, their development of character, and all their motives, whether they be good or evil. Hannah, the mother of Samuel, the child granted her by God in answer to her earnest entreaty, said, \"The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed\" (1 Samuel 2:3). David declared, \"Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity\" (Psalm 62:9). Isaiah says, \"Thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just\" (Isaiah 26:7). Solomon writes, \"All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits\" (Proverbs 16:2). It is for the eternal interest of everyone to search his own heart and to improve every God-given faculty.",
