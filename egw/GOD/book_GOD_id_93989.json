    "word": "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days when the Son of man shall be revealed [see Luke 17:26, 27].

They made eating and drinking, buying and selling, marrying and giving in marriage, the supreme objects of life. It is not sinful, but the fulfillment of a duty, to eat and drink, if that which is lawful is not carried to excess. And in the days of Noah it was lawful to marry. God Himself instituted marriage when He gave Eve to Adam.",
