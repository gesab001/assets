    "word": "We, as Christians, are not required to go about with long faces, sighing as though we had no Saviour and no hope. This will not glorify God. He desires us to be cheerful. He desires us to be filled with praises to His name. He desires us to carry light in our countenance, and joy in our hearts. We have a hope that is far above any pleasures that the world can give, and this fact should be made manifest.",
