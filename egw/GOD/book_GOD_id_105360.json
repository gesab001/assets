    "word": "I long to see the righteousness of Christ upon every one who has any official standing in the office, For a long time warnings, invitations, entreaties, reproofs have been given of God in order that decided reforms should be made in those who were not revealing the life of Christ in their characters. God has sent messages in order that there might have been a transformation of the natural temperament. So that men, leaning on Christ, might be laborers together with God. Men should heed the instruction, \"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Many moves have been made, many decisions have been carried out in your counsels, that have not been after Christ's likeness. Why? Because self has not been under the control of the Spirit of Christ. You have too often revealed in your counsels a hard, harsh, iron like spirit, to those who differ with you, that has been as unlike the meekness and gentleness of Christ, as Satan is unlike Christ. The Spirit of Christ has been grieved, and his great heart of love has been wounded, because souls have been torn and bruised that might have been healed and bound up, and saved, that might today have been doing acceptable service in the Lord's army.",
