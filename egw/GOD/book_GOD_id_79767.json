    "word": "Then light came to me in the night season that the Lord would not have me passing out means in large sums. I had donated one thousand dollars to erect the mission building in Illinois. I would be solicited to do this from every quarter, but the Lord would not have me dependent upon any of our institutions. He had a message for me to bear which would cut like a two-edged sword, right and left. He would have me so situated that I would be free from financial embarrassment. I must not trust in man, nor make flesh \n\n\n                     -7- \n\nmy arm. The enemy would exercise his ingenuity through the men who should uphold and sustain me wherever I was called to go, that I might lead out in the work that God in his wisdom would have done. Then, if my brethren did not awake to the situation, I was to make no delay in taking the books into my own hands, and the Lord would prepare the way before me. He would not have the work delayed.",
