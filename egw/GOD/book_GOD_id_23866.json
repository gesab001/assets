    "word": "57\n     The same God who gave the children of Israel manna from heaven, lives and reigns. He will give skill and understanding in the preparation of health foods. He will guide His people in the preparation of health foods. He will guide His people in the preparation of wholesome food. He desires them to see what they can do in the preparation of such food, not only for their own families, which is their first responsibility, but for the help of the poor. They are to show Christlike liberality, realizing that they are representing God, and that all they have is His endowment. -Letter 25, 1902. Written February 5, 1902.",
