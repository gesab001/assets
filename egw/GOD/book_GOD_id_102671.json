    "word": "All the warnings must be given. The truth, Bible truth, is to be proclaimed in our large camp-meetings, and the churches can hear the truth. They have the opportunity. All may not desire to hear. Many oppose anything that calls for self-denial. They are not willing to accept the Sabbath. In Exodus 31:12-18, is clearly marked out in definite lines what God expects from his people, and the decided consequence of rejecting is death. Notwithstanding this many will refuse obedience because the truth involves self-denial and self-sacrifice.",
