    "word": "Still another class is represented in the parable. Men and women who listen to the word are convinced of the truth, and accept it without seeing the sinfulness of their hearts. The love of the world holds a large place in their affections. In their deal, they love to get the best of the bargain. They prevaricate, and by deception and fraud gain means which ever will prove as a thorn to them; for it will over-balance their good purposes and intentions. The good seed sown in their hearts is choked. They frequently are so anxious and full of care, fearing they shall not gain means, or shall lose what they have gained, they make their temporal matters primary. They do not nourish the good seed. They do not attend meetings where their hearts can be strengthened by religious privileges. They fear they shall meet with some loss in temporal things; and the deceitfulness of riches leads them to flatter themselves that it is duty to toil and gain all they can, that \n                                                                           143\nthey may help the cause of God; and yet the more they increase in their earthly riches the less is their heart inclined to part with their treasure, until their hearts are fully turned from the truth they loved. The good seed is choked because overgrown with unnecessary worldly cares and needless anxiety--with love for earthly pleasures and worldly honors which riches give.",
