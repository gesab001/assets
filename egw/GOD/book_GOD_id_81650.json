    "word": "I was shown, December 10, that sister Smith could be a blessing to her husband, or a curse to him. If she permits herself \n                                                                           41\nto be sad, gloomy, and unbelieving, she becomes a body of darkness instead of light, and her husband is so constituted that it is almost impossible for him to be free to preach and write out the truth; for an oppressive weight bears him down. If sister Smith cultivates cheerfulness, and if she is hopeful in God, she can be a sunbeam in her family. She has experience, and has had great light, and she is responsible to God for the improvement of this light. God wants Bro. Smith to be a free man, and fully consecrated to the work. If he is not free, the reason exists in his own family. Bro. Smith has not realized what a paralyzing influence the spiritual atmosphere of his home has had upon his energies and spiritual strength. God is willing and ready to give Bro. Smith a large measure of his Spirit, if he will trust in him, and go forward in faith.",
