    "word": "Talk less, exalt science less; let your Redeemer be the One exalted. The melody of heaven is praise to God and the Lamb: it sounds forth from the voices of ten thousand times ten thousands of thousands. Why does not praise flow from our lips? Why are we so dumb? The Lord is ready to disclose to His church more and more of His wonderful power, and to open new lines of thought in regard to the great plan of redemption, the love, the matchless love, that moved him to give his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.",
