    "word": "As our representative, Christ stands on the highest possible ground. When He came to the world as God's messenger, He held the salvation of God in His hand. All mankind was delivered to Him, for in Him was the fullness of the Godhead. . . . So fully did Christ reveal the Father that the messengers sent by the Pharisees to take Him were charmed by His presence. . . . As they beheld the soft light of the glory of God that enshrouded His person, as they heard the gracious words that fell from His lips, they loved Him. And when . . . they were asked by the Pharisees, \"Why have ye not brought him?\" they answered, \"Never man spake like this man\" (John 7:45, 46).",
