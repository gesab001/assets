    "word": "Minds Must Be Prepared Spiritually.--I have tried to not shun to give to our people the whole counsel of God, but have sometimes deferred matters with the injunction, \"They cannot bear them now.\" Even truth cannot be presented in its fullness before minds that are in no preparation spiritually to receive it. I have many things to say, but persons to whom the messages apply cannot in their present unconsecrated state bear them.--Letter 55, 1894.",
