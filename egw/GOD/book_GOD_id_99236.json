    "word": "If Elder Waggoner's views were wrong, what business has anyone to get up and say what they did here yesterday? If we have the truth it will stand. These truths that we have been handling for years--must Elder Butler come and tell us what they are? Now, do let us have common sense. Don't let us leave such an impression on this people. One brother asked me if I thought there was any new light that we should have or any new truths for us? Well, shall we stop searching the Scriptures because we have the light on the law of God and the testimony of His Spirit? No, brethren. I tell you in the fear of God, \"Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils.\" How can you listen to all that I have been telling you all through these meetings and not know for yourself what is truth? If you will search the Scriptures on your knees, then you will know them and you will be able to give to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is within you.",
