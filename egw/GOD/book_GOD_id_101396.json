Tait\n\n                                  Norfolk Villa, Prospect St., June 6, '95. \n\n                                                              T - 76 - 1895 \n\nEld. A. O. Tait, \n\n\n     Battle Creek, Michigan, U.S.A. \n\nDear Brother:- \n\n\n     To answer your letter will require of me some very plain statements. The matters you refer to have been presented before me for years. Long before the meeting at Minneapolis the leaven that is now working was at work. The spirit of disaffection was gathering strength up to that time. Since that time some have confessed their wrongs and have decidedly changed their attitude, and have not manifested the same spirit. For years previous they withstood the pleadings of the Spirit of God, and were aided in their rebellion by the great adversary of souls. But there are some in influential positions who are still seeking to leaven the minds of canvassers, and to influence those who assemble in conference meetings. They work contrary to truth and righteousness, making use of any and every expedient to carry forward their own ideas. Many think that because these men are in responsible positions, because they have an appearance of being calm and rational, they must be reliable men. But God has no use for men who are disloyal in heart. He has not given his people into the hands of any man or set of men to make use of as their impulses dictate. In the name of the Lord God of Israel, I protest against this work.",
