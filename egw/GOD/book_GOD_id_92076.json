    "word": "\"If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love,\" Christ says. God looks for the fruit of obedience. \"Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples. As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you: continue ye in My love. If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and bide in His love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you\" [John 15:8-12]. Who among us realize these things, and cultivate love one for another?",
