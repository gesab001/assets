    "word": "You must be divested of self. You must be meek and lowly of heart, and then the teachings of Christ will be appreciated by you. There must be in the Echo office the transforming grace of Christ. Things are not as they should be. God forbid that religion should be only a profession with you. In your family you want the subduing, sanctifying power of the grace of Christ upon your own heart. Then levity and cheap nonsense will not prevail, but there will be cheerfulness and hopefulness and courage and faith. There will be no need of cheap, forced cheerfulness but there will be peace and joy in the assurance and love of Jesus.",
