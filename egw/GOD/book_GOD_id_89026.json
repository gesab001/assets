    "word": "MR No. 914 - Danger of Following \"Impressions and Feelings\"\n\n     In [Testimony] No. 9, you will see a note in regard to the East. I was shown that, as God revived His work, those who had formerly been in fanaticism would be in danger of crediting their impressions and feelings, and the devil would use them to push poor souls into the fire. Satan uses some as long as he can push souls into the waters (into cold formality), and then when he has accomplished all he wishes in that direction, he will give them a blind zeal and lead them to be moved by feelings and impressions, and through them will push souls into the fire to be consumed by fanaticism. The Paris people have been first pushed into the fire, next into the water, now again into the fire.",
