    "word": "Natural World, Like Fountain that Deepens and Broadens Beneath the Gaze.--All the lessons of the natural world reveal the providence of God. He who has this lesson book opened before him, and becomes a student thereof, will find himself looking into a fountain that deepens and broadens beneath his gaze. From the Old Testament, he can store up the most precious instruction, the gospel being the key.--Ms 30, 1898.",
