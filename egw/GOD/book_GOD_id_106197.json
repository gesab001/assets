    "word": "Lay Sister White right to one side: lay her to one side. Don't you never quote my words again as long as you live, until you can obey the Bible. When you take the Bible and make that your food, and your meat, and your drink, and make that the elements of your character, when you can do that you will know better how to receive some counsel from God. But here is the Word, the precious Word, exalted before you today. And don't you give a rap any more what \"Sister White said\"-- \"Sister White said this,\" and \"Sister White said that,\" and \"Sister White said the other thing.\" But say, \"Thus saith the Lord God of Israel,\" and then you do just what the Lord God of Israel does, and what he says.",
