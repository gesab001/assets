    "word": "Behold the Light \n\n     Let not depression and discouragement mar your representation of Christ. \"Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\" Let your light be seen. Educate your heart and lips to speak the praises of God for His matchless love for you. If you will educate your soul to be hopeful, and to see the light shining from the cross of Calvary, you will see His salvation brought near, and rejoice in the hope of a glorious immortality.",
