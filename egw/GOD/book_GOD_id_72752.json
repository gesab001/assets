    "word": "Anger as Intoxication-- When one once gives place to an angry spirit, he is just as much intoxicated as the man who has put the glass to his lips. Learn the eloquence of silence and know that God respects the purchase of the blood of Christ. Educate yourselves; we must learn every day. We must come up higher and higher and closer to God. Clear the rubbish away from the King's highway. Make a way that the King may walk in our midst. Put away filthy communications out of your mouth (see Colossians 3:8).--2MCP 582.",
