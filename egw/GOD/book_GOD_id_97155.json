    "word": "I see matchless charms in Jesus. I do not want any greater reward than He presents to us. I do not want any larger reward than that. I want to live for God, not for the world. I want the eye single to His glory. Let us every one--in the morning, and at noon, and at night--lay ourselves before God as His property, not our own, and fight the good fight of faith. Today you are not to have the faith of tomorrow. You have only faith for today; tomorrow you will find faith when that comes; so don't worry about tomorrow. It is today, Am I the Lord's? Today have I the witness of His Spirit? Today does my name come upon the lips of the great Advocate of heaven? Today am I walking in harmony with Jesus Christ and heavenly angels? The heavenly intelligences are at work to bring the light of the knowledge of the truth as it shineth in the face of Jesus Christ, to humanity. \n\n\n                                    -191-",
