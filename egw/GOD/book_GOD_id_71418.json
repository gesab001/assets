    "word": "Our life is something we receive from Christ by a study of His Word. \"In him was life\"--original, unborrowed. He was the Fountain of life. We receive life from the Saviour which He takes back again. That life which God has given us should be put to the very best account, for as human agents we are forming our own destiny. We need to choose wisely those associates who will best fit us, body, soul, and spirit, for the future country, even the heavenly. In our choice of companions we should not place ourselves under influences that are in any way unfavorable to the formation of pure and correct principles, for we need all the assistance we can possibly obtain that in our associations we may develop characters after Christ's likeness.",
