    "word": "After the judgment of the wicked dead had been finished, at the end of the one thousand years, Jesus left the city, and the saints and a train of the angelic host followed Him. Jesus descended upon a great mountain, which as soon as His feet touched it, parted asunder and became a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the great and beautiful city, with twelve foundations, and twelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate. We cried out, \"The city! the great city! it is coming down from God out of heaven!\" And it came down in all its splendor and dazzling glory and settled in the mighty plain which Jesus had prepared for it.",
