    "word": "Spirit-filled, Farseeing Men Needed.--Our great need today is for men who are baptized with the Holy Spirit of God--men who walk with God as did Enoch. We do not want men who are so narrow in their outlook that they will circumscribe the work instead of enlarging it, or who follow the motto: \"Religion is religion; business is business.\" We need men who are farseeing, who can take in the situation \n\n64 \n\nand reason from cause to effect.--5T 555.",
