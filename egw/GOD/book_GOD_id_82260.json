    "word": "Abrahamic--The Covenant of Grace \n\n\n     Now my sister, if it were not possible for human beings under the Abrahamic covenant to keep the commandments of God, every soul of us is lost. The Abrahamic covenant is the covenant of grace. \"By grace ye are saved\" (Ephesians 2:5). \"He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name\" (John 1:11, 12). Disobedient children? No, obedient to all His commandments. If it were not possible for us to be commandment keepers, then why does He make the obedience to His commandments the proof that we love Him? Letter 16, 1892, pp. 2, 3. (To Brother and Sister Holland, November 10, 1892).",
