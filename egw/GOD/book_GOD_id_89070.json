    "word": "Night after night I am in distress, walking the floor with a burden almost unendurable. I have a deep interest in you, my brother. The Lord has given me messages for you, warning you not to be as Nebuchadnezzar, filled with self-exaltation. You have before you every temptation to sway the work in such a way that God cannot put his signature upon it. Altogether too much power and authority rests in your word. You are not sufficient for these things. The Lord must be the ruler.--Letter 199, 1901, p. 2. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, October 15, 1901.)",
