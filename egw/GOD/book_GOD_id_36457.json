    "word": "A Christian life will be revealed by Christian thoughts, Christian words, and Christian deportment. In Christ there is a divine completeness of character. In Christ we will work the works of Christ. We shall in Christ sense our binding, far-reaching obligations to God and to our fellow man. . . . There are many cords which unite us to our fellow men, to humanity, and to God, and this relationship is solemn with its weight of responsibility.",
