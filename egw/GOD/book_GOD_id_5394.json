    "word": "The important interests of a great nation were entrusted to men whose talents fitted them to handle these responsibilities.  Some were chosen to direct the business affairs; others were chosen to look after spiritual matters connected with the worship of God.  All the religious service and every branch of the business was to bear the signature of heaven.  \"Holiness unto the Lord\" was to be the motto of the laborers in every department.  It was regarded as essential that everything be conducted with regularity, propriety, fidelity, and dispatch.--Manuscript 81, 1900, p. 6 (Diary, Solomon's Reign).",
