    "word": "Oh, I am so thankful for a Saviour! I am so thankful for One that is mighty in power, that will help in every emergency. \"Lo,\" He says, \"I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.\" Well now, if we have Christ at our right hand to help us--how much can He help that man that is so devoted to the smoking of his pipe that he can think of nothing else? God help us to cleanse the soul temple of its impurity. God help us that we may give to God an offering that is untainted physically, mentally, and morally. Well, \"no man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" You see, the problem is weighed with God, and He tells the result. He requires all there is of you.",
