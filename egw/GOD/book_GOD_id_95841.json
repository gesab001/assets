    "word": "\"Something must be done for the individual by the Lord. They must learn to look to God for duty, not to their minister or brethren, and when an individual strives to bend his brethren to his own peculiar notions or ideas of things, he takes that upon him which God has not laid upon him. Minds are differently constituted; they cannot run in the same channel of ideas or impressions. I saw that it was notions and ideas that some think others must be brought to that has destroyed spirituality and independent experience in New York. There is a depending upon one another for light and blessing. They have not learned to look to God for duty and counsel in this thing. Do you say [that] in New York [a] man is made to lose his identity and is made a mere thing to be moved by another's mind, another's experience? God will surely judge for these things.\"--Letter 2, 1858. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Letter.",
