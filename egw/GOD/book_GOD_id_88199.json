    "word": "The message from God to me for you is \"Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out\" (John 6:37). If you have nothing else to plead before God but this one promise from your Lord and Saviour, you have the assurance that you will never, never be turned away. It may seem to you that you are hanging upon a single promise, but appropriate that one promise, and it will open to you the whole treasure house of the riches of the grace of Christ. Cling to that promise and you are safe. \"Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.\" Present this assurance to Jesus, and you are as safe as though inside the city of God.",
