    "word": "Those who are doers of the Word have found the pearl of great price. The truth is as an anchor to the soul, both sure and steadfast. When men drift away from the principles of truth, they always betray sacred trusts. Let every soul, whatever may be his sphere of action, make sure that the truth is implanted in the heart by the power of the Spirit of God.--Ms 154, 1898, pp. 3, 4. (\"Pearl of Great Price,\" November 22, 1898.)",
