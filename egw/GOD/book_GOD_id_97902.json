    "word": "Don't bring your suppositions to the Bible, but lay your ideas at the door of investigation of the Scriptures. Take the mighty assertions that God has given and you are safe. A certain man who kept the Sabbath, but did not believe in the second coming of Christ, said, \"I made a center that it was not so, and then the Scriptures proved to my mind that the second coming of Christ was not near.\" Are you going to make a center of Sunday as the Sabbath, and then come with unmitigation to the Scriptures? If you do, you will surely hear a voice, \"Believe not in the fourth commandment as it reads.\"",
