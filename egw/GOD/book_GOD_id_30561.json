    "word": "Many sanitariums are to be established in places outside the cities. Connected with them there are to be men and women of ability and consecration, who will conduct themselves in the love and fear of God. These institutions are to be training schools. Those who act a part in them are not to feel that they are prepared for graduation, that they know all they need to know. They are to study diligently and practice carefully the lessons Christ has given.--MS. 76, 1902.",
