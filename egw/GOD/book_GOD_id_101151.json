    "word": "Who will stand against these bewitching, deceiving delusions? We have proof that God keeps a reckoning with nations, that there is a sum total of guilt, that although it is beyond the power of human minds to define the amount God allows not to pass, but when the point of transgression is fully reached, when the law of God is made void, God takes account of the dishonor put upon His government, and He charges one generation with the crimes of the preceding generation, if they follow in the same evil course. Your light is constantly increasing.",
