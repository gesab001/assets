    "word": "Suppose that my brethren at the Review and Herald had been able to bring me to their terms in the publication of my books; what could I have done among this poverty-stricken people? I not only tell them what must be done, but shoulder a large part of the burden myself. I know that God sent me here, but if I had been more closely bound about for want of facilities, I might have worn my life out, and died in disappointment that I could not relieve the situation. I will have Emily Campbell give you the figures showing what I have expended solely for the education of students in our school. I am satisfied with the outlay. It pays, thank God, it pays.-- Letter 5, 1895, p. 19. (To \"Brethren in Responsible Positions in America,\" July 24, 1895.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 11, 1982",
