    "word": "Aim for a Heavy Crown \n\n     We must not become weary or faint-hearted. It would be a terrible loss to barter away enduring glory for ease, convenience, and enjoyment, or for carnal indulgences. A gift from the hand of God awaits the overcomer. Not one of us deserves it; it is gratuitous on His part. Wonderful \n                                                                           109\nand glorious will be this gift, but let us remember that \"one star differeth from another star in glory.\" But as we are urged to strive for the mastery, let us aim, in the strength of Jesus, for the crown heavy with stars. \"They that be wise shall shine as the firmament, and they that win many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\"--Review and Herald, Oct. 25, 1881.",
