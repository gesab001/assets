    "word": "We have no right to tax nerve and muscle so severely that we readily become excited, speaking words that dishonor God. This is not in the Lord's order. He wants us to be always calm and forbearing. However inconsiderate a course others may pursue, we are to represent Christ, doing as he would do \n\n\n                                    -328- \n\nunder similar circumstances. We are to obey the words, \"Be ye wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\" We are to keep our nerves in such a healthy condition that we shall ever be calm in speech and righteous in action.--Letter 98, 1901, p. 5. (To Brother and Sister Kress, June 19, 1901.)",
