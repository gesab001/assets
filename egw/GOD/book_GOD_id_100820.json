    "word": "He who was seen by John in the vision, in the midst of the golden candlesticks, represents Himself as walking among them, going from church to church, from congregation to congregation and from soul to soul. Here is unwearied vigilance. While the undershepherds may be asleep, or engrossed with matters of small importance, He that keepeth Israel doth not slumber nor sleep. He is the true Watchman. The presence and sustaining grace of Christ are the secret of all light and life. We are kept by the power of God, through faith, and that not of ourselves; it is the gift of God.",
