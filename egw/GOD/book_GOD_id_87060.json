    "word": "True education is the inculcation of those ideas which will impress the mind with the knowledge of God the Creator and Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God. This education, which will ennoble the intellect and expand the mind, may be gained from a study of God's words: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not \n\n\n                                    -281- \n\nanything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not. . . . He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.\" (John 1:1-5, 10.). . . .",
