    "word": "Jesus desires to make celestial harmony in your soul. Read His words, not with discouragement, but with confidence and hope. Listen to the blessed words which God speaks to you. Walking with Christ means to believe that, though unseen, Christ is walking with you. The soothing voice of God comes to you, saying, \"Commit the keeping of your soul to Me and I will preserve you and sanctify and bless you. 'Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.'''",
