    "word": "There are most precious truths which the lapse of time and [Israel's] separation from God, the source of light, had displaced and disconnected from their true position. Their principles had become extinct. Christ came to remove the rubbish which had covered these truths from sight. He presented them as gems in a new framework of truth. He brought them before the people. He showed them that far from disdaining the repetition of old, familiar truths, He came to make them appear in their true force and beauty, the glory of which the people had never yet discerned. These truths He put in new settings and made them available by recalling them, clothing them with their original simplicity, and establishing them anew.",
