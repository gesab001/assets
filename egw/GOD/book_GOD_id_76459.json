    "word": "SpTB15 - Letters from Ellen G. White to Sanitarium Workers (1911)\n\n\n\"I have been instructed to say to our leading Sanitarium workers throughout our ranks: The work must move forward on a higher plane, and after a more sacred order than it has heretofore, if it is to accomplish all that God designs should be accomplished by it in our churches and for the world.\"--E. G. White.\n\n       To Ministers, Physicians, and Counsellors At Loma Linda \n\n          Sanitarium, Cal., May 7, 1911 \n\n     I have words of instruction for you and your coworkers who are ministers and physicians and counselors at Loma Linda. During my visit to Southern California, light was given me that many of the leaders in our sanitariums were failing of meeting the requirements of God, and, more than this, they did not realize their lack. I was instructed that those who stand in positions of responsibility in these important institutions are engaged in a most sacred work, that they have little time in which to do the work committed to their trust, and that it was of the utmost importance that faithfulness and consecration mark their efforts in every line.",
