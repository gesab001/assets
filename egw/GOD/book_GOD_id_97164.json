    "word": "There is no virtue in your prayers to God when you get right up from your prayers and begin to speak sharp words and make yourself disagreeable in your family.

There are vessels to dishonor, and there are vessels to honor. Now we want to make our choice, and reveal we choose to be a vessel unto honor. \n\n\n                                    -198-",
