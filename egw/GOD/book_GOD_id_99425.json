    "word": "The principles and bearings of the truth had disappeared from the minds of men as they separated in heart and practice from God and the truth. These principles had become covered up with superstition, forms, and customs. Men in their depravity had misinterpreted revealed truths and explained them to suit their own unconsecrated condition, their own destitution of spirituality and the love of God. Himself the Author of these truths, Christ could reopen and revive them. This work was to restore the significance of truth and to make plain the divine will.",
