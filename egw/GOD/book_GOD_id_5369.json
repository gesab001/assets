    "word": "Satan Fiercely Assails Responsible Men--Observing carefully every direction that the Lord has specified in regard to the Christian armor, you will walk before him softly, and will work discreetly.  You will not carry with you any yokes to bind men to your plans, nor will you attempt to make the Lord's workers amenable to any finite mind.  The maxims and precepts of men are not to control His laborers.  Let no man be placed in a position where he can lord it over God's heritage; for this imperils alike the soul of him who rules and the souls of those who are under his rule.--Manuscript 140, 1902 (Nov. 6, 1902 Principles for the Guidance of Men in Positions of Responsibility).",
