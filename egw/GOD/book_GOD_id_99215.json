    "word": "Let none here shut themselves away from God by their perversity of spirit, and then keep complaining that they have no light. Arise, dear souls; arise by faith, and do what you ought to do. Christ says, Follow Me, and you shall not walk in darkness. Let go your human wisdom, and ask God for that wisdom which is pure, elevating, and ennobling, and it shall be given you. Come up out of the cellar of doubt, of unbelief, of jealousy, and evil surmising, into the upper chamber of faith, hope, courage, and thankfulness. Make melody to God in the heart. The garden of the Lord is strewn with precious flowers. Gather the roses and the lilies and the pinks from God's spiritual garden. Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice. Let not the world receive the impression that there is no peace nor joy nor happiness in serving the Lord.",
