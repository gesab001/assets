    "word": "We point the sinner to One who can take away the sin of the world. He does not cover the world with His righteousness, but He takes it away, until sinners repent and wash their robes of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. And the heart that is divested of self is ready for something else. That is the inflowing of the Holy Ghost. Then you can no more repress it; it will come out. You will begin to work for the depressed and the suffering. You will forget self. Self will not be exalted, but you will forget self, and you will be hid with Christ in God. When self is hid with Christ in God, then the Spirit of Christ will flow forth in conversation. \"Be ye holy,\" says the apostle, \"in all manner of conversation\" [1 Peter 1:15].",
