    "word": "The Bible always tells the same story. With it sin is always sin, whether committed by the possessor of millions or by the beggar in the streets. Better a life of deepest poverty crowned with God\u2019s blessings, than all the world\u2019s treasure without it. We may be very rich; but unless we have the consciousness that God honors us, we are poor indeed.\u2014Signs of the Times, Dec. 24, 1896.",
