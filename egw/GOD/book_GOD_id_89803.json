    "word": "For a time Nebuchadnezzar was impressed by the warning and counsel that had been given him, but a heart that is not fully transformed by the grace of God soon loses the impression of the Holy Spirit. For 12 months the king was placed on trial, but at the end of that time he manifested the spirit that had led him to set up the golden image. At the end of 12 months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. \"The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty\" [verse 30, R.V.]. While the words of self-glorification were in the mouth of the king, \"There fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. And thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou knowest that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will\" [verses 31, 32, R.V.].",
