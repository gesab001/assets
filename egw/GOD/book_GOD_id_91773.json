    "word": "The words Christ has spoken, the spirit He has revealed in all His lessons to His disciples, are as the bread of life, the flesh and blood of the Son of God. He said, \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" [John 6:63]. But all He has said is contested by the confederacy of evil; nevertheless precious truth must be presented in its native force. The deceptive errors that are widespread and that are leading the world captive, are to be unveiled. Every effort that is possible is being made to ensnare souls with subtle reasonings, to turn them from the truth to fables, and to prepare them to be deceived by strong delusions.",
