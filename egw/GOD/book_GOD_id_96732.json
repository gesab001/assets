    "word": "Where the truth is rejected, it opens up a way where false waymarks will be set up, and perils will rise on all sides. Through neglect of seeking the earnest counsel of God men will be connected with the office who will form themselves into a ring, to echo the sentiments of him whom they consider most influential, and who pleases their human ideas. My guide spoke slowly and solemnly, \"Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.\" [See Isaiah 8:9, 10.]",
