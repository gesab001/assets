    "word": "Some feel relieved after they have stamped down the righteous, holy law of Jehovah, as one minister described: \"I feel better after giving the old law a run, and after denouncing it as a yoke of bondage. I pronounce it a bloody old law, dead and buried, and undeserving of a gravestone.\" Is not this the very way Cain felt when he brought a sacrifice to God without the shedding of blood? He was so provoked with Abel that he could not tolerate him, because Abel did not accept his reasoning but followed the injunction of God. He mingled with his offering the blood of the victim representing the efficacious offering, the real person of Christ, as a Lamb without blemish. \"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.\" 1 John 3:12.",
