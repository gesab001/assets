    "word": "You should not give up in despair thinking you must live and die in the bondage of doubt and unbelief. In the Lord we have righteousness and strength. Lean upon him, through his power you may quench all the fiery darts of the adversary, and come off more than conqueror. You may still become sanctified through the truth; or you may, if you choose, walk in the darkness of unbelief, lose Heaven, and lose all. By walking in the light and working out the will of God, you may overcome your selfish nature.",
