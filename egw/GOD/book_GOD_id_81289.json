    "word": "Thousands of dollars were lost in experimenting with various plans,--building up and tearing down. Wisdom seemed to have departed. Sabbaths were spent by some in looking over the premises and devising improvements. God's hand was not in all this. \n                                                                           53\nThere were lofty ideas and extensive plans, but no capital and little experience. Without a close connection with Heaven and special wisdom from God, it is not strange that mistakes were made. But a greater wrong was done in throwing the blame on Bro. Jones. I saw that he did not understand how to make proper calculations for so large a building; but much has been charged upon him for which others were responsible; and some of his plans, which would have saved expense, were not accepted. I saw that Bro. Sisley took advantage of this state of things to raise himself on the downfall of Bro. Jones.",
