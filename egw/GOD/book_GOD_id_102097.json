    "word": "In many the absence of a Christlike spirit has been very marked. Many who claim to follow Christ do not have His fragrance of character. By performing deeds of mercy and by speaking words that are like apples of gold in pictures of silver, they should exercise an uplifting influence over those with whom they have to do. But too often the words are harsh and the actions unbecoming to a Christian. God can not approve of such words and actions; for they are an offense to Him.",
