    "word": "Let Seventh-day Adventist medical workers remember that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Christ was the greatest Physician that ever trod the sin-cursed earth. The Lord would have His people come to Him for their power of healing. He will baptize them with His holy Spirit, and fit them for a service that will make them a blessing in restoring the spiritual and physical health of those who need healing. \n                                   (Signed) Ellen G. White. \n\n                                               -",
