    "word": "Shun Desire to Become Great Leaders-It is those who accept the warnings and cautions given them who will walk in safe paths.  Let not men yield to the burning desire to become great leaders, or to the desire independently to devise and lay plans for themselves and for the work of God.  It is easy for the enemy to work through some who, having themselves need of counsel at every step, undertake the guardianship of souls without having learned the lowliness of Christ.  These need counsel from the One who says, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden.\"",
