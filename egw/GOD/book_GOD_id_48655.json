I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.\" Some of the Ephesian brethren were wealthy; but Paul had never sought to receive personal benefit from them. It was no part of his message to call attention to his own wants.

This was accomplished only by unremitting diligence and the closest economy. Well might he point to his own example, as he said, \"I have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\"",
