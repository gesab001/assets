    "word": "We need to be constantly on our guard, to watch and pray lest we enter into temptation. The indulgence of spiritual pride, of unholy desires, of evil thoughts, of anything that separates us from an intimate and sacred association with Jesus, imperils our souls. We must have living faith in God. . . . If the thought of apostasy is grievous to you, and you do not desire to become the enemies of the truth,... then \"abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.\" Romans 12:9.",
