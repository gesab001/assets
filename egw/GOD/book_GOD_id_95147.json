    "word": "A special effort should be made to bring about reforms in regard to Sabbath observance. The workers in the sanitarium do not always do for themselves what is their privilege and duty. They feel so weary they become demoralized. This should not be. No soul can be rich in grace unless it shall abide in the presence of God. Better have poverty in temporal things, and abide in Christ, and be nourished by His Word, which is spirit and life. \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\" [Matthew 4:4]. The world may smile as we repeat this to them, but it is the word of the Son of God. He says, \"Whoso eateth my flesh (the Word that Christ speaks to us). . . hath eternal life; and I will raise Him up at the last day\" [John 6:54].",
