If any one gives you unessential problems to solve, tell him that God has placed in your hands a work to be done. Tell him that you are doing a great work, and cannot come down to try to solve the problem of the day line. You have the message for this time--the third angel's message--to give to the people. This is your work. Hold the beginning of your confidence firm unto the end. The truth is to be repeated, line upon line, precept upon precept.--Letter 11, 1901.",
