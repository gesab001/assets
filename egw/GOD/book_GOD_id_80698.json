    "word": "\"'I call upon our ministers, physicians, and all church members to study the lessons that Christ gave His disciples just before His ascension. These lessons contain instruction that the people \n\n40 \n\nof God need. When our physicians understand this instruction, they will realize that the Holy Spirit will never lead them to speak or write that which is at variance with the teachings of the Word of God. Take the Bible as your study-book. It contains the Alpha and Omega of knowledge. All can understand the instruction that it contains.' . . .",
