    "word": "\"In the night season many things are passing before me. The Scriptures, full of grace and richness, are presented before me. The word of the Lord to me is: 'Look on these things, and meditate on them. You may claim the rich grace of truth, which nourishes the soul. Have naught to do with controversy and dissension and strife, which bring darkness and discouragement to your soul. Truth is clear, pure, savory. . . . Speak the truth in faith and love, leaving the result with God. The work is not yours, but the Lord's. In all your communications, speak as one to whom the Lord has spoken. He is your authority, and He will give you His sustaining grace.'\" [UNPUBLISHED LETTER, DEC. 2, 1902.]",
