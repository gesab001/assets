    "word": "Sister White has prayed for many sick persons and they have been healed. There have been many, so very many, healed, for whom my husband and I have prayed, laying our hands upon them, and they were healed and glorified God. But I did not work the miracle; I called upon One who was the Miracle-worker and He has answered my prayer in a remarkable manner. The light of His Spirit has filled the room and some have been prostrated by the power of God, losing their strength. But their hearts and lips were filled with praise to God. --Ms 159, 1907. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. Jan. 24, 1988. Entire Ms.",
