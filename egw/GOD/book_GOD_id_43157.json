    "word": "The apostle and his associate workers might have argued that it would be vain to call to repentance and faith in Christ the servants of Nero. . . . But Paul did not reason thus; in faith he presented the gospel to these souls, and among those who heard were some who decided to obey at any cost. Notwithstanding obstacles and dangers, they would accept the light, and trust God to help them let their light shine forth to others.--The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 464-466.",
