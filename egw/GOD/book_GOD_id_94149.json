    "word": "Providence does its work gradually. The ladder that man must climb is made up of successive steps heavenward like the rounds of a ladder--step above step, upward to the wisdom of God, whose glory is at the upper end of the ladder. Angels rest not day nor night from active service in the positions assigned them. They ascend to bear their testimony of record of what they have done and of the state of individuals, and to receive further orders; and they descend to execute the orders they have received.",
