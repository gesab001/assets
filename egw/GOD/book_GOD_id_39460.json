    "word": "HANNAH WAS A WOMAN OF PRAYER.\u2014Hannah brought no reproach against her husband for his unwise marriage. The grief \n132\nwhich she could share with no earthly friend, she carried to her Heavenly Father, and sought consolation from Him alone who hath said, \u201cCall upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee.\u201d There is a mighty power in prayer. Our great adversary is constantly seeking to keep the troubled soul away from God. An appeal to Heaven by the humblest saint is more to be dreaded by Satan than the decrees of cabinets or the mandates of kings.",
