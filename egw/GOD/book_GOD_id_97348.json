    "word": "Many are doing the same thing today, in 1897, because they have not had experience in the testing message comprehended in the first, second, and third angels' messages.

Therefore such are in danger of misleading the people in regard to locating the messages. They do not see and understand the time of the end, or when to locate the messages. The day of God is coming with stealthy tread, but the supposed wise and great men are prating about \"higher education\" which they suppose originates with finite men. They know not the signs of Christ's coming, or of the end of the world.",
