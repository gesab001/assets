    "word": "The work that was done in collecting money to lift the school debt in Southern Calif. was not a work of God's ordering. He gave our schools the precious book \"Christ's Object Lessons\" and He wants that book to be appreciated. The students have lost precious lessons because they have not taken up the work of pushing the sale of these books. There is a most valuable experience to be gained by those who will aid in doing this work for the benefit of our educational institutions. If teachers and students will act their part in this missionary enterprise, angels of God will open the way before them.",
