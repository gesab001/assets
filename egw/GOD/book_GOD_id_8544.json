    "word": "The Saviour ignores both rank and caste, worldly honor and riches. It is character and devotedness of purpose that are of high value with\n284\nHim. He does not take sides with the strong and worldly favored. He, the Son of the living God, stoops to uplift the fallen. By pledges and words of assurance He seeks to win to Himself the lost, perishing soul. Angels of God are watching to see who of His followers will exercise tender pity and sympathy. They are watching to see who of God's people will manifest the love of Jesus.  6T 268526",
