    "word": "I am sorry, my sister, that you are in affliction and sorrow.  But Jesus, the precious Saviour, lives.  He lives for you.  He wants you to be comforted in His love.  Do not worry; trust in the Lord....  Do not complain.  Do not mourn and weep.  Do not look on the dark side.  Let the peace of God reign in your soul.  Then you will have strength to bear all your sufferings, and you will rejoice that you have grace to endure.  Praise the Lord; talk of His goodness; tell of His power.  Sweeten the atmosphere which surrounds your soul.",
