Their lives should reveal the influence of the cross. A great interest should be shown by them in the extension of the Lord's work. They should feel a deep sense of grief and humiliation as they think that many of the cities which have been kept before us for the last twenty-five years have not yet heard the message of present truth. There are heathen, as it were, right in our borders, in our large cities. But how few have a burden of soul for these unwarned ones! How few are willing to invest their means in the work of enlightening them! Entreaties have been made, but many have listened to the counsel of men not guided by the Holy Spirit.",
