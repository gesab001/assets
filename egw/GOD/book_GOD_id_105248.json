    "word": "Camp Meeting Appeal \n\n     \"The Lord has seen our backslidings, and he has a controversy with his people.\" Their pride, selfishness, their opening of the mind to doubt and unbelief, are manifest in his sight and grieve his heart of love. Many gather darkness about their souls as a garment, and virtually say, We want not a knowledge of thy way, O \n                                                                           338\nGod; we choose our own way. These are the things which separate the soul from God. There is in the soul of man an obstacle which he holds there with stubborn persistency, and which interposes between his soul and God. It is unbelief. God gives sufficient evidence, but man with his unsanctified will refuses to receive evidence unless it comes in his own way, to favor his own ideas. With a spirit of bravado he cries, \"Proof, proof, is what we want,\" and turns away from the evidence that God gives. He talks doubt, unbelief, sowing the seeds of evil, which will spring up and yield their harvest. He is separating his soul farther and farther from God.",
