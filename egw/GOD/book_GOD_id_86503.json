    "word": "Some young men are urging their way into the work, who have no real fitness for it. They do not understand that they need to be taught before they can teach. They point to men who with little preparation have labored with a measure of success. But if these men have been successful, it is because they put their heart and soul into the work. And how much more effective their labors might have been, if at the very start they had received suitable training. The cause of God needs efficient men. Education and training are rightly regarded as an essential preparation for the work of school-teaching, and not less essential is thorough preparation for the work of presenting God's last message of mercy to the world.--Ms 51, 1900, p. 4.
