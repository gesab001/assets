    "word": "Through God's word the light has been shining upon his people. Will those thus privileged appreciate their blessings? Will that which is wrong, in action, in spirit, and in thought, be renounced? Those who bear some good fruit must be pruned and purified from all common sensual things, from selfishness, ungodliness \n                                                                           1639\nand deception in any line of business, and from greed expressed in any transaction in trade with their fellow-men. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\" \"Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory, not, and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion, and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\"",
