    "word": "I have been, and am still speaking very plainly to them, and your attitude must not give them the impression that I have written to you anything detrimental to them. These men have many temptations, and their souls are precious. If they can be won to see how they can come to Jesus and take him as their counsellor, what a victory will be gained on the Lord's side. Do not live over the past. Do not in any way give occasion for your good to be evil spoken of. You may save souls from death, and hide a multitude of sins, if you walk circumspectly. The Lord bears long with the erring children he has purchased at an infinite cost. These men, A.R. Henry and Harmon Lindsay, are in the greatest peril of losing their souls because they do not discern their situation. Let the melting love of God abide and rule in your heart, controlling every action.",
