    "word": "MR No. 278 - Nursing Personnel in Our Medical Institutions\n\n     I went up to the next board meeting, and bore a straight testimony, stating how far short the sanitarium was falling of meeting the standard God desired it to meet. I said that the spirituality of many of those connected with the sanitarium seemed to be dead; that unbelievers were employed as nurses, and that the influence of this in the sanitarium is not at all profitable. To employ unbelievers as nurses does not please the Lord or fulfill the purpose for which the sanitarium was established. . . .",
