    "word": "God demands of us that we build a character that will stand that close test of the judgment. We will not have His protection in the time when the \n\n\n                                     -14- \n\nflood comes, if at that time it is found that we have wasted the hours of probation granted us now to build characters for eternity. For the character which we now build is not only for time, but for eternity. Those that are set forth in this parable as building on the sand are they that feel that they are all right. They come right up before the Lord and say, I have done this, I have done that. \"Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?\" But this goes for nothing to the Lord. \"Then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\" (See Matthew 7:22, 23)",
