    "word": "Christ's life on earth teaches that to obtain the higher education does not mean to gain popularity, to secure worldly advantage, to have all the temporal wants abundantly supplied, and to be honored by the titled and wealthy of earth. The Prince of life suffered the inconveniences of poverty, that He might discern the needs of the poor--He who by His divine power could supply the needs of a hungry multitude. Not to wear the gorgeous robes of the high priest, not to possess the riches of the Gentiles, did He come to this earth, but to minister to the suffering and the needy. His life rebukes all self-seeking. As He went about doing good He made plain the character of God's law and the nature of His service.",
