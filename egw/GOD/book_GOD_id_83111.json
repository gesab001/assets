    "word": "When Jesus began His public ministry, He cleansed the temple from its sacrilegious profanation. Almost the last act of His ministry was to cleanse the temple again. So in the last work for the warning of the world, two distinct calls are made to the churches: The second angel's message, and the voice heard in heaven, \"Come out of her, My people. . . . For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities\" [Revelation 18:4, 5].",
