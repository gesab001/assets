    "word": "But we have to meet and contend with men who employ all their power in slandering those who are loyal to God. Their wit and their God-given reason are devoted to making it appear that obedience to the commandments of God is an irksome service. But those who advocate the claims of the law of God testify, \"Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing \n\n\n                           - 22 - \n\nshall offend them.\" \"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\" The Lord presents truth in contrast with error, and presents also the sure result of accepting truth, the experience that always follows willing obedience. It is peace and rest.",
