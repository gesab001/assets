WHITE ALWAYS DESIRED THAT HER WORK AND TEACHINGS BE TESTED BY THE STANDARD OF GOD'S WORD AS REVEALED IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES. \"LET THE TESTIMONIES BE JUDGED BY THEIR FRUITS,\" SHE WROTE. \"WHAT IS THE SPIRIT OF THEIR TEACHING? WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF THEIR INFLUENCE? . . . GOD IS EITHER TEACHING HIS CHURCH, REPROVING THEIR WRONGS, AND STRENGTHENING THEIR FAITH, OR HE IS NOT. THIS WORK IS OF GOD, OR IT IS NOT. GOD DOES NOTHING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SATAN. MY WORK . . . BEARS THE STAMP OF GOD, OR THE STAMP OF THE ENEMY. THERE IS NO HALF-WAY WORK IN THE MATTER.",
