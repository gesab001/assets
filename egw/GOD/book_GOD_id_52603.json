    "word": "BUT TERRIBLE AS THESE WORDS OF THREATENING ARE, THE MESSAGE IS GIVEN IN MERCY. IT IS A LAST EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE LORD TO AROUSE MEN TO A SENSE OF THEIR DANGER; TO INDUCE THEM TO TURN FROM THEIR EVIL WAYS--FROM THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS OF HIS HOLY LAW --THAT THEY MAY HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. THE LORD HAS NO PLEASURE IN THE DEATH OF THE WICKED; BUT THAT THE WICKED TURN FROM HIS WAY AND LIVE. EZEKIEL 33:11. BUT IF THEY WILL NOT COME UNTO HIM THAT THEY MAY HAVE LIFE; IF THEY CHOOSE TO FOLLOW THE MULTITUDE TO DO EVIL, RATHER THAN TO WALK IN THE WAY OF GOD'S COMMANDMENTS, THEN THEY MUST BEAR THEIR INIQUITY. THEIR BLOOD WILL BE UPON THEIR OWN HEADS. GOD GIVES THEM THE POWER TO CHOOSE, AND WARNS THEM AGAINST THE EVIL WHICH LIES BEFORE THEM. AGAINST ALL HIS ENTREATIES, THEY DO DESPITE TO THE SPIRIT OF GRACE, AND TRAMPLE ON THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF CHRIST WHICH WAS SHED FOR THEIR REDEMPTION.",
