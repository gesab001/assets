    "word": "We are each in the service of God. He is our Teacher, and every lesson He shall give, is to be appreciated and acted upon. We are not called upon to give account of our talents to man, but to God. Our mind, our judgment, our tact, our wisdom, all are given to us of God to be improved for Him, and it is God who will call us to account for the way in which we have used His gifts. . . .",
