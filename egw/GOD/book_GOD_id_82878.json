    "word": "MR No. 105 - Statement Regarding Experience in Canvassing As An Absolute Prerequisite for the Ministry\n\n     Reference to Action Taken at the 1888 General Conference. Another resolution was passed that might have been laid upon the table, i.e. the one in reference to training all licentiates in the canvassing work before permitting them to enter the ministry. This was to be an absolute rule, and notwithstanding all I had to say against this resolution, it was carried. It was not right for the conference to pass it. It was not in God's order, and this resolution will fall powerless to the ground. I shall not sustain it, for I would not be found working against God. This is not God's way of working, and I will not give it countenance for a moment.--Letter 22, 1889, pp. 10-11. (To R. A. Underwood, Jan. 18, 1889.)",
