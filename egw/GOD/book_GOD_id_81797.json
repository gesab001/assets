    "word": "There is a thorough opposition in this place against plain testimony, and Harriet, none are so thoroughly opposed to it as yourself, and yet you are in close connection with the work of God, and in constant opposition and rebellion to the one he has laid burdens upon to reprove, to counsel and \n                                                                           13\nmanage in his cause. Says the true Witness, I know thy works. It has been to disaffect the minds of others in regard to James, to place him in a wrong light before them, and put on a distressed appearance, which has had its influence with a number of individuals, yet you faithfully concealed all this from us. But I have been shown that the counsel and strait testimony will not cease as long as God has anything to do with this church and with the Office. The plain testimony will cut to the right and left, and the church will have to be hewed and squared. The planning-knife of God will pass over them, and if individuals will not bear the strait work they will be laid aside as useless timber, unfit to have any place in the cause or work of God. Harriet, I was shown the past position John occupied after he went to Waukon. The spirit of rebellion that arose there is not dead yet. But quite a number are standing in just that uncertain position, taking no decided stand, with but little spirit of present truth, having no sense of the work of God, and the seeds of rebellion that have taken root there would spring up very easily.",
