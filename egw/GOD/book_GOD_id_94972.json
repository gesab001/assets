    "word": "Spiritual death marks the course of those who feel no burden to bear the messages which, if received, will restore the moral image of God in man. An unconverted ministry means spiritual death to the churches. When the ministers are converted, spiritual life and spiritual death come into conflict ere the truth gains access to the heart. It must fight every inch of the way.",
