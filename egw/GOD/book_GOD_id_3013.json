    "word": "The word came to them, \u201cVerily my sabbaths ye shall keep.\u201d Though the work on the tabernacle must be carried forward with expedition, the Sabbath must not be employed as a working day. Even the work on the Lord\u2019s house must give way to the sacred observance of the Lord\u2019s rest day. Thus God is jealous for the honor of His memorial of creation.",
