    "word": "The Word of God contains food for mind and soul. The appetite for reading the novels or the trashy reading to be found in many of the magazines that are flooding the world, will cause a dwarfage of spiritual growth. An unhealthful appetite is created, and very feeble will be the desire for the sincere milk of the Word. We desire to encourage all to be sensible, and give up the reading of all that is unprofitable, and to become interested in the Word of God, which teaches young and old how to set an example of righteousness. Eat ye that which is good, and instructive, that your souls \n\n\n                                    -401- \n\nmay have a healthful growth.--Letter 279, 1905, p. 3. (To Clarence Santee, October 4, 1905.)",
