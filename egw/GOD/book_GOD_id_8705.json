    "word": "\"The wrath of man shall praise Thee,\" says the psalmist; \"the remainder of wrath shalt Thou restrain.\" God means that testing truth shall be brought to the front and become a subject of examination and discussion, even if it is through the contempt placed upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated. Every controversy, every reproach, every slander, will be God's means of provoking\n336\ninquiry and awakening minds that otherwise would slumber.  5T 452, 453597",
