    "word": "A venerable-looking Vaudois, about 68 years old, was at work in the field. He gave us information concerning the events that had taken place which are mentioned in history. He led us along to the edge of this smiling, grassy field, and we looked over an abrupt, deep precipice, hundreds of feet down. Here the poor souls were driven. Being too few to help themselves, there was no escape for them. They were thrown off from this height upon the jagged rocks, which composed a part of the embankment of the precipice, and into the deep ravine below. And the only reason was that they did not receive the Catholic faith, but made their home in these wild mountain regions to escape their persecutors, and that they might worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. Thousands found their graves in the ravines below this precipice.--Ms 55, 1886, pp. 9, 10. (\"Visit to Bobbio, Italy,\" April 25, 1886.)",
