    "word": "We need now to repent before God. Those who show a repentance that means reconversion will not be left to beat about in the fog of uncertainty and discouragement. He who knocks at the door of mercy and asks forgiveness will receive that for which he asks. The Lord understands the voice of petition. Ask, then; in everything by prayer and supplication let your requests be made known unto God.",
