    "word": "Souls in our world today are in need of a Saviour. The Lord has given his church the opportunity to work for him; he has invited them to come to the gospel feast, and to invite others to come with them. Again and again opportunities have been given for God's people to go out into the highways and hedges, and compel those there to come in, that God's house may be full. In the providence of God, Dr. Kellogg has entered upon a work whereby he can organize workers to carry forward the work of bringing the truth before thousands that are now in vice and iniquity, that they may be redeemed from a life of dissipation and sin. All the people of God should be interested in this work. But a love of ease and selfish indulgence has been shown by many. We are sorry to say that some who have had every privilege of knowing Bible truth have not brought it into the inner sanctuary of the soul. God holds all these accountable for their misused talents, which were entrusted to them to be improved, but which they have not returned to him in honest, faithful service. \n\n\n                       - 5 -",
