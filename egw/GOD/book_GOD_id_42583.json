    "word": "The church member who believes the Word of God will never look indifferently upon a soul that humbles himself and confesses his sin. Let the repenting one be taken back with rejoicing. Christ came to the world to forgive everyone who says, \"I repent. I am sorry for my sin.\" When a brother says, \"God has forgiven me. Will you forgive?\" clasp his hand, and say, \"As I hope to be forgiven, I forgive.\"",
