    "word": "We are walking in the sight of unseen intelligences. A witness is by our side constantly to see how we trade with the Lord's entrusted goods. When the good steward returns his talents with usury, he will claim nothing. He will realize that they are the talents that God delivered unto him, and will give glory to the Master. He knows that there would have been no gain without the deposit, no interest without the principal. He will say, \"Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.\" Let the church now consider whether they are putting out to usury the capital the Lord has given. Without the grace of Christ every soul would have been bankrupt for eternity; therefore we can rightfully claim nothing. But while we can claim nothing, yet when we are faithful stewards, the Lord rewards us as if the merit were all our own. He says, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful \n                                                                           167\nover a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"",
