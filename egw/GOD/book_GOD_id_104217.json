Repent! \n\n     The message preceding the public ministry of the Son of God was, Repent, publicans, repent, Pharisees and Sadducees, \"for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" Our message is not to be one of \"peace and safety.\" As a people who believe in Christ's soon appearing, we have a work to do, a message to bear --\"Prepare to meet thy God.\" We are to lift up the standard, and bear the third angel's message--the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.",
