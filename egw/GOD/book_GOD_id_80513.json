    "word": "Daniel Webster gave utterance to these forcible words: \"If clergymen in our day would return to the simplicity of gospel truth, and preach more to individuals and less to the crowd, there would not be so much complaint of the decline of true religion. Many of the ministers of the present day take their text from St. Paul, and preach from the newspapers. When they do so, I prefer to enjoy my own thoughts, rather than listen. I want my pastor to come to me in the spirit of the gospel, saying, 'You are mortal. Your \n\n\n                     -10- \n\nprobation is brief, your work must be done speedily. . . . You are hastening to the bar of God. The Judge standeth before the door.'\"",
