    "word": "None To Strike Out Alone \n     I write this to you, my dear brother, in the hope of helping you. You are in an unsettled state of mind, and are tempted to do a strange work, which God has not appointed you to do. None of us are to strike out alone; we are to link up with our brethren, and pull together, and God will give us influence and self-control. We are to draw near to God, that He may draw near to us.--Letter 40, 1903. (Published in Medical Ministry, p. 46.)",
