    "word": "I pray, Brother Reaser, that you may find an open door, that this may be made a pentecostal season in the churches. Encourage one another to put from the soul everything that would hinder the exercise of the grace of Christ. This precious privilege is now being presented that all may receive the assurance of the grace and love of Christ. The Lord will be the hope and strength of His commandment keeping people. Look for that grace that the Lord has in abundance for all who trust in him. Believe, and receive the special assurances of His grace. The blessing of God is more precious than silver and gold.",
