    "word": "\"Let not human agents interpose to take another's work out of the hands of God into their own finite hands. I have borne abundant testimony, setting forth the fact that The Ability to Write a Book, is, like every other talent, a gift from God, for which the possessor is accountable to him. This talent No Man Can buy or sell without incurring great and dangerous responsibility. Those who labor to bring about changes in the publication of books, to place the books wholly under the control of the publishing houses or the Conference, know not what they are talking about. Their eyes are blinded, and they work from a wrong standpoint. Selfishness is a root of bitterness whereby many are defiled.",
