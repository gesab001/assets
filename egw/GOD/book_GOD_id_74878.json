    "word": "Earnest Work. \n\n     It is when we are engaged in earnest work, working according to our several abilities, that God manifests himself to us, and gives us grace for grace. A working church in travail for souls, will be a praying church, a believing church, and a receiving church. A church whose members are found upon their knees before God, supplicating his mercy, seeking him daily, is a church that is feeding upon the bread of life, and drinking of the waters of life. The promise, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he will give it you,\" will be verified to them. Christlike activity pursued with persevering zeal will bring large returns. There will \n\n\n                          - 37 - \n\nbe an enlarged experience in love, and the human agents will have elevated views as to what God would do through them as they stand at their post of duty. Then will the church arise and shine, realizing that the glory of the Lord has risen upon her, and that darkness is receding. Missionary success will be proportionate to whole-hearted, thoroughly consecrated effort. Every departure from true missionary effort, every failure to cherish the missionary spirit, has reacted upon the church, and there has been a decline of spirituality. But every earnest effort that has been made in missionary lines, has brought spiritual health to the church, and has not only increased the membership of the church, but has increased its holy zeal and gladness.",
