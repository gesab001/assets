    "word": "We feel deeply grateful for the blessing of God that has come into the meeting here [Chicago, Ill.]. We have all been blessed indeed. There began to be a break on Thursday, and on Friday the meetings were excellent, but oh, how hard it was to educate the people to look away from themselves to Jesus and to His righteousness. A continuous effort has had to be put forth. I am sure that those who are present begin to see now what they have lost in the past by their unbelief, and by the Christless sermons that have been presented. If this message that has been preached here is not present truth for this time, I know not how we can determine what is truth.",
