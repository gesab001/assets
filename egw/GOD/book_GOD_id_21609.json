    "word": "As a part of the services of the day, the monarch himself addressed the high officials of the kingdom in the great hall of the bishop's palace. With a sorrowful countenance he appeared before them, and in words of moving eloquence bewailed the \u201ccrime, the blasphemy, the day of sorrow and disgrace,\u201d that had come upon the nation. And he called upon every loyal subject to aid in the extirpation of the pestilent heresy that threatened France with ruin. \u201cAs true, Messieurs, as I am your king,\u201d he said, \u201cif I knew one of my own limbs spotted or infected with this detestable rottenness, I would give it to you to cut off. . . . And, further, if I saw one of my children defiled by it, I would not spare him. . . . I would deliver him up myself, and would sacrifice him to God.\u201d Tears choked his utterance, and the \n229\nwhole assembly wept, with one accord exclaiming, \u201cWe will live and die in the Catholic religion.\u201d",
