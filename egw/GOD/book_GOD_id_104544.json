    "word": "It is not safe for us to open our minds and hearts to envy and evil speaking. The fruits of God's Spirit are plainly specified, so that we need not entertain or cherish those attributes that proceed from the enemy of God and man. The false tongue beguiles the unwary, and makes an easy conquest of those who are not strengthened, stablished, and settled, having root in themselves. The atonement of Christ is to be the anchor of our hope, and the word of God a lamp to our feet, and a light to our path. Then our words will not be of self, but of Christ and of the all-essential work for this time.",
