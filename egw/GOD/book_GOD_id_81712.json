    "word": "Young men should be qualifying themselves to become familiar with other languages, that God may use them as mediums to communicate his saving truth to those of other nations. These young men may obtain a knowledge of other languages, even while engaged in laboring for sinners. If they are economical of their time, they can be improving their mind, and qualifying themselves for more extended usefulness. Young women who have borne but little responsibility, if they devote themselves to God, can be qualifying themselves by study to become familiar with other languages. They could devote themselves to the work of translating.",
