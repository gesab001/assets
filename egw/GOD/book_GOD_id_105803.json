    "word": "The use of drugs has not been specified as in the Lord's order, but He has given special light concerning our health institutions, directing His people to practice and cultivate hygienic principles. Such should be taught those who are in ignorance as to how to live in accordance with pure principles, practicing those things that will preserve the body in a healthful condition. Man is to cooperate with God-given ability. He is not to be ignorant as to what are right practices in eating and drinking, and in all his habits of life. The Lord designs that His human agents shall act as rational, accountable beings in every respect.",
