    "word": "As the Sanitarium is now located in Battle Creek, there is presented to me a very clear picture of the result of gathering students to a school in Battle Creek. By His judgments, God has revealed His displeasure at the way in which matters have been carried in the Sanitarium, and in the general management. There has not been a pure, fragrant, wholesome religious influence. The Lord does not design that the Sanitarium at Battle Creek shall be the center of education, drawing students to a place where he has evidenced that His judgments will be executed.",
