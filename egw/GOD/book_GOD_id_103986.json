    "word": "The trials of God's people may be long and severe, but the Lord never forgets them. Those who believe the truth and obey the commandments will find refuge in Christ. They will have the effectual protection of His ever-loving care as long as they take their position on the side of God and His law, which ever has governed and ever will govern His kingdom. Those who hold fast the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end will find that God is faithful and that He will fulfill His covenant to His commandment-keeping people.--MS. 42, 1900. \n\n                                               -",
