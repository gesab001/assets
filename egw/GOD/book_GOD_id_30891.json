    "word": "More and more, men and women are going forth with the gospel message. We thank God for this. But we need a greater awakening. We slide back into self-indulgence; we do not exercise to the utmost the virtues that Christ has promised if we ask in faith. That which we receive from Christ we must give to others. Just as surely as we receive, so surely must we give. None who receive the grace of Christ can keep it to themselves. As soon as Christ becomes an abiding presence in the heart, we shall not be able to see souls perishing in ignorance of the truth and be at rest. We shall make any sacrifice that we may reach them; and none of us are so poor that we cannot make daily sacrifices for Christ.",
