    "word": "Both of you need to be transformed in character or you will experience pain and remorse. You must feel your own sinfulness and nothingness, and when the grace of Christ is revealed to you you will no longer live to self but for God and for humanity.

Take all your deep-drawn sighs, your much-talked-of neglect and wrong, to the Burden-bearer. Break your heart before God in the presence of your family, and before your mother, who ought to find a pleasant home of peace with you, and let the sunlight of God's love into your home. Your own course of action has manufactured the irritating yoke that you are wearing.",
