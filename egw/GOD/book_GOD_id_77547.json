    "word": "Brethren at Fresno, there is with Elder Daniels a human influence combined with a mesmeric power. It is this that has led him to speak of congregations as bodies that he can manipulate. Why is it that the man cannot understand health reform?--It is because his appetites and practices are condemned by it. He cannot harmonize his practices with the light God has given on this subject in his word and through the testimonies. He cannot, then, of course, have an intelligent, practical knowledge of health reform.",
