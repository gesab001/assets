    "word": "We cannot always be upon our knees in prayer, but the way to the throne of God is always open. While engaged in active labor, we may ask, and we are promised by One who will not deceive us, \"ye shall receive.\" The Christian can and will find time to pray. Daniel was a statesman; yet three times a day he sought God, and the Lord gave him of His Holy Spirit. So today men may resort to the most sacred pavilion of the Most High and feel the assurance of His promise, \"My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places\" [Isaiah 32:18]. All who really desire it can find a place for communion with God where no ear can hear but the one open to the cries of the helpless, distressed, and needy.",
