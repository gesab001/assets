    "word": "Sabbath, February 16, 1895--May Lacey accompanied me to Petersham, eleven miles, the new place of meeting. A neat hall was filled to overflowing. Brother McCullagh had spoken at Ashfield in the forenoon, Brother Hare had been at Parramatta, and both were at the meeting in Petersham. The Lord gave me much freedom in speaking upon the fourteenth of Luke, the first portion of the chapter. There was then a testimony meeting. Those newly come to the faith came from Ashfield, and they bore witness for Jesus. The blessing of the Lord rested upon us. Brethren Humphrey and Hardy appear entirely changed men in spirit. They were bearing the change in their very countenance. I thought of the words spoken by God, \"A new heart will I give you\" (Ezekiel 36:26).",
