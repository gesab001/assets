    "word": "I know not who is cook at the boarding hall, but I beseech you, do not place any persons to oversee the cooking of food for the college students unless they have a thorough knowledge of the right kind of cooking, that the students shall take away with them the very best intelligence of what hygienic cooking means. The much-liquid food, the pastries, the desserts, prepared for the table after European hotel fashion, is not the proper food to place before a hungry lot of students, whose appetites are keen to devour the most substantial food. The very best, thorough cook should be employed. If I were speaking to your own family, I would say the same. But it is not merely your own family; it is in behalf of God's heritage of children I am speaking. No one person's ideas, or tastes, or customs, or habits are to control the boarding-house table. But obtain the very best cook, and have helpers that she, as matron in the kitchen, shall oversee. The students pay for their board; give them good, solid, nourishing food.--Letter 46, 1893, p. 5. (To W. W. Prescott, Sept. 5, 1893.)",
