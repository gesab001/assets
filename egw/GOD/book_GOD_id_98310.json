    "word": "\"And taketh hold of My covenant.\" There is much more in these words than many comprehend at the first reading. When the Lord gave His law to the children of Israel encamped at the foot of Mount Sinai, the people with one accord promised, \"All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.\" In return for their loyalty, the Lord promised to bring them safely into the promised land and to prosper them above all other nations. \"Behold,\" He declared, \"I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.... If thou shalt indeed obey His voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.... And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and He shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee\" [Exodus 23:20, 22, 25].",
