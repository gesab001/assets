    "word": "How full and free are the blessings to be bestowed on all who come to God in the name of His Son. If they will observe the conditions laid down in His Word, He will open to them the windows of heaven, and pour them down a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it. . . . If God's people will sanctify themselves by obedience to His precepts, the Lord will work in their midst. He will renew humble, contrite souls, making their characters pure and holy.--Manuscript 128, Nov. 28, 1897, \"The Only True Mediator.\"",
