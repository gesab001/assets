    "word": "Teach the children that because of God's great love their natures may be changed and brought into harmony with His. Teach them that He would have their lives beautiful with the graces of the flowers. Teach them, as they gather the sweet blossoms, that He who made the flowers is more beautiful than they. Thus the tendrils of their hearts will be entwined about Him. He who is \"altogether lovely\" will become to them as a daily companion and familiar friend, and their lives will be transformed into the image of His purity.",
