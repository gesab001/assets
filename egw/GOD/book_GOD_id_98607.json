    "word": "But the shepherds of the flock, instead of accepting the message, begin to search the Scriptures diligently to find something by which to condemn the serious, searching warnings from God's Word. They refuse to pay any attention to the last messages of warning that are to be given to the world, but seek to resist everything that does not vindicate their church as being what it should be. They use all the argumentative powers of the mind, and reason with the greatest possible positiveness and force from their own conclusions. They refuse to hear or to search the Scriptures for themselves in order to see if there is not light and evidence in God's Word that would lead them to make changes in their doctrinal views so as to be in harmony with God's truth. \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me\" [John 5:39].",
