    "word": "We would not sever youth and old age, and I love to have children in the room where I am if they do not fill the whole room and are the all pervading element in the room.

You need not make a long recitation of the matter to the children, but act as opportunities present themselves. Tell them you must not be interrupted for you wish to hear and to talk now. And the character of the child must be formed so as not to consider your children in this world to carry through without restraint their own desires. They are to be educated as to what is proper and right. Hannah gave to the Lord her son and separated him from her as soon as he was weaned and brought a little coat to the lad every year.
