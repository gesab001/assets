    "word": "Christ has specified the measure of love we are to show for one another. \"A new commandment I give unto you,\" He declared, \"That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\" By this practical love, seen by the world, \"shall all men know that ye are My disciples.\" When the softening, subduing influence of the Spirit of God rules the hearts of those who are connected with His service, they will honor Him by keeping the new commandment, new because Christ said, \"As I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\"",
