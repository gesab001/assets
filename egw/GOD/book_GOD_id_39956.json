    "word": "There is another matter too often neglected by those who seek the Lord in prayer. Have you been honest with God? By the prophet Malachi the Lord declares, \u201cEven from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from Mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto Me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? Will a man rob God? \n309\nYet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings.\u201d Malachi 3:7, 8.",
