    "word": "My brother, had you felt the necessity of preaching the lessons of true Christianity yourself, and of taking J. G. Matteson under strict discipline, then you could have seen and felt the necessity of instructing others. When you do not reach the standard yourself, how can you bring others up? When I see the people in Christiania and other places regarding you in the light they do, as \n\n\n                                   -100- \n\nthough you were almost as Christ, and then know how far short you come of practical godliness, I am distressed beyond measure. A man who has ability as you have, and with your entrusted talents, is far more accountable than those who have less light and less ability. Your position, then--what you have done or may do--will be no excuse in your case for not reaching the Bible standard in Christian character. You need daily the transforming grace of Christ on your heart or you cannot do the work of God with clear spiritual discernment, with an eye single to His glory.",
