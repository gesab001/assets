    "word": "An Evil Work \n\n     Some of our brethren have done a work that has wrought great injury to the cause. The knowledge of how to manufacture health foods, which God gave to His people as a means for helping to sustain the cause, these men have disclosed to worldly businessmen, who will use this knowledge as a means of personal gain, giving none of the glory to God. Those who have thus disclosed the secrets in their possession in regard to the preparation of health foods, have abused a God-given trust. As they see the result of this betrayal of trust, some will sorely regret that they did not keep their own counsel, and wait for the Lord to lead His servants and to work out His plans in His own way.",
