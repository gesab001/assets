    "word": "O, eternal life is worth everything! and to lose it, the man loses everything. Will he give up the struggle? Will he brave it through in defiance of God, or will he show his loathing for the sins he has committed, and say, \"Woe is me, that for so long I have been a transgressor of the law of God. Lord, I know that thy law is holy, just, and good. Woe is me that I have tried to preserve my dignity, and in so doing, have lost so much as a steward of Christ's grace. I have been a transgressor, but I will be so no longer. I will repent, while Christ is still pleading for me in the courts of heaven. I will now come into the presence of the Saviour, and touch the holy scepter, and if I perish, I perish\"?",
