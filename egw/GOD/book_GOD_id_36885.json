    "word": "Blessed is the man who by faith can get a glimpse of Christ's faith. . . . Then there is a possibility of his becoming Christlike in character. . . . Great light comes to man as he sees the privileges that are for him. He sees God's plans for him and he dies to self. . . . He submits to be worked. . . . When he submits to be as clay in the hands of the potter, then God works the man into a vessel of honor.",
