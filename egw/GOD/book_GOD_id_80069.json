    "word": "Let each now consider the strong and determined traits of his character, and not be misled by them, and misrepresent the precious truth, and thus misrepresent Jesus Christ by unguarded statements in public by voice, or in publications; for every such thing will he meet again. Those who have the truth, let the truth appear, while self is dropped out of sight. Give no occasion for any one to be harsh, denunciatory, or severe; for there are inexperienced men and women who will catch the manners and indiscreet words that fall from the lips of any one bearing aloft the banner of truth, and in an improper manner will repeat their very works, and in a spirit which will do much harm. Therefore, every man, however gifted, however prominent in the ranks of believers, let him know that caution in expression is his positive duty to practice, lest his words shall lead astray some souls, who will think he is imitating and following the example of the man, the messenger acknowledged to be sent forth by God to proclaim a message for this time. Let all consider that we are as sheep among wolves, and heed the caution of Christ by being \"wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\"",
