    "word": "At times, Elder Prescott, you have come very near making shipwreck \n     of your faith. Only the grace of God and the confidence you \n     have had in the messages He has sent through the Spirit of Prophecy \n     have held you back. I was shown that although you have had many \n     years of experience in the cause of God, you are still in danger \n     of making grave mistakes.",
