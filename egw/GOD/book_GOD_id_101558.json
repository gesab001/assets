    "word": "One of the dangers to which God's people will be exposed is this, The delusions that are coming upon a world that has turned from the truth. Those will be of such deceptive power, that the apostle under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, declares. \"If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\" Our work now is to confirm our souls in the faith,--that faith which is a working faith, which works by love and purifies the soul.

Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.\" \"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: \"for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.\"",
