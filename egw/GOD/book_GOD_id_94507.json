    "word": "If the managers are swaying the institution away from the principles which it was created to maintain, which they have been doing, then a change must be made. To let things go on as they have been going is decidedly wrong. The very first thing to be done is to secure harmony of action, to clear away the difficulties and mark out a sphere of action. Christian principles in accordance with our faith must be maintained at any cost. Let us not be met with the statement that the adoption of Christian health reform principles in such an institution is simply impossible. These principles must be adopted and maintained. When this cannot be done, then let the institution be closed. The doctrines of Seventh-day Adventists are not to be sounded in the ears of guests and patients, but the principles which have made Seventh-day Adventists what they are should be lived out, and show a people in everything obedient to our great Leader Jesus Christ. The institution has not been conducted after God's order. It must return to the principles given in the lessons of Christ.",
