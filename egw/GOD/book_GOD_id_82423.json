    "word": "The heart is the citadel of the man, and until new affections, new moral tastes are created through the power of Christ, the enemy finds his stronghold in the heart. It is in the heart that man establishes his idols, and no power \n                                                                           206\non earth can dislodge the enemy, when men are satisfied to live in separation from God. When the heart is not in possession of an indwelling Saviour, the carnal lusts, the tastes, the mind of the great deceiver will be revealed in the life, and although men may make a profession of Christianity, their works will testify that they know not God; though they acknowledge the truth, its place in the heart is occupied by a deceptive spirit. The love of the Saviour is not there. The love of Christ was an unselfish love, that prompted Him to seek and save that which was lost. Those who think much of their remuneration for their services, reveal the fact that they have not laid the foundation for their spiritual life on the sure Rock, or they have lost the spirit of the truth, and have forgotten that they are purged from the old leaven with the priceless blood of the Son of God. They have become so devoid of spiritual discernment that they place the sacred and the common on the same level. The Lord is not honored in their hearts, and the principles of the religion of Christ are not woven in the character. They go through a cold formal service that they call religion; but Christ is not formed within, the hope of glory.",
