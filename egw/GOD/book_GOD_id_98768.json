Kellogg: \n\nMy dear brother,-- \n\n\n     When you took your position with those who have warded off all testimonies of reproof, did you feel that you were standing on safe ground? Do you not know that those who despise and throw aside the counsels of the Lord, are in fearful peril? And do you not know that by standing with them, you are making of no account the work given me of God? Any one could say, \"Some one has told Sister White:\" but this would not make it so. Any one could close his eyes to his danger, but this would not make the danger less real. This is too serious a matter for you to trifle with.",
