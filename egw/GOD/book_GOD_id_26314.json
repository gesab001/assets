    "word": "The 144,000 \n\n     They sing \"a new song\" before the throne, a song which no man can learn save the hundred and forty and four thousand. It is the song of Moses and the Lamb--a song of deliverance. None but the hundred and forty-four thousand can learn that song, for it is the song of their experience--an experience such as no other company have ever had. \"These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.\" These, having been translated from the earth, from among the living, are counted as \"the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb\" (Revelation 15:2, 3; 14:1-5.) \"These are they which came out of great tribulation\"; they have \n                                                                           269\npassed through the time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation; they have endured the anguish of the time of Jacob's trouble; they have stood without an intercessor through the final outpouring of God's judgments.--GC 648, 649 (1911).",
