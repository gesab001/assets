    "word": "MR No. 1378 - Better Days Are Coming\n\n     (Written Jan. 11, 1850, from Oswego, New York, to \"Dear Brother and Sister [Leonard] Hastings.\") \n\n\n     I will take time to write you a few lines. I earnestly desire to see you. I pray God to bless and sanctify you. I felt today the necessity of being all, all ready, that when the time of trouble such as never was shall come, we may be hid in the Lord. Oh, my brother and sister, I wish all of God's people could get a sight of it as God has shown it me. The work of the Lord is going on; souls are coming into the truth, and soon the work will be all done. Keep up good courage, hope in God; let nothing weigh thee down. We have the truth. We know it. Praise the Lord.",
