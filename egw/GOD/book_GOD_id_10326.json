    "word": "The Sabbath School a Factor in Missionary \n                        Training \n\n\n     It has been proved in the missionary field, that, whatever may be the preaching talent, if the laboring part is neglected, if the people are not taught how to work, how to conduct meetings, how to act their part in missionary labor, how to reach people successfully, the work will be nearly a failure. There is much to be done in the Sabbath school work also, in bringing the people to realize their obligation and to act their part. God calls them to work for Him, and the ministers should guide their efforts.--5T 256.",
