White. \n\n     How can any one who is in fellowship with Christ's sufferings, refuse to obey His will and do His work? Yet there are people who know the terms of salvation, which are plainly revealed in the word of God. They listen to the message which the Lord sends through His delegated servants, but, although they assent to the truth, they will not obey. They have not genuine faith to appropriate God's promises to themselves. They do not regard Him as their personal Saviour, in whom they may trust as a child trusts its loving parents. They do not regard God as a loving heavenly Father, who has provided for them a perfect Saviour, a never-failing Friend, an infallible Guide and Teacher.",
