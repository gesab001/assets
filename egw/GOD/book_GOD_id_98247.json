    "word": "In no respect is God's work to be circumscribed by man-made restrictions. Many of the ambitious plans and policies that have been made are not endorsed by Him. He is no party to keeping many advantages in one place. He desires every institution established to stand ready to help establish the next institution that is needed. Upon everyone who knows the truth rests the responsibility of bringing others into the truth.",
