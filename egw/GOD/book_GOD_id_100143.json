    "word": "You, my brethren, took the responsibility of seeing that it was put in circulation, but about the time when the new edition of Vol. IV came from the press, the new work \"Bible Readings\" was introduced. This book has had a great sale, and has been permitted to swallow up every other interest. Canvassers found it an easy book to handle, and Vol. IV was kept out of the field. I felt that this was not right; I know that it was not right, because it was not in harmony with the light which God had given me. I talked with Capt. Eldridge, and with Frank Belden while he was engaged in training canvassers, but the only response I could get was, \"We cannot do anything in this matter until Bible Readings has had its run. Then we will take hold of Vol. IV, and give it the field.\" Last fall I was promised that in the spring a special effort should be made to push Vol. IV. My answer was. \"Brethren, I dare not wait so long.\" I could not understand why such delay was necessary. The reasons given were of no weight to me. I felt that if my brethren understood and appreciated the subject matter which the Lord had presented before me and bidden me to write, their excuses would have appeared very small to their own minds.",
