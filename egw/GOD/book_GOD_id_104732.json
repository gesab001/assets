    "word": "Now is our period of stewardship. We are training on our Lord's goods. Our means, our speech, our influence, all are talents to be used in the Master's service, to be multiplied by wise investment. We must increase our capabilities. If God has entrusted us with three talents, He will not accept of two in return. If we have but one talent, but with it gain yet another, we shall have a position and a place in Christ's service, and will finally hear the blessed words of commendation and approval from the lips of our Saviour.",
