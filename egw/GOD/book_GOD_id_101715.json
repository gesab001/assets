    "word": "I have heard from many the cry of unjust dealing, and knowing something of the inward working of these matters, I have been stirred with indignation. For years men have been working contrary to God's word, ignoring judgment and justice. Shall we be compelled to follow the same course pursued by Nehemiah? We read of him, \"I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one against his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.\" \"Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? I likewise and my brethren, and my servants might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.\" \"The former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver, . . . . but so did not I, because of the fear of God.\"",
