    "word": "A sanctified ambition to excel in imitating the character of Christ is a safe ambition to cherish; for it is not the will of God that physicians and workers should retrograde. It is his will that they should reach the highest development of the \n\n\n                     -10- \n\nphysical, mental, and moral natures. Striving to excel in what is excellent is lawful, and promises entire success. You are called to be laborers together with God, whether you are physicians, nurses, or workers in any other branch of the Sanitarium. You should ever remember that you are in holy partnership in the great work of God. Realizing this fact, you may be enabled to act your part faithfully according to your ability, training your souls and the souls of others for the future immortal life. A cloud of witnesses is around you. The heavenly intelligences look upon you; and the evil angels are also spectators of your actions. The Prince of Life is watching to see if those who have had such great light and so much knowledge will practise what they have been taught, and help those who have been connected with them in the work to walk in the light as Christ is in the light.",
