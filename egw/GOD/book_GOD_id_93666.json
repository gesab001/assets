N.] Haskell.\") \n\n\n     I received and read your letter, and would say to you, Let nothing depress you. It will not pay to allow yourself to become cast down. Satan is pleased when he can work his will in this respect. You are to look to the One who has never failed you, who will never leave you. You need not be discouraged, notwithstanding there may be many things of a discouraging nature to meet right among professed believers. Strange things will be revealed, but we are warned in the Word of God that thus it will be.",
