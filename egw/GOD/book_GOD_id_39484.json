    "word": "DAVID \n\nDAVID\u2019S FALL A WARNING NOT TO NEGLECT PRAYER.\u2014God intended the history of David\u2019s fall to serve as a warning that even those whom He has greatly blessed and favored are not to feel secure and neglect watchfulness and prayer. And thus it has proved to those who in humility have sought to learn the lesson that God designed to teach. From generation to generation thousands have thus been led to realize their own danger from the tempter\u2019s power. The fall of David, one so greatly honored by the Lord, has awakened in them distrust of self. They have felt that God alone could keep them by His power through faith. Knowing that in Him was \n141\ntheir strength and safety, they have feared to take the first step on Satan\u2019s ground.\u2014(Patriarchs and Prophets, 724.)",
