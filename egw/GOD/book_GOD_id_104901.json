    "word": "And I want to say that there is a lot to be done for your children in your homes. No crossness; they are God's children. It is the Lord's heritage, and you have no right to speak to them in a way which will create an unhappy disposition and spoil their tempers. You want to speak to your children kindly. I have felt it my duty, notwithstanding all my trials and these things, to bring up some children. They say, Why, you are bringing up so many children! I want them right in my home. I see the mothers do not know how to discipline them, and they are very glad to have me take them. And so I take them, and I have now three or four children that I have taken and trained in the very way I told you, never to speak a cross word. I would tell them, We will give you a ride every day, and we will try in all our words that there is nothing that shall deserve a tod. That is what we are going to try for. Well now, we accomplish what we try for.",
