    "word": "I am instructed to say that we are on test and trial to reveal whether, if under favorable circumstances, we would share with our neighbor brethren the supplies and rich gifts bestowed by God upon us, that they may be able to work having advantages equal to those of our own. We are to demonstrate here in this world how we would conduct ourselves in the heavenly courts; for the same characters we reveal here, the way with which we deal with our brethren here is the way we would deal with those who are to compose the family in heaven. Now is our testing, proving time. Just as we treat one another we will treat Him who gave His life to save a perishing world from eternal ruin.",
