    "word": "MR No. 1473 - Trust in God and Follow His Counsel\n\n     (Written November 5, 1894, from Granville, N.S.W., to W. C. White.) \n\n     I arise early this morning and I thought to suggest to you, before arrangements shall be made for Byron and Sarah Belden, would it not be well for them to be in Newcastle and work in that place? Would it not be well for him to purchase things for the school and try to prepare the way for Newcastle to be worked, and will not just such ones who have experience be needed to do a certain work? Would not this be of greater advantage than sending them back to Melbourne and then to Broken Hill? Please consider this question.",
