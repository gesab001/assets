    "word": "Those whom God chooses as His workers are not always talented in the estimation of the world. Sometimes He selects unlearned men. These workers have a special work to do. They reach a class to which no one else could obtain access. Those who labor in a quiet way will be rewarded with the same commendation as those who, from outward appearances, exerted a wider influence. Every worker is rewarded according to the spirit that prompted him to action.",
