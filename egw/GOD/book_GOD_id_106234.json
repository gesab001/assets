    "word": "The Lord calls upon his people to help the Southern field. This call brings with it a solemn, sacred responsibility, which can not be evaded. The field speaks for itself. Neglected, down-trodden, oppressed, ignorant, who need our help more than the colored people of the South? Let this field be helped, without waiting until every other call for help is answered. God calls for a right appropriation of his means, that the work may enlarge and extend, where such extension will help other barren and forsaken parts of the vineyard.",
