    "word": "God has given man land to be cultivated. But in order to reap the harvest, there must be harmonious action between divine and human agencies. The plough and other implements of labor must be used at the right times. The seed must be sown in its season. Man is not to fail of doing his part. If he is careless and negligent, his unfaithfulness testifies against him. The harvest is proportionate to the energy he has expended.--Letter 139, 1898, p. 16. (To Elder A. T. Jones, December 16, 1898.)",
