    "word": "The work of God needs men and women who have learned of Christ. The moment God's workmen see Him as He is, that moment they will see themselves as they are, and will ask Him to make them what they ought to be. Selfishness makes men hindrances instead of helps. In God's light we can see our defects, and in His strength we can remedy them.",
