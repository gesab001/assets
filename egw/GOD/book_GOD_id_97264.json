    "word": "What are we to do? Study the Scriptures. Search the Scriptures. See whether you are obeying the law of God and the standard of his righteousness. Tell your children that you have disregarded the law of God. Tell them you feel as Ezra did. Here was Josiah, so sorry to think that the law had been lost, and that they had been careless and heedless of it. They bring it before him. There stands up one that reads it, and the people weep and mourn because they have not kept the law. But rejoice that you have the law now. We will keep it. Bring your offerings and gifts, and offer praise to God with your tears and mourning. That is just what we want to do.",
