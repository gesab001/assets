    "word": "PRIVATE PRAYER SHOULD BE PRIVATE.\u2014In private prayer all have the privilege of praying as long as they desire and of being as explicit as they please. They can pray for all their relatives and friends. The closet is the place to tell all their private difficulties, and trials, and temptations. A common meeting to worship God is not the place to open the privacies of the heart.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, 578.)",
