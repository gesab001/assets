    "word": "I wish to impress upon the minds of physicians the fact that they can not do as they please with their thoughts and imaginations, and at the same time be safe in their calling. Satan is the destroyer; Christ is the restorer. I desire our physicians to fully comprehend this point. They may save souls from death by a right application of the knowledge they have gained, or they may work against the Great Master-builder. They may cooperate with God, or they may counterwork his plans by failing to work harmoniously with Him.",
