    "word": "Teaching Sabbath Observance \n\n     Parents should have a thorough understanding with their family that the sacred hours of the Sabbath are to be spent to God's glory. They should be up with the sun, and have plenty of time to prepare for Sabbath school without getting into a rush, and perhaps losing self-control. If the proper preparations have been made the previous day, there will be abundance of time to review the lesson studied during the week; and both parents and children can go to the school with the assurance that they have the lessons well learned.",
