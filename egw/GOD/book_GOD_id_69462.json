    "word": "A mere profession of discipleship is of no value. The faith in Christ which saves the soul is not what it is represented to be by many. \"Believe, believe,\" they say, \"and you need not keep the law.\" But a belief that does not lead to obedience is presumption. The apostle John says, \"He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" 1 John 2:4. Let none cherish the idea that special providences or miraculous manifestations are to be the proof of the genuineness of their work or of the ideas they advocate. When persons will speak lightly of the word of God, and set their impressions, feelings, and exercises above the divine standard, we may know that they have no light in them.",
