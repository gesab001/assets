    "word": "Before the creation of man, angels were in existence; for when the foundations of the earth were laid, \u201cthe morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\u201d [Job 38:7.]. After the fall of man, angels were sent to guard the tree of life, and this before a human being had died. Angels are in nature superior to men. For the psalmist says that man was made \u201ca little lower than the angels.\u201d [Psalm 8:5.]",
