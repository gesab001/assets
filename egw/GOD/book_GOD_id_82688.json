    "word": "Need for Conversion.--Genuine conversion is needed. . . . God's Word declares, \"He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth\" (2 Corinthians 10:17, 18). The success of the ministry of Elias was not due to any inherited qualities he possessed, but to the submission of himself to the Holy Spirit, which was given to him as it will be given to all who exercise living faith in God. In his imperfection man has the privilege of linking himself up with God through Jesus Christ.",
