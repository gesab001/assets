    "word": "My brother, if you can come to Berrien Springs and as Bible teacher take your place in the school with your brethren, having confidence in them, believing that God has been leading them in their work as He has been leading you in your work; if you can come trusting yourself in the hands of God, willing to do the work He calls you to do, without insisting on the carrying out of such propositions as were made in your letter, then come. But if you cannot come unless these propositions are accepted, I could not advise you to come. We do not know the end from the beginning. God does not want you or me, in our human judgment, to lay down such plans for the future. God's hand leads those who will be led. His righteousness goes before them.",
