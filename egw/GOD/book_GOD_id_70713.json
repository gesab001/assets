    "word": "\u201cIf we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us\u201d; and that love cannot be restrained. . . . Only by becoming partakers of the divine nature can the law of God be fulfilled by men and women. Only those who love God with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength, and their neighbor as themselves, can give glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, good will to men. This was the work of Christ; and when His work is appreciated and represented by His followers, the great result will be achieved in the \u201cjoy that was set before him\u201d in the saving of the souls for whom He gave His life.",
