    "word": "Children, have faith in God. If you make mistakes, turn your defeats into victories. Test and trial comes to every child of God. The intensity of your love and fidelity will be tested by difficulties, disappointments, and trials. These your faith must overcome. The burden you bear for Christ's sake, the service you render to Him in the complete surrender of your will to God's will, is the measure of your love for Him. \n     [1 Peter 1:3-8, quoted.]",
