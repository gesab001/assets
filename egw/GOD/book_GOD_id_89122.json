    "word": "You are in perplexity as to what is the best course for you to pursue. Please consider that the Lord is acquainted with you. He knows every event connected with your life. He knoweth our frame, that we are but dust. Knowing this, He desires to impress us with the conviction that our only hope is in and through the merits of Jesus Christ. Of our own selves we cannot bear the weight of our own sins, nor atone for our mistakes and errors, but the Lord has provided a way of escape, for it is because He saw us sinners, unable to save ourselves, that God's great heart was touched, \n\n\n                                     -34- \n\nand He \"so loved the world [in their degradation and sin] that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16).",
