    "word": "\"Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge\"--knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, knowledge of the great plan of salvation. To be ignorant of God's commandments and laws will not excuse a soul. He will not dare to plead around the throne of God, \"I did not know the truth. I was ignorant.\" The Lord has given His word to be our guide, our instructor, and with this heavenly enlightening there is no excuse for ignorance. Christ speaks of those who have eyes but see not, ears but they hear not. God has given them precious hours of probation. He has given them His truth. He has said plainly if they do His will they shall know of the doctrine. Therefore those that might be wise in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but do not choose this wisdom will be banished from His presence when the judgment shall sit and the books be opened.",
