    "word": "It is the Lord's desire that His followers shall grow in grace, that their love shall abound more and more, that they shall be filled with the fruits of righteousness. . . . Where there is life, there will be growth and fruit bearing; but unless we grow in grace, our spirituality will be dwarfed, sickly, fruitless. It is only by growing, by bearing fruit, that we can fulfill God's purpose for us. \"Herein is my Father glorified,\" Christ said, \"that ye bear much fruit\" (John 15:8). in order to bear much fruit, we must make the most of our privileges. We must use every opportunity granted us for obtaining strength.",
