    "word": "I mourn now that I did not do the very work I ought to have done when my nephew, Frank Belden, and Captain Eldridge were in responsible positions and had not an appreciation of the Great Controversy, Vol. 4, which the people should have had then as they are having now. What effect did all my talk with a burdened heart in setting before them these things, have upon them? As much as to talk to a stone. My burden, my distress, was interpreted to be through selfish motives. They judged me by themselves. They intercepted themselves in their own management, that the book which the people should have had, which the Lord would have had them have, fell almost useless, and died from the press. Light was in that book which came from heaven; but what account \n                                                                           1281\nwill those men have to give to God for the little faith and confidence manifested in that book that the warnings should not come to the people when they should have had them? I am so glad the people can have them now. The delay was Satan's own devising. He was working diligently and has brought about a condition of things that the work cannot now go as it would have gone and done its work, which the Lord presented before me needed to be done. Those who hindered the work will have to answer to God for this.",
