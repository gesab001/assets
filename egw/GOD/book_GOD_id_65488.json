    "word": "My brethren, we are living in a most solemn period of this earth's history. There is never time to sin; it is always perilous to continue in transgression; but in a special sense is this true at the present time. We are now upon the very borders of the eternal world and stand in a more solemn relation to time and to eternity than ever before. Now let every person search his own heart, and plead for the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness to expel all spiritual darkness and cleanse from defilement. \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" Through faith, irrespective of feeling, Jesus, the Author of our salvation, the Finisher of our faith, will, by His precious grace, strengthen the moral powers, and the sinner may reckon himself \"to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ.\" Simple faith, with the love of Christ in the soul, unites the believer to God. While toiling in \n                                                                           148\nbattle as a faithful soldier of Christ, he has the sympathy of the whole loyal universe. The ministering angels are round about him to aid in the conflict, so that he may boldly say, \"The Lord is my helper,\" \"the Lord is my strength and my shield;\" I shall not be overcome. \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.\"",
