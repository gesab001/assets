    "word": "I have now written the vision God gave me. [Early Writings, pp. 43-44, \"The Open and the Shut Door.\"]  I am tired sitting so long. Our position looks very clear. We know we have the truth, the midnight cry is behind us; the door was shut in 1844 and Jesus is soon to step out from between God and man. The sealing will then be accomplished--finished up. Oh, let us keep the whole armor of God that we may be ready for battle at any moment. We shall have to fight every inch of ground now. Satan has come down in great power, knowing his time is short; but with the commandments of God written in our hearts and in our minds [we] will go on strong and bold, and although the sons of Anak be many and tall, yet we will go on crying, The commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus. Arabella, the Lord is coming; are you ready? Can you meet Him in peace and say, This is our God, we have waited for Him?--Letter 5, 1849, pp. 5, 6. (To Brother and Sister Hastings, March 24-30, 1849.)",
