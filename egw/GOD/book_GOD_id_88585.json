    "word": "MR No. 857 - God's Word Supplies Spiritual Power\n\n     The life of God, which gives life to the world, is in His word. It was by His word that Jesus healed disease and cast out demons. And by His word He stilled the sea and raised the dead; and the people bore witness that His word was with power. He spoke the word of God, as He had spoken it to all the prophets and teachers of the Old Testament. The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ. It is our only source of power. Do not rely upon any human agency for your wisdom. Take the Lord at His word, believing you do receive the things you ask of Him. [Matthew 28:18-28 quoted.]",
