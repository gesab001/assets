    "word": "My brethren and sisters, as you go out to sell this book, the Lord Jesus and His angels will open the way before you. Success has attended the effort to sell the book in the past, because God's people have worked in cooperation with heavenly agencies; and success will attend the effort in the future, if our people will still carry forward the work. All, will receive grace for grace as they give what they can, in time and influence, to the circulation of \"Christ's Object Lessons\".",
