    "word": "Those who do the cooking and the other work of the home are as verily engaged in the service of God as are those engaged in Bible work. And they are in greater need of sympathy and compassion; for there is in spiritual lines of work that which keeps the spirits cheered, uplifted, and comforted. And remember, we are all servants. The one who does your housework is no less highly regarded by the Lord than the one whose work is to give Bible readings.--Manuscript 128, 1905. \n                                                                           469",
