    "word": "But when multitudes began to believe on the Son and to receive divine truth from the lips of the disciples of Jesus, Satan saw that he must do something else to counter the work that the disciples were doing. So he determined to lead men to reject the Father and His law, as the Jews had rejected Christ. As he had blinded the eyes of the Jewish nation so they were unable to recognize and acknowledge Jesus, the only one who had power to give them life, so he would blind the eyes of the Christian world to the claims of the law, making professed Christians cry, \"Christ, Christ!
