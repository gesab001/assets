    "word": "In the time when God's judgments are falling without mercy, oh, how enviable to the wicked will be the position of those who abide \"in the secret place of the Most High\"--the pavilion in which the Lord hides all who have loved Him and have obeyed His commandments! The lot of the righteous is indeed an enviable one at such a time to those who are suffering because of their sins. But the door of mercy is closed to the wicked, no more prayers are offered in their behalf, after probation ends.--Ms 151, 1901, p. 5.
