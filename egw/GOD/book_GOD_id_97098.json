    "word": "Remarks by Ellen G. White at the Michigan Conference Meeting\n\n                              September 3, 1891 \n\n     Everything connected with God's work is to teach; everything during campmeeting is to do good. It is to present this people before the world as standing refined, with nicety of purpose, with wise plans, and for everything to be presented before them in such a way that it has a telling influence upon unbelievers. This people is a model people, and that is the way it ought to be. The truth is a sacred truth. Everything that is connected with the truth is to stand upon the highest elevation. Here are some things presented to me regarding our campmeetings, written about one year ago while I was at Petoskey, Michigan.",
