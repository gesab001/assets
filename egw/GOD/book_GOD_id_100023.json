The Promise of the Saviour. --- In Eden the gospel of a coming Saviour was proclaimed. No sooner was the promise given that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head than Christ was revealed as the Redeemer of mankind. Through Him alone could be fulfilled God's purpose to prevent heathenism and idolatry from becoming universal. The promise of His coming was the star of hope that shed its bright beams across the desert over which the church was to make her way to the consummation of her hopes.",
