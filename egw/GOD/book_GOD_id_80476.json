    "word": "A Sad Picture. \n\n     I have no heart to write out many things that might be given for the example and practise of those who have been often reproved. Those at the center of the work have manifested an avaricious spirit; they have, as it were, clothed fraud and double-dealing, conniving,--principles which God condemns in his work,--with a garment of righteousness. They have so perverted their imagination that they have supposed gain to be godliness. In the sin of Achan, theft, and dissembling, and covetousness, were considered by God to be of such a grievous character that God said, \"Neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.\" How will he regard the sins that are practised among his professed people?",
