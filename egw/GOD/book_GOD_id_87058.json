    "word": "We do not study the Scriptures as much as we should. Instead of spending our time in studying the various themes of the day, we need to devote that \n\n\n                                    -280- \n\ntime to the study of the Scriptures. We want to come with our Bibles on our knees before God and ask for wisdom from God to comprehend the treasures of truth. We cannot have root in ourselves unless we do this, for everything is to be shaken that can be shaken. The devil is working in a special manner with the popular churches to pick flaws with the Bible and with those who are working in Christ's lines, and infidelity prevails everywhere. It is the mystery of iniquity, the superhuman working of Satan, bewitching human minds with his power.--Ms 11, 1893, p. 3. (\"Search the Scriptures,\" March 28, 1893.)",
