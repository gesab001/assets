    "word": "All are to be workers together with God. All have been entrusted with talents, to use for the glory of God, and not for selfish purposes.

The responsibility of each human agent is proportionate to the amount of gifts received from the Lord. On the one blessed with the largest amount of talents rests the heaviest responsibility.--Letter 29, 1897, pp. 4-6. (To Frank and Hattie Belden, January 1, 1897.) \n\nReleased March 17, 1978.",
