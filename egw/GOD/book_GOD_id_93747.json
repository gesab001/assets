    "word": "The teacher may understand many things in regard to the physical universe; he may know all about the structures of animal life, the inventions of mechanical art, the discoveries of natural science; but he cannot be called educated unless he has a knowledge of the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. A principle of divine origin must pervade our conduct and bind us to God. This will not be in any way a hindrance to the study of true science.",
