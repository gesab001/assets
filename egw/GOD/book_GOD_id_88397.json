    "word": "\"Died because of bad cooking.\" \"Died because of sour bread.\" \"Died of medication.\" \"Died of an abused stomach.\" This might be written over the graves of many. This suicidal process is gradual. Nature bears the abuse as long as possible, but in the end she must succumb. The oil in the lamp of life is mixed with a variety of injurious substances, and the lamp refuses to burn longer. It is extinguished, not because God willed it, but because of the manifest disregard of nature's laws.--Ms 47, 1896, pp. 2,3, 5,7,9,11,12. (\"The Lack of Unity and Cause of Failure,\" no date.)",
