    "word": "Chapter 62 \u2014The Sifting Time\n\nThe apostle exhorts the brethren, saying, \"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand . . . in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.\" Oh, what a day is before us! What sifting will there be among those who claim to be the children of God! The unjust will be found among the just. Those who have great light and who have not walked in it will have darkness corresponding to the light they have despised. We have need to heed the lesson contained in the words of Paul, \"But I keep under my body, and bring it in subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\" The enemy is diligently working to see whom he can add to the ranks of apostasy; but the Lord is soon coming, and erelong every case will be decided for eternity. Those whose works correspond with the light graciously given them will be numbered on the Lord's side.  TM 163602",
