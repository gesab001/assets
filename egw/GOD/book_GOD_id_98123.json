    "word": "Do not talk, but pray. We have always had so much to say; in faith apply it to yourself. God says, \"Be still, and know that I am God\" [Psalms 46:10]. Be still long enough to know that God is God. Remember that you are to help everyone around you. Forget yourself, your bruises and wounds and difficulties. Praise God, and He will receive you because He lives, and you may live also.--Ms 144, 1901 (MR 900.60).",
