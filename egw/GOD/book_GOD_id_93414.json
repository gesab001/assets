    "word": "Satan knows just what elements he has to deal with, and he displays his infernal wisdom in various devices to entrap souls to their ruin. He watches every step that is taken in these matters, and he has many suggestions to make; and these suggestions are more often followed than the counsels of God's Word. As the result, we see wrecks of humanity everywhere. When will our youth be wise? The Bible, if carefully studied and obeyed, would prove a safeguard against the delusive snares of Satan.",
