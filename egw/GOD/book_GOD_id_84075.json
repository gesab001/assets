    "word": "Last night I slept only three hours, from eight to eleven. Oh, how my soul longs to see the people of God zealous in repentance. I entreat them to prepare to meet their God.

Violence and death mean nothing to them if their unions are opposed. The spirit is working in those who profess to believe the truth, but who, because they do not live the truth, are always in contention.",
