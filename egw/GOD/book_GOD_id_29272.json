    "word": "Christ Himself is the pearl of great price. . . . The righteousness of Christ, as a pure, white pearl, has no defect, no stain. No work of man can improve the great and precious gift of God. It is without a flaw. In Christ are \"hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\" Colossians 2:3. He is \"made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.\" 1 Corinthians 1:30. All that can satisfy the needs and longings of the human soul, for this world and for the world to come, is found in Christ. Our Redeemer is the pearl so precious that in comparison all things else may be accounted loss. . . .",
