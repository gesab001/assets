    "word": "Obedience to the law is essential, not only to our salvation, but to our own happiness and the happiness of all with whom we are connected. \"Great peace have they \n                                                                           219\nwhich love thy law: and nothing shall offend them\" (Psalm 119:165), says the Inspired Word. Yet finite man will present to the people this holy, just, and good law, this law of liberty, which the Creator Himself has adapted to the wants of man, as a yoke of bondage, a yoke which no man can bear. But it is the sinner who regards the law as a grievous yoke; it is the transgressor that can see no beauty in its precepts. For the carnal mind \"is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be\" (Romans 8:7).",
