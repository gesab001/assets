    "word": "Let the true-hearted youth come out from under the influence of every man who has refused the light of truth, and who has accepted fables instead. The Holy One has given us rules for the guidance of all who will keep the way of the Lord. The law is God's standard, from which there can be no swerving without sin. Where God's will and way are not paramount, the first principles of holiness have yet to be learned. The rule of heaven, which must be observed with unswerving obedience, is \"They shall keep the way of the Lord.\" Every other path is that of the destroyer. \"The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked.\" Some, whose eyes are now blinded by Satan, seem to be proud of their smartness and keenness, as revealed in their deceptive, fraudulent, underhand dealings. But a day will come when the Word of God, as summed up in His law, will be vindicated.--Ms 39, 1906. \n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. December 1, 1988. Entire Ms.",
