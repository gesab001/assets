    "word": "Sabbath, January 11, 1873, San Francisco, California, Ellen White Diary Entry \n\n\n     We rested well last night. This Sabbath morning opens cloudy. My mind is coming to strange conclusions. I am thinking I must lay aside my writing I have taken so much pleasure in, and see if I cannot become a scholar. I am not a grammarian. I will try, if the Lord will help me, at forty-five years old to become a scholar in the science. God will help me. I believe He will.--Manuscript 3, 1873, p. 5.",
