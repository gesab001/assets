    "word": "Brethren, be kind and courteous on all occasions. Never be sharp, critical, or exacting in your deal. \n                                                                           19\nIf there is any advantage to be gained, give it to your neighbor, whom you are required to love as you love yourself. With the patience and love of Jesus, watch for opportunities to do him a kindness. Let him see that the religion which we profess does not close up nor freeze over the avenues of the soul, making us unsympathizing and exacting. Let a well-ordered life and a godly conversation testify to your sincerity and piety; and when you have thus gained his confidence, the way is opened for you to reach the heart by introducing the truth.",
