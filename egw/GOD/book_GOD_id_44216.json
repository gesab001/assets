    "word": "There is scarcely an operation of nature to which we may not find reference in the Word of God. The Word declares that \"he maketh his sun to rise,\" and the rain to descend (Matthew 5:45). He \"maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.\" \"He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels. . . . He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow\" (Psalm 147:8, 16-18). \"He maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries\" (Psalm 135:7).",
