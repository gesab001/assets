    "word": "God has given to his church a diversity of gifts. Paul writes, \"He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors; and some, teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ. . . . I therefore the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, wit long-suffering, forebearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace. . . . That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly framed together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.\"",
