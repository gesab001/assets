    "word": "Oh, how tenderly Jesus looks upon the simple-hearted, the humble, contrite, self-denying followers of Jesus. His eye is especially upon all those who are willing and obedient and who are learning the lessons in the school of Christ. There is wisdom which God gives the humble and contrite ones which He does not bestow upon the wise and the prudent, so prudent in their own self-conceits that they know not the things which make for their peace. He passes these by, but imparts His wisdom to babes. He lays in the dust all human pride; He lifts up with the tenderest care those that are cast down; He recognizes the weak and the humble, and He imparts to them His comfort and grace. Oh, how true [it is] that he that walketh in spiritual blindness knoweth not whither he goeth nor at what he stumbleth. How many need to become fools in their own estimation that they may have true wisdom.",
