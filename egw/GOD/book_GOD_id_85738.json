    "word": "This is the very way with yourself. God has given you light, not because He wants to embarrass you and tear you in pieces, but to correct your mistakes that He may build you up, strengthen, stablish, settle you; that you may not be at one time on the mountain top and at another in the lowest depths.

The light God has given you is set aside, and A has his own will and his own way, whatever betides.",
