    "word": "Through Moses, God's purpose to send His Son as the Redeemer of the fallen race was kept before Israel. On one occasion, shortly before his death, Moses declared, \"The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.\" Plainly had Moses been instructed for Israel concerning the work of the Messiah to come. \"I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee,\" was the word of Jehovah to His servant;\" and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him\" (Deuteronomy 18:15, 18) (Prophets and Kings, pp. 683, 684).",
