    "word": "The Word of God is to become a part of our very being. You are to become as a little child, as must every one who is admitted into the city of God. We are to be His little children, not kings and rulers, striving for the supremacy and to make a great display, but little children, realizing our lack of knowledge and experience. It is only when we serve God in the strictest integrity and in humility of mind, trusting in Jesus, that we are safe. Everything is to be shaken that can be shaken.",
