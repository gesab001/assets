    "word": "Some of the servants of God have given up their lives to spend and be spent for the cause of God, until their constitutions are broken down, and they are almost worn out with mental labor, incessant care, toil, and privations. Others have not had and would not take the burden upon them. Yet just such ones think they have a hard time, because they have never experienced hardships. They never have been baptized into the suffering part, and never will \n250\nbe as long as they manifest so much weakness and so little fortitude, and love their ease so well.\u2014Vol. I, p. 129.",
