We should not let the bustle and \n\n\n                                  -294- \n\nexcitement around us detract from its sacred dignity. No cooking should be done on that day. The instruction which God gave to Israel should not be disregarded: \"Bake that which ye will bake today, and seethe that ye will seethe\": \"Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord\" [Exodus 16:23]. God meant what He said when He gave these directions, and shall we, who are presenting to the people the claims of the divine law, break that law ourselves, merely to please the appetite? God forbid. There has sometimes been almost as much cooking done on the Sabbath as on other days; and the blessing of God has been shut out by our failure to honor Him in keeping the Sabbath according to the commandment.--Undated Manuscript 88.",
