    "word": "My husband must take time to do those things which his judgment tells him will preserve his health. He has thought that he must throw off the burdens which were upon him and leave the Office and throw off responsibilities and cares, or his mind would be a wreck. I saw that when the Lord released him from his position, He would give him just a clear evidence of his release as He gave him when He laid the burden of the work upon him. But I saw that he had borne too many burdens and his ministering brethren have let him bear them. They have stood back and excused themselves while he was weighed down, crushed beneath censure until God vindicated His cause. If they had taken their share of the burdens it would have eased him greatly, but instead of this there have been more burdens caused by the course pursued by the ministers than by all the people. The shepherds have been unwise and the poor sheep have suffered from unwise, as well as from false, shepherds.--Ms. 1, 1863, pp. 1, 4-5. (\"Testimony Regarding James and Ellen White.\")",
