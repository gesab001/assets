    "word": "Dr. Lay is nervous, too hurried and excitable. He must encourage calmness, slow, unhurried speech, and calm movements. All this is very important, for him to be successful as a physician. He should trust his case in the hands of God, and guard against being over-sensitive. The worriment of mind Dr. Lay has suffered to come upon him, and his care in regard to things where he should have no care, have worn him more than all the labor he has done. God lives. He should trust his case wholly in his hands. In seeking so hard to save himself in the estimation of others, he has sunk himself every time. He has felt jealous lest the minds of his patients should be turned to some other one besides himself. This feeling is all needless. The more it is indulged, the more sure will the much-to-be-feared result take place. He should be indifferent to the matter just as much as possible. \n                                                                           47",
