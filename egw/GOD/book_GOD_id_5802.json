    "word": "The Priests of Israel Among the First to Respond.-- Among the first to catch Nehemiah's spirit of zeal and earnestness were the priests of Israel. From the position of influence which they occupied, these men could do much to hinder or advance the work. Their ready co-operation at the very outset contributed not a little to its success. Thus should it be in every holy enterprise. Those who occupy positions of influence and responsibility in the church, should be foremost in the work of God. If they move reluctantly, others will not move at all. But \"their zeal will provoke very many.\" When their light burns brightly, a thousand torches will be kindled at the flame.--Southern Watchman, April 5, 1904.",
