    "word": "When Charles Wesley at one time fell ill, and anticipated that death was approaching, he was asked upon what he rested his hope of eternal life. His answer was, \u201cI have used my best endeavors to serve God.\u201d As the friend who had put the question seemed not to be fully satisfied with his answer, Wesley thought, \u201cWhat! are not my endeavors a \n254\nsufficient ground of hope? Would he rob me of my endeavors? I have nothing else to trust to.\u201d Such was the dense darkness that had settled down on the church, hiding the atonement, robbing Christ of his glory, and turning the minds of men from their only hope of salvation,\u2014the blood of the crucified Redeemer.",
