    "word": "Our work may seem at times to be very discouraging, but if one soul is turned from the error of his way to righteousness, there is joy in heaven. \n\n\n                                     -35- \n\nThe Father and the Son rejoice in the presence of the angels. The song of triumph and victory is sung and echoed and re-echoed through the courts of heaven. Then why should we not be wise in this life, and work for the glory of God? \"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever\" [Daniel 12:3]. We want that our lives here shall be refined, ennobled, elevated, like Jesus Christ's. When Christ is formed in you the hope of glory, you will begin to lay aside your favorite sins. You will fear to offend God, and you will love His law.",
