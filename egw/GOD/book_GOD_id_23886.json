    "word": "71\n     There is a great work to be done in the world, and the Lord's servants are not to start enterprises of a commercial character, which will absorb the ability and tact and skill that God calls for in other lines of work. Just as soon as God's people lay off the burdens that He has not placed on them, and obtain the robe of Christ's righteousness; just as soon as they begin to answer the prayer of Christ, and to serve the Lord with all humility, the words of the twelfth chapter of Isaiah will be fulfilled to them. -MS 45, 1903. Written May 17, 1903.",
