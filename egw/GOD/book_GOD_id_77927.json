    "word": "God would have the facts appear as they are. Elder Smith has neglected to cultivate those traits of character which it is so needful that all who are engaged in the work of God should possess. Pleasing or unpleasing to human nature, faithfulness, vigilance, and boldness must be exercised, or sin will triumph over righteousness. A failure to see and sense the wants of the cause for this time, and to reprove sin, is called by some, meekness; God calls it unfaithfulness, and spiritual sloth. He gives no credit to those who shun the cross and neglect the disagreeable duties, thereby imperiling his church. Envy, jealousy, dishonesty, falsehoods, and evil surmisings have ever had to be met. They existed in the time of ancient Israel, and will ever be \n                                                                           11\nfound in modern Israel. Some one must meet this element, and whoever does will displease some; it cannot be otherwise, for there will ever be those who will sympathize with wrong-doers. Those who have shunned that part of the work which requires anxiety and care, boldness and fortitude, will receive no reward for their silence and their peaceful demeanor; but condemnation will be written against them.",
