    "word": "Our ministers need to practice right principles and live healthfully, that they may be partakers of the fruit of their own labors. There is a neglect shown in this line of work. There is light which our ministers have never taken up and thoroughly practiced. Therefore they cannot harmonize with the work that is being done in these lines, and they make this work a stumbling block to themselves. They watch with eager eyes for some inconsistencies which they can comment upon. But they might better overcome their prejudice; and as husbandmen of the garden of the Lord, His church, being first partakers of the fruit they bear the message, \"I beseech you therefore, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God\" [Romans 12:1,2].",
