    "word": "The streets here are arranged upon a very liberal plan. The streets which leads to our place of meeting is over 100 feet wide and is divided into seven parts with three rows of trees between them. The first is sidewalk, the second a place for carriages, this paved with stone; then comes a place for men on horseback; then a broad street for footmen; next another carriage way and then the sidewalk. This is all grand, safe, and convenient for all parties. But I look away from this in imagination to that city whose builder and maker is God, and whose broad streets are of pure gold as it were transparent glass.--Ms 15b, 1886, p. 1.
