    "word": "The truth of God is to give shape to each distinct branch of education; but shall the truth of God be of no account because its influence is not recognized by a few who lead, and who are rioters and tempters? Satan works his will through them, so that the truth is made a common thing. But should this be? There are those who prize these privileges of hearing the truth from the word of God, but are counteracted by the influence of those who have not cared and who do not care to be on the Lord's side. We desire that every youth shall realize the importance of the truth. We cannot countenance any frivolity. Those who give way to this are being educated under Satan's dictation, and this we cannot allow in the school.",
