    "word": "Laborers Together With God. The Lord has given me these words to speak and write over and over again, until a decided adherence to the principles of truth \n\n\n                                  -171- \n\nshows that men have been called to repentance. A grand side of the work of God is revealed by the words, \"medical missionary.\" To be a medical missionary means to be a laborer together with God. Medical missionary work, a work that is to be a great help and strength to the cause, is to be carried forward in all carefulness and wisdom. Into this work not one thread is to be drawn that will spoil the beautiful pattern that God designs shall be worked out.",
