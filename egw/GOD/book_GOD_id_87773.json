    "word": "MR No. 744 - Principles Relating to Sickness\n\n     God Is Concerned About Cleanliness Now as Anciently.--I saw that God is no less particular now than He was anciently. He gave special direction to the children of Israel to observe cleanliness in their camps, to wash their clothes, etc., etc., lest the Lord should pass by and see their uncleanness and would not go out with their armies to battle against their enemies. I was shown that in this God wished Israel to practice habits which would ensure them health and would keep them elevated above the heathen around them, for they were His peculiar treasure which He was sanctifying to Himself. Nothing would be more displeasing to God than for them to have disregarded His special commands and persisted in being unclean; and, if they had done so, the consequences would be that God would visit them with curses instead of blessings, with defeat instead of victory. If any family among Sabbathkeepers dare continue in slack, disorderly habits and risk it, they will be visited with a curse instead of a blessing, for they will be the means of bringing a reproach upon all Sabbathkeepers and will cause the heathen to make them a byword and a proverb.",
