Thus mothers may become teachers in the home. Mothers should themselves act like Christ, speaking tender, loving words in the home. Then opposite their names in the book of heaven will be written, 'Ye are laborers together with God.' . . . . Avoid everything that will be rasping to your children.\"-- P.C., Sept. 24th., 1898.",
