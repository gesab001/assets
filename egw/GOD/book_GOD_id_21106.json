    "word": "The Temperance Work \n\n     Of all who claim to be numbered among the friends of temperance, Seventh-day Adventists should stand in the front ranks. For many years a flood of light concerning the principles of true reform has been shining on our pathway, and we are accountable before God to let this light shine to others. Years ago we regarded the spread of temperance principles as one of our most important duties. It should be so today. Our schools and sanitariums are to reveal the power of the grace of Christ to transform the whole being,--body, soul, and spirit. Our sanitariums and other educational institutions should be centers of light and blessing in the cause of every true reform.",
