    "word": "The messages that God has given through His servant John are now to be proclaimed as of special importance. This is our work--to revive the sacred truths that called us out from the world and made us what we are. We are not to yield up one feature of the faith, but are to hold our confidence firm unto the end. We are to give no place to doctrines that are not in harmony with the truth for this time.--Letter 270, Dec. 21, 1903, to Edson White.",
