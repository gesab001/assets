    "word": "All who have a part to act in the Health Institute should be unselfish. Irwin Royce is not what God would have him be. He has an exalted opinion of himself. He talks too much. He does not have a humble mind. Sometimes he talks in an unbecoming manner to patients. This would be wrong were he even superintendent of the Institution, but in the position as a common helper, he should be the last one to dictate to patients, or to speak to them disrespectfully. He should take a humble position, and be faithful in the littles, having an interest to do all he can, and not be an eyeservant. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much. The time that Irwin spends in chatting with the helpers, can be better employed. He is too set in his own way, and he needs to cultivate humility. He should seek for a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.",
