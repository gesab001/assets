    "word": "The man who had been wronged said, \"What has wrought upon you to make this confession?\" Said they, \"We have been attending the campmeeting, and the spirit and power of God and the religion of Jesus Christ have taken hold upon us.\" \"Well,\" said the man, \"If the work done there is of this order I must go there,\" and he did go, and he did tremble under the sharp arrows of God. The influence of these confessions made to many others who have been wronged, is as far reaching as eternity. This man in his wickedness had nothing, but since his conversion the Lord has blessed him greatly with means, and he is using it in making restitution and in advancing the cause of truth. He is free, generous to a fault, he is humble as a child, sitting at the feet of Jesus, ready and willing to do anything. He takes 150 Signs and distributes. He has done more missionary work alone the past year than the whole Fresno Church together.--Letter 47, 1888, pp. 2-4. (To \"Dear Brethren,\" circa March, 1888.) \n\n\n                                   -152-",
