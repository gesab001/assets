    "word": "Observance of the Sabbath \n\n     Let no man, because he is a physician, feel at liberty to do those things which God has forbidden. He should not travel on the Sabbath unless this is a necessity in order to relieve suffering humanity. He should plan his work so as to obey God's requirements. The Lord says, \"Verily, my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations.\" Exodus 31:13. When there is real suffering to be alleviated, it is not a desecration of the Sabbath for physicians to travel upon it: but unimportant cases should be deferred. God sanctified and blessed the seventh day, and it is to be kept as His sacred memorial.",
