    "word": "In the full light of the sun, surrounded by thousands,--men of war, prophets of Baal, and the monarch of Israel,--stands the defenseless man, Elijah, apparently alone, yet not alone. The most powerful host of heaven surrounds him. Angels who excel in strength have come from heaven to shield the faithful and righteous prophet. With stern and commanding voice Elijah cries: \"How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.\" Not one in that vast assembly dared utter one word for God and show his loyalty to Jehovah.",
