    "word": "I am sorry that Elder Corliss, by his impetuous spirit has weakened his influence with you and others. But this has not weakened his influence with me. I know that this hastiness of temper is his infirmity. He will always have to guard against this failing. But I rejoice to think that he has made such good use of the time and ability which God has given him. Had Elder Corliss made a tirade against me, whom he calls \"Mother,\" I should have felt sorry because of the injury done to himself and to the cause of God; but I would not have turned away from him. He loves the truth, and the Lord loves him.",
