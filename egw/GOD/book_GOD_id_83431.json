    "word": "I wish that I could carry your minds to the future glory, and could impress upon each the great sacrifice that had to be made to redeem man. It rests with you whether you will enjoy this glory. To obtain it, the will must be brought under subjection to the will of Christ. The rebellious can not enter heaven. Satan was the first in rebellion and his work is to lead others to disobey the mandates of Jehovah. To each one God has given talents, and if we neglect to cultivate them we shall fail and lose eternal life. Everything has been done for us that could be done to elevate man, and if we fail on our part then the sacrifice has been in vain so far as we are concerned. Shall we be weighed and found wanting? Or shall we be with the white-robed throng? This will depend upon your course of action. If we are in the workshop of God He will beautify us and polish us and we shall be fitted for the heavenly mansions.",
