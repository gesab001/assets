    "word": "These words of Holy Writ say nothing of the independent laws of nature. God is the superintendent as well as the creator of all things. The divine Being is engaged in upholding the things which He has created. God has laws which He has instituted, but they are only His servants through which He effects results. It is God who calls everything in order and keeps all things in motion.--Ms 92, 1898, p. 5. (\"The Revelation of God,\" typed July 6, 1898.)",
