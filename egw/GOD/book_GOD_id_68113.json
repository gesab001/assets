    "word": "It may be that much work needs to be done in your character building, that you are a rough stone which must be squared and polished before it is fit to fill a place in God's temple. You need not be surprised if with hammer and chisel God cuts away your defects of character, until you are prepared to fill the place He has ready for you. No human being can accomplish this work. Only by God can it be done. And be assured that He will not strike one useless blow. His every blow is struck in love, for your eternal good and happiness. He knows your infirmities, and works to restore, not to destroy.",
