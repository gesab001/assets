    "word": "3-6 (John 1:12; Colossians 1:26, 27;  2:2, 3, 10). The Gospel Is True Science.--[Ephesians 1:3-6 quoted.] These divine heights the true believer may reach. All who will may see the mystery of godliness.

His long human arm embraces the human family; His divine arm grasps the throne of the Infinite, that man may have the benefit of the infinite sacrifice made in his behalf. And to as many as receive Him, He gives the power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.",
