    "word": "\"The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts\" (Malachi 2:7). The people should counsel with him, as God's appointed messenger. They should not only hear, but they should ask questions, that they may have a clear knowledge of truth. He is not to withhold his knowledge from the people, but he is to keep it as a sacred trust, to be imparted to others.",
