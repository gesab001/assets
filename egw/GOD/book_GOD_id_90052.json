    "word": "Souls are perishing in sin because those who have been appointed as shepherds of the flock are not all laborers together with God. They neglect to do the very work that should be done. Why are those set apart for the work of the ministry placed on committees and boards? Why are they called upon to attend business meetings at a great distance from their field of labor? Why are not business matters placed in the hands of businessmen? The ministers have not been set apart to do this work. The finances of the cause are to be properly managed. Managing ability is to be brought into the work. But ministers are set apart for a higher work.",
