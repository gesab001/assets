    "word": "Daniel in Babylon chose the wisdom that would vindicate the honor of God. He and his three companions decided that it was in the wise purpose of God\n\n                                    -125- \n\nthat they had been taken as captives to the wicked and corrupt city of Babylon. They did not leave their religion behind them in their own nation. They determined that they would not devote their time to complaint, but that they would be cheerful, and faithful in all their business transactions; that God's compassion for them demanded the most unselfish service on their part as His representatives. They would preserve the true worship, and not permit one slur to be cast upon God.--Ms 48, 1898, p. 7. (\"Treasure Hid in a Field,\" undated.)",
