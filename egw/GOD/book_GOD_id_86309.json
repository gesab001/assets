    "word": "We need greater faith. We need now to be worked by the Holy Spirit. Believers themselves need to be reconverted, and understand what is comprehended in the Third Angel's Message. If we individually understood our privileges, and opportunities, when we assemble together each heart would have a living experience, and the Lord Jesus would be in our midst, and thick currents of His love would flow from heart to heart, and the petty, and also larger, difficulties would disappear. Brotherly love would tell its precious story, and there would be no discussion. Heart would blend with heart in a oneness with Christ Jesus, and bound up with Christ in God they see His face by faith. Then the standard of Truth is uplifted, the light from heaven is poured over the world. . . .",
