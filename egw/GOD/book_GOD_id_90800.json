    "word": "I was glad of the opportunity of speaking to the people in the Hanford-Lemoore district, and I decided to bring before them the needs of the Southern \n\n\n                                     -237- \n\nwork, and especially the needs of the Huntsville school.

In each place the attendance was good. I had freedom in speaking. When on my feet before the people I seemed to be stronger than I had been for years, but when I got back to the house again my strength seemed to leave me. I felt worn out, and could not write.",
