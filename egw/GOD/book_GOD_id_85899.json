    "word": "Especially should the young women who have been accustomed to read novels and cheap story-books, join in the evening family study. The Lord has appointed them to be His helping hand. Young women, read the literature that will give true knowledge and that will interest the entire family. Say firmly, \"I will not spend my precious moments in reading that which will be of no profit to me. I will devote my time to God's service, I will close my eyes to frivolous and sinful things. My ears are the Lord's property, and I will not take them where I shall hear the subtle reasoning of the enemy. My voice must not in any way be subject to a will that is not under the influence of the Spirit of God.--Ms 119, 1901, pp. 4, 5. (\"The Church in the Home,\" November 24, 1901.)",
