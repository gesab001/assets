    "word": "Order and Discipline\n     While the Bible teaching in regard to faith and sanctification should be presented to the people, there is need of guarding every \n274\npoint, so that no place may be given to those demoralizing influences manifest among some classes of people who have much to say in regard to holiness. There are many who are careless in deportment, and low and coarse in their tastes, who grasp at a superficial theory of sanctification, and justify themselves in their commonness, when they should diligently seek to purify themselves by obedience to the truth. They talk of the freedom they feel, the happiness they have; but by their words, deportment, and dress, they fail to recommend their religion. Camp-meetings should never be conducted in such a manner as to encourage this kind of experience. To encourage an unbecoming familiarity in the association of men and women, boys and girls, under the pretext of seeking conversion and sanctification, is to foster an evil whose influence is of the worst character. Christ and his righteousness must be clearly presented to the people; the teacher himself must be circumspect in conduct, having his conversation elevated and holy, that he may teach believers and unbelievers the reasons of his faith from both the law and the gospel. He must show to all that they must do the will of God if they would know of the doctrine.",
