    "word": "As I looked at the large vineyards owned by our people in central and southern California, I thought, How I wish that those who own these vineyards could see and appreciate the needs of our workers in Nashville; for then they would surely help them by sending them gifts of fruit. My brethren and sisters, will you not see what you can do to help those who are just starting out in the establishment of a work that God has said must be done? Gifts of money or gifts of fruit would be greatly appreciated by the workers in these needy Southern schools. I have reason to know that they need your assistance. If you will take hold to help them, the Lord will certainly reward you liberally.",
