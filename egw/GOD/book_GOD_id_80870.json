    "word": "\"The Lord Jesus corrects our erring piety, giving the burden of this work for the poor and needy in the rough places of the earth, to men and women who have hearts that can feel for the ignorant, and for those who are out of the way. The Lord teaches them how to meet these cases. These workers will be encouraged as they see doors opened for them to enter places where they can do medical missionary work. Having little self-confidence, they give God all the glory, taking none of it to themselves. The Saviour is present to help make a beginning through those whose hands are rough and unskilled, but whose hearts are susceptible to pity, and awakened to do something to relieve the woe so abundant. He works through those who can discern mercy in misery, gain in the loss of all things. When the Light of the world passes by, privileges appear in all hardships, right order in confusion, the success and wisdom of God in that which seems to be failure.\"",
