    "word": "All who work for God in our land should have the Martha and the Mary attributes blended. Self and selfishness must be put out of sight. God calls for earnest women-workers, who are prudent, warm-hearted, tender, and true to principle. He calls for persevering women, who will think far less of self and their personal conveniences, who will take their minds from self, and center them on Christ, speaking words of truth, praying with the persons to whom they can obtain access, laboring for the conversion of souls. Lukewarm, self-indulgent, self-centered, covetous souls will be found to be the chief stumbling blocks to the work of God. These are to be found in every enterprise that God has instituted.",
