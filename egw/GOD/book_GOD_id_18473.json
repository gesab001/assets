    "word": "Christ tears away the wall of partition, the self-love, the dividing prejudice of nationality, and teaches a love for all the human family. . . . He teaches us to look upon every needy soul as our neighbor and the world as our field. As the rays of the sun penetrate to the remotest corners of the globe, so God designs that the light of the gospel shall extend to every soul upon the earth.",
