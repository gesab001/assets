    "word": "The office work of the Holy Spirit is to convince of sin, and I know that it is a sin for any one of us to be indifferent now. As we look around at the different fields that have been entered, we are led to inquire, \"What hath God wrought?\" What more could He have done for His vineyard than He has done? God has made provision to supply His rich grace, to give divine power for the performance of His work. Nothing is wanting on the part of God; the lack is on the part of the human agency, who refuses to cooperate with divine intelligences. Through the plan He has devised, nothing can be done for the salvation of man save through the cooperation of man. Sinners who have been blessed with light and evidence, who know that through grace that can be supplied to them, they may meet the conditions upon which salvation is promised, and yet who decline to make the attempt, have but themselves to blame for their own destruction. We feel that of such it may be said that Christ has died for them in vain.",
