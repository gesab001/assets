    "word": "There is with many a great lack of love in laboring for others. Especially in this field, far more could be accomplished by manifesting this love in your labor, than by presenting the strongest arguments. But the two should be combined. There are many who are in darkness; and when the truth, which involves a cross, is presented, they draw back, as did Nathanael. If by kindness and love these can be prevailed upon to trace down the chain of prophecy, they will, as they find link after link uniting in a perfect whole, see new beauty and harmony in the word of God; and the more they study it,  the more precious it will become to them.",
