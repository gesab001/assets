    "word": "The Son of God, who is the express image of the Father's person, became man's Advocate and Redeemer. He humbled Himself in taking the nature of man in his fallen condition, but He did not take the taint of sin. As the second Adam He must pass over the ground where Adam fell, meet the wily foe who caused Adam and Eve's fall, and be tempted in all points as man will be tempted, and overcome every temptation in behalf of man. To Him should man look--to Him who endured the \"contradiction of sinners against Himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds\" (Hebrews 12:3). While every human being is to be loved for Christ's sake, not one is to be looked to as supreme in counsel and unerring in wisdom.",
