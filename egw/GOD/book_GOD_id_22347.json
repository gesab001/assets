    "word": "To God's people, the captivity of Satan will bring gladness and rejoicing. Says the prophet: \u201cIt shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy trouble, and from the hard service wherein thou wast made to serve, that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon [here representing Satan], and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! . . . The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers; that smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, that ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.\u201d [Isaiah 14:3-6, Revised Version.]",
