    "word": "My sister, trust in the Lord as a little child trusts its earthly parent. Cling to the Saviour. Let nothing separate your soul from God. \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). Look for mercies; expect mercies. Look continually for blessings. See them, acknowledge them, and do not complain, do not fret. Do not cast blame upon God, but say, \"O Lord, I do believe, though I am a sinner and because I am a sinner. I believe in Thee with all my heart. Thou art the Truth, and Thy Word I believe.\"",
