    "word": "I would say to those who have turned their feet into the way of God's commandments, It is not enough to profess to keep the law of God; do you carry its precepts into your daily life? To profess the truth and not be sanctified through it, is to dishonor God. We want the truth on every point, and we are to put it in practice daily. Come to Christ in simplicity and faith, and he will enlighten your understanding, and enable you to walk so humbly and circumspectly before your fellow-men that they can speak no evil of you except for the same reason that men spoke evil of Christ. While you follow in the path of humble obedience day by day, you will be gaining a living experience in the things of God,\u2014an experience which you must have in order to stand in the troublous times before you.",
