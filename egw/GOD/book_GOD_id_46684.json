    "word": "Psalm 11\n\n  6 (Malachi 4:1). Devouring Flames Recompense the Wicked.--The wicked receive their recompense in the earth. \"Upon the wicked he shall rain quick burning coals, fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.\" Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire. The day has come that shall burn as an oven. The elements melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein are burned up. The wicked \"shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts.\" All are punished \"according to their deeds\" (SW March 14, 1905).",
