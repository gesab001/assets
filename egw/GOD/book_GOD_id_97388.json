    "word": "No, the dark shadow of Satan will come right across our pathway if we let our faith sink into it. But we must do as the eagle does when he is in the cloud and bewildered in the fog.

And so we should press upward beyond the hellish shadow of Satan, when he tries to eclipse the rays of light that come from God.",
