    "word": "My brethren and sisters in Southern California, educate yourselves to work for the Master. Remember that in helping to circulate \"Object Lessons\", you are placing before others truths which cannot fail of being a blessing to them. Each one of God's people has a part to act in the work of the Redeemer. Those who receive Christ are to prove the sincerity of their love for Him by earnest, self-sacrificing efforts in His service. No opportunity for helping to advance the Lord's cause is to be allowed to pass by. In meekness and lowliness, yet with an earnest determination (74) to accomplish something for the blessing of others, God's children are to take hold of His work.",
