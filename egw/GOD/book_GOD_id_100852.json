    "word": "Elder Jones, walk carefully before God. \"Ye are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.\" Be careful not to present in the paper views which you \n                                                                           1038\nknow will clash with Elder Smith; for he feels that he is in authority to control the articles which appear in the REVIEW; but if he makes an attempt to close the door that light shall not come to the people, then, sad as it may be, the Lord will remove him. But the Lord loves Brother Smith, and be careful that no occasion shall be given, by publishing articles that he has not seen. If after he sees the articles and publishes them without seeing and speaking with the author of the article, then he has no right to put in the paper an opposite view; for he hurts the cause of God. This is no time for dissension; press together; seek to be a unit. There should be a breaking down of icy reserve and a mutual confidence and freedom exercised. Each must guard his words. Avoid all impressions which savor of extremes; for those who are watching for a chance will seize hold of any words strongly expressed to justify them in their feelings of calling you an extremist.",
