    "word": "By the words and works of this life is decided the eternal destiny of everyone; be very careful, therefore, not to drive a tempted soul onto the enemy's battleground. Provoke not the youth to wrath. Stir not up in them, by unjust charges and harsh treatment, the impulse to act rashly. Often those who ought to know how to deal with the youth drive them away from God by injudicious words and actions. God records such treatment of the youth as a sin against Himself. Treat the tempted ones in a way that will draw them to you as a friend who will not misjudge or hurt them.",
