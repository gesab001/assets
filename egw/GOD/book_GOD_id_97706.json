    "word": "And now the question is, Will man fasten his thoughts upon the things of eternal interest and work in harmony with God? Is it any condescension on our part to accept the cup of salvation? To us it is no condescension to accept of the crucified and risen Saviour. Do we consider the sacrifice and take hold of the only chain let down from heaven for man to grasp? We answer, No; but it is the highest exaltation that can be placed upon us. Heaven we want, every one of us. You cannot afford to lose heaven. You cannot afford to have the gates of paradise closed to you. You want heaven, eternal life.",
