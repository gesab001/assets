    "word": "Then my eyes were taken from the glory, and I was pointed to the remnant on the earth. The angel said to them, \u201c. . . Get ready, get ready, get ready. Ye must have a greater preparation than ye now have, for the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it. Sacrifice all to God. Lay all upon His altar\u2014self, property, and all, a living sacrifice. It will take all to enter glory. Lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven, where no thief can approach or rust corrupt. Ye must be partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings here if ye would be partakers with Him of His glory hereafter.\u201d",
