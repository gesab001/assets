    "word": "It is a law of heaven that as we receive we are to impart. The Christian is to be a benefit to others; thus he himself is benefited. \"He that watereth shall be watered also himself\" (Proverbs 11:25). This is not merely a promise. It is a law of God's divine administration, a law by which He designs that the streams of beneficence shall be kept, like the waters of the great deep, in constant circulation, perpetually flowing back to their source. In the fulfilling of this law is the power of Christian missions. . . .",
