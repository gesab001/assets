    "word": "It is time that men and women have some true idea of what is expected of a true soldier of the cross of Jesus. Those who serve under the bloodstained banner of the Prince Emmanuel are expected to do difficult work which will tax every power God has given them. They will have painful trials to endure for Christ's sake. They will have conflicts which rend the soul. But if they are faithful soldiers they will say with Paul, \"Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal\" [2 Corinthians 4:17, 18].",
