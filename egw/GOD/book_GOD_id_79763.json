    "word": "Shall we follow the judgment of men who have had the rebuke of God upon them for years. Their history is a declaration as to how much weight should be given to their sentiments. The inwardness of the actions of these--what shall I call them--false prophets, has been shown; with many words they have set things forth in a false light. The Lord has declared that their counsel should not stand. Their intriguing, their gathering together men whom they thought would voice their methods, was an offense in God's sight. They were themselves deceived, and their deception has been deepening. They were deceived by their own manufactured logic. They have been separating farther and farther from God, and soon, I was instructed, would realize that they were weighed in their own balances, by the very principles they forwarded and advocated with the greatest assurance. The Lord would give them an opportunity to come under the rules and sentiments they acted a part in creating. They would know by experience how it would feel to have their own principles brought to bear upon them. These men, from the first to the last of their experience, have done an injury to the work and cause of God by perverting justice and judgment, and making crooked paths with their own wandering feet, to their great loss and confusion.",
