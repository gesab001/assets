    "word": "I was helped and strengthened by the Spirit of the Lord to speak to my brethren with many tears, and present before them the pure, holy character of our work and the necessity of the improvement of all the talents God had given us. In the night previous a book was opened before me with the record of the past year's labor of the workmen, just as God viewed it. As I traced down the record, there stood every defect. With some, many hours spent in visiting and \n\n\n                                     -115- \n\ntalking, occupied with unimportant matters, were registered as idle--time which should have been devoted to intense, interested work in the cause of God. How different from their report appeared the record of some of the laborers! How unsatisfactory to themselves! Every time that they associated with their fellow men opportunities were open, could they have seen them, to draw minds to the Saviour and to drop seeds of truth. But opportunities came and passed and were not seen or improved. Words of no consequence were spoken and the evidence was given that the message of warning was not uppermost in their minds. It was not resting as a burden of their souls, that whenever their lips opened it would flow out in reflecting the light of Christ given them to bless others. This is the profitable, true education for all ministers who labor in word and doctrine.",
