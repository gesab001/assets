    "word": "Our God is a God of mercy. With long-sufferance and tender compassion He deals with the transgressors of His law. . . . But there is a point beyond which divine patience is exhausted, and the judgments of God are sure to follow. The Lord bears long with men, and with cities, mercifully giving warnings to save them from divine wrath; but a time will come when pleadings for mercy will no longer be heard. . . .",
