    "word": "The men who stand as presidents of conferences, or as leaders in any part of the solemn work of giving the last gospel message must cultivate and cherish broad views and ideas. It is the privilege of all who bear responsibilities in the work of the Gospel, to be apt learners in Christ's school. The professed follower of Christ must not be led by the dictates of his own will; his mind must be trained to think Christ's thoughts, and enlightened to comprehend the will and way of God. Such a believer will be a follower of Christ's methods of work.",
