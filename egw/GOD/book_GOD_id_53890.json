    "word": "The curse of God will surely rest upon unfaithful parents. Not only are they planting thorns which shall wound them here, but they must meet their own unfaithfulness when the judgment shall sit. Many children will rise up in judgment and condemn their parents for not restraining them, and charge upon them their destruction. The false sympathy and blind love of parents, causes them to excuse the faults of their children, and to pass them by without correction, and their children are lost in consequence, and the blood of their souls will rest upon unfaithful parents.",
