    "word": "Let no one say, \"I can not overcome my defects of character;\" for if this is your decision, then you can not have eternal life. The impossibility is all in your will. If you will not, that constitutes the can not. The real difficulty is the corruption of an unsanctified heart, and an unwillingness to submit to the will of God. When there is a determined purpose born in your heart to overcome, you will have a disposition to overcome, and will cultivate those traits of character that are desirable, and will engage in conflict with steady, persevering effort. You will exercise a ceaseless watchfulness over defects of character, and will cultivate right practices in little things. The difficulty of overcoming will be lessened in proportion as the heart is sanctified by the grace of Christ. \n\n\n                                 -80- \n\nEarnest, persevering effort will place you on the vantage-ground of victory: for he who strives to overcome, in and through the grace of Christ, will have divine enlightenment, and will understand how great truths can be brought into little things, and religion can be carried in the little, as well as in the large concerns of life. \n\n\n                                  Ellen G. White.",
