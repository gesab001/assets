    "word": "MR No. 1274 - God Calls Upon Workers To Be Producers, Not Consumers; Medical Missionary Work To Be Pursued; Study the Word\n\n     It should be made a part of gospel labor to help forward promising young men who give evidence that the love of truth and righteousness has a constraining influence upon them, leading them to dedicate themselves to the work of God, as medical missionaries, as canvassers, as evangelists. Let a fund be established to carry this work forward. Then let those who have received help go forth to minister to the sick and suffering. This work will surely open the way for the balm of Gilead to be applied to sin-sick souls.",
