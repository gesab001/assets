    "word": "Study the Sermon on the Mount, and from it learn what are the qualities that Christ blesses. Is not the blessing of the Son of God worth time and effort? Only by carrying out in the daily life the principles of godliness can we gain the qualities that bring His blessing. Place yourself under His love and care, that in His strength you may bring to the foundation works represented by gold, silver, and precious stones. Christ's promises are full of wealth and power. The sanctification received through a belief of the truth brings comfort and joy. It imparts to the life a quickening power.",
