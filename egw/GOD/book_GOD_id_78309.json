    "word": "These words the Jews applied to themselves; and because God had shown them so great favor and mercy, they flattered themselves that, notwithstanding their sins and iniquity, he would still retain them as his favored people, and shower especial blessings upon them. This has been the danger of the people of God in all ages; and especially is this the danger of those living near the close of time. We are cited by the apostle to the children of Israel as a warning. Paul plainly states that \"all these things happened unto them \n                                                                           39\nfor ensamples; and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.\" If in these last days of peril, for the encouragement of persons in responsible positions, God in mercy gives them a word of favor, they frequently become lifted up, and lose sight of their frailties and weaknesses, and rely upon their own judgment, flattering themselves that God cannot accomplish his work without their especial aid. They trust in their own wisdom; and the Lord permits them, for a time, to apparently prosper, to reveal the weakness and corruptions of the natural heart. But the Lord will, in his own time, and in his own way, bring down the pride and folly of these deceived ones, and reveal to them their true condition. If they will accept the humiliation, and by confession and sincere repentance, turn unto the Lord, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, he will renew his love to them. But if they shut their eyes, as did the Jews, to their own corruption, and choose their own ways, the Lord will give them up to blindness of mind, and hardness of heart, that they cannot discern the things of the Spirit of God.",
