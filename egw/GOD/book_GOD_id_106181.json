    "word": "Notwithstanding the light given by God, ten thousand dollars were called for, and double that amount was used, in building an addition to the school. The managers of the Review and Herald had much to do in this matter. These things must be considered. The Review and Herald is not required to pay the College debt; for if this were done, calls would be made for other schools to be helped in the same way. But the interest on this debt should be made as low as possible. Interest should not be charged upon interest. Neither should those who have loaned money charge a higher rate of interest than they themselves pay. One institution should have the tenderest and most kindly feelings for its sister institution. The work done in one is as much the Lord's work as the work done in the other.",
