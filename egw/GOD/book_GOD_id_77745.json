    "word": "The Health Institute at Battle Creek is established upon firm religious principles. Its conductors acknowledge God as the real proprietor. Physicians and helpers look to God for guidance, and aim to move conscientiously in his fear. For this reason, it stands upon a sure basis. When feeble, suffering invalids learn in regard to the principles of directors, superintendent, physicians, and helpers, at our Institute, that they have the fear of God before them, they will feel safer there than at the popular institutions.",
