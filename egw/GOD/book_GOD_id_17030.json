    "word": "No man can of himself cast out the evil throng that have taken possession of the heart. Only Christ can cleanse the soul temple. But He will not force an entrance. He comes not into the heart as to the temple of old; but He says, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.\" Revelation 3:20. He will come, not for one day merely; for He says, \"I will dwell in them, and walk in them; . . . and they shall be my people.\" 2 Corinthians 6:16. . . . His presence will cleanse and sanctify the soul, so that it may be a holy temple unto the Lord, and \"an habitation of God through the Spirit.\" Ephesians 2:22.",
