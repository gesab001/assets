    "word": "Fearing God\u2014how little of it there is! . . . There are those who will be like the men and women who helped to build the ark. They hear the truth; they have every advantage to become people of moral worth, yet they will not choose the good society, but the corrupt. If there is an influence that is not heavenly, they will gather to their side and unite with them, and although they act a part in the preparation of the truth that is to fit a people to stand in the day of the Lord, they will perish in the general ruin like Noah\u2019s carpenters who helped to build the ark. God help you that you may not be of that class.\u2014Letter 36, 1887 (Manuscript Releases, vol. 18, pp. 260-262).",
