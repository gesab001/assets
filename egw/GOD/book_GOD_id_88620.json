    "word": "Council Bluffs, Iowa, August 22, 1878--We have made the change all right. Glad you were not on board today; hot, almost unendurable. We have a lower berth in drawing-room car. Well situated. Three dollars to Chicago. Cheap enough, I think. I am glad that so many of you are in the cool mountains. Stay there as long as you can. I think Emma would be rather oppressed with her woolen dress. I am glad she is not on board this train. The heat would wilt and exhaust her. At one time today it seemed as though I should faint away, but a cool breeze sprang up and we feel better. I think I am in the way of duty. It is fearfully oppressive, yet God will sustain.--Letter 45, 1878, pp. 1,2. (Post card to James White.) \n\n\n                                    -57-",
