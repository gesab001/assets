    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 20, 1892. During the past night I slept but little, but I am not going to look on the dark side. I turn my face to the Sun of Righteousness, and dwell with pleasure upon the Saviour's willingness to pardon my sins and sanctify my soul. It is by beholding that we may reflect Christs image. The transforming power of grace can make me a partaker of the divine nature. On Christ the glory of God has shone, and by looking upon Christ, contemplating His self-sacrifice, remembering that in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, the believer is drawn closer and closer to the Source of power. His love in our hearts leads us to seek for lost sheep. By working to win souls to Christ, believers give evidence of their love for Him. The path that He trod is the one in which His children will choose to follow.",
