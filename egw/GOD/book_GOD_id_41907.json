    "word": "God's promise is, \"Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.\" Holiness is the reflection of God's glory. But in order to reflect this glory, we must cooperate with God. Heart and mind must be emptied of all that leads to wrong. The Word of God must be read and studied with a sincere desire to gain from it spiritual strength. This Word is the Bread of heaven. Those who receive it, and make it a part of their lives, grow strong in the strength of God. Our sanctification is God's object in all His dealing with us. He has chosen us from eternity, that we may be holy. Christ declares, \"This is the will of God, even your sanctification.\" Is it your will, also, that your desires and inclinations shall be brought into conformity to the divine will? . . .",
