    "word": "My sister, your mind will bear taxing. If you take up the burdens that you should, you can be a blessing to the [St. Helena] Health\n215\nRetreat.

You need to stand firmly and truly for God and the right. You need to be vitalized by the grace of Christ.

You must exercise the living machinery, or else you will not be able to throw off the waste matter, and you will fall short of gaining health. . . .",
