    "word": "MR No. 935 - Additional Information for Prescott Biography\n\n     The Matter of the Ordination of W. W. Prescott--I was visited by Brother Prescott. His brethren wish him to be ordained, but he is undecided what is best to do in this matter. I could only say I could see nothing to hinder this move being made if he in his judgment considered it best. His duties as principal of the college were important and large, and his responsibilities many. If he could serve the cause of God any better in receiving ordination and credentials, it would be best. But it must fall back upon himself to decide the matter according to circumstances and the dictates of his own conscience. He had several things to bring before me. One was the case of our brethren's and sisters' disrespectful irreverence manifest in the Tabernacle, where we go to worship God, talking and leaving the meeting before it is closed, and their children behaving disrespectfully in the church.--Ms 23, 1889, pp. 3,4. (Diary: Battle Creek, Nov. 3, 1889.)",
