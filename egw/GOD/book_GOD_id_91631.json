    "word": "Pure Religion Revealed in Deeds of Mercy. I cannot sleep after half past two o'clock. I wish to speak to my brethren who occupy positions of trust. As God's husbandry you are invested with the responsibility of acting in His stead, as His helping hand. Those who are placed in positions of trust must have the authority of action, but they are never to use this authority as a power to refuse help to the needy and helpless. It is never to be exercised to discourage or depress one struggling soul. Let those to whom have been given positions of influence ever remember that God desires them to carry out the mind of Christ, who, by creation and redemption, is the owner of all men. Just as long as a man is imbued with the Spirit of Christ, he is registered in the books of heaven as a co-partner with God. He is God's helping hand. As the disciples received bread from the hands of the Saviour to give to the people, so he receives divine grace to impart to those in need. And in the distribution, the gift is increased.",
