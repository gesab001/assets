He has been bought with a price, even the blood of the Son of God. \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name\" [John 1:12]. My brother, may the Lord indeed wash all your sins away, and give you a new heart. \"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that, watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame\" [Revelation 16:15]. \n     [Revelation 19:6-9, quoted.]--Letter 48, 1898. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G.
