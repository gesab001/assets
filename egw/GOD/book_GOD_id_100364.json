    "word": "The greatest worker that ever lived was Jesus Christ. He was the Truth. He was the Light; and He was with us under all our trying circumstances. We think of those days with thankfulness for our experience. But now God has been leading us on step by step, from advance to advance. Old standardbearers have laid off their armor and men with no experience in test and trial or in knowledge come in and think they know everything. They take things made ready at their hands, swell into great proportions, and forget Joseph.",
