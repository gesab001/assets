    "word": "The first four commandments allow us no separation of the affections from God. Nor is anything allowed to divide, or share, our supreme delight in him. \n                                                                           80\nWhatever divides the affections, and takes away from the soul supreme love to God, takes the form of an idol. Our carnal hearts would cling to, and seek to carry along, our idols; but we cannot advance until we put them away; for they separate from God. The great Head of the church has chosen his people out of the world, and required them to be separate. He designs that the spirit and life of his commandments shall draw them to himself, and separate them from the elements of the world. To love God and keep his commandments is to be far from loving the world's pleasures and friendship. There is no concord between Christ and Belial. The people of God may safely trust in him alone, and without fear press on in the way of obedience.",
