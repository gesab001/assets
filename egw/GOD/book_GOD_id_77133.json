    "word": "From the light the Lord has given me, our sisters should pursue a very different course. They should be more reserved, and manifest less boldness, and encourage in themselves \"shamefacedness and sobriety.\" There is too much jovial talk indulged in among our brethren, as well as our sisters, when in each other's society. There is much jesting and joking and laughing indulged in by women professing godliness. This is all unbecoming, and grieves the Spirit of God. These exhibitions manifest a lack of true Christian refinement. These things indulged in do not strengthen the soul in God, but bring great darkness, drive the pure, refined, heavenly angels away, and bring those who engage in these wrongs down to a low level.",
