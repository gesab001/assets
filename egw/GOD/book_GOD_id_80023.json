    "word": "Efficiency Needed.--I saw that there was great inefficiency in the bookkeeping in many departments of the cause. Bookkeeping is, and ever will be, an important part of the work; and those who have become expert in it are greatly needed \n\n\n                      -42- \n\nin our institutions, and in all branches of the missionary work. It is a work that requires study that it may be done with correctness and despatch, and without worry or overtaxation; but the training of competent persons for this work has been shamefully neglected. It is a disgrace to allow a work of such magnitude as ours, to be done in a defective, inaccurate way. God wants as perfect work as it is possible for human beings to do. It is a dishonor to sacred truth and its Author to do his work in any other way. I saw that unless the workers in our institutions were subject to the authority of God there would be a lack of harmony and unity of action among them. If all will obey his directions, the Lord will stand as the [invisible] Commander; but there must also be a visible head who fears God. The Lord will never accept a careless, disorderly company of workers; neither will he undertake to lead forward and upward to noble heights and certain victory, those who are self-willed and disobedient. --Test., No. 33, p. 81.",
