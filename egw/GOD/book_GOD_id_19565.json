    "word": "The King of kings descends upon the cloud, wrapped in flaming fire. The heavens are rolled together as a scroll, the earth trembles before Him, and every mountain and island is moved out of its place. . . . The wicked pray to be buried beneath the rocks of the mountains rather than meet the face of Him whom they have despised and rejected. . . . Those who would have destroyed Christ and His faithful people now witness the glory which rests upon them. In the midst of their terror they hear the voices of the saints in joyful strains exclaiming: \"Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us\" (Isaiah 25:9).",
