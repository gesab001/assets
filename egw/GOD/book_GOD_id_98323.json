    "word": "Finally I had a dream which gave me a faint hope that I might be saved. Soon afterward I attended a prayer meeting, and when others knelt to pray, I bowed with them tremblingly, and after two or three had prayed, I opened my lips in prayer before I was aware of it. The promises of God appeared to me like so many precious pearls that were to be received only by asking for them. As I prayed, the burden and agony of soul that I had so long felt, left me, and the blessing of God came upon me like gentle dew, and I gave glory to God for what I felt.",
