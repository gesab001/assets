    "word": "Medical Missionary Workers to Solicit Funds From Non-Adventists.--The message \"Sell that ye have, and give alms\" is now to be given. But there are many who do not understand the object of this message. It is not the purpose of God that the revenues of the church should be absorbed in the work for the poor and outcast classes. This work might be presented in such a way that every dollar would be drawn from our people, and there would be no resources left for aggressive warfare in new fields. But our brethren in America, who are engaged in medical missionary lines, can by appealing to outside people obtain help, because theirs is not a denominational work. They should not draw their funds largely from our churches. The resources of the church are needed to support the gospel ministry, and to carry forward the work in new fields.--Manuscript 4, 1899, p. 16.
