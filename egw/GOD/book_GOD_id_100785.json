    "word": "I have my fears for Battle Creek, that the light that has been shining upon them will not exalt them to a deeper, higher plain of action. Day and night these words are ringing in my ears, \"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had \n                                                                           1000\nbeen done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes... And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day.\" I tremble for Battle Creek. Oh that God would roll back the mist and clouds that are gathering over her at the present time. But our trust must be in the Lord God of Israel. Jesus, precious Saviour, Thou alone canst be the help of Thy people. We are amid the perils of the last days, and it makes my heart ache to read the articles in the Review that published to the world that we are at variance. One feels moved to present the coming conflict in strong lines as he views it.",
