    "word": "Here they stand, and the finishing touch of immortality is put upon them, and they go up to meet their Lord in the air. The gates of the city of God swing back upon their hinges, and the nations that have kept the truth enter in. There are the columns of angels on either side, and the ransomed of God walk in through the cherubims and seraphims. Christ bids them welcome and puts upon them His benediction. \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" What is that joy? He sees of the travail of His soul, and is satisfied.",
