    "word": "I saw that Satan was working through agents in a number of ways. He was at work through ministers who have rejected the truth, and are given over to strong delusions to believe a lie that they might be damned. While they were preaching or praying some would fall prostrate and helpless; not by the power of the Holy Ghost, but by the power of Satan breathed upon these agents, and through them to the people. Some professed Adventists who had rejected the present truth, while preaching, praying or in conversation used mesmerism to gain adherents, and the people would rejoice in this influence, for they thought it was the Holy Ghost. And even some that used it were so far in the darkness and deception of the Devil, that they thought it was the power of God, given them to exercise. They had made God altogether such an one as themselves, and had valued his power as a thing of naught.",
