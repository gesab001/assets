    "word": "The apostles encountered those in the church who professed godliness while they were secretly cherishing iniquity. Ananias and Sapphira acted the part of deceivers, pretending to make an entire sacrifice for God, when they were covetously withholding a portion for themselves. . . . As trials and persecution came upon His [Christ\u2019s] followers, those only who were willing to forsake all for the truth\u2019s sake desired to become His disciples. Thus, as long as persecution continued, the church remained comparatively pure. But as it ceased, converts were added who were less sincere and devoted, and the way was opened for Satan to obtain a foothold.\u2014The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 4, pp. 44, 45.",
