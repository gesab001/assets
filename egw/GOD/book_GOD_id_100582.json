    "word": "There are men of experience and ability among us, who should find their place in the work as the Lord shall permit. Make room for these men brethren, give them a place. Michigan and many other states are almost destitute of laborers; for but little encouragement has been given to men who if encouraged would do a good work. Give them your confidence. All are but human, and if imperfections are seen in your laborers, do not lead them, by your words and actions to lose all confidence in themselves, to think that they can do nothing. Lay hold of every jot of ability that God places within your reach. Cultivate the talents entrusted to human beings. Do not turn away from those who err in judgment. Remember that you have faults which you do not \n                                                                           908\nsee. Seek to correct their mistakes. Encourage them to overcome, as you would desire to be encouraged were you in their place. Pray for them and with them.",
