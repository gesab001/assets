If you have wronged a brother or a sister, you have the light given you in the Word: \"If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift\" (Matthew 5:23, 24). . . .",
