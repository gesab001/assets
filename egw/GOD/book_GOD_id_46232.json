    "word": "(Matthew 12:31, 32). God Gave Pharaoh Into Hands of Self.--Every additional evidence of the power of God that the Egyptian monarch resisted, carried him on to a stronger and more persistent defiance of God. Thus the work went on, finite man warring against the expressed will of an infinite God. This case is a clear illustration of the sin against the Holy Ghost. \"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" Gradually the Lord withdrew His Spirit. Removing His restraining power, He gave the king into the hands of the worst of all tyrants,--self (RH July 27, 1897).",
