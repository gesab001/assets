    "word": "Christ's dignity and office-work are in imposing such conditions as He pleases. His followers are to become more and more a power in the proclamation of the truth as they draw nearer to the perfection of faith and of love for their brethren. God has provided divine assistance for all the emergencies to which our human resources are unequal. He gives the Holy Spirit to help in every strait, to strengthen our hope and assurance, to illuminate our minds and purify our hearts. He means that sufficient facilities shall be provided for the working out of His plans. I bid you seek counsel from God. Seek Him with the whole heart, and \"whatsoever He saith unto you, do.\" [John 2:5.]--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VI, pages 414, 415. \n\n                                               -",
