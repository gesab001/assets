    "word": "Chap. 48 - Oratorical and Theatrical Display\n\n     Eloquent Orations As Sounding Brass--The life renewed by divine grace and hidden with Christ in God is eloquent in its simplicity. The orations and speeches made by apparently learned men are in God's estimation as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal in comparison with the words which come direct from a heart refined by belief in Christ as a personal Saviour. Those who are eloquent in God's sight are willing to walk in lowly paths. They are unappreciated by those who are constantly striving for the supremacy, who have no sense of what it means to walk in humble subjection to God's will and way; but God declares: \"To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word\" [Isaiah 66:2].--Ms 176, 1899.",
