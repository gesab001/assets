    "word": "Everything not comprehended in truth is the guesswork of man. Professedly high and learned men may be fools in the sight of God, and if so, the high and learned statements of their doctrines, however they may please and humor the senses, and though they may have been handed down from age to age, and rocked in the cradle of popular faith, are a delusion and a falsehood if not found in the inspired lessons of Christ. He is the Source of all wisdom; for he placed himself directly on a level with the eternal God. In his humanity the glory of heavenly illumination fell directly upon him, and from him to the world, to be reflected back by all who receive and believe on him, mingled with his perfection of character and the luster of his own character. While Christ stood forth distinctly in his human personality, and appealed in striking but simple language to humanity, he was in such perfect oneness \n                                                                           5\nwith God that his voice came with authority, as the voice of God from the center of glory.",
