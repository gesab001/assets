    "word": "As I look over this city, I realize the magnitude of the work to be accomplished. Let every professing Christian feel the necessity of self-denial. Let every one guard against the tendency to expend for the gratification of mere vanity, money that belongs to God--especially in this time when our people are making every effort possible to build in the capital of the nation memorials that will stand in vindication of present truth. Let us study the use of every penny. Some may have formed habits of extravagance; let every such a one now choose another way--the way of obedience and self-denial.",
