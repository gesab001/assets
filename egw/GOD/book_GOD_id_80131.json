    "word": "Our brethren should be guarded, lest they become stereotyped in their plans and labors. They may spend time and money in preparing an exact channel, that the work must be done in just such a way or it is not done right. There is danger of being too particular. There should be greater care to avoid expenses in transporting books and persons. The influence is bad upon the cause of God. Brethren, you should move cautiously, economically, and judiciously. A great work is to be done, and our Offices are embarrassed. There are men who work faithfully in the Office at Battle Creek, who do not receive an equivalent for their labor. Justice is not done these men. In other work they could earn double the amount received here; but they conscientiously keep to their business, because they feel that God's cause needs their help.",
