    "word": "Make no unwise investments. Owe no man anything. Do not bind up borrowed money, making future calculations too abundantly to repay, for this has ever been your weakness. Your only safety is in walking softly before God, holding forth the word of life, receiving the precious light given you of God, for He has chosen you as a light bearer.--Letter 85, 1895, pp. 1, 2. (To J. Edson White, October 7, 1895.)",
