    "word": "The Work of Faith. \n\n     We are to be diligent workers. An idle man is one of the most miserable of God's creatures. And to be idle in the great work which Christ gave his life to accomplish, is the worst kind of idleness. Our spiritual faculties will die without exercise. Satan is never idle in seeking our destruction. All heaven is actively engaged in preparing a people for the second coming of Christ to our world. \"We are laborers together with God.\" The end of all things is at hand, and we must work while it is day, for the night cometh, in which no man can work.",
