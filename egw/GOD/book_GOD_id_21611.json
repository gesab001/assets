    "word": "A solemn oath to extirpate heresy was taken, in the great cathedral where, nearly three centuries later, the \u201cGoddess of Reason\u201d was to be enthroned by a nation that had forgotten the living God. Again the procession formed, and the  representatives of France set out to begin the work which they had sworn to do. At intervals along the homeward route, scaffolds had been erected for the execution of heretics, and it was arranged that at the approach of the king the pile should be lighted, that he might thus be witness to the whole terrible spectacle. The details of the tortures endured by these witnesses for Christ are too harrowing for recital; but there was no wavering on the part of the victims. On being urged to recant, one answered, \u201cI only believe in what the prophets and apostles formerly preached, and what all the company of the saints believed. My faith has a confidence in God which will resist all the power of hell.\u201d",
