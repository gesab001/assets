    "word": "When we obey we shall have happy families. Teach the children the commandments of God forever. This was important in Israel's time and it is none the less so now.

There is One who sees it all, and He says, I have set before thee an open door. Through this was shown the throne of God, overshadowed by the rainbow of promise, the token of the everlasting covenant, showing that mercy and truth are met together, and drawing from the beholder praise to the Lord.",
