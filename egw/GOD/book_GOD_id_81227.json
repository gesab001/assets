    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has at times taken strong measures, and has been firm and determined in the accomplishment of his purposes. He has an indomitable will to carry through whatever he undertakes; otherwise he would not now be standing on the high platform he has honorably reached. While he makes God his strength, and loves and fears him, he will be rightly balanced; but as surely as he loses his connection with God, and attempts to go in his own strength, this same will that has proved a blessing, will prove an injury to himself and to others. He will become overbearing, tyrannical, exacting, and dictatorial. These traits must not be allowed to gain the ascendency under any circumstances; for they will strengthen by indulgence, and will soon become a controlling power. His character will thus become ill-balanced, and this will disqualify him for the work of God. But although Dr. Kellogg has not been faultless, the Lord has been his helper thus far; and those who have cherished envious and jealous feelings toward him have been working against God. \n                                                                           19",
