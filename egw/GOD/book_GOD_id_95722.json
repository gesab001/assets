    "word": "\"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word.\" Jesus gave Himself up to die upon the cross in order that He might cleanse and keep us from all sin and pollution by the influence of the Holy Spirit. Let husbands devote some time to the study of the Word of God, receiving that word which convinces of sin, and let them become doers of the command of their Lord.",
