    "word": "In the day of judgment many will be found wanting because they have been tested and proved of God and found \n\n300 \n\nunworthy of eternal life. God could not trust them in heaven. The decision will be made for eternity; he that is not faithful in that which is least cannot be entrusted with greater responsibilities. They will be judged by their works which have determined their character. Is it a paying business to be dishonest? Never; for if there is no detection here in probationary time, everything will be laid open in the day of final reckoning.--MS 59, 1900.",
