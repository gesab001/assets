    "word": "MR No. 494 - What Christ's Righteousness Means to Us\n\n     All self-righteousness must be given up, for we have no righteousness of ourselves. It is the gift of God; therefore we should not be exalted, or by any means pretentious, for it is an offense to God. What have we that we have not received? Man cannot rely upon himself for anything good or righteous. Christ, only Christ and His righteousness, will obtain for us a passport into heaven.--Letter 6b, 1890, pp. 6, 7. (To \"My Dear Brethren and Sisters in Africa,\" 1890.)",
