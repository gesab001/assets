    "word": "I call upon the people of God to awake to a realization that their condition is plainly marked out in the message to the Laodicean church. Those who are striving to overcome will while on this earth be pursued by Satanic agencies. The enemy will tempt them to corrupt the principles that they must maintain if they would reach the high standard that God has set before them. \n\n\n                                       -265- \n\nWe can overcome only in the way in which Christ overcame, by whole hearted obedience to God. Real virtue of character cannot, will not, act by halves. The Christian graces, all cherished, form a beautiful, symmetrical character. True religion is obedience to all the commandments of God. Obedience brings salvation, disobedience, ruin.",
