    "word": "The world is full of evidences of God's love for fallen man. How much he loved us we can never with our finite minds measure, we have no line with which to fathom, no standard with which to compare it, but with John we may say, \"He so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,\" that through Christ he might confer on us everlasting life. This subject fills my mind and it is so grand, so elevating, that I am entranced as I think of it.",
