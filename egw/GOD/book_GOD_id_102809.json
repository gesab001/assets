    "word": "This was Christ's work. Our churches have not filled their place in cooperating with God in this great work. Every position in life is permitted in the providence of God. Every sphere of action requires most thorough consecration to God. Those who are hid with Christ in God will become instruments in God's hands for the development of Christian virtues. All classes have a part to act. God's people are not to sit, Sabbath after Sabbath hearing the word, and then do nothing to communicate to others what they have heard. They are to be laborers together with God. The Lord has given every one a work to do. Not one will He excuse who cherishes the least inclination to fold his hands and make himself a center. Truth is to be proclaimed. It is to go forth as a lamp that burneth. Not a thread of selfishness is to be woven into the work. We must see light in God's light. \n\n                                               -",
