    "word": "We have every reason to trust in God, and to bring all our worries and anxieties to Jesus Christ, that we may become better acquainted with Him.

How much happier we should be would we do this. You may come to Him as a child comes to his parents, saying, \"Here, Lord, I have carried my self as though I could save myself for a long time. My burdens are too heavy for me to carry longer. Thou canst bear them for me.\" He says, \"I will take them. With everlasting kindness will I have mercy upon thee.\"",
