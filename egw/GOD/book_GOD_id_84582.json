    "word": "Abuse of the temple of God has brought upon men and women suffering and misery which no human tongue can describe. \"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor light. Let us walk honestly in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.\"",
