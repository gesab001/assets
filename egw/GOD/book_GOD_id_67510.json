    "word": "It is not an uncommon thing to see imperfection in those who carry on God's work. . . . Would it not be more pleasing to God to take an impartial outlook, and see how many souls are serving God and glorifying and honoring Him with their talents of means and intellect? Would it not be better to consider the wonderful, miracle-working power of God in the transformation of poor degraded sinners. . .? The most unfavorable matters . . . should not cause us to feel perplexed and discouraged. Everything that causes us to see the weakness of humanity is in the Lord's purpose to help us to look to Him, and in no case put our trust in man, or make flesh our arm.",
