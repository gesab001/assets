    "word": "(63) Christ gives to all the invitation, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" If God's people will wear Christ's yoke, if they will learn in His school the lessons that He teaches, there will be sufficient means to establish gospel medical missionary work in many places.",
