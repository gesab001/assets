    "word": "The Lord has a work that must be done, not only for those who are in the highways and the byways, but for those in high positions of trust. Divine power is promised, not to those who are strongest, but to those who are weakest. Those who are accounted the strongest and the most enlightened should go to the aid of those who are in most need of help and enlightenment. Everyone can become a laborer together with God, working with Him for the salvation of the souls of the colored race.",
