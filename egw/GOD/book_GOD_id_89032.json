    "word": "Is it true that the end of all things is at hand? What mean the awful calamities by sea--vessels shipwrecked and lives hurled into eternity without a moment's warning? What mean the awful accidents by land--fire consuming the riches men have hoarded, much of which has been accumulated by oppression of the poor? The Lord will not interfere to protect the property of those who transgress His law, break His covenant, and trample upon His Sabbath, accepting in its place a spurious rest day. As Nebuchadnezzar set up an image on the plains of Dura, and commanded all to bow before it, so this false sabbath has been exalted before the world, and men are commanded to keep it holy. But it has not a vestige of sanctity. Nowhere in God's Word are we commanded to reverence the first day of the week. \n\n\n                                  -355-",
