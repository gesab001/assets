    "word": "Another compact [other than the Abrahamic covenant]-- called in Scripture the \"old\" covenant--was formed between God and Israel at Sinai, and was then ratified by the blood of a sacrifice. The Abrahamic covenant was ratified by the blood of Christ, and it is called the \"second\", or \"new\" covenant, because the blood by which it was sealed was shed after the blood of the first covenant.",
