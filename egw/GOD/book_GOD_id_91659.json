    "word": "Here is presented before all the warfare of Christ with Satan in behalf of the human race. The church is to stand in and through Him who took the penalty of sin upon His own divine soul. Every advantage that Christ had in the conflict He has made it possible for man to have. There stood the divine God in closest contest with the evil one. What an hour for the triumph and supremacy of Satan, man's most deadly foe. How he would have exulted had he been able to place his feet upon Christ as a victor. What swellings of pride filled his heart because he had it in his power to humiliate Christ. But the Son of God came forth more than conqueror. Oh, if men would avail themselves of their advantages, they would in turn become victors over the powers of darkness. More will be written on this subject. --Letter 191, 1899. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. June 5, 1986. Entire Letter",
