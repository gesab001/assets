    "word": "The truth that works by love and purifies the soul is to be cherished. We are to shun as we would the leprosy all spiritualistic ideas of God. There are mysteries that God has not revealed to human minds. Human beings would not know how to handle the Lord' treasures of wisdom without tarnishing His glory. We are to understand, as diligent students, that which God has revealed. Paul speaks of the mystery \"which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God;\" and of the purpose of its revelations, saying, \"To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord; in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him. Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of \n\n\n                                -85- \n\nwhom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God. Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.\"",
