    "word": "Christian love will work the grandest of all miracles. Christ is the world's Redeemer, and men who do not have an experimental knowledge of what He is and what He will be to them, are in darkness. In our day it is a difficult matter to bring those who profess to believe the truth to the experimental knowledge of its vitalizing, sanctifying power. This has been experienced in years gone by, but form has taken the place of the power, and its simplicity has been lost in a round of ceremonies. There is need of the Spirit and life of God to be breathed into the dry bones.",
