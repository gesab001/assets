    "word": "We are nearing the closing up of this world's history, and we want to be right with God. I believe the Lord will work for us if we will do that which the Lord enjoins us to do. We are not above temptation. Satan tempts those strongly who are in responsible positions. I am sure that you have perverted ideas; that you have imagined many things that are without foundation. The cause and work of God which we represent requires us to place ourselves in the channel of light, that the Lord may communicate to us His will.",
