    "word": "It is common for men and women to speak of themselves as Christians whose whole claim lies in the assuming of the name. They do not reveal that they are partakers of the divine nature. They do not reveal love for Jesus or for religious things. As far as their words and their spirit and their character \n\n\n                                    -341- \n\nare concerned, no one would suspect they were Christians. Their assent to the truth has no virtue. This counts for nothing in the sight of God.",
