    "word": "Will Brother Henry consider what kind of spirit they have cherished in reference to the message and the messengers. How bitter were your feelings against them. Do you think that God was leading you? These feelings are waiting for a revival. If in the history of the men who have borne this gospel message, anything should take place which should prove them erring, fallible as yourselves, you would not consider your own errors and mistakes; you would manifest the most bitter feelings against them. It is high time you were thoroughly converted, that your sins may go beforehand, and be blotted out now in probationary time, lest it shall be forever too late for wrongs to be righted. Read Isaiah 30:8-13.",
