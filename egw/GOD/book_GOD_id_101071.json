    "word": "God does not commend the position that any one of you three representative men has taken. You think you are standing at your post of duty, firm as rock; but God has not told you to stand where you are. The command is, \"Go forward, and I will be with you; I will go before you, I will be your front-guard, and the glory of the Lord shall be your rereward.\" The richest beams of light have been shining from the throne of God directly upon you, but you have slighted and (shall I say it? Painful it is to me, but I cannot forbear,) refused it as strange fire.",
