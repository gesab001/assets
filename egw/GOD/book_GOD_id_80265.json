    "word": "What is the example given at the center of the work? Let those who profess to be followers of the meek and lowly Jesus, dispose of some of their idols, such as bicycles, and various other things. Then there will be no need of robbing the treasury of God for church expenses. Christ for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich. But the professed followers of Christ do not follow his example. Let every one study how to help forward the work of God in home missions and in foreign countries. The Lord has a serious account to settle with those who have done exactly opposite to that which he has counseled them to do. The money they have bound up in Battle Creek is needed in missionary fields, to supply even the most meager facilities. The work cannot be advanced because there is no money to work the fields.",
