    "word": "The Huntsville School must not be allowed to become a reproach to the cause of God. The workers having talent and ability to help must not all congregate in Graysville and leave Huntsville destitute of suitable workers. It is wrong for one place to become strong by leaving others to become weak. To our people in Graysville I would say, Be careful not to make Graysville a Jerusalem center. Some of the talent now in Graysville is needed in Huntsville.",
