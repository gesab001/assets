    "word": "When the children of Israel were encamped on the other side of the Jordan, \"the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel.\" Read this history, contained in the thirteenth and fourteenth chapters of Numbers. When the evil report brought back by the spies was received, God was displeased, and declared His determination concerning the people. For forty years they were to wander in the wilderness. After He had said this, the people decided to go up. But the favorable time had passed. The news of their coming had been circulated, and their enemies were prepared to resist them. And Moses said, \"Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.\" But they presumptuously went to the hilltop to be defeated by their enemies.",
