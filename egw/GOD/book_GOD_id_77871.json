    "word": "Churches are to be planted. No great centers are to be made, as at Battle Creek; and yet there will be some important churches established, and meeting houses provided in large cities favorable to accommodating the believers in each locality. There should not be a call to have settled pastors over our churches, but let the life-giving power of the truth impress its individual members to act, carrying on an efficient missionary work in that locality. As the hand of God, the church is to be educated and trained to do effective work. Its members are to be the Lord's devoted, Christian workers. The church is too one-sided.",
