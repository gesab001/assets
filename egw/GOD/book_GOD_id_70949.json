    "word": "God's anger was kindled against Balaam for his Heaven-daring folly, and \u201can angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him.\u201d The animal, seeing the divine messenger, who was, however, invisible to the master, turned aside from the highway into a field. With cruel blows, Balaam brought the beast back into the path; but again, in a narrow place hemmed in by walls, the angel appeared, and the animal, trying to avoid the menacing figure, crushed the rider's foot against the wall.\u2014ST Nov. 25, 1880.",
