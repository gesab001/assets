    "word": "Parents, the Lord has shown me that if you wish to save your children, separate them from the world, keep them from other wicked children. Subdue their tempers and evil passions; teach them to obey you, then they can more easily obey the commandments of God. After you have done your duty, carry your children to God and plead His blessing upon them, and He that said, \"Suffer little children to come unto Me and forbid them not,\" will be ready to listen to your prayers for them, and the seal or mark of the believing parents will cover the children if they are brought up right.",
