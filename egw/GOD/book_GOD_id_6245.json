May God help us in the great work of overcoming. He has crowns for those that overcome. He has white robes for the righteous. He has an eternal world of glory for those who seek for glory, honor, and immortality. Every one who enters the city of God will enter it as a conqueror. He will not enter it as a condemned criminal, but as a son of God. And the welcome given to every one who enters there will be, \u201cCome, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\u201d [Matthew 25:34.]",
