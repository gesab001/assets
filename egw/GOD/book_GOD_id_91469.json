    "word": "If men will walk with God, He will hide them in the cleft of the Rock. Thus hidden they can see God in the way that Moses saw Him. With the presence and the light that God gives, they can comprehend more than they have deemed it possible to do. In walking with God and not with self, they will endure the seeing of Him who is invisible. All our workers have too slight a hold on God and eternal realities. The ministerial force in all our camp meetings must be as strong as possible. Preparations must be made for them to leave their fields of labor, if possible in safe hands, with those who will leave the work of preaching, and will labor from house to house as missionaries. In God many can do valiantly, and receive for their labor returns the richness of which will surprise them. God now calls for workers not only for the work of preaching but in coming close to individual souls, thus revealing an aptitude to watch for souls as they that must give account.",
