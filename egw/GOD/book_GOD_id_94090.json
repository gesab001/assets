    "word": "In spiritual lines many hope for something, while they have little fervency of spirit to obtain eternal good. God desires men to act proportionately, according to the value of the object they hope to obtain. When men will weigh the interests to be secured in this life, why do they not act sensibly in dealing with matters which stretch over the whole period of everlasting life? Why are they so fearful to advance?--Letter 81, 1900. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. July 7, 1988. Entire Letter.",
