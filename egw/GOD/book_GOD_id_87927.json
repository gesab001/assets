    "word": "MR No. 768 - The Harris Family\n\n     Your course of action, I was shown, has done more to lower the standard in the Lancaster church of order and discipline and subjection to order than any other one. Your influence has been demoralizing--your example to encourage undue attachments and a courting spirit with the young. Your course is not at all in accordance with the will of God.--Letter 3, 1879, pp. 9,10. (To Chapin Harris, September 9, 1880.)",
