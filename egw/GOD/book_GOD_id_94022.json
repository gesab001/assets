    "word": "Those who connect with the office of publication should be men of sterling principle; men who will look to God daily; men who have learned thoroughly the \n\n\n                                   -261- \n\nfact that eternal vigilance is their only means of safety. If those who will be chosen to connect with the office choose to confederate with others to do the works that are now being done there, they will lose their integrity. Whoever dares to seek counsel of God and to put not his trust in the pretended purity and false piety of some of the workers now in the office will find it exceedingly difficult to maintain right principles; but the only safe course for any to pursue is to work in accordance with gospel principles, and to allow nothing to swerve him from them.",
