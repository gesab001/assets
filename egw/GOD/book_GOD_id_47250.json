A Desperate Companionship for Evil.--Christ shows that without the controlling power of the Spirit of God humanity is a terrible power for evil. Unbelief, \n                                                                           1123\nhatred of reproof, will stir up satanic influences. Principalities and powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high places will unite in a desperate companionship. They will be leagued against God in the person of His saints. By misrepresentation and falsehood they will demoralize both men and women who to all appearances believe the truth. False witnesses will not be wanting in this terrible work [Luke 21:16-19 quoted] (MS 40, 1897).  {5BC 1122.12}  \n     20. Scenes to Be Repeated.--After speaking of the end of the world, Jesus comes back to Jerusalem, the city then sitting in pride and arrogance, and saying, \"I sit a queen, ... and shall see no sorrow.\" As His prophetic eye rested upon Jerusalem, He sees that as she was given up to destruction, the world will be given up to its doom. The scenes that transpired at the destruction of Jerusalem will be repeated at the great and terrible day of the Lord, but in a more fearful manner (MS 40, 1897).",
