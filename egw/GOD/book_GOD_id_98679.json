    "word": "Work must be done not only for the outcasts, but for the higher classes of society. Not half the effort is made that should be made to win this class to God. As I meet noble looking men and women, my heart yearns toward them. I think of the possibilities before them; for they have talents. But they are not aware of their dependence upon God for every spiritual and temporal favor. If they would give themselves to God, how grandly the truth would be displayed through their agency. God says to them, \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God's.\" Lay not up for yourself treasures on earth but lay up for yourself treasures in heaven, where Christ is pleading for you. Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth.\" To work for this class requires tact and ingenuity and individual effort by workers whose hearts are softened by the grace of God. While the world is heaping up treasures for the fires of the last days, let those who believe the truth work with all their God-given abilities to gain eternal treasures.",
