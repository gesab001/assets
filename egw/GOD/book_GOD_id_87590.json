    "word": "We see family and home religion neglected, altars broken down, first love abandoned, and the religion of Christ expelled from the soul, to give place to engaging in speculation and business enterprises, and these things are constantly multiplying. Men are leaving God and heaven out of their calculations, and time spent in searching the heart is considered wasted. The Bible is neglected, and a multitude of cares overbalance the precious truth of God in the heart, and spiritual eyesight is put out. How much men need the heavenly anointing!--Manuscript 6, 1890, p. 8.",
