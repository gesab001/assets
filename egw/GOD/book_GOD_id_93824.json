    "word": "Fight the good fight of faith. Overcoming requires constant watchfulness and unceasing prayer. Let not your words in the desk be contradicted by your words out of the desk. The love of Christ is progressive. By constant effort you will grow in the knowledge of God. It costs something to be pure, holy, and undefiled. But remember that he that offendeth \"not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body\" [James 3:2]. Put your hand in the hand of Christ saying, Lead me, keep me, bless me.",
