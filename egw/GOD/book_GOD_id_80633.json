    "word": "\"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.\" \"Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, and waiting at the posts of my doors.\" \"He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall; but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk, and not faint.\" \"In the day that I called he answered me, and strengthened me with strength in my soul.\"",
