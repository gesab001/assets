    "word": "Remember that you are making a mistake when you think that your conflict is with human agencies. Will a man rob God? Will you in a court of unbelievers carry on a trial against one of God's institutions, saying that \n\n\n                                     -445- \n\nit has injured you? Soon, in a higher court than any on this earth, all will see that by the inauguration of wrong principle's God's institution has been crippled, bruised, and wounded. It will be seen that you in association with others by injustice and wrong management, have hurt the Lord's instrumentalities; and that thus the work which should have gone forward in prosperity was brought into confusion.--Letter 18, 1901. (To A. R. Henry, January 20, 1901.)",
