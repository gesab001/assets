We have given of our means, setting an example to others. \n                                                                           32\nAnd we have encouraged economy and industry on the part of all connected with the Institute, and that physicians and helpers must work hard, for small pay, until the Institute should again be fully established in the confidence of our people. We have borne a plain testimony against the manifestation of selfishness in any one connected with the Institute, and have counseled and reproved wrongs. We knew that the Health Institute would not succeed unless the blessing of the Lord rested upon it. If his blessing attended it, the friends of the cause would have confidence that it was the work of God, and would feel safe to donate means to make it a living enterprise, that it might be able to accomplish the design of God.",
