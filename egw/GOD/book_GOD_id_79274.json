    "word": "The Lord has given his people great light and precious instruction. What sorrow, what shame, what agony of soul, has been felt by God's faithful servants who have stood as did Joshua and Caleb, to hear Israel cast off their leader, and choose one of their rebellious number to lead them back to Egypt. In their complaints the Israelites blasphemed God. God had signified that the defense of the land of Canaan had departed, and that now was the opportune time for them to enter it. Caleb declared the truth for that and every time: \"The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceedingly good land. If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us: a land which floweth with milk and honey. Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land: for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the Lord is \n                                                                           29\nwith us: fear them not. But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.\" The manifestation of the Lord's glory was needed to quell the mad and blasphemous utterances of the people, and to save the lives of his servants from the maddened throng.",
