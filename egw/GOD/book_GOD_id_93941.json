    "word": "The family of Brother Adams is no help but a living curse to Healdsburg, and unless they are converted--every soul of them--father, mother and children will, I fear, lose their souls. There is a commonness, a low level, which they keep which is no recommendation to our faith. It is not letting their light shine in a manner to lead anyone to glorify God. The less of such families that come to Healdsburg the better it will be for this church. My soul is sick and sore. I see nothing for this class that will elevate and ennoble, refine and purify, but the Lord's close judgments. I mention this family as a sample of other families. \n\n\n                                   -220-",
