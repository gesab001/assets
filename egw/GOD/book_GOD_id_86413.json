    "word": "In many, the absence of a Christlike spirit has been very marked. Many who claim to follow Christ have not His fragrance of character. By performing deeds of mercy, and by speaking words of kindness that are like apples of gold in pictures of silver, they could exert an elevating influence over those with whom they come in contact; but too often their words are harsh, their actions unbecoming a Christian. God cannot approve of wrong words and actions; for they are an offense to Him. He calls for a decided and thorough change. The time is very near when these matters will be adjusted by One whom none can evade. In the day of judgment everything will be put on its proper basis.",
