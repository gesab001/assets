    "word": "Those who love the law of God cannot harmonize in worship or in spirit with the determined transgressors of that law, who are filled with bitterness and malice when the plainly revealed truths of the Bible are taught. We have a detector which discriminates between the true and the false. \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" [IBID., FEB. 26, 1885.]",
