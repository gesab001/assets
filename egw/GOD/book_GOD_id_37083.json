    "word": "Minister's Appearance\n \n\n     Whether out of the pulpit or in, your appearance matters.--The work in which we are engaged is a responsible and exalted work. Those who minister in Word and doctrine should themselves be patterns of good works. They should be examples in holiness, cleanliness, and order. The appearance of the servant of God, out of the pulpit and in, should be that of a living preacher. He can accomplish far more by his godly example than by merely preaching in the desk, while his influence out of the desk is not worthy of imitation.\n62\nThose who labor in this cause are bearing to the world the most elevated truth that was ever committed to mortals.--1T 446.",
