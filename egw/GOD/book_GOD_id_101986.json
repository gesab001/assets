    "word": "God is in earnest with us. He has seen the close dealing, and it is contemptible in His sight. It leaves men where, if they do not change, they will never see the kingdom of God. They are as destitute of the nobility, the generosity, the tenderness, the compassion, the love of Christ, as the hills of Gilboa were destitute of dew and rain. They cannot be aroused to see their condition. Enough has been said, but it does not lead them to reform. The message from heaven is professedly accepted, but no change is made. This is what alarms me. I see that unless there is more tenderness, more compassion, more of the love of God, the blessing of heaven will be withdrawn. John knew what he was talking about when he said, \"Thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and \n                                                                           1732\nrepent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent\" [Revelation 2:4, 5].",
