    "word": "\"In our campmeeting services there should be singing and instrumental music. Musical instruments were used in the religious services in ancient times. The worshippers praised God upon the harp and cymbal. Music should have its place in our services. It will add to the interest. And every day a praise meeting should be held, a simple service of thanksgiving to God. There would be much more power in our campmeetings if we had a true sense of the goodness and mercy and longsuffering of God, and if more praise went forth from our lips to the honor and glory of His name. (891) We need to cultivate more fervor of soul. The Lord says whoso offereth praise glorifieth me.",
