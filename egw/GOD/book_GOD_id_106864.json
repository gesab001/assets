    "word": "I am bidden to say to our brethren in Graysville and in other centers, If the Lord has not called you definitely to a work where you are located, Go forth as missionaries sent by God. Labor as Christ did, preaching wherever you can obtain a hearing. Labor and pray. Christ will be with all who will do honest missionary work. New churches are to be built up, and in many places the word of life is to be proclaimed. Multitudes are to hear from inspired tongues the last message of mercy to a fallen world.",
