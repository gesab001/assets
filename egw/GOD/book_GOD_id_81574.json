He sustained very much the same relation to the friends in and about Rochester and Olcott that the Brn. Lindsays, Lamsons, and Gaskills, sustain to one another. He is regarded very much as a member of the same family. Bro. Andrews is beloved by them all. All are pleased with his society, and chat and  have a social time when together, and Bro. Andrews is not in their minds invested with the dignity his position gives him. Had Bro. Andrews located among his brethren who were comparatively strangers, it would have been more in accordance with the mind and will of God, and his influence would have been much greater.",
