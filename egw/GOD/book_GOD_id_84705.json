    "word": "Brethren, why not pray to God? Why not get in such a position that you can lay right hold of the hand of God? Why wait for God to humble us? Now God has been waiting for those men that have stood in the way, to humble themselves; but the word has come to me, 'If they do not humble themselves, I will humble them.' Now, God will work. He will have the work prepared for His Spirit. There is to be a preparation for the last great day, and we want to come into a position where we can work unitedly with intense earnestness \n\n\n                                    -435- \n\nand courage for God.\"--Ms 2, 1890, pp. 8-10.
