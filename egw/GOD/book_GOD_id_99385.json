    "word": "Your present and future usefulness depends upon your having a living connection with God. Your heart will then be filled with love to your brethren. Your position grants you no liberty to be severe, critical, and overbearing. Peter instructed the elders to \"feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, neither as being lords over God's heritage but being ensamples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another; for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time; casting all your care upon him; for He careth for you.\"",
