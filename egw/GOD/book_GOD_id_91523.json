    "word": "When will faithful work be done to arrest the evils that ministers and medical missionaries have seen but have not corrected? The Lord now calls for decided action in order that the gospel medical missionary work shall not be entirely spoiled by the tares that the enemy has sown. Let none continue the work of leavening our institutions, our churches, and the world with the objectionable sentiments that have been coming in of late. Let not one wrong thing be passed by uncorrected. Christian medical missionary work is to bear the signature of God, not of man.",
