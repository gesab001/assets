    "word": "The minds of God's workers must be turned toward the Sun of Righteousness. The impress of the mind of God is not upon the man who will refuse to impart instruction unless he first learns the mind of some minister or someone in whom he has confidence. In this he is leaning upon man and making flesh his arm. Let every intelligent human being lean upon his God. Let him breathe out his soul to God. Let him not consent to wear Saul's armor, but with his own God-given ability, work in the armor that God has provided for him.",
