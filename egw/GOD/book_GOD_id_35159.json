When His heritage shall conscientiously follow the Word of the Lord, His blessing will rest upon them in answer to their prayers. \u201cTherefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness\u201d (Joel 2:12, 13).",
