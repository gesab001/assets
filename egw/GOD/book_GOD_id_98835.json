    "word": "The Scriptures, given by inspiration of God, are \"profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" Let us go to the word of God for guidance. Let us seek for a \"Thus saith the Lord\". We have enough of human methods. Brethren awake to your God-given responsibilities. Your judgment, unless perverted by a long practice of false principles, will discern the deep things of God, given by His Holy Spirit, and your hearts will be made susceptible to the teachings of the word.",
