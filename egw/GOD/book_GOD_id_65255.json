WHITE, PAGES 192-205.] \n\n\n     It is nearly forty years since organization was introduced among us as a people. [WRITTEN IN 1892.] I was one of the number who had an experience in establishing it from the first. I know the difficulties that had to be met, the evils which it was designed to correct, and I have watched its influence in connection with the growth of the cause. At an early stage in the work, God gave us special light upon this point, and this light, together with the lessons that experience has taught us, should be carefully considered.",
