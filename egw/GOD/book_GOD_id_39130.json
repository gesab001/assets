    "word": "LIKE MOSES, WE MAY ENJOY INTIMATE COMMUNION WITH GOD.\u2014That hand that made the world, that holds the mountains in their places, takes this man of dust,\u2014this man of mighty faith,\u2014and mercifully covers him in a cleft of the rock, while the glory of God and all His goodness pass before him. Can we marvel that the \u201cexcellent glory\u201d reflected from Omnipotence shone in the face of \n15\nMoses with such brightness that the people could not look upon it? The impress of God was upon him, making him appear as one of the shining angels from the throne.",
