    "word": "When Wycliffe's attention was directed to the Scriptures, \n81\nhe entered upon their investigation with the same thoroughness which had enabled him to master the learning of the schools.

Here he saw the plan of salvation revealed, and Christ set forth as the only advocate for man. He gave himself to the service of Christ, and determined to proclaim the truths he had discovered.",
