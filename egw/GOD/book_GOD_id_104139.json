    "word": "He who rejects the life and character of Jesus, refusing to be like Him, declares himself to be in controversy with God. \"He that is not with Me is against Me,\" Christ declares, \"and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\" Those who love God will not choose His enemies as their friends. The question is asked, \"Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them who hate the Lord?\" True Christians will not choose the society of non-Christians. If the Lord gives them a special position in the world, as He gave Joseph and Daniel, He will keep them from being contaminated. We need to discern good from evil. We need all the help and instruction that comes from a true faith. We need to listen to the inculcation of Scripture doctrines, which are free from the sophistry and deception of the great deceiver. We need to live in as pure a religious atmosphere as possible, that we may bring solid timbers into our character building.",
