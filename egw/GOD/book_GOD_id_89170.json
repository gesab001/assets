    "word": "The world is our field of missionary toil, and we are to go forth to our labor surrounded with the atmosphere of Gethsemane and Calvary. Those in our sanitariums are to take advantage of the opportunities given them to set before the sick and suffering the restoring efficacy [that] there is in Christ for the salvation of soul and body. How carefully should these precious opportunities be improved by nurses, matron, and physicians! They are to hold up the privilege which all have of becoming children of God by surrendering all they have and are to the keeping power of Christ. We have been bought with a price, and what a price!--even the blood of the only begotten Son of God. Shall we not, then, strive to bring our lives into conformity to His will?--Letter 122, 1901, pp. 6, 7. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, Sept. 11, 1901.)",
