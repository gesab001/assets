    "word": "Our Relation to God. I have been shown that our relation to God is the same as that of little children to their parents. The God of heaven is watching His people, His church, just as loving parents \n\n\n                               -209- \n\nwatch their children. And we are as foolish as little children are; for how prone we are to think that we know everything, when really we have not begun to know what God is waiting to teach us when we show willingness to follow in His footsteps.",
