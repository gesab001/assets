    "word": "Those who give themselves to God with humble, devoted hearts need not spend three or five years in qualifying themselves to do the work essential to win souls to Christ. They are not to graduate from their progressive study when they leave school. Every day they must do humble work for the Master. They must ascertain their duty and perform it, whatever may be its character.",
