    "word": "Heart-searching Questions \n\n     Why is it that many seem to think that a responsible position exalts the man? Why do they become so self-sufficient when they are so utterly dependent upon the atoning Sacrifice? Why is there with some so great a want of tenderness, so little heart work? It is because those who are self-sufficient have not fallen upon the Rock and been broken. This is why there is so little trust in God, so little earnest, contrite repentance, so great a lack of fervent prayer. Well may the questions be put by every instructor: \"Have I received the Holy Ghost since I believed? Have I received Christ as my personal Saviour?\" Let these questions be solemnly answered.",
