    "word": "I have been instructed to publish the early experiences of the cause of present truth, showing why we stand, as we do, a people separate and distinct from the world. Few of the men who led out in the proclamation of the message are now living; but I have kept in my diaries an account of many precious experiences. These are now being prepared for the press. Will someone loan me, at a low rate of interest, the means to help in doing this work that needs to be done in bringing these things before the people? While Satan is stirring up many to depart from the faith, I am bidden to republish the experiences of the past, and give the message of warning God sends, showing the dangers of the present time, and what will be in the future. \n                                        (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
