    "word": "When a brother who has made a mistake sees his error and corrects it, is it not an indication that he may be trusted not to take a similar false step? Shall his brethren lay open his blunder, and make it appear in as grave a light as possible before his comrades and before his warring enemy? God will charge those who unwisely expose the mistakes of their brethren \n\n\n                                 -277- \n\nwith sin of far greater magnitude than He will charge the one who makes a misstep. Criticism and condemnation of the brethren are counted as criticism and condemnation of Christ.",
