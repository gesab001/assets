    "word": "June 25: . . . I put my trust in the Lord Jesus. I cry after God. \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.\" (Psalm 42:1.) Here in the home, in my pain and suffering, I must be imbued with the Spirit of Christ. It is now that I must put my trust in the Lord. At times I can do little else than cling to Jesus, saying, \"I am thy child. I trust in Thee. I have Thy pledged word, 'My grace is sufficient.'\" (2 Corinthians 12:9.) Then relief comes, and I praise the Lord for His goodness and mercy. . . . \n\n\n                                    -48-",
