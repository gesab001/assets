    "word": "Let not those who have made pledges to carry on the work of God repent of their vows, and withhold that which they have given. Those who have taken upon themselves the responsibility of annulling a pledge that has been made to God are assuming to do that for which they will not care to account in the day of final reckoning. The counsel of men who would at this time advise that means be withheld from the cause of God and invested in other enterprises should be rejected, for the Lord says to you, \"Lay up your treasure in heaven.\" \"Invest your means to advance My work, to open new fields, that the light of present truth may shine to all parts of the world.\"",
