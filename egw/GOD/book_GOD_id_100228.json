    "word": "My brother, sink self in Jesus. Lift him up, contemplate his character, grow into his character, the character of Christ is his glory. We are to grow more and more into his divine likeness, to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. When I commence writing on this subject, I go on and on, and try to get beyond the outer edge, but I fail. \n                                                                           713\nWhen we shall reach the mansions above, Jesus will himself lead the white-robed ones, made white in the blood (of the Lamb) to the Father. Therefore \"are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple, and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light on them, not any heat: for the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of water, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\"",
