    "word": "The father in one sense is the priest of the household, laying upon the altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice, the wife and children uniting in prayer and praise. With such a household Jesus will tarry and through His quickening influence your joyful exclamations shall yet be heard here, and amid higher and more lofty scenes, \"Behold I and the children whom Thou hast given me.\"  Saved, saved, eternally saved, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust, heirs now of immortality! Oh, how few fathers realize the responsibility resting upon them! How few have learned the art of governing their children, perfect self-control. When this is attained, it is easy to control, to educate the children to self-control.--Letter 27, 1870, pp. 2, 3. (To Brother Alchin, circa 1870.)",
