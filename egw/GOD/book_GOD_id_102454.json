    "word": "\"Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.\" All men and youth are appointed to do a separate work. But some stumble at the word of truth. It does not harmonize with their inclinations, and therefore they refuse to be doers of the word. They will not wear Christ's yoke of perfect obedience to the law of God. They look upon this yoke as a burden, and Satan tells them that if they will break away from it they will become as gods, no one shall rule or dictate to them; they will be able to do as they please, and have all the liberty they desire. True, they feel that they have been oppressed and cramped in every way in their religious life, but that religious life was farce. They were appointed to be co-laborers with Jesus Christ and yoking up with Christ was their only chance for perfect rest and freedom. Had they done this, they would never have been confounded.",
