    "word": "The Word of God is your counselor; the Word of God is your authority. Be very careful how you bring anything weaker to take its place. You may, my brother, feel much more certainty in regard to the movements made in Battle Creek, after reading the writings of Anna Phillips in connection with the communications from Sister White given her of God. I deeply regret that you should make this connection. I discern the future more clearly than you do. Take your Bibles, and dwell upon the truth. Preach the Word, and let the Holy Spirit of God impress the hearts of the hearers.",
