    "word": "Chap. 9 - Decided Action to be Taken Now\n\n\n                   St. Helena, Cal., October, 1903. \n\n     God has permitted the presentation of the combination of good and evil in \"Living Temple\" to be made to reveal the danger threatening us. The working that has been so ingeniously carried on he has permitted in order that certain developments might be made, and that it might be seen what a man can do with human minds when he has obtained their confidence as a physician. God has permitted the present crisis to come to open the eyes of those who desire to know the truth. He would have His people understand to what lengths the sophistry and devising of the enemy would lead.",
