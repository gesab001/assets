    "word": "As we are continually receiving the blessings of God, so are we to be continually giving. When the heavenly Benefactor ceases to give to us, then we may be excused; for we shall have nothing to bestow. God has never left us without evidence of His love, in that He did us good. He gives us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, providing us abundantly with His bounties, and filling our hearts with gladness. He has declared that \u201cwhile the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\u201d",
