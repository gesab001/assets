    "word": "\"In regard to the case of John, you see him as he now is and deplore his simplicity. He is without the consciousness of sin. The grace of God will remove all this hereditary transmitted imbecility, and he will have an inheritance among the saints in light. To you the Lord has given reason. John is a child as far as the capacity of reason is concerned, but he has the submission and obedience of a child.",
