    "word": "The more blameless the conduct of Daniel, the greater was the hatred excited against him by his enemies. They were filled with madness, because they could find nothing in his moral character or in the discharge of his duties upon which to base a complaint against him. \"Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God\" (verse 5). Three times a day Daniel prayed to the God of heaven. This was the only accusation that could be brought against him.",
