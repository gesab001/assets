    "word": "It is not ordained ministers upon whom we must depend for this work, but laymen who love and fear God, and who feel the burden for the salvation of souls. They can be agents and co-workers with divine providence in seeking to save the lost. We want those who have sanctified energy, moral and intellectual. Let these put to use the talents they have, and by exercise they will grow. It can not be otherwise if they abide in Christ. In His companionship they will be constantly growing in wisdom. Christ says, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" With Christ by your side, as your Teacher and Leader you can do all things.",
