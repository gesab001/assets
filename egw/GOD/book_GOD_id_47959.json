    "word": "(Isaiah 13:12; Matthew 13:45, 46.) Spiritual Riches for the Soul.--Jesus is going from door to door, standing in front of every soul temple, proclaiming, \"I stand at the door, and knock.\" As a heavenly merchantman, He opens His treasures and cries, \"Buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.\" The gold that He offers is without alloy, more precious than that of Ophir; for it is faith and love. \n                                                                           966\nThe white raiment He invites the soul to wear is His own robe of righteousness; and the oil for anointing is the oil of His grace, which will give spiritual eyesight to the soul in blindness and darkness, that he may distinguish between the workings of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the enemy. \"Open your doors,\" says the great Merchantman, the possessor of spiritual riches, \"and transact your business with Me. It is I, your Redeemer, who counsels you to buy of Me\" (RH Aug. 7, 1894).",
