    "word": "Chapter 5 \n\n     5, 6 (ch. 4:15, 16; 2:1). Christ Appointed to the Priesthood.--Christ glorified not Himself in being made High Priest. God gave Him His appointment to the priesthood. He was to be an example to all the human family. He qualified Himself to be, not only the representative of the race, but their Advocate, so that every soul if he will may say, I have a Friend at court. He is a High Priest that can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities (MS 101, 1897).",
