    "word": "Every right motive, every right principle violated prepares the soul for scheming and dishonesty. Those who follow such a course are making crooked paths for their feet, by which the lame will be turned out of the way. God hates these crooked practices. Christ died that he might take away our sins. He did not come that he might save us in our sins. But crooked paths and crooked practices have been sought out by some professing to believe the truth, and all that ingenuity could suggest has been taken to injure the cause of God. These plans and devices have been working like unholy leaven, just as the leaven of the Pharisees worked when Christ was on earth. All this has been done against the Lord Jesus. He has been betrayed by the wrong course of action followed, and the synagogue of Satan has triumphed.",
