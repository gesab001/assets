    "word": "The whole school, Principal and teachers, are regarded as guilty before God of your misdemeanors, which are apparent. You show that you have no respect for the word of God, no respect for your teachers or for the Principal of the school. This school was not established at great expense, and the rates of tuition placed at a very low figure, to accommodate a class of students who ought to know how to behave like gentlemen, if not for the credit of the school, for their own sakes, but who dishonor themselves and their Maker. This matter has been presented to me, and I cannot keep silent. If the teachers have not given decided commands, it is time that they did, that the respectability and credit of the school may be maintained. The Lord makes principal and teachers responsible for their students. But who is sufficient to assume the office of guide to a company of youth who are here, it is understood, to be instructed, and to behave like gentlemen and Christians, but who do not do this; they cannot; for they do not know what the name of Christian comprehends. They do not know what it means to love God, and to wear the yoke that restrains them from evil practices.",
