    "word": "The darkness of discouraged members may be dispelled if they are led to work for those more needy than themselves.--Our ministers may visit our churches, and may offer public prayer to God for the comfort of the sorrowing, asking Him to dispel doubt from their minds, and shed light into their darkened hearts. But this will not be so effective in helping these sorrowful, doubting, sin-burdened ones, as to lead them to work for those\n232\nmore needy than themselves. The darkness will be dispelled if they can be led to help others.--RH May 5, 1904.",
