    "word": "In regard to Laura, I am sure she will never consent to live with Walter Harper. She is no more favorable than she has been and will do anything but this. She is a strong girl, but when it comes to tact in furnishing little dishes that is palatable, I fear she has not the experience in the line of cooking. I know Water Harper's anxiety and he hangs to this matter like a dog to a bone, but I have done and said all I shall ever do or say on this subject to Laura Harper. I leave her to settle with her God in regard to this matter.",
