    "word": "Chap. 20 - The Pillars of Our Faith\n[WRITTEN ON THE TRAIN\nEN ROUTE TO LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS, DECEMBER, 1890.]\n\nBy Ellen G. White\n\n     During the last fifty years of my life, I have had precious opportunities to obtain an experience. I have had an experience in the first, second, and third angels' messages. The angels are represented as flying in the midst of heaven, proclaiming to the world a message of warning, and having a direct bearing upon the people living in the last days of this earth's history. No one hears the voice of these angels, for they are a symbol to represent the people of God who are working in harmony with the universe of heaven. Men and women, enlightened by the Spirit of God and sanctified through the truth, proclaim the three messages in their order.",
