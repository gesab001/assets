    "word": "Our savior taught His disciples to pray: \u201cForgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\u201d A great blessing is here asked upon conditions. We ourselves state these conditions. We ask that the mercy of God toward us may be measured by the mercy which we extend to others. Christ declares that this is the rule by which the Lord will deal with us. \u201cIf ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\u201d Wonderful terms! but how little are they understood or heeded.",
