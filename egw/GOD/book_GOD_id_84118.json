    "word": "Materials on Daniel \n\n     Daniel was closely connected with the Source of all wisdom, and this knowledge was to him more precious than the gold of Ophir. He kept his religious training on an equal with the advantages which were given him of becoming a wise and learned man. He worked with his entrusted capital. He was aroused by the situation in which he found himself in the king's court. He co-operated with God in the use of every power which had been given him, \n\n\n                                    -122- \n\nthat he should not be second in anything. And we read, \"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. Daniel was connected with God, and the secrets of the Most High were opened to him; for He is with them that fear him. \"And the king communed with them, and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they stood before the king.\" And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. Continual growth in religious wisdom and intelligence did not in any sense disqualify these youth for the faithful, intelligent discharge of the important duties assigned them in the kingdom of Babylon.--Ms 135, 1898, pp. 1, 2.
