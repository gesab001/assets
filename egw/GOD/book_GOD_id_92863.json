    "word": "God would have you pure and free and happy. Put self out of sight, and keep the glory of God in view. Depend on God for enlightenment in regard to your spiritual growth. Do not neglect to look to Jesus, who is seeking to mold and fashion you after His image. If you will consent, He will lead you on till at length you reach perfection. He will renew you more and more till you are complete in Him. Never depart from your Leader. He alone can lead you in safe paths. He alone can heal all your wounds. In every time of need He will give you comfort and consolation. Will you trust in Him?",
