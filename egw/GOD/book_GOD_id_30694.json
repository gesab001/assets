    "word": "Modesty in Deportment \n\n     The young ladies connected with our institutions should keep a strict guard over themselves. In word and action they should be reserved. Never when speaking to a married man should they show the slightest freedom. To my sisters who are connected with our sanitariums I would say, Gird on the armor. When talking to men, be kind and courteous, but never free. Observant eyes are upon you, watching your conduct, judging by it whether you are indeed children of God. Be modest. Abstain from every appearance of evil. Keep on the heavenly armor, or else for Christ's sake sever your connection with the sanitarium, the place where poor, shipwrecked souls are to find a haven. Those connected with these institutions are to take heed to themselves. Never, by word or action, are they to give the least occasion for wicked men to speak evil of the truth.",
