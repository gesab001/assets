    "word": "The Cause in New York. \n\n     While in Vermont, Dec. 10, 1871, I was shown some things in regard to New York. The cause in the State seemed to be in a deplorable condition. There were but few laborers, and these were not as efficient as their profession of faith in the sacred truths for this time demanded of them. There are those in the State, who minister in word and doctrine, who are not thorough workmen. Although they have believed the theory of the truth, and have been preaching for years, never will they be competent laborers until they work upon \n                                                                           63\na different plan. They have spent much time among the churches when they are not qualified to benefit them. They themselves are not consecrated to God. They need the spirit of endurance to suffer for Christ's sake, to \"drink of the cup and be baptized with the baptism,\" before they are prepared to help others. Unselfish, devoted workmen are needed, to bring things up in New York to the Bible standard. These men have not been in the line of their duty in traveling among the churches. If God has called them to his work, it is to save sinners. They should prove themselves by going out into new fields, that they may know for themselves whether God has committed to them the work of saving souls.",
