    "word": "March 16, I am unable to sleep this morning, and arise from my bed at two o'clock to write to you, my dear children. In the last letter that I sent you I made suggestions in reference to your coming to this country, but I fear that our course of action will be such that it will not be advisable at present. Your plans in reference to working for the colored people are, I believe, correct. But, Edson, do not gather responsibilities upon yourself. The enemy will seek to get you involved in plans and in inventions that will embarrass you. Take up the work in some line where you can work to a purpose. The talent God has given you in the ability to comprehend the truths of His word is a precious gift. If your opportunities are improved, your mind will be led into fruitful study, to an intelligent understanding of the grand, elevating, sanctifying truths for this time, and you can bless others in your work.",
