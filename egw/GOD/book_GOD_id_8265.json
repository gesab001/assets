    "word": "Isaac is bound by the trembling, loving hands of his pitying father because God has said it. The son submits to the sacrifice because he believes in the integrity of his father. But when everything is ready, when the faith of the father and the submission of the son are fully tested, the angel of God stays the uplifted hand of Abraham that is about to slay his son and tells him that it is enough. \"Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from Me.\" Genesis 22:12.",
