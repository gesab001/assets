    "word": "God would have us ever refuse to plead against the truth. His frown is upon all that is false or unfair. This should be the position of everyone who stands to minister in the service of his Master. For if one to whom God has entrusted holy responsibilities allows envy, evil surmising, prejudice, and jealousies to find place in the heart, he is guilty of breaking the law of God. And his words, his ideas, and his errors will extend just as far as his sphere of influence extends.",
