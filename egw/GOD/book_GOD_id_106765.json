    "word": "Christ is the greatest teacher that this world has ever seen. Truth never languished upon His lips, never suffered in his hands. He declares, \"He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\" God has given to every man his work. He expects every follower of his to exert an influence that will tell for the upbuilding of his kingdom. He who is not actively engaged in promoting unity and love and equity and sound principles, is exerting an influence that is contrary to Christ.",
