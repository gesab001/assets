    "word": "(116) W. 202 '03 (Copied Sept. 11, '03):-- \n\n\n     Medical missionary workers are needed in the Southern field, who can engage in sanitarium work. Sanitariums are needed, in which successful medical and surgical work can be done. These institutions, conducted in accordance with the will of God, would remove prejudice, and call our work into favorable notice. The highest aim of the workers in these institutions is to be the spiritual health of the patients. Successful evangelistic work can be done in connection with medical missionary work. It is as these lines of work are united that we may expect to gather the most precious fruit for the Lord.",
