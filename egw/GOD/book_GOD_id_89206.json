    "word": "Will this tempted brother fail with all the encouragements of the Word of God to sustain him in heroic endurance? \"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man\" (1 Corinthians 10:13). Every trial is weighed and measured by the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is not beyond man's ability to endure through the grace given unto him. \"God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it\" (Ibid.). Will this dear brother, who is so young in the faith, lay hold upon the promise? \"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations\" (2 Peter 2:9). This means that, while everything may appear overwhelmingly dark, the Lord will bring forth the tried one with firmer faith and a richer experience.",
