    "word": "Both temporal and spiritual liberality is included in this lesson of seed-sowing. When God's instrumentalities sow the good seed by distributing to others the temporal blessings God has given them, gratitude and thanksgiving to God are awakened in the hearts of the receivers. They are relieved; their temporal wants are supplied, and the evidence of the love and sympathy of others awakens in their hearts a feeling of thanksgiving to God, and opens the way whereby the seeds of truth may be sown. And God, who ministers seed to the sower, will cause the seed sown to germinate, and spring up unto life eternal.",
