    "word": "Body and Soul in Slavery.--Drinking houses are scattered all over the cities and towns. . . . The traveler enters the public house with his reason, with ability to walk in an upright manner; but look at him as he leaves. The luster is gone from his eye. The power to walk uprightly is gone; he reels to and fro like a ship at sea. His reasoning power is paralyzed, the image of God is destroyed. The poisoning, maddening draft has left a brand upon him. . . . Body and soul he is in slavery, and he cannot distinguish between right and wrong. The liquor dealer has put his bottle to his neighbor's lips, and under its influence he is full of cruelty and murder, and in his madness actually commits murder.",
