    "word": "We see that we are in no better condition than the Jewish people. God gave them the clear light that they might stand as His holy, peculiar people. He had given them the prophets, and then Christ Himself came in order that He might present the truth to them. But when His own nation rejected Him, He turned away. He told them, \"Ye have ears, but ye hear not, eyes have ye but ye see not.\" (cf. Jeremiah 5:21.) Then they inquired, \"Are we blind also?\" Christ said, \"If ye were blind no sin would be attached, but it is because light has come and ye choose darkness rather than light.\" (See John 9:14) Was it a real darkness? No, it was not. The light of truth had shone upon them, but Satan was throwing his blinder before their eyes, and they received it not.",
