    "word": "While much of the fruit of their labor is not apparent in this life, God's workers have His sure promise of ultimate success. As the world's Redeemer, Christ was constantly confronted with apparent failure. He seemed to do little of the work which He longed to do in uplifting and saving. Satanic agencies were constantly working to obstruct His way. But He would not be discouraged. Ever before Him \n                                                                           515\nHe saw the result of His mission. He knew that truth would finally triumph in the contest with evil, and to His disciples He said: \"These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\" [John 16:33.] The life of Christ's disciples is to be like His, a series of uninterrupted victories--not seen to be such here, but recognized as such in the great hereafter.",
