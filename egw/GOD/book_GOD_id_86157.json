    "word": "MR No. 422 - Additional Material on Ellen White and Health Reform\n\n     I have no recollection of being in meetings with I. C. Wellcome. It might have been, but I have no acquaintance with him, and never knew him by sight. Before '44, I sometimes lost my strength under the blessing of God. I. C. Wellcome may have confounded these exercises of the power of the Spirit of God upon me with the visions. I had no visions until in the winter, near spring, after the time had passed.--Letter 2, 1874, p. 9. (To J. N. Loughborough, August 24, 1874.)",
