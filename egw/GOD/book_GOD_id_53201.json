He did not receive the information he desired, and he sent forth a dove which finding no rest returned to the ark again. After seven days the dove was sent forth again, and when the olive leaf was seen in its mouth there was great rejoicing by this family of eight which had so long been shut up in the ark.

God spoke to Noah through the angel who opened the door and bade the family of Noah to go forth out of the ark, and to bring forth with them every living thing.",
