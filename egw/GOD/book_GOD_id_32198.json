    "word": "Learning is good. The wisdom of Solomon is desirable; but the wisdom of a greater than Solomon is far more desirable and essential. Through the learning in our schools we cannot reach Christ, but we can through Christ reach the highest end of the ladder in science; for the word of inspiration says, \"Ye are complete in Him\" (Colossians 2:10). Our first business is to see and acknowledge God, and then He will direct our path.--Lt 120, 1896.",
