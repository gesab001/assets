    "word": "SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS BELIEVE THAT MRS. WHITE WAS MORE THAN A GIFTED WRITER; THEY BELIEVE SHE WAS APPOINTED BY GOD AS A SPECIAL MESSENGER TO DRAW THE WORLD'S ATTENTION TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES AND HELP PREPARE PEOPLE FOR CHRIST'S SECOND ADVENT. FROM THE TIME SHE WAS 17 YEARS OLD UNTIL SHE DIED 70 YEARS LATER, GOD GAVE HER APPROXIMATELY 2,000 VISIONS AND DREAMS. THE VISIONS VARIED IN LENGTH FROM LESS THAN A MINUTE TO NEARLY FOUR HOURS. THE KNOWLEDGE AND COUNSEL RECEIVED THROUGH THESE REVELATIONS SHE WROTE OUT TO BE SHARED WITH OTHERS. THUS HER SPECIAL WRITINGS ARE ACCEPTED BY SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS AS INSPIRED, AND THEIR EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY IS RECOGNIZED EVEN BY CASUAL READERS.",
