    "word": "My brother, you have grown to manhood without learning the lesson that all should learn in childhood and youth, the lesson of self-denial and self-sacrifice. \n                                                                           17\nFor your present and future good, remember that you are responsible for the use you make of your Lord's gifts. God has given you genius and capabilities. Ever realize that you must make the best use of your talents, because they are not your own. They are entrusted to you by God, not to be used in pleasing and gratifying impulse, but for Him and Him alone, because they are His.",
