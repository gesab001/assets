    "word": "Says the psalmist, \"The law of the Lord is perfect.\" How wonderful in its simplicity, its comprehensiveness and perfection, is the law of Jehovah! It is so brief that we can easily commit every precept to memory, and yet so far-reaching as to express the whole will of God and to take cognizance, not only of the outward actions, but of the thoughts and intents, the desires and emotions, of the heart. Human laws cannot do this, They can deal with the outward actions only. . . . The law of God takes note of the jealousy, envy, hatred, malignity, revenge, lust, and ambition that surge through the soul, but have not found expression in the outward action; . . . and these sinful emotions will be brought into account in the day when \"God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\" . . .",
