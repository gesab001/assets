    "word": "Faithfulness Determines Value of Service.--My heart is deeply stirred by the scenes which during the night have passed before me.

The statements they made indicate that they are on the wrong track, that they have not an experience which will guard them from deception. I was grieved to hear from the lips of some of our brethren expressions that show neither faith in God nor loyalty to His truth. Propositions were made that, if carried out, would lead away from the straight and narrow way.",
