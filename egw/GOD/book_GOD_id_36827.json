    "word": "If those who claim to believe the grand truths for this time would prepare themselves by searching the Scriptures, by earnest prayer, and by the exercise of faith, they would place themselves where they would receive the light they so much crave. . . .

Christ takes His children from that which holds their attention, that they may behold His glory.",
