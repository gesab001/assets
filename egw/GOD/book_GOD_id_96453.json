He liveth in light unapproachable, but surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands of holy, happy beings, every one of them waiting to do His bidding. They are not inactive, but in communication with other worlds, in all God's vast dominion. This little world is but an atom of the Lord's dominion. Through various agencies, divine and human, He is seeking to save. He is actually stooping from His throne and observing the movements of every living being, and in His books are recorded every transaction; and through heavenly agencies He is lifting up the oppressed and pointing the way before every soul,--the way to reach the mansions above.",
