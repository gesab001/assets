    "word": "The president of the Southern California Conference needs the power to see himself as he is in the sight of God. He is as a man lost in the woods, blinded by a dangerous confidence in himself. A humbling of the soul, with earnest prayer, and a diligent study and reception of the word of God, are the means by which to overcome these peculiar temptations. The armor of truth is to be found in the word of God. Clothed in this armor, a man will be humble, not dictatorial, but a learner from the Great Teacher.",
