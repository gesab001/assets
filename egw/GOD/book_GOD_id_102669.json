    "word": "The temperance question is to have special attention. Work in this line may be called medical missionary work, but that work in its relation to the work of the third angel's message is ever to be recognized as the hand to the body. In America it has been made the head and not the hand. The gospel ministry is not to be treated as it has been treated,--as something hardly worthy to be recognized. It is God's appointed means, the very means which has made us what we are, and its work is to be carried forward in the same lines and in the same way, because it is God's. Nothing is to be devised to stand as a memorial of man's greatness or woman's greatness.",
