    "word": "God has a yearning desire to save the purchase of the blood of Christ from the sure result of a wrong course of action, which, if persisted in, will bring upon them the wrath of the rejected Lamb. Mercy, rich and free, is presented in the gift of Christ's righteousness. Those who scorn this precious gift, who despise and reject the Saviour, who refuse the invitation, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me\" (Isaiah 27:5), reject the offer of the attributes of a character which will constitute them sons and daughters of God. \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, \n\n\n                                    -144- \n\neven to them that believe on His name:\" (What name? Immanuel, the Son of God) \"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth\" (John 1:12-14).--Ms. 26, 1896.",
