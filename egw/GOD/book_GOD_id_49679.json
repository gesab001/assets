    "word": "Righteousness is holiness, likeness to God; and \"God is love.\" It is conformity to the law of God; for \"all thy commandments are righteousness;\" and \"love is the fulfilling of the law.\" Righteousness is love, and love is the light and the life of God. The righteousness of God is embodied in Christ. We receive righteousness by receiving Him.",
