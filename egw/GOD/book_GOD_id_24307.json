    "word": "It is the privilege of every one of us, like Jacob, to prevail with God. But the query arises, How can we believe that we shall receive the things we ask for, when we have no evidence that we shall? God's word is pledged. Is not that sufficient evidence? If we grasp the promises by living faith, trusting entirely in Jesus, the blessing will come in due time. It may not come in the way we expect; but it will come in the way that God directs, and by the means that he chooses to employ. Satan may tempt you to think that the Lord has forgotten you; but tell him that the word of the Lord standeth sure, having this seal, \u201cThe Lord knoweth them that are his;\u201d and keep on praying.",
