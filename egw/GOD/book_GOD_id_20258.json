    "word": "Trials\n     The work of pruning and purifying to fit us for heaven, is a great work, and will cost us much suffering and trial, because our will is not subjected to the will of Christ. We must go through the furnace till the fires have consumed the dross, and we are purified, and reflect the divine image. Those who follow their inclinations and are governed by appearances, are not good judges of what God is doing. They are filled with discontent. They see failure where there is indeed triumph, a great loss where there is gain; and, like Jacob, they are ready to exclaim, \u201cAll these things are against me,\u201d [Genesis 42:36.] when the very things whereof they complain are all working together for their good.",
