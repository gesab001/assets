    "word": "Christ's ascension to heaven, amid the cloud of heavenly angels, glorified Him. His concealed glory shone forth with all the brightness that mortal man could endure and live. He came to our world as a man; He ascended to His heavenly home as God.

The same holy beings that announced His advent to the world were permitted to attend Him at His ascension, and to demand a triumphal entrance for the royal and glorified Being. \"Lift your heads, O ye gates,\" they cry as they near the heavenly portals. . . . \"Who is this King of glory? \"And from thousands and ten thousands of voices the answer comes: \"The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.\" . . .",
