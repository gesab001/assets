    "word": "There is great danger that young men who are associated with older workers in the cause, will copy even the defects of the older ministers. This should be guarded against by both old and young. All should seek to have the softening, subduing influence of the Spirit of God, Christlike tenderness, and love for souls. Those who are sent out to labor together, should put self away, lay aside their own peculiarities, and seek to unite, heart and soul, in carrying out God's will. In order to work to advantage, they must work in harmony.",
