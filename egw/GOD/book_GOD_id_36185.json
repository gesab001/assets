    "word": "The precious promises of God are not given to strengthen man in a presumptuous course, or for him to rely upon when he rushes needlessly into danger. . . . We are required, as children of God, to maintain the consistency of our Christian character. We should exercise  prudence, caution, and humility, and walk circumspectly toward them that are without. Yet we are not in any case to surrender principle.",
