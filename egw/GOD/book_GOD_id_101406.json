    "word": "You seem unreconciled to the statement you understand me to have made in a letter to Elder Olsen, that you were selfish in leaving the Review Office. You have mistaken my meaning. It was not the act of leaving the Office, but your spirit and course while connected with the Office that was presented to me as selfish. What I wrote to Bro. Olsen was not based on reports received from any one, but on what the Lord had presented before me. The course pursued in regard to wages, at the time under consideration, was a purely selfish course, and was contrary to the principles on which the Office was established,--the principles of self-sacrifice and of justice between man and man. Those who exerted an influence to increase the wages of the workers connected with the Office were displeasing God. There was a confederacy for the robbery of God's treasury. One worked to secure higher wages for others, so that the contrast between the wages of the workers might not appear disproportionate. All who acted a part to carry this influence were engaged in a selfish work, which will sooner or later react upon themselves \n                                                                           1380\nunless they repent. Evil angels exulted, and the Lord said, \"Shall I not judge for these things?\" \"They have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. But they have set their abominations in my house which is called by my name, to defile it.\"",
