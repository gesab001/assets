    "word": "The Son of God was rejected by those whom he came to bless. He was taken by wicked hands and crucified. But after he had risen from the dead, he was with his disciples forty days, and in this time he gave them much precious instruction. He laid down to his followers the principles underlying the higher education. And when he was about to leave them and go to his Father, his last words to them were, \"I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.\" Christ will not forsake us.",
