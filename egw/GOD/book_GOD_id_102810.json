    "word": "I am instructed to say to our sanitarium workers that their light is to go forth as a lamp that burneth. There are ministerial duties devolving upon the head physicians of our sanitariums outside of the purely medical work. They must give heed to the urgent calls that come for soul-winning efforts. Every jot of influence that the Lord has given them is to be used for Him. Our medical superintendents should so live and labor as to be recognized as men who place their trust in God, men who fear the Lord, and depend upon His divine power.",
