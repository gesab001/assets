    "word": "Hasty, Impatient Speech--In the use of language there is perhaps no error that old and young are more ready to pass over lightly in themselves than hasty, impatient speech. They think it a sufficient excuse to plead, \"I was off my guard, and did not really mean what I said.\" But God's Word does not treat it lightly. The Scripture says: \"Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.\" Proverbs 29:20. \"He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken \n                                                                           144\ndown, and without walls.\" Proverbs 25:28.",
