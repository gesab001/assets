    "word": "Chapter 3 \n\n     1. See EGW on Romans 6:1-4.  {7BC 907.10}  \n     2. See EGW on 2 Corinthians 4:18.  {7BC 907.11}  \n     3 (see EGW on Galatians 2:20). Rising Above the Fog of Doubt.--The soul that loves God, rises above the fog of doubt; he gains a bright, broad, deep, living experience, and becomes meek and Christlike. His soul is committed to God, hid with Christ in God. He will be able to stand the test of neglect, of abuse and contempt, because his Saviour has suffered all this. He will not become fretful and discouraged when difficulties press him, because Jesus did not fail or become discouraged. Every true Christian will be strong, not in the strength and merit of his good works, but in the righteousness of Christ, which through faith is imputed unto him. It is a great thing to be meek and lowly in heart, to be pure and undefiled, as was the Prince of heaven when He walked among men (RH Dec. 3, 1889). \n                                                                           908\n {7BC 907.12}  \n     (Ephesians 6:16.) Shielded From the Darts of the Enemy.--When self is hid in Jesus, we are shielded from the darts of the enemy (Letter 16a, 1895).",
