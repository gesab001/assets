Now the unbelieving came up and the devil took advantage of it and began to work, and they began to say among themselves, Who is this? Is not this the son of Joseph and Mary? And just the minute this thought came into their minds they began to work it out. And you know how it worked. They arose right up and laid hold of Christ and led Him to the brow of the hill and were going to destroy Him. Now, there has not been any improvement made in human nature since that time. Human nature \n\n\n                                      -94- \n\nis human nature still. If there is any little point where they can divert the mind, they make the most of it. You see it in the counsels. It has been presented to me again and again. They [church leaders] are laying plans for the work of God, trying to make arrangements whereby they can advance the work of God, and there stands someone trying to trig [block] the wheels.

You come in and they think you are a good man, a moral man, and what you say is all right, but every time you have a chunk to throw in, and they are worried out in their counsels and nothing is accomplished which should have been done, on account of this hindrance.\"",
