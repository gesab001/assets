    "word": "There is altogether too much sermonizing. There is too little listening and hearing the voice of God, but hearing only the voice of man; and the hearers go to their homes with souls unnourished but empty as before, and prepared to sit in judgment upon the sermon, commenting upon it as they would upon a tragedy, reviewing the matter as a human effort. \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.\" Fill the mind with the great humiliation of Christ, and then contemplate His divine character, His majesty and glory of the Highest, and His disrobing Himself of these and clothing His divinity with humanity. Then we can see a self-denial, a self-sacrifice, that was the marvel of angels.",
