    "word": "Great caution should be used by you that no strife shall be unnecessarily stirred up. And yet, when the question is raised between you in regard to the keeping of the Sabbath of the Lord, the turning point comes: Will you obey God or man? Whose authority and displeasure do you most fear? You are very much averse to discord and strife. You shrink from blame like the sensitive plant to the touch. You have allowed yourself to be placed in positions making it impossible to keep the Sabbath.--Letter 4a, 1880, p. 1. (To Sister Brigs, Feb. 8, 1880.)",
