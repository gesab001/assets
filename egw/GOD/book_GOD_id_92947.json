    "word": "God gave direction that an ark was to be built for those who desired to be saved from the coming destruction. He was about to speak in determined language against the wickedness that had grown to fearful proportions. He was about to clothe Himself with vengeance, and execute His judgment against the transgressors of His law. He would arise out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity and bold transgression.",
