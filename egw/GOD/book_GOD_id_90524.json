    "word": "MR No. 1094 - Leaders to be Under the Discipline of God; Christ's Power can Transform Human Nature\n\n     (Written January 2, 1894, from Melbourne, Australia, to Jacob Christiansen, captain of the mission ship Pitcairn.) \n\n\n     I send you a copy of the letter written to a brother in New Zealand. I have endeavored to press this matter through although there has been much going on in moving from the school building to the campground five miles from there. The camp meeting grounds are six times as large as the grounds upon which we held our meeting in Wellington, and there are more than six times as many campers on the ground. Thus far our meetings have been excellent. There is a good, cheerful spirit manifested. Oh, that the Lord would manifest His power in this meeting!",
