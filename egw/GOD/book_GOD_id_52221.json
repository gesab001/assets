    "word": "The sanctuary in Heaven, in which Jesus ministers in our behalf, is the great original, of which the sanctuary built by Moses was a copy. God placed his Spirit upon the builders of the earthly sanctuary. The artistic skill displayed in its construction was a manifestation of divine wisdom. The walls had the appearance of massive gold, reflecting in every direction \n                                                                           261\nthe light of the seven lamps of the golden candlestick. The table of show-bread and the altar of incense glittered like burnished gold.
