    "word": "Men who do not control their own impulses are not chosen by the Lord to deal with human minds. For this work, there is need of much prayer, much humiliation before God, much deep sensibility of the value of the human soul, for whom Christ has paid so great a price. It was to seek for the pearl of great price that he left the enjoyments of heaven. And when the pearl is found, all heaven rejoices. When this is the case, why do not men tremble when they see the pearl in danger of being lost? Why are they not working conscientiously to secure that pearl for Jesus Christ? God sees that men in official positions are lifted up by self confidence and self importance. He sees that they are speaking and acting wrongly toward those who need wise instruction, and who need to come in contact with men who have hearts of flesh and not of steel.",
