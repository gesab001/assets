We may associate together as we do here today, [NOTE: PORTION OF AN ADDRESS TO A COMPANY OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED, ENJOYING A SEASON OF RECREATION AT LAKE GOGUAC, NEAR BATTLE CREEK, MICHIGAN, IN MAY, 1870.] and do all to the glory of God. We can and should conduct our recreations in such a manner that we shall be fitted for the more successful discharge of the duties devolving upon us, and that our influence shall be more beneficial upon those with whom we associate. Especially should it be the case upon an occasion like this, which should be of good cheer to us all. We can return to our homes improved in mind and refreshed in body, and prepared to engage in the work anew, with better hope and better courage. \n                                                                           497",
