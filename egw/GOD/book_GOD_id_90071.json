    "word": "Concerning God's dealing with the children of Israel, we read in Nehemiah: [Nehemiah 9:11-21, quoted]. Thus Christ had wrought for ancient Israel. Enshrouded in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, He led them through the wilderness. \"Nevertheless, they were disobedient, and rebelled against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their backs, and slew Thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to Thee, and they wrought great provocations\" [verse 26]. (Let every soul be careful now else he will do as did the children of Israel. Many who do not know it, are taking sides today.)",
