    "word": "Tell these brethren that the Lord has a complaint against them which is not imaginary or trivial. Tell them that they have wounded Him who died to save them, and unless they shall break the snare, and confess their sins, and seek the forgiveness of God, they will feel His displeasure. Oh, that the love of God may melt the hearts of these men, that they may see how they have grieved the heart of Christ. Our God is a God of infinite tenderness, of sympathy, and inexpressible love; and in Jesus is revealed His heart of love. May the Lord give these brethren the repentance that needeth not to be repented of.--Letter 4, 1897, pp. 1-6. (To Brethren and Sisters in Adelaide, April 5, 1897.)",
