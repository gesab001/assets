    "word": "Christ alone can do this. His gospel, in the hearts and hands of His followers, is the power which is to accomplish His great work. \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\" Romans 11:33. Christ made it possible for the work of redemption to be accomplished by Himself becoming subject to Satan's misrepresentations. Thus was Satan to show himself to be the cause of disloyalty in God's universe. Thus was to be forever settled the great controversy between Christ and Satan.",
