    "word": "When Christ shall come in His glory, the wicked cannot endure to behold Him. The light of His presence, which is life to those who love Him, is death to the ungodly. The expectation of His coming is to them a \"fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation.\" Hebrews 10:27. When He shall appear, they will pray to be hidden from the face of Him who died to redeem them.",
