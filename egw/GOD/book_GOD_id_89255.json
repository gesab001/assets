    "word": "In your case, and those connected with you, the church has been zealously seeking to keep out these heresies. They have openly protested against them, and this has caused those in error to raise the cry, \"Persecution!\" The ones who dealt with these persistently inconsistent elements became excited and harsh, moved unwisely, and thus gave Satan great advantage. This is not the way to deal with the erring. The standard of truth should always be held up in the spirit of the Master. God alone is able to decide how far circumstances and personal infirmities were responsible for their accepting heresies--whether it was a sin of ignorance, or a lack of wisdom.",
