How many facilities might be used in extending the work of God as His providence opens the way! Hundreds could be employed in the field in doing good in various branches, but they are not there.

Some would go into regions beyond, but they have not the means to take them; for others have left undone that which they ought to have done. These are some of the reasons why a few workers have to go loaded down as a cart beneath sheaves, while others take no burden.--R. & H., July 14, 1896.",
