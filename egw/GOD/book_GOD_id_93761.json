    "word": "The king declared to the three Hebrew youth, if \"ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hand?\" [Daniel 3:15]. The youth said to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, \n\n\n                                    -120- \n\nour God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated\" [Daniel 3:16-19].",
