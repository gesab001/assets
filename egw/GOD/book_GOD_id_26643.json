    "word": "\u201cThese men claimed to be sanctified, and that they could not sin. \u2018Believe in Jesus Christ,\u2019 was their cry, \u2018only believe and this is all that is required of us; only have faith in Jesus.\u2019 The words of John came forcibly to my mind: \u2018If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\u2019 I was shown that those who triumph, and claim that they are sinless, show in this very boasting that they are far from being without the taint of sin. The more clearly fallen man comprehends the character of Christ, the more distrustful will he be of himself, and the more imperfect will his works appear to him in contrast with those which marked the life of the spotless Redeemer. But those who are at a great distance from Jesus, whose spiritual senses are so clouded by error that they cannot comprehend the divine character of the great Exemplar, conceive of him as altogether such an one as themselves, and talk of their own perfection of holiness with a high degree of satisfaction. They really know little of themselves, and less of Christ. They are far from God.",
