    "word": "You lack the very experience you need to make you what God would have you to be. You need to study the law of God. Look in the mirror; bring your own heart to its searching, far-reaching principles, and go not away and forget what manner of man was presented to you in that mirror. I have not much hope for the church [members] unless the very ones who labor for them are converted men and Christlike in character. I am pained to write you these things. I hoped I should not have to write them. Search and see if self is not idolized. You must cleanse the soul temple.",
