    "word": "Growth in Grace \n\n     Those who have Christ enthroned within, will manifest Christlike principles. They will make it evident that the Holy Spirit has imparted a new life to them, and that they are nourishing and cherishing that life. Its beginning is found in spiritual union with the Lord Jesus Christ, and as they go on increasing in the knowledge of God, they will manifest a growth in grace and will show Christlike love to others.",
