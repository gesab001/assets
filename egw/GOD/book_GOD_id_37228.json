    "word": "28: Child Dedication\n\n\n     Let ministers take little children in their arms and bless them.--The mothers that brought their children to Jesus, did well. Remember the text, \"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\" Let mothers now lead their children to Christ. Let ministers of the gospel take the little children in their arms, and bless them in the name of Jesus. Let words of tenderest love be spoken to the little ones; for Jesus took the lambs of the flock in His arms, and blessed them.--RH March 24, 1896.",
