    "word": "You are not a converted people. The love of Jesus does not dwell in your hearts, and you are just as ready to fasten upon some other one to dissect his character, to become like Jehu in zeal to ferret out everything you can of a nature to condemn him, as you have been in the case of Bro. Bell. The spirit is there. The root of bitterness has not been dug out, but will spring into life and flourish wonderfully if it has a chance. The same suspicion, the same jealousies, the same spirit of insubordination, the same disrespect for men whom God has acknowledged as his servants, the same riding over authority that caused your present trouble, is not dead,--it is only quelled to arouse again in greater force, if a favorable occasion should offer. This spirit has never been expelled. The suspicions, the dark hints, the venom, the bitterness that has existed against Dr. Kellogg will be put in more active operation. Thus I have seen. He has been faulty, he has erred. He has confessed it like a man and a Christian, and I hold nothing against him. But if you can find some excuse to neglect your own heart-work by dwelling upon what you term the wrongs of another, you will do it with the greatest satisfaction.",
