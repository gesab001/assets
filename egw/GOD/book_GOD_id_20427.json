    "word": "It was the joy of Christ to save souls. Let this be your work and your joy. Perform all duties and make all sacrifices for Christ's sake, and he will be \n464\nyour constant helper. Go straight forward when the voice of duty calls; let no seeming difficulties obstruct your path. Take up your God-given responsibilities; and as you bear your sometimes heavy burdens, do not ask, \u201cWhy idle stands my brother, no yoke upon him laid?\u201d Do the duty nearest you thoroughly and well, not coveting praise, but working for the Master because you belong to him.",
