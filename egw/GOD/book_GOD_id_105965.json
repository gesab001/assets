    "word": "\"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder, Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

Be sober, be vigilant.\" (Not in kicking football, and in educating in the objectionable games which ought to make every Christian blush with mortification at the after-thoughts) be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.\"",
