    "word": "Last night I slept better than during the night previous, but I was greatly afflicted with pain in my arms, shoulders, spine, hip-bones, and feet. This makes me painfully sick, but I will not become discouraged. I will press my petitions to the throne of grace. I have a sympathizing Saviour, who does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men. I have much time to think, and my head is perfectly clear. Christ draws my attention to Himself. \"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.\" This is our confidence. I will rejoice in His love.",
