    "word": "I address my brethren and sisters in the faith, who are living in this solemn period of the world's history: We need to pray much. We need to watch unto prayer, and to live our prayers by practicing the principles of God's Word. Let us seek the Lord with the whole heart, and testify of His grace in the fervor of the Holy Spirit. The Word of God is to be our guide, our proof by which we shall vindicate our faith in every time of need. Through the sacrifice of our gracious Redeemer we have the privilege of claiming much, because we need much, and because in Christ all fullness dwells.",
