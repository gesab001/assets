    "word": "Do not let the idea that I have the rheumatism scare anyone; for the work forced upon me for the last three or four years, the little sleep and rest that I have had has been enough to affect nerve and muscle; and the only marvel is that the strain has not made me a paralytic or perfectly helpless. The strain of the last year has been terrible on me, and I am surprised that I have endured it. To God alone is all the glory. . . . But no one will carry the burden I am obliged to carry; no one will have so little opportunities as I have had to \"come apart and rest awhile.\"--Letter 19c, 1892, p. 5. (To O. A. Olsen, January, 1892.)",
