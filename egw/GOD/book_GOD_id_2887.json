    "word": "It was a great sacrifice Christ made for us in dying for us upon the cross. What are we willing to sacrifice for His love? Jesus says, \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments\u201dnot to select out one or two or nine, but the whole ten. All His commandments must be kept. John tells us of those who pretend to love but do not obey God\u2019s requirements. \u201cHe that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\u201d\u201cFor this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.\u201d",
