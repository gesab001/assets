    "word": "Jesus sees every action of the children of men. He weighs thoughts and motives. You are carrying a heavy load. I wish that everyone could feel this as I do, and would be true and faithful to you, not to hinder, not to praise or extol and glorify you, but to look upon you as one whom God is using as His instrument to do a given work, and that they must not block the wheels, but put their shoulder to the wheel and help rather than hinder.",
