    "word": "Precious Promises.--These precious words every soul that abides in Christ may make his own. He may say: \n\n\n          \"I will look unto the Lord; \n           I will wait for the God of my salvation: \n           My God will hear me. \n                                                                           125\n\n           Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; \n           When I fall, I shall arise; \n           When I sit in darkness, \n           The Lord shall be a light unto me. \n\n\n          \"He will again have compassion on us, \n           He will blot out our iniquities; \n           Yea, Thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of \n               the sea!\" Micah 7:7, 8, 19, Noyes's translation. \n\n\n     God has promised: \n\n\n          \"I will make a man more precious than fine gold; \n           Even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\" \n                                         Isaiah 13:12. \n\n\n          \"Though ye have lain among the pots, \n           Yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with \n               silver, \n           And her feathers with yellow gold.\" Psalm 68:13.",
