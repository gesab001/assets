    "word": "God's Word a Guide for Daily Speech--Our words, whether we are in the home or associating with those outside the home, will be kind and affectionate and pure. If we study the Word, and make it a part of our lives, as represented by the words, \"Eating the Word,\" we shall have a wholesome experience, which will always speak forth the truth. We shall search our hearts diligently, comparing our daily speech and tenor of work with the Word, that we may make no mistake.--Ms 3, 1906.",
