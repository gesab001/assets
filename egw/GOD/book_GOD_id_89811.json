    "word": "Those who are regarded as wise men, who are exalted to positions of trust, may be tempted to take a course like that of the king of Babylon, but rather let them be taught by the Lord's dealings with this king, and understand that all human glory will certainly be stained. God will leave men to their own exalted ideas, and prove that the wisdom of men is foolishness. God would have men learn through the experience of others that human imaginations are not current with God. The Lord sets His seal upon those who build their characters according to the pattern shown them in the mount. We are safe only as we follow Jesus and drink from the fountain of wisdom which is pure and undefiled.",
