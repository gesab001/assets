    "word": "Many have believed some things as truth because men whom they believed to be led of God have declared them to be truth; but were they? Was all they held in doctrine true? No! Time has shown that men who feared God have made mistakes in their interpretation of Scriptures. Some parts were not understood, and the next generation have, through diligent searching, come to a knowledge of the truth; advanced light has been presented, but they did not have all the light. The next generation saw increased light and then there was a going forward from light to a greater light. \n                                                                           836",
