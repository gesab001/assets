    "word": "PRAYER IS OF NO AVAIL IF THE LIFE DOES NOT MATCH THE PRAYER.\u2014\u201cIf ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\u201d When you pray, present this promise. It is our privilege to come to Him with holy boldness. As in sincerity we ask Him to let His light shine upon us, He will hear and answer us. But we must live in harmony with our prayers. They are of no avail if we walk contrary to them. I have seen a father who, after reading a portion of scripture and offering prayer, would often, almost as soon as he had risen from his knees, begin to scold his children. How could God answer the \n104\nprayer he had offered? And if, after scolding his children, a father offers prayer, does that prayer benefit the children? No; not unless it is a prayer of confession to God.\u2014(Child Guidance, 499.)",
