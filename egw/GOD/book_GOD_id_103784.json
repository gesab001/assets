White. \n                                        (Feb. 13, 1912.) \n\n\n     Shortly after I reached the office on Tuesday, February 13, 1912, Sister White came into my room, and told me that she had had a strange experience the night before, and experience somewhat similar to that which she passed through during the session of the Pacific Union Conference held at Mountain View in January 1910, when it had seemed as if she were being torn to pieces by the powers of darkness. She said that she had been struggling all night with unseen agencies that were striving to oppress and discourage and thus defeat the purposes of God. The struggle had been a long and wearing one, and at times had seemed as if the enemy might obtain the mastery; but finally, toward morning, the Lord had helped her to gain a decisive victory. The trying experience had left her, however, very weak, and she feared that during the day she would not be able to do much writing.",
