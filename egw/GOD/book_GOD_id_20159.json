    "word": "Every one who accepts the present truth should make the fullest possible surrender of himself to God. He should fall upon the Rock, and be broken. Old habits, hereditary and cultivated traits of character, must all be broken up; we must yield ourselves to be moulded by the divine Spirit if we would become vessels unto honor. Do not seek to conform the truth to your peculiarities and imperfections. But as the Comforter shall come, and reprove you of sin and of righteousness and of judgment, be careful lest you resist the Spirit, and be left in darkness. Be willing to see your errors and yield up your self-will. Submit yourself to God, that he may work in you to will and to do according to his good pleasure.\u2014MS.",
