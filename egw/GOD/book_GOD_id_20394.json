    "word": "Humility and Faithfulness in Laborers\n     Ministers should live close to Jesus, that they may rightly represent him to others. He has set them an example in his own ministry. They should labor for souls with the same unselfish love that characterized his labors. They have something more to do than merely to preach in the desk. This is only the beginning of their work. They are overseers of the flock; and it is their duty to \u201cfeed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.\u201d [Acts 20:28.] They are required to watch for souls \u201cas they that must give \n448\naccount;\u201d [Hebrews 13:17.] and they need clear discernment, that no wrong influence may pervert their work.",
