    "word": "Thus did the children of Israel. They broke down the barriers which God in His providence had erected to preserve them from disease, that they might live in health and holiness, and so learn obedience in their journeyings through the wilderness. They journeyed under the special direction of Christ, who had given Himself as a sacrifice to preserve a people who would ever keep God in their remembrance, notwithstanding Satan\u2019s masterly temptations. Enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, it was Christ\u2019s desire to keep under His sheltering wing of preservation all who would do His will.",
