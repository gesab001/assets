    "word": "Brother -----, I wish to express my great thankfulness to God that you have the privilege of engaging in so good a work. This is the very work you ought to do in connection with the medical missionary work. Your position as a physician of experience, and your wife's position, give you influence. It has been very plainly presented to me by the Lord that you and your wife have been placed where you have many opportunities for accomplishing much good. A second physician--one who is competent to assist you, and who, withal, is sound in the faith-- should be connected with you; and reliable help should \n                                                                           16\nalso be provided for your wife. This would give both of you more freedom.",
