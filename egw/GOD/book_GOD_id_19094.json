    "word": "Should anyone dishonor God by imagining that He would not respond to the appeals of His children? . . .  The Holy Spirit, the representative of Himself, is the greatest of all gifts. All \"good things\" are comprised in this. The Creator Himself can give us nothing greater, nothing better. When we beseech the Lord to pity us in our distress, and to guide us by His Holy Spirit, He will never turn away our prayer.",
