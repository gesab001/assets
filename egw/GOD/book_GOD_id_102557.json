    "word": "Daily there is opened before you the divinely-inspired word of God. The truth of God is precious. Let no irreverent, careless, heedless spirit be imbibed. Just as soon as we understand from the Spirit of God that harm is being done to the minds of those who wish to preserve sobriety and to receive good in the place of evil, an effort should be made to counteract the wrong. Our duty is plain. That class who will not take heed how they hear and how they speak, who allow the enemy to lead them whichever way he chooses, that he may use them as his agents, should be allowed to leave the school, and associate with the society they choose. They are not inclined to be pure, uncorrupted, refined, and elevated. They will not get good themselves if their minds are set not to be benefited by the light; and to keep among the students one who is not getting good himself, but who is an agent for evil, would be very unwise. \n\n\n                                   - 98 -",
