    "word": "All Christ's followers are to be partakers with Him in His sufferings. God would have us estimate the value placed on us by the price paid for us. Christ died to save us from everlasting ruin. \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\" Then should we not value ourselves when we were made to be sons of God, yes, sons of God? Obedience to Christ, holiness of soul, body, and spirit, gained by the indwelling of the grace of Christ and cherished and matured by looking to Jesus, will make us living epistles, known and read of all men.--Ms 64, 1898. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nJanuary 11, 1990. Entire Ms.",
