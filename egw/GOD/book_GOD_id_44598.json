    "word": "\"I Have Not Sent Them\" \n\n     Letters have come to me from different ones, relating visions that they said God had given them; but the Lord Jesus tells me, \"Believe them not; I have not sent them.\" Some write to me, saying that God has revealed to them that Sister White is in error, that she is influenced by the leaders to believe some things that are not true, and to reject some things that are true. But the word comes again, \"Heed them not; I have not spoken by them, nor given them any word or message. They have spun lying words, from the suggestions of Satan.\"",
