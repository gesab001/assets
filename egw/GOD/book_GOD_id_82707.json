    "word": "Will you consider what is the quality of the fruit that you are bearing? Are you a fruit-bearing branch on the parent vine stalk, or are you producing fruit that bears no resemblance to the living vine? I ask you seriously and solemnly, What is the character of the fruit that you produce? Does it do good to souls? Is it the fruit of self-denial, of self-sacrifice, the fruit of meekness, patience, long forbearance, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness and love? Is this fruit budding and blossoming for God and His glory in working as Christ worked to save perishing souls? Remember, if \"ye bear much fruit, so shall ye be My disciples.\" Without this evidence you are not Christ's, neither is Christ yours. You have no right to the Christian name. . . .",
