Let the truth of heavenly origin elevate and sanctify you, soul, body, and spirit. Abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul. Bro. D., your eating has an influence to strengthen the baser passions. You do not control your body, as it is your duty to do in order to perfect holiness in the fear of God. Temperance in eating must be practiced by you before you can be a patient man. Remember you have given to your children, in a great degree, the stamp of your own character. You should guard yourself, and not be harsh, or severe, or impatient. Deal with them decidedly, yet patiently, lovingly, pityingly, as Jesus has dealt with you. Be careful how you censure. Bear with your children, yet restrain them. This has been too much neglected by you. You have not corrected them in the right manner, not having perfect control of your own spirit. A great work must be done for you, my dear brother and sister.",
