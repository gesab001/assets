    "word": "I wish to speak of another point. In regard to Brother Rogers connecting with the Huntsville school, I thought at first that this might be best, but light has come to me that he can accomplish a much greater work in Vicksburg. In a short time, as the work opens up in the large cities, he will be needed as a man who can be depended upon. At present he is needed in Vicksburg. Let God use the men of capability just where their influence will tell for the most good. Brother Nicola has been placed in charge of the Huntsville school. Give \n\n\n                                  -312- \n\nhim another trial, and keep looking for a man to take hold there who is sound and solid in every respect, and who will stand firm for principle.",
