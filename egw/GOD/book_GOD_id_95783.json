    "word": "MR No. 1549 - Praising God for a Remarkable Healing\n\n     (Written December 7, 1872, from San Francisco, California, to Edson and Willie White.) \n\n\n     We have received two letters of length from Brother Kellogg--one written from Battle Creek and one from Dr. Trall's. We received a good letter from Edson which was a relief to us and caused us to be thankful to God that Edson was having clearer views of his mistakes and dangers. Our prayer is that God will help him to shun his past mistakes. We received two letters from Willie--one written from Battle Creek, one on galley paper written from Dr. Trall's. Dear children, write your letters on good note paper and carefully, for I wish to preserve them. I wish you also to preserve all my letters that I do not tell you to burn.",
