    "word": "Obey not the voice of the deceiver which is in harmony with the unsanctified will, but obey the impulse that God has given. The work of the heavenly intelligences, in all their operations, is constantly working to induce the human agent to will and to do. Everything is at stake. Will the human agent cooperate with the Divine? \"To will and to do.\" If man places his will on God's side, fully surrendering self to God's will, the high and holy endeavor of the human agent tears down the obstruction he himself has erected; the rubbish is cleared away from the door of the heart, the defiance and barricading of the soul is broken down. The door of the heart is opened, and Jesus enters to abide as a welcome guest.--Ms 9, 1889, pp. 1-3. (\"Behold the Lamb,\" undated.)",
