    "word": "Ezra was impressed by the Spirit of God to search the historical and poetical books of the Bible, and by this means he became familiar with the sense and understanding of the law. During the captivity the knowledge of God\u2019s will had to some extent been lost. Ezra gathered all the copies of the law that he could find. He published copies of these among God\u2019s people and became a teacher of the law and the prophecies in the schools of the prophets. The pure Word, thus diligently taught by Ezra, gave knowledge that was invaluable at that time. . . .",
