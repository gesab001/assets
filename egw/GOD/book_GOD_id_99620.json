    "word": "The Lord forces His blessing upon no one. There will be those who stand in resistance against light and will say the same words as did the Jews, \"Work a miracle and we will believe. If this is the message of God, why do they not heal the sick, and then we will believe.\" Others truly may comprehend that miracles have been wrought far greater than to heal bodily infirmities. Has not the divine power of God taken hearts cold as steel and softened them and subdued them so that they became as little children? Their legal religion was seen as it is in its true light--worthless.",
