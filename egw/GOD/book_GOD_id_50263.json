    "word": "That Christ, during his childhood, should grow in wisdom, and in favor with God and man, was not a matter of astonishment; for it was according to the laws of his divine appointment that his talents should develop, and his faculties strengthen by exercise. He sought neither the schools of the prophets nor the learning received from the rabbinical teachers; he needed not the education gained in these schools; for God was his instructor. When in the presence of the teachers and rulers, his questions were instructive lessons, and he astonished the great men with his wisdom and deep penetration. His answers to their queries opened up fields of thought on subjects in reference to the mission of Christ, which had never before entered their minds.",
