    "word": "All, every one of God's called and chosen servants, have had just such times, and if they had followed their feelings, would have given up, [feeling] that that was not the work God had given them to do. But the servants of God will always have obstacles to surmount. But do not yield up readily; keep trying, and plow your way through the darkness. Look away to Jesus, depend upon Him entirely.",
