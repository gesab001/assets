He gives wisdom to those who seek Him and depend upon Him as their Counselor.  So long as men represent the pure principles of His government, He will continue to bless and maintain them as His instrumentalities to carry out His purposes concerning His people.  He cooperates with those who cooperate with Him.--Manuscript 81, 1900, p. 12 (Diary, \"Solomon's Reign\").",
