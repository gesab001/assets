    "word": "\"Then after that.\" What meaning is there in these words? In them there is a lesson for all who are connected with the work of God. A period of probation was granted to the tree that bore no fruit. And in like manner God bears long with his people. But to those who have had great advantages, and who are standing in positions of high and sacred trust, and yet bear no fruit, Christ says, \"Cut it down: why cumbereth it the ground?\" There must be work corresponding with the sacredness of the truth they have had placed before them. Old things must pass away; all things must become new.",
