    "word": "While my baby lived, I thought I knew what my duty was. I pressed him to my heart and rejoiced that at least for one winter I should be released from any great responsibility, for it was not my duty to travel in winter with my infant. But when he was removed, I was again thrown into great uncertainty. The drowsy state of God's people nearly crushed me. A horror of great darkness came over me. I could not sleep through the night, for a severe pain was in my heart. I could find no rest in any position [in which] I might lie. Finally I fainted, and continued to faint a number of times, until my husband was seriously alarmed. He feared I must die. He sent for the brethren [BRETHREN AMADON, KELLOGG, AND C. SMITH (1T 247-8).] to come and pray for me. Their fervent and effectual prayers prevailed with God. I was relieved, and immediately taken off in vision. The cause of God in different places was then presented before me.--Letter 17, 1861, pp. 1-2. (To W. S. Ingraham, January 17, 1861.) \n                                                                           23",
