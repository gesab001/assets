    "word": "In our large cities there exists an appalling condition of poverty; multitudes are destitute of food, clothing, or shelter fit for a human being. In the same cities are men of wealth who have more than heart could wish; who live luxuriously, spending their money upon richly furnished houses, upon personal ornament, or worse, upon the gratification of the sensual appetites, upon tobacco, liquors, and other things that destroy the power of the brain, unbalance the mind, and debase the soul. While they are thus selfishly indulging themselves, all heaven is looking down upon these unfaithful stewards. God and angels mark how the means given to men, with which to honor the Creator by blessing the world, are turned to the gratification of self, to the dishonor of God, and to the neglect of his heritage. . . .",
