    "word": "As a people we are to prepare the way of the Lord. Every iota of ability God has given us must be put to use in preparing the people after God's fashion, after his spiritual mold, to stand in this great day of God's preparation; and the serious question may be awakened in world-loving hearts, \"What is eternity to us? How will my case stand in the investigative judgement? What will be my lot and place?\" Many who suppose they are going to heaven are blindfolded by the world. Their ideas of what constitutes a religious education and religious discipline are vague, resting only on probabilities; there are many who have no intelligent hope, and are running great risk in practising the very things \n                                                                           86\nwhich Jesus has taught that they should not do, in eating, drinking, and dressing, binding themselves up with the world in a variety of ways. They have yet to learn the serious lessons so essential to growth in spirituality, to come out from the world and be separate. The heart is divided, the carnal mind craves conformity, similarity to the world in so many ways that the mark of distinction from the world is scarcely distinguishable. Money, God's money, is expended in order to make an appearance after the world's customs; the religious experience is contaminated with worldliness, and the evidence of discipleship--Christ's likeness in self-denial and cross-bearing--is not discernible by the world or by the universe of heaven.",
