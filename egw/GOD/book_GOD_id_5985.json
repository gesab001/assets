    "word": "What was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost?--The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the utmost bounds of the known world. . . . Under their labors there were added to the church chosen men, who, receiving the word of life, consecrated their lives to the work of giving to others the hope that had filled their hearts with peace and joy. Hundreds proclaimed the message, \"The kingdom of God is at hand.\" They could not be restrained or intimidated by threatenings. The Lord spoke through them; and wherever they went, the sick were healed, and the poor had the gospel preached unto them. So mightily can God work when men give themselves up to the control of His Spirit.--Southern Watchman, Aug. 1, 1905.",
