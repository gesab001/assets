    "word": "Do not try to weave in a spirit of human wisdom. Do not try to find something new and strange to bring to the people, but speak the truth as it is in Jesus. When the doctrine is presented in the simplicity of true godliness, it will speak to hearts. There is need that all have opportunity to labor for souls. Then their ability will be increased, and they will be qualified to do a greater work.",
