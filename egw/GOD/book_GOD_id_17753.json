    "word": "It is a most difficult matter to unlearn the habits which have been indulged through life. The demon of intemperance is of giant strength, and is not easily conquered. But if parents begin the crusade against it at their own firesides, in their own families, in the principles they teach their children from very infancy, then they may hope for success. It will pay you, mothers, to use the precious hours which are given you by God in forming the characters of your children, and in teaching them to adhere strictly to the principles of temperance in eating and drinking.",
