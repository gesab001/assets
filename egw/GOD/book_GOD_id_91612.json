    "word": "December 14 I received a letter saying that Brother Sharp had been sent for to come to an important firm and talk with the proprietor. This man said that he had let his bookkeeper go for a holiday, and in his absence had attended to the books himself. While doing so he found that he credited himself with 15 pounds more per month than had his bookkeeper. He saw that \n\n\n                                     -54- \n\nhe had been dealt with dishonestly. He told Sharp that he had heard that he had lost his place not because of any failure on his part but because he wanted to keep the Sabbath, and added, \"I said, 'That is the man I want. I can trust that man. He has a conscience, and fears God,'\" \"Well,\" he said, \"you may have the Sabbath\"; and I think he has the same pay that he received from the other firm.",
