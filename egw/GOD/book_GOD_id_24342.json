    "word": "When our hearts are all aglow with love for Jesus and the souls for whom he died, success will attend our labors. My heart cries out after the living God. I want a closer connection with him. I want to realize his strengthening power, that I may do more effective work in his cause; and I want my brethren and sisters who are here to be blessed spiritually and physically. I entreat you to be men and women of prayer. Do not seek your own pleasure and convenience, but seek to know and do the will of God. Let each one inquire, Can I not point some soul to the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world? Can I not comfort some desponding one? Can I not be the means of saving some soul in the kingdom of God? We want the deep movings of the Spirit of God in our hearts, that we may not only be able to secure for ourselves the white raiment, but that we may so influence others that their names may be entered in the book of life, never to be blotted out. \n     Friday morning, Sept. 25.",
