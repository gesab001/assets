    "word": "The canvasser's work is a most important work. Let the canvasser remember that he has an opportunity to sow beside all waters. He will meet many who need to be taught the way of life. Let him remember that he is doing the work of God and that every talent is to be used to the glory of His name. He is doing God service as he sells the books which give a knowledge of the truth.",
