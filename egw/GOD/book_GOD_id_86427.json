    "word": "On every hand we can see the terrible results of the selfishness that led Adam to transgress God's law. The taking of the forbidden fruit--seemingly so small a matter--resulted in opening the floodgates of woe upon the world. To this transgression can be traced all the violence and the crime now existing. And when in this age of the world the principles of justice and mercy are in any way violated in word or deed, there is committed a sin of far greater magnitude than the sin that was committed in Eden; for sin was a new thing to our first parents.",
