    "word": "Satan came to Christ hoping to gain the victory. He thought that he had every advantage over Him. But he was conquered by the Saviour\u2019s meekness and humility, and by His reliance on the Word of God. Meek and lowly, and seemingly helpless, Christ was stronger than the strong man armed.
