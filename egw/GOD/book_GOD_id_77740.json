    "word": "The same sins exist in our day of carrying their eating and drinking to gluttony and drunkenness. The same sins exist in our day which brought the wrath of God upon the world in the days of Noah. Men and women now carry their eating and drinking to gluttony and drunkenness. This prevailing sin, of indulgence of perverted appetite, inflamed the passions of men in the days of Noah, and led to general corruption, until their violence and crimes reached to Heaven. And God washed the earth of its moral pollution by a flood.",
