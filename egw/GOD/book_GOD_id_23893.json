    "word": "I have a testimony to bear regarding the work of our restaurants. These institutions have absorbed much of the talent which could be used in evangelical work. In this enterprise, many are employed who, with Bible in hand, should be teaching in new places, flashing the \n74\nlight of truth into the mist and fog of error. Thus much talent and capability are absorbed in a work which, as now conducted, reveals but small results in the salvation of souls. The restaurants are carrying a burden which God has not laid upon them. The preparations of food are so expensive that the poorer class of people are unable to use them. There should be greater simplicity in the preparation of foods.",
