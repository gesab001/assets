    "word": "Again and again I have been instructed to say to our people, Let your faith and trust be in God. Do not depend on any erring man to define your duty. It is your privilege to say, \"I will declare Thy Name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee. Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him. All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify Him; and fear Him, all ye the seed of Israel. For He hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath He hid His face from him; but when he cried unto Him He heard. My praise shall be of thee . . . I will pay my vows before them that fear Him. The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise (495) the Lord that seek Him; your heart shall live forever.",
