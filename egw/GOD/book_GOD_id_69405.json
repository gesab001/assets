    "word": "The kingdom of God's grace is now being established, as day by day hearts that have been full of sin and rebellion yield to the sovereignty of His love. But the full establishment of the kingdom of His glory will not take place until the second coming of Christ to this world. \"The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,\" is to be given to \"the people of the saints of the Most High.\" Daniel 7:27. They shall inherit the kingdom prepared for them \"from the foundation of the world.\" Matthew 25:34. And Christ will take to Himself His great power and will reign.",
