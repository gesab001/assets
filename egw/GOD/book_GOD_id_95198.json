    "word": "Brother Phillips has the gift of exhortation. He can do good, but he lets feeling govern him too much. He should lift when the work goes hard. He is not called to devote [all of] his time, but can fill in here and there, and when he is not especially engaged in the work of God should be economical of his time. [He] should not seek to be eased while others are burdened and have all they can do to get along.",
