    "word": "MR No. 936 - Ellen White and the Kellogg Crisis\n\n     Exalt Science Less; Exalt Christ More--I want you, my brother, to stand under the shadow of the cross. The beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine directly there. I have no time to write more now, but I do feel an intense interest for your soul. Talk less; exalt science less; let your Redeemer be the one exalted. The melody of heaven is praise to God and the Lamb. It sounds forth from the voices of ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands. Why does not praise flow from our lips? Why are we so dumb? The Lord is ready to disclose to His church more and more of His wonderful power, and to open new lines of thought in regard to the great plan of redemption--the love, the matchless love, that moved Him to give His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.--Letter 18, 1892, pp. 8,9. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, April 15, 1892.)",
