    "word": "Faithful in Paying Tithes--This is not a request of man; it is one of God's ordinances, whereby His work may be sustained and carried on in the world.  God help us to repent.  \"Return unto Me,\" He says, \"and I will return unto You.\" Men who have a desire to do their duty, have it all laid down in clear lines in this chapter.  No one can excuse himself from paying his tithes and offerings to the Lord.--Testimonies to Ministers, p. 307.",
