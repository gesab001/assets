    "word": "True sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Thessalonian church, declares: \"This is the will of God, even your sanctification.\" And he prays: \"The very God of peace sanctify you wholly\" (1 Thessalonians 4:3;  5:23). The Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. The Saviour prayed for His disciples: \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth\" (John 17:17). And Paul teaches that believers are to be \"sanctified by the Holy Ghost\" (Romans 15:16).",
