    "word": "A Sacred Trust--The gift of speech is a valuable talent. Never despise or demit this gift. Thank God for entrusting it to you. It is a precious gift, to be sanctified, elevated, and ennobled. As a sacred trust, the voice should be used to honor God. It should never utter harsh, impure words or words of faultfinding. The gospel of Christ is to be proclaimed by the voice.",
