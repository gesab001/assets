    "word": "Addie Chamberlain is in the place she should be in. She is conscientious and unselfish. God has blessed her in her position, and if she moves in his fear he will continue to bless her. But Addie must guard against being too set. There is danger in this direction. She does not always grant little privileges and indulgences to patients that would be well for her to. She occupies a responsible position, and needs daily the grace of God to aid her in her efforts.",
