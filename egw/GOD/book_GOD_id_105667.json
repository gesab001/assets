    "word": "As believers in the greatest truths ever given to mortals, we should put to the highest use the talents that God has entrusted to us. The farm and the school at Huntsville have been placed in our hands as a precious treasure. We cannot express in words all that is involved in the proper cultivation of the land and the education of the students in domestic duties. If this work is done in the fear of God, souls will be influenced to take their position on the side of an unpopular truth.",
