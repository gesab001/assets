    "word": "I am more pleased than I can tell you with the help we have in Elder Haskell as a worker in the school. His wife also gives Bible lessons. Brother Haskell has been opening the Scriptures upon the Sanctuary subject, and he makes the matter stand out clear and forcible. Sister Haskell gives lessons in Revelation, and makes this subject very plain. All are pleased. It is so nice to have workers who have had an experimental knowledge of the Word of God. We are sure that Brother Hughes and his wife will use their experience in school management as wise and capable workers.",
