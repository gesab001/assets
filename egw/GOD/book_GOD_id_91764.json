    "word": "How much easier it is to criticize and pick flaws and tell what should be done, than to unselfishly lay hold of the work and devote to it our capabilities and talents. One who had means, and who could have helped us when everything went hard, refused to work because we could not afford to pay him the wages he asked. Men who were coach-builders by trade, and who had large families to support, worked for less than one dollar per day. \n\n\n                                   -153- \n\nwhile the brother who had come, as we supposed, as a missionary, did nothing. For three months he sat on the enemy's stool of indolence because he could not have the wages he desired, and the enemy kept him busy watching and criticizing, talking of his great knowledge and of the value of his work, while others did everything in their power to follow the light God had given, giving of their time and means to push the work and make it a success.",
