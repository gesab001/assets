    "word": "July, 1853, I saw that it was not as it should be, that the paper, owned and approved of God, should come out so seldom. That the cause, in the time in which we are living, demands the paper weekly, and the publication of many more tracts to expose the increasing errors of this time; but the work was hindered for want of means. I saw that the truth must go, and that we must not be too fearful; that tracts and papers had better go to three where they were not needed, than to have one deprived of them who can be benefited, and who prized them. I saw that the last-day signs should be brought out and clearly shown; for the manifestations of satan are on the increase. Their publishing is increasing, their power is growing; and what we can do to get the truth before others, must be done quickly.",
