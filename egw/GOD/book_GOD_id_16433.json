    "word": "Every shining star which God has placed in the heavens obeys His mandate, and gives its distinctive measure of light to make beautiful the heavens at night; so let every converted soul show the measure of light committed to him; and as it shines forth the light will increase and grow brighter. Give out your light, . . . pour forth your beams mirrored from heaven. O daughter of Zion, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" Isaiah 60:1. \n                                                                           27",
