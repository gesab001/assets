    "word": "Christ told His disciples that in the world they should have tribulation. They would be brought before kings and rulers for His sake; all manner of evil would be spoken against them falsely, and those who destroyed their lives would think they did God service. And all, in every age, who have lived godly lives have suffered persecution in some form. . . . They have suffered every indignity, outrage, and cruelty which Satan could move upon minds to invent.",
