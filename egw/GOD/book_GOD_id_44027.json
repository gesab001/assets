    "word": "WHILE THERE IS NOT A GENERAL CALL FOR THE REPUBLICATION OF ALL OF THE ARTICLES IN THEIR ENTIRELY, THERE IS A DESIRE TO HAVE A CHOICE GROUP OF ARTICLES DEVOTED LARGELY TO DOCTRINAL SUBJECTS REPRINTED IN THEIR COMPLETENESS OF COVERAGE. MANY OF THESE ARE OUTSTANDING IN THEIR PRESENTATION OF THE CENTRAL TRUTHS OF THE ADVENT MESSAGE. THESE PRICELESS MESSAGES ARE HERE PRESENTED FOR THE MOST PART IN THEIR ENTIRETY, GIVING THE READER THE BENEFIT OF EACH STATEMENT IN ITS FULL SETTING. THERE ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS WHERE THERE WERE LARGE SEGMENTS OF AN ARTICLE THAT WERE NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO THE DOCTRINAL PRESENTATION, AND IN THESE CASES DELETIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AND INDICATED IN THE USUAL WAY. THE CAREFUL STUDENT OF THE WORD OF GOD WILL REJOICE TO SEE THESE CHOICE DOCTRINAL STATEMENTS--ALL OF WHICH CENTER IN CHRIST OUR LORD--APPEAR IN THIS PERMANENT FORM.--WHITE TRUSTEES.",
