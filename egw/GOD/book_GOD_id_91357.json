Praise God, praise His holy name that we have been led to the cross of Christ, and we understand that our only hope is to renounce self and all dependence in anything and everything, and take Jesus as our Saviour, a complete Redeemer. \"Unto you therefore which believe, He is precious.\" He can be precious only to those who believe. \"Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.\" \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\"",
