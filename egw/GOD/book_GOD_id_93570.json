    "word": "If we are ever suspecting evil, we are in danger of creating what we allow ourselves to suspect. Oh, how many mistakes we make in attempting to judge the motives of our brethren!

While in connection with men of varied minds and organizations, we cannot pass along without sometimes having our feelings hurt and our temper tried, but as \n\n\n                                     -14- \n\nChristians we must be just as patient, forbearing, humble, and meek as we desire others to be. Oh, how many thousand good acts and deeds of kindness that we receive from our brethren pass from the mind like dew before the sun, while imaginary or real injury leaves an impression which it is next to impossible to efface! The very best example to give to others is to be right ourselves, and then leave ourselves, our reputation, with God, and not show too great anxiety to right every wrong impression and present our case in a favorable light.",
