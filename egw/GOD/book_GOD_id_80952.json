    "word": "Bro. Bell could have done a much better work than he has done for those who were to be ministers. God is not pleased with his course in this matter. He has not adapted himself to the situation. Men who have left their fields of labor at a considerable sacrifice to learn what they could in a short time, have not always received that help and encouragement which they should have had. Men who have reached mature years, even the meridian of life, and who have families of their own, have been subjected to unnecessary embarrassment. Bro. Bell is himself extremely sensitive, but he does not realize that others can feel the sting of ridicule, sarcasm, or censure, as keenly as he. In this he has wounded his brethren and displeased God. Bro. Bell is naturally severe, critical, and exacting; and he should continually guard himself upon these points, with all his students both old and young.",
