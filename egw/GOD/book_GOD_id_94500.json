    "word": "A person may be addicted to the use of alcohol or stimulating drinks in some shape, and he has confused his reason. He does not sense his responsibility. What cure would you advise for a person who thus indulges a habit that is rebuked even by the beasts of the field? The Word of God has denounced it. No drunkards shall enter into the kingdom of God. What would you recommend to cure such an appetite? You would not say, \"You may use strong drink moderately. Continue within bounds, but never indulge to excess.\"",
