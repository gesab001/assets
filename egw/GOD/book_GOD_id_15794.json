    "word": "A Tactful Approach.--The living truth of God is to be made known in our medical institutions. This does not mean that the doctor or any of the workers are to introduce the truth to everyone. That is not the way to do. The truth can be presented without doing this. The nurses and workers are not to go to the patients, saying, We believe in the third angel's message. That is not their work, unless the patients desire to hear, unless their objections have been removed, and their hearts have been softened.",
