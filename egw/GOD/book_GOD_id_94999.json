    "word": "There are ministers who in their habits of eating have wholly disregarded the light God has given His people on health reform. Their self-indulgence has weakened their piety and diseased their spirituality. They have set the church members an example of intemperance in eating and drinking, and this has cut Dr. Kellogg to the quick. He has lost confidence in many of our ministers and church members. He has been led to this by their failure to give up the use of flesh meat and other harmful articles of diet.",
