    "word": "This is not an exaggeration. If Christ left the ninety and nine, that he might seek and save the one lost sheep, shall we be justified in doing less? God himself set an example of self-sacrifice in giving up his Son to a shameful death. Is not a neglect to work even as Christ worked, to sacrifice as he sacrificed, a betrayal of sacred trusts, an insult to God? The lost sheep is to be found at any peril, any cost.",
