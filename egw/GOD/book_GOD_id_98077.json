    "word": "He is knocking, knocking at your heart. Open the door and let Him in. Empty the heart of all selfishness, by living right, eating right, thinking right. Enthrone the Saviour in the heart. With His long human arm He encircles the race, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite. I am hungry for the Spirit of God. Are you, brethren? My soul longs for it. May the Lord help us to take steps heavenward.--Ms 29, 1901 (MR 900.32).",
