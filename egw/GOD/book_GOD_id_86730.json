    "word": "We are praying for you that the Lord may give you largely of His Holy Spirit, and that as His human agent you may represent the likeness of Christ's character, by manifesting the practical power of the truth in the manner in which you treat your opponent. Give him not the least semblance of an excuse to become irritated over any personal thrusts that may be given in the debate. On this occasion you are representing the Author of truth. You \n\n\n                                    -25- \n\nare to show that the truth is sacred, and not to be made a scourge to those who oppose it. In handling the words of the infinite God, you are not to manifest a sharp, cruel spirit. The Lord will be your teacher and enable you to carry the controversy through with Christ-like dignity. Your opponent will seek to make the truth appear unimportant, but to many he will not be successful in this design. You are Christ's instrumentality, and should clothe your words with sacred, reverential dignity. This attitude will not be without effect on human minds.--Letter 113, 1894, pp. 2, 3. (To Elder J. O. Corliss, December 16, 1894.)",
