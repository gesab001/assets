    "word": "Surety, Oath-Taking, etc. \n\n     I saw that God was displeased with his people for being surety for unbelievers. I was directed to these texts. Proverbs 22:26. \"Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are surety for debts.\" Proverbs 11:15. \"He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; and he that hateth suretyship is sure.\" Unfaithful stewards! They pledge that which belongs to another--their heavenly Father--and Satan stands ready to aid his children to wrench it out of their hands.",
