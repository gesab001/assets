    "word": "My sister, never cherish unhappy thoughts, or think that you are not treated right.  You have become childish.  You may not recognize this, nevertheless it is so.  You need quietude and rest.  You have strong likes and dislikes.  Beware of hindering the work of God. Because I speak to you on these points, do not for a moment suppose that I wish to do you an injury.",
