    "word": "Clear New Ground--Establish New Centers.--Prepare workers to go out in the highways and hedges. We need wise nurserymen who will transplant trees to different localities and give them advantages, that they may grow. It is the positive duty of God's people to go into the regions beyond. Let forces be set at work to clear new ground, to establish new centers of influence wherever an opening can be found.--Manuscript 11, 1908.",
