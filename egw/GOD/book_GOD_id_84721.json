    "word": "On Tobacco \n\n     If the poisonous tobacco is such a soother for gentlemen, is it not for the ladies? Shall the women go through the streets polluting the air with the smoke of the noxious weed? One has just as much right as the other. But what right have any of the human race to defile themselves? What right have any to poison the air that is given us of Heaven? There is no justice in it, no more than is in the use of alcohol to poison and deform the image of God.- \n\n\n                                     -446- \n\n-Ms 26, 1887, p. 6.
