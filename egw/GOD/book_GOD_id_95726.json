Conradi.) \n\n     We were made very sorry to hear that you were in prison. We anticipated nothing of the kind when you left us, and we cannot make it seem real now. We have not forgotten you, but we have presented your case to the highest tribunal--the Great Sovereign of the worlds. The Lord whom we serve will deliver you in His own good time.",
