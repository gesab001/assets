    "word": "56\nTrue success in any line of work is not the result of chance or accident or destiny. It is the outworking of God\u2019s providences, the reward of faith and discretion, of virtue and perseverance. Fine mental qualities and a high moral tone are not the result of accident. God gives opportunities; success depends upon the use made of them.",
