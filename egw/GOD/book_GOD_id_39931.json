    "word": "We should not try to lessen our guilt by excusing sin. We must accept God\u2019s estimate of sin, and that is heavy indeed. Calvary alone can reveal the terrible enormity of sin. If we had to bear our own guilt, it would crush us. But the sinless One has taken our place; though undeserving, He has borne our iniquity. \u201cIf we confess our sins,\u201d God \u201cis faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d 1 John 1:9. Glorious truth!\u2014just to His own law, and yet the Justifier of all that believe in Jesus. \u201cWho is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His anger forever, because He delighteth in mercy.\u201d Micah 7:18.",
