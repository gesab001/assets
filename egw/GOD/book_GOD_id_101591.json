    "word": "Eternity, eternity,--my brother, how will you meet it? What would be your position should death end your career now? I ask you to consider that you cannot carry the world with you into heaven. Have you supposed that God has accepted your life of deception, that he has been glorified by your course of action? All who enter the city of God, enter there through the strait gate, through agonizing effort. You and some others who have been depended on as trustworthy men, to do the work of God, have been surrounded by an atmosphere that is not divine, but as deleterious to the soul as a poisonous malaria. Could you have the past years of your religious experience opened up to your view, you would have no more false peace, no more self-complacency. Every fibre of your being would be agonized. If you continue to do as you have done, bear in mind that when the Judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened, things that have been hidden from human eyes will appear just as they are. Then the forces that have been at work under a pretence of advancing the cause of God will be revealed in an altogether different light from that in which they are now seen.",
