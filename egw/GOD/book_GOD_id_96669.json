    "word": "Take heed lest Satan should take possession of mind and will and character. \"Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit, there is more hope of a fool than of him.\" I have a warning for all such, \"Enter not into the path of the wicked.\" Nets are laid by Satan for the feet of all who turn aside from the straight and narrow way. A blessing is upon the way of the man who has not stood in the way of sinners. \"Be ye not envious of evil men, neither desire to be with them. The path of the just is as a shining light.\" The Lord hates all manner of pretense and deception and fraud. Men may appear outwardly moral while the fear of God is not before their eyes. Those who leave the path of uprightness to walk in the deceived imagination of their own human unsanctified judgment are under the control of satanic agencies. If the weak and erring ones would only receive counsel they would be helped.",
