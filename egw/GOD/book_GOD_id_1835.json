    "word": "Jesus sought to correct the world\u2019s false standard of judging the value of men. He took His position with the poor, that He might lift from poverty the stigma that the world had attached to it. He has stripped from it forever the reproach of scorn, by blessing the poor, the inheritors of God\u2019s kingdom. He points us to the path He trod, saying, \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d [Luke 9] Verse 23.  Ibid., pp. 197, 198.88",
