    "word": "The Lord hates sin; but He loves and forgives the repentant, believing sinner, and takes him under His guardianship and control. Satan is on the track of every soul; but with every temptation that is permitted to come upon the children of God's pardoning love, He makes a way of escape in order \n\n\n                                  -362- \n\nthat they shall not be tempted above that which they are able to bear. Divine strength is imparted to make the believing child able to resist the temptation, and to escape the snare.--Manuscript 27, 1894, pp. 11, 12. (To \"Dear Brethren in the Seventh-day Adventist Faith,\" June 7, 1894.)",
