    "word": "John beholds the loyal people of God, and he exclaims, \"Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus\" [verse 12]. Babylon is represented as holding a wine cup in her hand, from which she makes all nations drink. The nations commit spiritual fornication by divorcing themselves from God and trampling on His commandments. The time in which the saints live is a trying one for those who refuse to receive the mark of the beast and his image, but through it all the saints show their patience. They continue to be steadfast in the faith, even should their firmness cost them their lives.",
