    "word": "We leave here today for Norridgewock. Well, dear Willie, I shall expect a letter from you at Norridgewock. We expect you are beginning to feel somewhat like an orphan. We hope you are cheerful and happy. We would be glad to be at our own quiet home and rest, but it seems there is but little opportunity for rest allowed us. God has sustained us thus far, and we trust Him still. He will give strength according to our day.",
