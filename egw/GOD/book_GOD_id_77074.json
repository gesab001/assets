    "word": "The Lord Jesus expects more of you than you give; yes, a great deal more. He has called and chosen you. Every man according to his several ability, has been given his work. You are to occupy a place as a laborer together with God, and as His agent you are to gather other agencies, and unite them with those already in the work, that the instrumentalities for winning souls to look to Christ may be as many as possible.",
