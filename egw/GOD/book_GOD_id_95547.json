    "word": "Those who are but babes in Christ will exert a far stronger influence for good than those who, filled with self-sufficiency, refuse to receive the light and knowledge that God offers them, saying, \"I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.\" But the words and works of these self-exalted ones are disgusting to the self-denying Redeemer. The One who knows all things says to them, \"I will not hear thy prayers, neither will I commend thy service.\" [Revelation 3:15-19, quoted].",
