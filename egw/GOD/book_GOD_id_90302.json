    "word": "The question was asked, Shall the house of the Lord be left as the last consideration? Read this chapter of inspiration, and take heed unto it. The first and second chapters contain lessons for us. I received instruction to speak to the people, and tell them that we are not to leave the house of the Lord until the last consideration. There is no place of worship we can secure in which to assemble. In the cities, halls can be obtained, but the place in which we worship is becoming too small for us. This is not according to the will of God. Our first consideration should be to build a house for the Lord.",
