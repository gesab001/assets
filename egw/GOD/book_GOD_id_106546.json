    "word": "We are very grateful to God that there have been conversions in the school. But the school is not in all things reaching the high standard to which it may attain. A mistake was made in choosing the name adopted, and in the announcement of studies that it was said would be taught. It is not wise for a new school to lift its banner and promise a high grade of work, before it has proved that it is fully able to do preparatory work as it should be done. It should be the great aim in every intermediate school to do most thorough work in the common branches.",
