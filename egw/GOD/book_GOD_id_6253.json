    "word": "I saw that God does not require any one to practice such rigid economy as to weaken or injure the temple of God. There are duties and requirements in his word to humble the church, and cause them to afflict their souls; there is no need of making crosses and manufacturing \n152\nduties to distress the body, in order to cause humility. All this is outside the word of God.",
