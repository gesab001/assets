    "word": "Giving Part Time to Neighborhood Ministry \n\n     Now I urge that more attention be given to eternal realities. Let every soul be aroused, and show that he appreciates the value of souls for whom Christ died. Let every one inquire, \"What can I do to let the light shine forth to others?\" Where is the missionary spirit? Where are those who will come to this part of the world and establish themselves in localities where they can lift the standard of truth, working in a quiet way? [ALSO WRITTEN FROM AUSTRALIA.] Although they may not be able to give their whole time to the work, they can give a portion, they can exert a good and saving influence, and God will work through them.",
