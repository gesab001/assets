    "word": "Every human being is of consequence with God. The apostle says: \"He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved: in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are in earth; even in him: in whom also we have obtained an \n\n\n                                    -376- \n\ninheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh in all things after the counsel of his own will: that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. . . . The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye might know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but that which is to come.\" (Ephesians 1:4-21, 18-21)--Ms 117, 1898, pp. 1-3, 5-9.
