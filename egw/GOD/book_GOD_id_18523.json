    "word": "Not only man but the earth had by sin come under the power of the wicked one. . . . At his creation Adam was placed in dominion over the earth. But by yielding to temptation, he was brought under the power of Satan. \"Of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage\" (2 Peter 2:19). When man became Satan's captive, the dominion which he held, passed to his conqueror. Thus Satan became \"the god of this world\" (2 Corinthians 4:4). He had usurped that dominion over the earth which had been originally given to Adam.",
