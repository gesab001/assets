    "word": "In His great suffering, Christ felt no pang of bitterness against His persecutors. He felt no remorse for His own sins [for He had none], but for the sins of the fallen race. Those who refuse the gift of Christ will one day feel \n\n\n                                 -74- \n\nthe sting of remorse. Entire obedience to the law of God is the condition of salvation. Those who refuse this, who refuse to accept Christ, will become embittered against God. When punished for transgression, they will feel remorse, despair, and hatred. This will be the experience of all who do not enter into Christ's sufferings. It is the sure consequence of sin.",
