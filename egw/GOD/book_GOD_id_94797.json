    "word": "I have begun to feel the school question burdening me again. I do now solicit my brethren to go to God, who is the Source of all wisdom, for themselves. Ask of God for light to come to your own minds and then move in whatever way the Lord shall direct. I think I should have kept my own counsel, and [then] you [would have] followed the light God would give you. I am afraid I have made a mistake in communicating to you so much as I have done. I should have waited until after all of you had investigated the land fully yourselves. Please keep all that I have said, Brother Daniells, Brother Rousseau, and W. C. White, to yourselves, and if you present anything I have said, let it be as suggestions and propositions of your own through your own sincere, honest convictions.",
