    "word": "Responsibilities and Duties of God's People \n\n     The banner of truth and religious liberty held aloft by the founders of the gospel church and by God's witnesses during the centuries that have passed since then, has, in this last conflict, been committed to our hands. The responsibility for this great gift rests with those whom God has blessed with a knowledge of His Word. We are to receive this Word as a supreme authority. We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the claims of God, we must obey God rather than men. God's word must be recognized as above all human legislation. A \"Thus \n                                                                           162\nsaith the Lord\" is not to be set aside for a \"Thus saith the church\" or a \"Thus saith the state.\" The crown of Christ is to be lifted above the diadems of earthly potentates.-- The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 68, 69.",
