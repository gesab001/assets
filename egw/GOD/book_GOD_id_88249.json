    "word": "Fermented liquor confuses the senses and perverts the powers God has given. He is dishonored when men have not sufficient respect for themselves to practice strict temperance. Fermented wine is not a natural production. The Lord never made it, and with its production He has nothing to do. When Paul advised Timothy to take a little wine for his stomach's sake, and often infirmities, it was the unfermented juice of the grape he meant.",
