    "word": "God has poured out His love unstintedly, as the showers that refresh the earth. He says, \"Let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together.\" \"When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.\" Isaiah 45:8; 41:17, 18.",
