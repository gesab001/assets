    "word": "These scriptures I have been directed to write to you. It is the spirit revealed in these words that you are to bring into your work. In the past you have presented the truth in a fierce way, using it as if it were a scourge. This has not glorified the Lord. You have given the people the rich treasures of God's Word, but your manner has been so condemnatory that they have turned from them. You have not taught the truth in the way that Christ taught it. You present it in a way that mars its influence. Unless you are converted, do not stand before the people with the truth. You are not blessed yourself in the belief of the truth, and you present the rich fruit from God's Word to the people in a very objectionable way. Your heart needs to be filled with the converting grace of Christ.",
