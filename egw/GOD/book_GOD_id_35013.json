    "word": "The Inspired Record says of Him: \u201cJesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.\u201d Luke 2:52. As He grew in years He grew in knowledge. He lived temperately; His precious hours were not wasted in dissipating pleasures. He had a truly healthy body and true powers of mind. The physical and mental powers could be expanded and developed as yours or any other youth\u2019s. The Word of God was His study, as it should be yours.",
