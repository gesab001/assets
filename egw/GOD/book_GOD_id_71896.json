    "word": "A deceiving crookedness is discernible in the minds of those whose eyes are not anointed with the heavenly eyesalve that they may see all things in the light of God's Word. The will becomes enslaved, bound to pursue a course which the Word of God will not justify. The will of the human agent is not to be given into the control of any other man. When merged into the will of other men, it is misleading. . . .",
