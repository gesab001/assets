He met all the temptations which man will meet in his life experience. Christ has Himself traveled over the path in which He calls upon us to walk. He says, \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.

He declares, \"Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\" He \"that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\"",
