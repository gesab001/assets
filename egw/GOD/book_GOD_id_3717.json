God is leading out a people, not an individual here and there. . . .\u201cTake heed, therefore, how ye hear\u201d is an admonition of Christ. We are to hear for the sake of learning the truth, that we may walk in it. And again: \u201cTake heed what ye hear.\u201d Examine closely, \u201cprove all things,\u201d\u201cbelieve not every spirit.\u201d. . . This is the counsel of God; shall we heed it?",
