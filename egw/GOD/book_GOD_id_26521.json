    "word": "\u201cAt length I was greatly relieved while listening to a discourse from the words: \u2018I will go in unto the king,\u2019 \u2018and if I perish, I perish.\u2019 In his remarks the speaker referred to those who were wavering between hope and fear, longing to be saved from their sins and receive the pardoning love of Christ, yet held in doubt and bondage by timidity and fear of failure.

All that was required of the sinner, trembling in the presence of his Lord, was to put forth the hand of faith and touch the scepter of his grace. That touch insured pardon and peace.",
