    "word": "This morning we met in the east room of the Tabernacle. A number of spirited prayers were offered, and many excellent testimonies were borne. Then I spoke again. I was full, and poured out my testimony of warnings, reproof, and encouragement. There is a breaking away. We have meetings now that hold from half past seven until nine o'clock a.m. for prayer and social meeting. Brother Olsen's testimonies are sharpening up. We believe we shall see the salvation of God. Brother and Sister Prescott were present this morning. I have no brakes to put on now. I stand in perfect freedom, calling light, light, and darkness, darkness. I told them yesterday that the position of the covenants I believed as presented in my volume 1 [Patriarchs and Prophets]. If that was Dr. Waggoner's position then he had the truth. \n\n\n                                     -422- \n\nWe hope in God.--Letter 82, 1890, p. 1. (To Willie and Mary White, March 9, 1890.)",
