    "word": "MR No. 721 - The Authority of the Spirit of Prophecy\n\n     Ellen White Spoke the Things God Gave Her.--I labored in the morning meeting to help my brethren. I presented the state of things as God had presented them to me. I illustrated the positions we should occupy as they had been presented to me. I had no personal feelings in the remark made to you that morning. In the line of my work I speak the things the Lord gives me. And in my words to you I would no more dare to say that the Lord did not move me to make the remarks which I made in that talk all the way through.-- Letter 18d, 1890, pp. 1-2. (March 6, 1890.)",
