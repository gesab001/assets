    "word": "This water represents the life of Christ, and every soul must have it by coming into living connection with \n\n\n                          - 59 - \n\nGod. Then blessed, humble, grateful confidence will be an abiding principle in the soul. Unbelieving fear will be swept away before living faith. We shall contemplate the character of Him who first loved us. By contemplation of God's matchless love, we take upon us his nature. Christ was a representative before men and before angels, of the character of the God of heaven. He demonstrated the fact that when humanity depends wholly upon God, men may keep God's commandments and live, and his law be as the apple of the eye. Those who inquire after the way of life need not be rich, need not be wise, learned, or honored, yet God will quicken their perceptions so that they may understand what they may do to be saved. The light of heaven is shining upon the earth from the throne of God, and Christ says, \"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\" His gracious invitation is going forth to all mankind, and those who respond to it will find life and salvation. Peter writes, \"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\" \n\n                                               -",
