    "word": "Satan comes to us with worldly honor, wealth, and the pleasures of life. These temptations are varied to meet men of every rank and degree, tempting them away from God to serve themselves more than their Creator. \"All these things will I give Thee,\" said Satan to Christ. \"All these things will I give thee,\" says Satan to man. \"All this money, this land, all this power and honor and riches will I give thee\"; and man is charmed, deceived, and treacherously allured on to his ruin. If we give ourselves up to worldliness of heart and of life, Satan is satisfied. --Lt 1a, 1872. (HC 93.)",
