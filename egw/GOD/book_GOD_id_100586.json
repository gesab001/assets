    "word": "Brethren, you may be quick to see things in Eld. Littlejohn that do not please you. You say he is sharp in money matters. Is he dishonest? He has erred in some things, and been reproved, but those who pronounce judgment against him have made and continue to make mistakes in their religious experience. Those who have criticised so freely must remember that Eld. Littlejohn is a blind man. If you read the Old Testament scriptures you will see that the Lord has a special care for the blind. \n                                                                           910\nHe has a love exceeding the love of a mother for her afflicted children, and he has given special directions in regard to how they should be treated. Those who for several years in the past have made no difference between those who are blind and those who can see, have not obeyed the voice of the Lord. They have followed their own impulses, irrespective of our infirmities of the men who could be a help and blessing to the work, if they would make a place for them. Those who treat their afflicted brethren coldly pursue a course condemned by God.",
