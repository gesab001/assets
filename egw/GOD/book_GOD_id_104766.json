    "word": "Elder Waggoner has loved discussions and contention. I fear that E. J. W. has cultivated a love for the same. We need now good humble religion. E. J. W. needs humility and meekness, and Brother Jones can be a power for good if he will constantly cultivate practical Godliness that he may teach this to the people. But how do you think I feel to see our two leading papers in contention? I know how these papers came into existence. I know what God has said about them, - that they are one, that no variance should be seen in these two instrumentalities for God. They are one, and they must remain one, breathing the same spirit exercised in the same work to prepare a people to stand in the day of the Lord, - one in faith and one in purpose.",
