    "word": "Balak was disappointed and angry. He exclaims, \u201cWhat hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.\u201d Balak thinks it is the grand appearance of the Israelites in their tents . . . that keeps him from cursing them. He thinks if he takes him to . . . where Israel will not appear to such advantage, he can obtain a curse from Balaam. Again, at Zophim . . . Balaam offered burnt offerings, and then went by himself to commune with the angel of God. And the angel told Balaam what to say.\u20141SP 322-324.",
