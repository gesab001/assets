    "word": "My idea is to have advantages for the little ones. We are not to throw them into Brother Anthony's school, because they are children, and don't have to pay anything. Brother Anthony I believe will do his best as far as the schooling is concerned, but he cannot teach the Bible. There is the Bible. That is what we want. It is to teach our children when they rise up and when they sit down, and when they go out, and when they come in. Your children here must be in such a school as that. You cannot teach them the commandments of God, the law of God, and importance of the law, in a public school.",
