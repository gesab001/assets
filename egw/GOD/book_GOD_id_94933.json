    "word": "Faith is not sight. It rests upon probability, not on demonstration, for then it would be no faith. You can, through consecration to God, with every capability and power sanctified be a colaborer with Jesus Christ. You can, in connection with the Echo office, be an efficient workman that needeth not to be ashamed. Your hands handling sacred things may be clean, your spirit pure, and you vitalized with the Spirit of God. The word of the Lord comes to you to change your course of action. The Lord will use you as His human instrument to do a good work for the Lord who gave His life for you.",
