    "word": "2 (1 Corinthians 4:9; Philippians 2:12, 13). Good Fruits the Proof.--Man, fallen man, may be transformed by the renewing of the mind, so that he can \"prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\" How does he prove this? By the Holy Spirit taking possession of his mind, spirit, heart, and character. Where does the proving come in? \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\" A real work is wrought by the Holy Spirit upon the human character, and its fruits are seen.",
