    "word": "No advice of sanction is given in the Word of God to those who believe the third angel's message to lead them to suppose that they can draw apart. This you may settle with yourselves forever. It is the devisings of unsanctified minds that would encourage a state of disunion. The sophistry of men may appear right in their own eyes, but it is not truth and righteousness . . . . The children of God constitute one united whole in Christ who presents His cross as the center of attraction. All who believe are one in Him. Human feelings will lead men to take the work into their own hands and the building thus becomes disproportionate. The Lord therefore employs a variety of gifts \n                                                                           231\nto make the building symmetrical. Not one feature of the truth is to be hidden or made of little account. God cannot be glorified unless the building, \"fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord\" (Ephesians 2:21). A great subject is here comprehended, and those who understand the truth for this time must take heed how they hear and how they build and educate others to practice.
