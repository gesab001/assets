    "word": "In establishing the work in new places, economize in every possible way. Gather up the fragments; let nothing be lost. The work of soul-saving must be carried on in the way that Christ has marked out. He declares, \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" [Matthew 16:24.] Only by obeying this word can we be His disciples. We are nearing the end of this earth's history, and the different lines of God's work are to be carried forward with much more self-sacrifice than has yet been manifested.--Idem, pages 239, 240. \n\n[464]",
