    "word": "God wants his people to place their feet on the eternal rock. The money that we have is the Lord's money; and the buildings that we erect with his money for his work, are to stand as his property. He calls upon those who have received the truth not to quarrel with their brethren, but to stand shoulder to shoulder to build it up, not to destroy.",
