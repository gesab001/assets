    "word": "VI to Direct, Not Dictate \nDo Not Lord it Over God's Heritage \n     I have been shown that there is one practice which those in responsible places should avoid, for it is detrimental to the work of God. Men in position should not lord it over God's heritage, and command everything around them. Too many have marked out a prescribed line which they wish others to follow in the work. Workers have tried to do this in blind faith, without exercising their own judgment upon the matter which they have in hand. If those who were placed as directors were not present they have followed their implicit directions just the same.",
