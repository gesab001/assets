    "word": "Christ has laid the only foundation on which we can safely build. \"Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" Build on this foundation. On doing this depends your present peace and happiness, and your future well-being. Be careful how you build. Do not bring to the foundation material represented in the Word of God as wood, hay, and stubble. Do not bring your own inventions into your character-building. These are perishable, and will be consumed. Do not put human wisdom in the place of Him who is the Light of the World the Sun of righteousness, our peace and assurance forever.",
