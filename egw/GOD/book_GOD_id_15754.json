    "word": "The matter of presenting true principles of health and temperance must not be passed over as unessential; for nearly every family needs to be instructed on this point. Nearly every person needs to have his conscience aroused to become a doer of the Word of God, practicing self-denial, and abstaining from the unlawful indulgence of appetite. When you make the people intelligent concerning the principles of health reform you do much to prepare the way for the introduction of present truth. Said my Guide, \"Educate, educate, educate.\" The mind must be enlightened, for the understanding of the people is darkened. Satan can find access to the soul through perverted appetite, to debase and destroy it.--Letter 1, 1875.",
