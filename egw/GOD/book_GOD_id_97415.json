    "word": "When Christ bowed on the banks of Jordan and offered up prayer to heaven, it was in our behalf that He prayed. And as He prayed, the heavens were opened, and the glory of God like a dove of burnished gold rested upon Him, while from the highest heaven was heard a voice, saying, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\" (Matthew 3:17). This is heaven's pledge in behalf of humanity. Christ's prayer was offered for us. We are accepted in the Beloved. What an incentive this should be to us to strive earnestly and perseveringly to please our Saviour, to live so that He shall not have died for us in vain!",
