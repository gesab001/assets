    "word": "But Bro. Abbey is in danger of taking upon himself burdens which others can and should bear. He should not wear himself out in doing those things which others, whose time is less valuable, can do. He should act as a director and superintendent. He should preserve his strength, that with his experienced judgment he can direct others what to do. This is necessary in order for him to maintain a position of influence in the Institute. His experience in managing with wisdom and economy is valuable. He is in danger of separating his interest too much from his family, and becoming too much absorbed in the Health Institute, and of taking too many burdens upon him, as my husband has done. My husband's interest for the Health Institute, Publishing Association, and the cause generally, was so great that he broke down, \n                                                                           35\nand has been compelled to retire from the work for a time, when, had he done less for these institutions, and divided his interest with his family, he would not have had a constant strain in one direction, and would have preserved his strength to continue his labors uninterrupted. Bro. Abbey is the man for the place. But he should not do as my husband has done, even if matters are not in as prosperous condition as if he devoted his entire energies to them. God does not require my husband, or Bro. Abbey, to deprive themselves of social family enjoyment, and divorce themselves from home and families, for the interest even of these important Institutions.",
