All who have died in the faith of the third angel\u2019s message come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God\u2019s covenant of peace with those who have kept His law. \u201cThey also which pierced Him\u201d (Revelation 1:7), those that mocked and derided Christ\u2019s dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of His truth and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory and to see the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient.",
