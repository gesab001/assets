We rejoice with you for the precious tokens you have of the Lord's blessing. Praise the Lord. O let us be encouraged. Let our hearts be filled with thankfulness. Continue to work earnestly and interestedly and have perfect trust in God. Do not doubt his goodness. When difficulties seem to surround you, remember \n\n\n                            -13- \n\nthe promise that the Father is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him than parents are to give good gifts to their children. If God will only let his blessing rest on the workers, everything will work out to his glory, and souls will be converted. The Lord will acknowledge and bless all who walk before him in earnest, hopeful confidence. Look and live. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. He will draw near to each one who exercises faith, and labors courageously to advance the work because this is what God directs.",
