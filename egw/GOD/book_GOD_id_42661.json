    "word": "\"A new commandment I give unto you,\" Christ said, \"That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another\" (John 13:34). What a wonderful statement; but, oh, how poorly practiced! In the church of God today brotherly love is sadly lacking. Many who profess to love the Saviour do not love one another. Unbelievers are watching to see if the faith of professed Christians is exerting a sanctifying influence upon their lives; and they are quick to discern the defects in characters, the inconsistencies in action.",
