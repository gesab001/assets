    "word": "Wise and Holy Words--When the Lord's voice calls, \"Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\" the Divine Spirit puts it into hearts to respond: \"Here am I; send me.\" Isaiah 6:8. But bear in mind that the live coal from the altar must first touch your lips. Then the words you speak will be wise and holy words. Then you will have wisdom to know what to say and what to leave unsaid. You will not try to reveal your smartness as theologians. You will be careful not to arouse a combative spirit or excite prejudice by introducing controverted points of doctrine. You will find enough to talk about that will not excite opposition, but that will open the heart to desire a deeper knowledge of God's Word.-- 6T 325.",
