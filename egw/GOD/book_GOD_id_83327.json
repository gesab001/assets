    "word": "Moses descending from the holy mount, his face glorified by communion with God; the high priest reappearing from within the holy of holies; Isaiah fresh from beholding the Lord high and lifted up, the train of His glory filling the temple, never came to the people with truth greater or more precious than that which as messengers of God we have to bear to the people, the doctrine of the cross, the imputed righteousness of Christ. This comes to the people not in word only, but in the power of God to every one that believeth.",
