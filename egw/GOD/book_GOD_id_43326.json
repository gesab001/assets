    "word": "I greatly desire that you shall have a trustful mind, that you shall not depend upon your past confidence in God, but have a present, fresh faith, and maintain your confidence without wavering.  Your soul must daily be warmed and invigorated by the truth of the gospel, and you refreshed by a daily living and new experience.  I want you to have comfort and hope and joy in the Holy Ghost.  Never, never feel the slightest disturbance because the Lord is raising up youth to lift and carry the heavier burdens and proclaim the message of truth. -- Letter 14, 1891.",
