    "word": "I was at that time [early December 1850] in Paris, Maine. Old Father Andrews was very sick. For some time he had been a great sufferer from inflammatory rheumatism. He could not move without intense pain. We prayed for him. I laid my hands on his head and said, \"Father Andrews, the Lord Jesus maketh thee whole.\" He was healed instantly. He got up and walked about the room, praising God, and saying, \"I never saw it on this wise. Angels of God are in this room.\" The glory of God was revealed. Light seemed to shine all through the house, and an angel's hand was laid upon my head. From that time to this, I have been enabled to understand the Word of God.--Ms 135, 1903, pp. 1-3.
