    "word": "Impression, Wrong, Influence of.--I found Dr. B's wife in ----- in the same condition that Dr. A.'s sister is in. They said she was unable to eat anything but meat and that her blood was turning to water. But the light given me was, her impression that she must live on meat, was not correct. I was instructed that she was placing herself mentally in a position in which she should not be. If she would discard the use of meat for one year, the unfavorable position in which she now is would be changed, and there would be an opportunity for healthy action to take place in her system. She could, if she overcame her meat eating, be in a much better condition and live to glorify God.--Letter 231, 1905.",
