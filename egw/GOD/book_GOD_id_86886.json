    "word": "There should be a reform in our diet, both in the home and in the restaurants. With many health reform means nothing more than to live without the use of flesh-meat.

Because the foods are called health-foods and are appetizing, some think it proper to eat more than they should. God desires us to restrain our appetites. We should partake of simple food, and eat no more than the stomach can readily take care of.",
