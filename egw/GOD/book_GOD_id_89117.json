    "word": "MR No. 927 - Country Living\n\n     The Benefits of Country Living--It was not God's purpose that people should be crowded into cities, huddled together in terraces and tenements. In the beginning He placed our first parents in a garden, amid the beautiful sights and sounds of nature, and these sights and sounds He desires men to rejoice in today. The more nearly we can come in harmony with God's original plan, the more favorable will be our position for the recovery and the preservation of health.",
