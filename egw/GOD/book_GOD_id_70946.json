    "word": "Balaam, a Prophet Gone Wrong\n     God came to Balaam in the night, through one of His angels, and inquired of him, What men are these\n106\nwith thee? And Balaam said unto God, Balak the \u201cson of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying, Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt. . . . Come, now, curse me them. . . . And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them. Thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.\u201d The angel tells Balaam that the children of Israel are conducted under the banner of the God of heaven; and no curse from man could retard their progress.",
