    "word": "You who are slighting the offers of mercy, think of the long array of figures accumulating against you in the books of heaven; for there is a record kept of the impieties of nations, of families, of individuals. God may bear long while the account goes on, and calls to repentance and offers of pardon may be given; yet a time will come when the account will be full; when the soul\u2019s decision has been made; when by a person\u2019s own choice one\u2019s destiny has been fixed. Then the signal will be given for judgment to be executed.\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 165.",
