    "word": "As you study the Word, and allow the sanctification of the truth to mold your life, the Lord can make you an acceptable worker for Him. All who come together in church capacity should be among the Lord's army of workers. But if the natural traits of character are left unsubdued, in times of crisis, when strong, hopeful words are needed, words of discouragement and hopelessness will be spoken, that bring heavy burdens on the church. . . . Look constantly to Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of your faith. Walk humbly with God, and do not talk discouragement.--Letter 246, Aug. 13, 1908, to W. R. Strother.",
