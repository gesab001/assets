While probation is graciously granted to you, \n                                                                           30\ncome out from the world, separate yourselves from its customs, its maxims, and its influences, and put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof. At whatever cost or humiliation to yourselves, you must do this if you would inherit eternal life. \"This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. Unto the pure all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. They profess to know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.\"",
