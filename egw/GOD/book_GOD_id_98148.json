    "word": "There are periods when it is necessary to pass through strait places. But when sorely tried, do not place your trust in the arm of flesh, but in the living God. Have faith in the One who is by your side ready to tell you what steps to take in times of perplexity and trial. He has everything marked out, and if His people trust in Him He will reveal to them His power and glory.",
