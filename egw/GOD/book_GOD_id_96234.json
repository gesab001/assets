    "word": "God has manifested the most wondrous love for fallen man. He \n\n                                     -411- \n\n\"so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Those who are partakers of Christ's love through a reception of the truth will give evidence of this by making earnest, self-sacrificing efforts to give the message of God's love to those who are in error.",
