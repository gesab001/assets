    "word": "Daniel was brought to a test and he purposed in his heart that he would worship the true God, notwithstanding the decree. He here saw that principle was at stake and because of integrity he was cast into the lions' den. But here God did not forget him. All heaven had been watching his case, to see if he would be faithful to his God. When the trial came angels were his companions. They stopped the lions' mouths and delivered him. When the king saw the real object of the wise men, to rid Daniel of his power, then the king was wroth, and destroyed the enemies of Daniel.",
