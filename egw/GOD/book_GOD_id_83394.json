    "word": "Ever seek to exert a good influence, that God may approve of your works. Remember you are forming a character for heaven or for destruction. Oh, that you may form a good Christian character! You are daily stamping a record of your life by your course of action here. Let all your acts be such that you would not be ashamed to meet them in the judgment. God's eye never slumbers or sleeps. This all-seeing eye is ever upon you.",
