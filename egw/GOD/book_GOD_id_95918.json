    "word": "Please read Exodus 31:12-18. Could anything be more positive than this? The Sabbath of the fourth commandment is not to be hidden under a bushel. In all our sanitariums the light on this question is to shine forth. By our methods of work we are to exalt God's memorial and refrain from lessening the sacred, exalted character of the law of God. We are ever to acknowledge the binding claims of the Sabbath command before all believers and unbelievers. This, God declares, is a sign between Him and us throughout our generations forever.",
