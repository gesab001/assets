    "word": "If you seek the Lord with the whole heart, he will abide with you. But your temperament is such that it is hard for you to work in Christian union with your brethren. You have a great variety of negatives of your own creating, which, introduced into other minds, set in operation a train of thought opposed to the Lord's plan. Be careful how you drop into the hearts of your brethren the seeds of suspicion and questioning. It is not profitable to keep questions and suppositions as a stock in trade. Do not by your criticisms throw a mist over the path in which God desires to lead his people.",
