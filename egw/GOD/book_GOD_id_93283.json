    "word": "Then I ask, How can it be possible that those who love God and the truth will be truly estimated and kindly received by the world, who seeth not the truth because they see not and love not the Author of truth? \"He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Judas saith unto Him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world?\" Let everyone mark the answer, \"Jesus \n\n\n                                   -240- \n\nanswered and said unto him, If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth Me not keepeth not My sayings: and the word which ye hear is not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me\" [Verses 21-24].",
