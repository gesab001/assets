    "word": "The Lord encourages the trust of the most faulty and most perverse. He is able to restore His moral image to the soul, and is not slack concerning His promises. Christ went to the very depths of human extremities in order that He might meet men where they are and know how to befriend them in their need. He is our Friend, who has come to save us. Why are we not more diligent in learning of the great Teacher lessons of patience, kindness, forbearance? We may suppose that we have great provocation to feel injured, and to be angry with those with whom we associate, but we may be laborers together with God no matter what may be our circumstances. We may be sustained by faith, inspired by hope, that God in His goodness and mercy will deliver us from evil.",
