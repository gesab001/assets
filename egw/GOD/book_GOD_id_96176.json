    "word": "But now comes the need of divine wisdom to know how to speak a word in season and give personal labor to those whose minds have been wonderfully stirred up by the presentation of the Word in a new light. Abundant evidence has been given that the Holy Spirit of God has spoken to men through human agencies. For \"we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us\" [2 Corinthians 4:7]. Large numbers testify that they have never heard the Word administered with such power and in the manifest demonstration of the Spirit as at this meeting.",
