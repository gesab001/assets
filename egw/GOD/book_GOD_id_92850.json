    "word": "We are ambassadors for Christ, and we are to live not to save our reputation but to save perishing souls from perdition. Our daily endeavor should be to show them how they may gain truth and righteousness. Instead of trying to elicit sympathy for ourselves by giving others the impression that we are not appreciated, we are to forget self entirely, and if we fail to do this, through want of spiritual discernment and vital piety, God will require at our hands the souls of those for whom we should have labored. He has made provision that every worker is His service may have grace and wisdom, that they may become living epistles, known and read of all men.",
