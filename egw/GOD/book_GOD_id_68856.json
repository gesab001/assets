    "word": "Many mean to be Christians sometime, but do not want to make the start just yet. . . . Not only are you losing much yourselves in giving to the enemy the very best part of your lives, but you are bringing your children up in the neglect of eternal things. They have your example, all on the wrong side. Your neglect is robbing them of the very knowledge which God makes it your duty to give them that they may learn to love, reverence, and obey the requirements of God. . . .",
