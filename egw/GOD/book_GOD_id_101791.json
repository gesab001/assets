    "word": "The prayer of Paul for his brethren was that they might be filled with all the fulness of God. Those who are thus filled will never disappoint us or grieve the Spirit of God. They are more anxious to be rich in faith and abundant in experience than to possess the richest treasure that earth can give, for they have Christ in the soul as the well spring of life. And what then?--They reveal a fountain of inward piety, making it manifest that they have the mind of Christ, and that they live and breathe in a pure, wholesome atmosphere.",
