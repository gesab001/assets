    "word": "Christ spake as never man spake. To the multitude that listened to His sermon on the mount\u2014His lessons illustrated by things with which they were familiar\u2014the law of God, with its living, matchless principles, was brought home to their minds and consciences. Among the thousands who were converted in a day, after Christ had risen from the tomb and ascended to the Father, were the very ones who had heard and believed the words spoken on that occasion.",
