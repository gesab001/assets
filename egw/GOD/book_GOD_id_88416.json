    "word": "Show the Sinfulness of Sin, Then Show the Sinner the Saviour--Truth must be presented in regions beyond your immediate work, where the truth is unknown. The work specified in Isaiah 58:9-13 must be done. Sin is not to be cloaked as a matter of little consequence. It is to be presented as guilt against the Son of God, depriving Him of the glory that should be given Him. The exceeding sinfulness of sin is to be held before the people just as it is. Then show them the uplifted Saviour, telling them that immortality comes only through belief in Christ, through receiving Him as a personal Saviour. Immortality is found in Christ alone--Letter 10, 1899, pp. 6,7. (To J. H. Kellogg, January 14, 1899.)",
