    "word": "Brother Smith has fallen on the Rock, and is broken, and the Lord Jesus will now work with him. He took my hand as he left the room, and said, \"If the Lord will forgive me for the sorrow and burdens I have brought upon you, I tell you this will be the last. I will stay up your hands. The testimonies of God shall hold this place in my experience.\" It is seldom that Elder Smith sheds a tear, but he did weep, and his voice was choked with the tears in it.",
