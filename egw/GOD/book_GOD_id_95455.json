    "word": "June 15, 1892. The night has been long and trying. I lay awake from half past ten till half past two, so full of nervous pain that I could not rest. But I will not repine. \"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.\" I shall be glad when the days lengthen and the nights shorten. Constantly my petition is ascending to God for restoration to health, that while here in Australia I may bear my testimony to the people. But if the Lord has other plans for me, I am content. He knows what is for my good and the good of His people. He doeth all things well.",
