    "word": "How long will those who claim to believe the truth, ministers and people, work away from the light which the Lord has imparted for His people in these last days? How long will those who minister in word and doctrine stand apart from each other as independent branches, as though they were not all grafted into the same parent stock? The Lord will work if you prepare the way for Him by heeding the light He has given us. Ministers who are working in Battle Creek, for Christ's sake advance with the light, else the light that you already have will become darkness. We have no time to lose in counterworking the men whom God has appointed to do a certain work.",
