    "word": "John says, \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" No language can express this love; we can describe but a faint degree of love that passeth knowledge. It would require the language of the Infinite to express the love that has made it possible for us to be called the sons of God. In becoming a Christian, a man does not step down. There is no shame in having connection with the living God.",
