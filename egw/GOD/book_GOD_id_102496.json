    "word": "Propositions may be made by Dr. Kellogg and some in Africa regarding money matters, that are not to be accepted. These propositions will arrange for bonds and a party negotiation, the profits to be under the control of certain individuals who are not and have not been for some time under the control of the great Head. The word was spoken, Beware. Consider well before you use your pen to subscribe to any conditions which will place matters under the control of minds which are not guided by the Lord. Beware. You will have trials that you do not foresee. Arrangements may be proposed by the brethren in America and Africa that the Lord declares to be a snare. Leave yourselves wholly under the jurisdiction of the great Head. The Lord's cause is too sacred to be trifled with. In no case are His people to subscribe to conditions which will lead to endless perplexity, jealousy, evil-surmisings, suspicions and temptations. God declares, \"The gold and the silver is mine, from the first penny, to the last, and for the abuse or misappropriation of my money I will call men to account.\"",
