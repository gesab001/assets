    "word": "Christian Understanding.--Those who make the most of their privileges and opportunities will be, in the Bible sense, talented and educated men; not merely learned, but educated in mind, in manners, in deportment. They will be refined, tender, pitiful, affectionate. This, the Lord \n\n436 \n\nhas shown me, is what He requires of His people. God has given us powers to be used, to be developed and strengthened by education. We should reason and reflect, carefully marking the relation between cause and effect. When this is practiced, there will be on the part of many, greater thoughtfulness and care in regard to their words and actions, that they may fully answer the purpose of God in their creation.--MS 59, 1897.",
