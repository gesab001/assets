    "word": "Eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God, we become one with Him. Unity of purpose and harmony of action marks our work. This mutual love and confidence constitutes a moral force which is a convincing power to the world. When absolute homage is paid to the Word of God in matters of doctrine and principle, there will be no easy fellowship with the world. There will be no slipshod religion. When the Bible and the Bible alone is the rule of our faith and practice, the influence of our lives will have a telling power on the world.--Ms 177, 1899, p. 11. (\"The Medical Missionary Work,\" May 10, 1899.)",
