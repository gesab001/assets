    "word": "The associations chosen by the workers are determining their destiny for this world and for the next. Some who were once conscientious and faithful have sadly changed; they have disconnected from God, and Satan has allured them to his side. They are now irreligious and irreverent, and they have an influence upon others who are easily molded. Evil associations are deteriorating character; principle is being undermined. \"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.\" Proverbs 13:20.",
