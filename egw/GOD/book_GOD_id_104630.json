    "word": "Nothing can take the place of obedience to a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Knowledge that does not lead to a practice of self-denial and self-sacrifice, to a daily walk in the foot-steps of Christ, but rather to self-exaltation and self-sufficiency, is opposed to practical godliness. God calls for obedience.",
