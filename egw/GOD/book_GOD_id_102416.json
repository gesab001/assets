    "word": "The Physician who loves and fears God will need to make no outward display in order to distinguish himself: for the Sun of Righteousness is shining in his \n\n\n                                   - 58 - \n\nheart and is revealed in his life, and this distinguishes him. When men work in Christ's lines, they will be living epistles, known and read of all men. Through their example and influence men of wealth and talent will be turned from the cheapness of material things and lay hold on eternal realities. The greatest respect will ever be shown to the physician who reveals that he receives his directions from God. Nothing will work so powerfully for the advancement of God's instrumentality as for those connected with it to stand steadfast as His faithful servants.",
