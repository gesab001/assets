    "word": "Never Results in Starvation.--Never need anyone fear that observance of the true Sabbath will result in starvation. [Isaiah 58:11, 12; Proverbs 7:2; Isaiah 58:14.] These promises are a sufficient answer to all the excuses that man may invent for refusing to keep the Sabbath. Even if, after beginning to keep God's law, it seems impossible to support one's family, let every doubting soul realize that God has promised to care for those who obey His commandments.--Manuscript 116, 1902.",
