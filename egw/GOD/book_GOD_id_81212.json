    "word": "The cause of God should not be overlooked, that the poor may receive our first attention. Christ once gave his disciples a very important lesson on this point. When Mary poured the ointment on the head of Jesus, covetous Judas made a plea in behalf of the poor, murmuring at what he considered a waste of money. But Jesus vindicated the act, saying, \"Why trouble \n                                                                           10\nye her? She hath wrought a good work on me. Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached, in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.\" By this we are taught that Christ is to be honored in the consecration of the best of our substance. Should our whole attention be directed to relieving the wants of the poor, God's cause would be neglected. Neither will suffer, if his stewards do their duty; but the cause of Christ should come first.",
