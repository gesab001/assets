    "word": "Men today declare that Christ's teachings of God cannot be substantiated by the things of the natural world, that nature is not in harmony with the Old and New Testament Scriptures.

The word of the God of heaven is not in harmony with human science, but it is in perfect accord with His own created science.--Ms 117, 1898.",
