    "word": "To those who are laboring in the various branches of the Lord's work I would say: Let every one carry with him a sense of the sacredness of God's work. Let no one be satisfied with a shallow development of spiritual knowledge in the religious life. Let every soul seek for a reconversion. God calls upon men and women, beginners in the work and also those of long experience, to labor interestedly in an effort to do better and still better work, under the supervision of the divine Teacher.",
