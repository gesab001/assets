    "word": "Point after point of truth should be investigated; for there is no limitation to the truth of God, and in its study a most lively interest should be felt by both teachers and pupils, that they may know what God hath said. For years the voice of God has been saying to us, \u201cAgitate, agitate, agitate.\u201d Study every point of truth, that you may know for yourselves what is truth in distinction from error. Let students search for themselves, that they may \n56\nknow the deep things of God. Let this work be done in the Spirit of Christ. Put no restriction upon the students.",
