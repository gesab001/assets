They have become so devoid of spiritual discernment that they place the sacred and the common on the same level. The Lord is not honored in their hearts, and the principles of the religion of Christ are not woven in the character. They go through a cold, formal service that they call religion; but Christ is not formed within, the hope of glory. . . . \n                                                                           94",
