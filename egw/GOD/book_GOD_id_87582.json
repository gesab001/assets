    "word": "There was neglect anciently on the part of Israel. God established them in the land of Canaan and said, \"I will never leave thee nor forsake thee\" (1 Kings 8:57), but there was to be an aggressive warfare carried on between them and the inhabitants of the land. His words to Joshua were, \"And there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed\" (Joshua 13:1). This was a rebuke to them. God would have had this land filled with His own people who loved and feared Him, but to their shame the land was not taken up, and the idolatrous Canaanites were permitted to come in and gain strength, until God's name became less and less a power in their midst, and His glory less and less manifested with them.",
