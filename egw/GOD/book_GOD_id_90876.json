    "word": "But I dare not counsel our ministers and missionaries, who are continually moving from place to place, to encumber themselves by adopting children, especially helpless infants. Those who have children of their own must share the responsibility of training them to do service for God. It is the wife's duty to care for her children and her husband. The Lord will give her strength to do this work if she will put her trust in Him and obey the laws of life and health. And husband and wife are to unite in the work of bringing up their children in the love and fear of God.",
