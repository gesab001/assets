    "word": "The solemnity of living is not understood. Souls are lulled to sleep in the cradle of carnal security, and discern not the signs of the times, and the dangers that beset their path. They do not seek heavenly enlightenment day by day, that they may be guided into all truth, and may have clear discernment to pass unscathed through the intricate mazes of falsehood, deception, and iniquity which exist intense activity everywhere around us, within us. They go stumbling blindly along, not taking in the words of inspiration, \"What concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God.\" Then the conditions are plainly laid before us: \"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\" \n\n\n                          -8-",
