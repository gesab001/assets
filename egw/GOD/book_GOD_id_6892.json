    "word": "God went through the proud land of Egypt as He will go through the earth in the last days. With fire and tempest, earthquake and death, the great I AM redeemed His people. He took them out of the land of bondage. He led them through the \"great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought\" (Deuteronomy 8:15). He brought them forth water out of \"the rock of flint,\" and fed them with \"the corn of heaven\" (Psalm 78:24). \"For,\" said Moses, \"the Lord's portion is his people: Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him\" (Deuteronomy 32:9-12). Thus He brought them unto Himself, that they might dwell as under the shadow of the Most High.",
