    "word": "(John 3:21; Titus 2:11; 1 John 3:3; see EGW on 1 John 3:3-6;  4:7, 8.) Airing the Soul of Sin.--The Lord purifies the heart very much as we air a room. We do not close the doors and windows, and throw in some purifying substance; but we open the doors and throw wide the windows, and let heaven's purifying atmosphere flow in. The Lord says, \"He that doeth truth cometh to the light.\" The windows of impulse, of feeling, must be opened up toward heaven, and the dust of selfishness and earthliness must be expelled. The grace of God must sweep through the chambers of the mind, the imagination must have heavenly themes for contemplation, and every element of the nature must be purified and vitalized by the Spirit of God (MS 3, 1892).",
