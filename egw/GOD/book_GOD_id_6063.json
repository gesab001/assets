    "word": "A great responsibility rests upon us. We cannot render to God true service unless we present our bodies a living sacrifice. No one can be justified in marring this wonderfully intricate human organism. If we do this, not only do we suffer ourselves, but the evil is transmitted to our children. Can we wonder that the children who have such a legacy do not fear God? How often do we see boys not more than eight years old using tobacco! If you speak to them about it, they say, \u201cMy father uses it, and if it does him good, it will me.\u201d They point to the minister or the Sunday-school superintendent, and say, \u201cIf such good men as they use it, surely I can.\u201d How can we expect anything else of the children, with their inherited tendencies, while the older ones set them such an example? God pity the poor slave to these indulgences!",
