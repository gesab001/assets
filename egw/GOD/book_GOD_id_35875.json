    "word": "Not all members of the church are cultivating personal piety; therefore they do not understand their personal responsibility. They do not realize that it is their privilege and duty to reach the high standard of Christian perfection. . . .

The latter rain will never refresh and invigorate the indolent, who do not use the powers God has given them.",
