    "word": "When David saw the prosperity of the wicked, and he himself fail, he was tempted to doubt the existence of God; but he need not have done this, for it was he himself that separated his soul from God. God would never separate the soul from Him. The human agent needs to abide in Christ, and choose Him, and Christ will live in him. God should not be reproached for the backslidings of any. The warnings and instructions are given fully and abundantly in the Word, to guard the soul from peril. But the will must be placed on the side of God's will. No one will be kept who does not put his soul into God's keeping. The soul that feels his dependence, and trusts in One who is able to keep his soul, will not perish. - Manuscript 73, 1893. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. September 5, 1985.
