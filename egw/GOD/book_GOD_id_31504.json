Those lessons should be exemplified in the lives of Christians, so that in all the education and self-training of teachers and students, the heavenly agencies may not record of them that they are \"lovers of pleasures.\" This is the record now being made of a large number, \"Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.\" 2 Timothy 3:4.",
