    "word": "Our Duty Toward Our Neighbors. \n\n     Oh, that thousands more of God's people had a realization of the times in which we are living, and of the work to be done in field service, in house-to house labor! There are many, many of our neighbors who know not the truth. Let us become acquainted with them and seek to draw them to Christ. Entering the homes of our neighbors to sell or to give away our literature, and in humility to teach them the truth, we shall be accompanied by the light of heaven, which will abide in these houses. Our feet \"shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,\" we shall be prepared to go from house to house, carrying the truth to the people. Sometimes we shall find it trying to do this kind of work; but if we go forth in faith, the Lord will go before us, and will send His angels to co-operate with us in our efforts to bring our neighbors to a knowledge of the truth.",
