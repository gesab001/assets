    "word": "Every soul who obeys the first four commandments will obey the last six commandments, and make manifest what is the duty of man to his fellow men. He will manifest tender, pitying love toward everyone for whom Christ has died. He will consecrate himself to be a missionary, to be a laborer together with God. All who have the Spirit of Christ are missionaries; they derive zeal and energy from the Chief Missionary.--Letter 31, 1894, p. 16. (To Brother Harper, Sept. 23, 1894.)",
