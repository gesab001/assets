    "word": "Let us remember that we are to be tried by the laws of Christ's kingdom. We are not our own to do with ourselves as we please. We have been bought with a price, and the laws of Christ's kingdom, the ten holy precepts, present the standard that we are to reach. God is jealous of His law. He test every man, to see whether he will obey or not.",
