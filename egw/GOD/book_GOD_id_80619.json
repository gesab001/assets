    "word": "Nature sympathized with the suffering of its Author. The heaving earth, the rent rocks, and the terrific darkness, proclaimed that it was the Son of God that died.

The mocking and jeering of the chief priests and elders were hushed as Christ commended his spirit into the hands of his Father. The astonished throng began to withdraw, and grope their way in the darkness, to the city. They smote upon their breasts as they went, and in terror, speaking scarcely above a whisper, said among themselves, \"It is an innocent person that has been murdered. What if, indeed, he is, as he asserted, the Son of God?\"",
