    "word": "\"He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend\" (Proverbs 22:11). By faith we behold Him here and now. In our daily experience we discern His goodness and compassion in the manifestation of His providence. . . . The pure in heart see God in a new and endearing relation, as their Redeemer; and while they discern the purity and loveliness of His character, they long to reflect His image. They see Him as a Father longing to embrace a repenting son, and their hearts are filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory.",
