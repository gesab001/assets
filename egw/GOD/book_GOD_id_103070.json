    "word": "God sees our dangers, and knows the weight of our burdens. He remembers that we are in need of His strength, and (240) those who make Him their trust will be enabled to resist every temptation. We shall have enemies who will plot against us because they know not the value that God places on those whom He has chosen. But the Lord God knoweth them that are His. However misrepresented and misjudged these may be, if they walk humbly before Him, He will give them help in time of need. They may be compassed with discouragements, but He who knows what is the mind of the Spirit knows all who love Him, and He will honor them.",
