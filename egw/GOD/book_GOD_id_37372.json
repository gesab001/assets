    "word": "Members should be willing to work with their own hands to provide a church building.--Whenever it is possible, let our church buildings be dedicated to God free of debt. When a church is raised up, let the members arise and build. Under the direction of a minister who is guided by the advice of his fellow-ministers, let the newly converted ones work with their own hands, saying, \"We need a meeting-house, and we must have it.\" God calls upon His people to make cheerful, united efforts in His cause. Let this be done, and soon will be heard the voice of thanksgiving, \"See what the Lord hath wrought!\"--GW 432.",
