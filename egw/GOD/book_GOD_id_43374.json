    "word": "God Will Teach Us Our Duty \n\n     There are poor men and women who are writing to me for advice as to whether they shall sell their homes, and give the proceeds to the cause.  They say the appeals \n                                                                           99\nfor means stir their souls, and they want to do something for the Master who has done everything for them. I would say to such, \"It may not be your duty to sell your little homes just now; but go to God for yourselves; the Lord will certainly hear your earnest prayers for wisdom to understand your duty.\"  If there was more seeking God for heavenly wisdom, and less seeking wisdom from men, there would be far greater light from Heaven, and God would bless the humble seeker.",
