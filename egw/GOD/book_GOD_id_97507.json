    "word": "Brethren and sisters, it is time now that we were looking unto Jesus to see whether we are reflecting His image. It is time now that we put away everything that will grieve the Holy Spirit of God--divisions, dissensions, fault-finding, incriminations. God wants us to come to the light, that our light may shine forth in good works. Let the praise of God be in heart and voice.",
