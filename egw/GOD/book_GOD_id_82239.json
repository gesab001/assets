    "word": "Here are found the terms of a covenant that God desired to make with the children of Israel. If they would fulfill the pledge He asked of them, He would greatly bless them. He promised to honor them, to manifest His love and power upon them, and constantly to care for them, if they would comply with the conditions He asked of them. They were not merely to profess to worship God, but were to obey His voice indeed.",
