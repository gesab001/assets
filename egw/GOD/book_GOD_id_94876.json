    "word": "We are not to be ignorant of the prophecies. We are not to be wise in our own conceit, lest blindness come upon us, and we stumble and fall. If we are wise in this way, we do not represent the truth as it is in Jesus. We must look carefully, that we do not dishonor God by our unbelief. Amid the moral darkness light is to shine forth in clear, distinct rays.",
