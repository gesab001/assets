    "word": "The Spirit of the Lord is being withdrawn from the world. It is no time now for men to exalt themselves. It is no time for the people of God to be erecting costly buildings, or to be using the Lord's entrusted talent of means in glorifying themselves. Whatever we do we should do economically. The buildings we erect should be plain, without useless display. Let us beware of selfish greed.--Letter 103, 1904. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. July 19, 1984 Entire Letter Released",
