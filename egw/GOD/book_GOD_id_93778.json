    "word": "MR No. 1379 - An Early Vision; How To Be an Overcomer\n\n     (Written on Aug. 4, 1850, from Center Port, New York, to \"Dear Sister Arabella [Hastings].) \n\n\n     This is the first opportunity I have had to write you since we left you. We have been traveling just as fast as we could go since we left your place. We have not allowed ourselves time to rest or hardly time to sleep. We have felt that the King's business required haste, that what we did must be done quickly. God gave us a victorious time on our journey. The truth triumphed. I will not write the particulars of our journey, for you will have it in the paper.",
