    "word": "\"What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price; therefore, glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" This expression, \"Bought with a price,\" means everything to us.

Shall not that which He has redeemed be kept in as wholesome and pure and holy a condition as possible?",
