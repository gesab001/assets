    "word": "I have great confidence in her for this, although she has made no complaints to me. Yet the words and the attitude of yourself, as well as others, toward her was, to say the least, not cordial. If there is a woman that loves and fears God in South Lancaster, it is Sister Harris. If there is a woman I would fear to slight or offend, because it would grieve the Spirit of God, it is Sister Harris. And those who would speak against her in any way to affect your feelings toward her, had better be on their knees before God, and get all that feeling out of their hearts, and not draw from her, but come close to her, and show her sympathy and love. This changeable mood toward those who have been real pillars in the truth, I cannot see is bearing the divine stamp, and if we have much less of this spirit to change, we should change our feelings, because someone does not think us above making mistakes is a spirit that is not of Christ, and I mean to condemn it wherever I see it.",
