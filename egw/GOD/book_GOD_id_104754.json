    "word": "These statements, interwoven with other matter that professes to be from God, are misleading; many minds will eagerly seize upon them, and through false impressions will misapprehend our true position and work.

Thus fanaticism will take the place of well-regulated, well-disciplined, heaven ordained efforts to carry forward the work to its completion.",
