    "word": "When a soul is in peril, one who knows little of sympathy and has little of the meekness and lowliness of Christ, by unadvised words, may bruise where he should bind up, and fail to draw to Christ. They are likely to fail to give the words of tenderness and love that they should, to stand back in cold dignity, which is most hateful in the sight of God, and drive souls into the very snare that Satan has laid for their feet. Those who do this will have the blood of souls on their garments, because they obeyed the orders of Satan and disregarded the words of Christ.",
