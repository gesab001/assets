    "word": "Predictions \n\n     TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS AGO, WHEN MANY WERE PREDICTING THAT NATION SHOULD NEVER AGAIN LIFT UP SWORD AGAINST NATION, NEITHER SHOULD THERE BE WAR ANY MORE, LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE SISTER WHITE MADE THIS STARTLING PREDICTION: 'The tempest is coming, \n                                                                           11\nand we must get ready for its fury, by having repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord will arise to shake terribly the earth. We shall see troubles on all sides. Thousands of ships will be hurled into the depths of the sea. Navies will go down, and human lives will be sacrificed by the millions. Fires will break out unexpectedly, and no human efforts will be able to quench them. The palaces of the earth will be swept away in the fury of the flames. Disasters by rail will become more and more frequent; confusion, collision, and death without a moment's warning will occur on the great lines of travel. The end is near, and probation is closing.\"",
