    "word": "Gather the precious rays of light shining around you and focus them in one blaze upon the Word, and truths hidden from the casual reader will stand forth plainly and distinctly. All over the field of revelation are scattered grains of gold--the sayings of the wisdom of God. If you are wise you will gather up these precious grains of truth. Make the promises of God your own. Then when test and trial come, these promises will be to you glad springs of heavenly comfort. As you study the Word, it will become to you a wellspring of wisdom. Thus you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God.",
