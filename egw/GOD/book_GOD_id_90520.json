    "word": "Every son and daughter of Adam who is blessed with reasoning powers, has endowments and capabilities by which he may make progress. He may be elevated, ennobled, and sanctified, and hold converse with God. Heaven has manifested an intense interest in the work of developing the moral image of God in man. We must see the value that God has placed upon man. Human beings may come into possession of immortality, the life which runs parallel with the life of Jehovah. They may live as long as God lives. When we consider these things, we are filled with awe and reverence. It means very much to be a child of God, an heir of God, and joint heir with Jesus Christ.",
