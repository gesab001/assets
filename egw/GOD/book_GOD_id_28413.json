    "word": "However much a shepherd may love his sheep, he loves his sons and daughters more. Jesus is not only our shepherd; He is our \"everlasting Father.\" And He says, \"I know mine own, and mine own know me, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father\" (John 10:14, 15, RV). What a statement is this! The only-begotten Son, He who is in the bosom of the Father, He whom God has declared to be \"the man that is my fellow\" (Zechariah 13:7)--the communion between Him and the eternal God is taken to represent the communion between Christ and His children on the earth!",
