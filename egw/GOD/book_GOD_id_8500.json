    "word": "\u201cOf Every Man That Giveth It Willingly\u201d\nThe only means which God has ordained to advance His cause is to bless men with property. He gives them the sunshine and the rain; He causes vegetation to flourish; He gives health and ability to acquire means. All our blessings come from His bountiful hand. In turn He would have men and women show their gratitude by returning Him a portion in tithes and offerings\u2014in thank offerings, in freewill offerings, in trespass offerings.  5T 150497",
