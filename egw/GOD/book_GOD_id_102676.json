    "word": "God has spoken he has said that his work is one, that his workers are to keep in solid union. Even though men may sell themselves for a song, God continues to carry forward his work in his own appointed way in the light shining forth in the redemption of his people. Those who hold fast the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end will sing the song, \"We overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of our testimony.\" The work of truth will go forward in the hearts of the true seekers because God sees in them his own name and the word of truth magnified.",
