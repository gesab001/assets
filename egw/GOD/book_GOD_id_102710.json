    "word": "No selfishness is to be shown in this line of work. Every one is to work for the benefit of his fellow men. Unless men allow the Lord to guide their minds, untold difficulties will arise as God gives to different ones the knowledge of how to make health foods. When the Lord gives skill and understanding, let that one remember that this wisdom was not given to him for his benefit only, but that with it he might help others.",
