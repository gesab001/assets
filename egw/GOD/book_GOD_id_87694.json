    "word": "After the baptism, Christ went into the wilderness of temptation. It was here that He fought the great battle with His fallen foe. Satan tried every device to overcome the humanity of Christ. He claimed to be an angel direct from heaven. He clothed himself with angel robes, that he might, if possible, deceive the Son of God. And this is the way that he will come to \n\n\n                                  -234- \n\nthe tempted ones who are upon the earth now, hiding his real character in order to overcome them. But Christ withstood his temptations on every point. For forty days and forty nights He fasted, neither eating nor drinking. He did not do this because of any necessity on His own account, but for man. There was a mighty work for Him to achieve as the representative of the race. He was to pass over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell. By His resistance to temptation He was to work out a victory in behalf of the fallen race, and elevate man in the scale of moral value with God. Too few realize the importance that is attached to our having a living connection with God. It is our privilege to see, in this great victory gained for man, a hope that every one of us may overcome. Here was Christ on the field of battle, faint and hungry, almost dying under the long strain of warfare. But where was the hand that could be placed beneath His head? Where was the sympathizing breast upon which He could repose? He trod the winepress all alone, and of the people none were with Him. But angels from heaven came and ministered unto Him in His necessity. . . .",
