    "word": "The instruction the Lord has given me for the physicians in our sanitariums is: Do not suppose that your reception of visitors will give you influence or prosperity. You may make an effort to present an appearance which is not a true representation of the financial standing of the institution; but this will not give you influence. Modesty in poverty is much more commendable than an effort to keep up an appearance which is of no value to the institution. In order to have true success, our physicians must have a firm hold on God, ever moving onward and upward.",
