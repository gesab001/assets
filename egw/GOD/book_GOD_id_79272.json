    "word": "There have been times when a crisis has determined character. This has been again and again. When the time came for our institutions to receive new organization, the elements of character ruling men were revealed. Those who had not been in harmony with truth and righteousness, who did not bear the approval of God, strove to obtain the ascendency. But it was not the Lord's design that their voice, their decisions, should have influence in board or council meetings. The only way in which they can be a strength to the work and cause of God is by keeping quiet until they know whether they are on Satan's side or on Christ's.",
