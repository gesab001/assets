    "word": "What great need there is of cultivating tenderness and gentleness. None should be ashamed to manifest a tender, compassionate spirit for those who err; for those who think they make no mistakes, are far from being without fault before God. No one needs to think that the manifestation of compassion is something for which they need be ashamed, Thorough and decided reformation must be made that this hard, iron like spirit which has been so often and easily brought to the front and made manifest in words and measures that savor more of the attributes of Satan than of the Spirit of Christ, should be overcome. I have a message for the workers in both high and low position in the office to each one of them in their several departments. It is that unless the transforming grace of Christ conforms you to his character, you will never be numbered with the family of God in heaven. Now is the testing time. Angels of God are watching the development of character. \n                                                                           391\nAngels of God are weighing moral worth and nothing can make a man truly great in God's estimation except being truly good, being a partaker of the divine nature, escaping the corruption of the world through lust. The world's Redeemer demands that those who are called by his name, who claim to stand under his banner shall represent his character; Christianity is intensely practical. When Christianity is brought into the circumstances of actual life, it is a safeguard to the soul in all daily cares, perplexities, and annoyances, and then it is that the sympathy, tenderness, and gentleness of Christ is manifested in the deportment, and revealed in the character of those in whose heart God abides; and then it is that the kingdom of God comes in through his representatives into the world.",
