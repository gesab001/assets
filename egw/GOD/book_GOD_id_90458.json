    "word": "God is the great Husbandman. He will make everything in the lives of those who are laborers together with Jesus Christ, subservient to His great purpose of growth and fruitbearing. It is His plan, by conforming His servants day by day to the image of Christ, by making them partakers of the divine nature, to cause them to bear fruit abundantly. He desires His people, through actual experience in the truth of the gospel, to become true, solid, trustworthy, experimental missionaries. He would have them show results far higher, holier, and more definite than have been revealed in the last 15 years.",
