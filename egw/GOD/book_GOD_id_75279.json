    "word": "God is a God at hand, not afar off. \"Come unto me,\" said Christ, \"all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. O how differently from this have the men in Battle Creek felt and acted when consulted. They did not show the meekness and lowliness of heart manifested by the great Teacher and Saviour of men, but have shown, instead, a selfish superiority, an overbearing spirit. By this they showed that Jesus did not abide in their hearts. Thank the Lord, all are not of this spirit; but the conferences are fast being leavened with this self-righteous sense of superiority.",
