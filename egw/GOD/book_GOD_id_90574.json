    "word": "If a man will walk in the fear of the Lord, with perfect respect for all His counsels, the Lord will cause his influence to be felt. If, notwithstanding a dark outlook, man will choose the right instead of the wrong, the Lord will make multitudes to be at peace with him. As he sees the goodness of God in barring the way which would have led to embarrassment, he will give God the honor and glory due to His holy name.",
