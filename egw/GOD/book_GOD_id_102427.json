    "word": "The Tithe \n\n     The men connected with the institutions of God's appointment should be careful to acknowledge God in all their ways. They are to show that to Him they owe their intellect and all their capabilities. As did Abraham, they are to pay tithe of all they possess and all they receive. A faithful tithe is the Lord's portion. To withhold it, is to rob God. Everyone should freely, willingly, and gladly bring tithes and offerings into the storehouse of the Lord. In so doing he will receive a blessing. There is no safety in withholding from God His own portion.",
