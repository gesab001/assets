    "word": "Expression Strengthens Thoughts and Feelings.-- It is a law of nature that our thoughts and feelings are \n\n420 \n\nencouraged and strengthened as we give them utterance. While words express thoughts, it is also true that thoughts follow words. If we would give more expression to our faith, rejoice more in the blessings that we know we have--the great mercy and love of God--we should have more faith and greater joy. No tongue can express, no finite mind can conceive, the blessing that results from appreciating the goodness and love of God. Even on earth we may have joy as a wellspring, never failing, because fed by the streams that flow from the throne of God.--MH 251-253 (1905).",
