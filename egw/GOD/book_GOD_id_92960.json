    "word": "God has expressed His will. This will is not to be ignored, as has so often been done. God's servants are not to present for signature by their brethren agreements that will give one man the least authority for ruling over his fellow men. No such documents must be signed. No yoke that Christ has not framed is to be bound upon the necks of God's people. Let those who have been wearing yokes of human devising cast them aside at any cost, and take the yoke of Christ. This is the instruction that God has been given me for the past years and has been repeating the past few days.",
