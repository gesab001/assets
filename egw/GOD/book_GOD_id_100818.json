    "word": "\"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Christ \"was in the world, and the world was made by Him\"; but the world had sunk to such terrible depths of unbelief that when its own Creator came to it, it knew Him not. \"He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\" This grace is not inherited. \n                                                                           1019",
