    "word": "The Saviour is in communication with every part of His vast dominion. He stoops from His throne to listen to the cries of His children. His heart of love is filled with pity and compassion for them. But His greatest grief, I am instructed to say, comes when grief is brought to those whom He has appointed to do a certain work; when someone who does not understand the will of God urges his way in, to cloud judgment by many words. Months and years may be needed to undo the wrong wrought in the few minutes spent in speaking unadvised words.",
