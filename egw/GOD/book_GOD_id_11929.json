    "word": "Increased Light to Shine.--A spirit of pharisaism has been coming in upon the people who claim to believe the truth for these last days. They are self-satisfied. They have said, \"We have the truth. There is no more light for the people of God.\" But we are not safe when we take a position that we will not accept anything else than that upon which we have settled as truth. We should take the Bible, and investigate it closely for ourselves. We should dig in the mine of God's word for truth. \"Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.\" Some have asked me if I thought there was any more light for the people of God. Our minds \n                                                                           35\nhave become so narrow that we do not seem to understand that the Lord has a mighty work to do for us. Increasing light is to shine upon us; for \"the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\"--Review and Herald, June 18, 1889.",
