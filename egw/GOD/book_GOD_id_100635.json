    "word": "When you see to a man the necessity of putting self out of sight, of having an eye single to the glory of God, not thinking or consulting as to what the world will say, what the world will think, what motives they will attribute to our work, but following your Leader, keeping step with the Captain of your salvation, keeping your senses wide awake to catch His orders and to obey them to the letter, then, although you have not had experience your faith will lay hold on Jesus' power. With Him there is no danger of failure.",
