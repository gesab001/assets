    "word": "By kindness, by graceful behaviour, the messenger of the Lord is to give to the world an evidence of what the truth has done for his soul. The very grace of his words will be a convincing evidence; for the Lord will impress the human mind, and many will submit to the sweet influence of the Spirit of God. Angels of God will impress the minds with sacred truths.",
