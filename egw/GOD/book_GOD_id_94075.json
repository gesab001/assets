I wrote a twelve-page letter to Dr. Kellogg today. I am instructed to caution him to move guardedly, else he will surely lose his bearings. There are many perplexing questions coming up for decision, and he will need great wisdom in order to keep the way of the Lord. May God give him special grace.

I have \n\n\n                                    -297- \n\nurged him to remember that the Lord has greatly favored him. His experience will be governed by the dependence that he places upon the High and Holy One. I am afraid for Dr. Kellogg that he will follow unwise advisers.",
