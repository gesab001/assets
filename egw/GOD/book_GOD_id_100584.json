    "word": "Eld. Littlejohn is needed. His talent of intellect is of value, and his brethren can help him by showing that they appreciate his ability. It requires much labor and taxing thought to put to the tax the highest mental and moral abilities with which nature, study, and the word of God have endowed him. His success will be proportionate to his devotion and consecration rather than to his natural and acquired ability. Eld. Littlejohn should have a place in your counsels. The Lord has given him talents to use to his glory. If sanctified, his clear, strong judgment will be a great help in your deliberations. If he will connect with God, God can use him. But you will have to prepare his way if he works to advantage. If you show that you place little value on his time and labor, you cut him away from the work and discourage him from engaging in active service. This will be a loss to him and to the cause of God. \n                                                                           909",
