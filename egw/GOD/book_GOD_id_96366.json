    "word": "For this work there must be a deeper consecration. We must have all of Jesus, and none of self. Then there will not exist one selfish thought. With an eye single to the glory of God, we shall do good as we have opportunity. We shall give of our means as God has prospered us. We shall not take into consideration whether we ourselves are to be benefitted, but shall do all we can for the common good.",
