    "word": "You speak in your letter of discouragement. I felt to sympathize with you and would point you to the dear Saviour, the Burden Bearer. He will receive you, if you seek Him. \"Ask, and it shall be given you,\" are the words which fell from His divine lips. \"Seek, and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7). Claim the promise as yours. Do not seek to make yourself better and keep your eyes upon yourself, worrying and doubting the goodness and mercy of God.",
