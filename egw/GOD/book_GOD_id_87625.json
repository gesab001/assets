    "word": "God sent these self-sufficient ones messages of warning, but they would not heed them. He has been appealing to them by His Holy Spirit and by the testimonies, and yet they will not hear. He says to them, \"I counsel thee to buy of me gold, . . . white raiment, . . . and . . . eyesalve\" (verse 18). This is a purchase that will be of the highest advantage. He explains why He has sent earnest appeals, reproofs, warnings: \"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me\" (verses 19, 20).",
