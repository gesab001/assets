    "word": "I have a message to the people. Urgent calls are coming to me from all directions, but I am lying crushed, a cart beneath sheaves and I can but feel deeply over these things. \"It seems so strange that Sister White is laid upon a bed of suffering; why doesn't the Lord raise her to health?\" is the question.

I have just that confidence in my brethren that those who have had every evidence God saw fit to give them, that His spirit and power was with me, and yet turned from it all to walk in the sparks of their own kindling, and have shown a wonderful blindness, want of perception and knowing the things that be of God, and in their resistance to light and evidence in their choosing the darkness rather than the light, have virtually said, \"We do not want God's ways, but we want our own ways.\"",
