    "word": "Who is Christ?--He is the only begotten Son of the living God. He is to the Father as a word that expresses the thought,--as a thought made audible. Christ is the word of God. Christ said to Philip, \"He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father.\" His words were the echo of God's words. Christ was the likeness of God, the brightness of His glory, the express image of His person.",
