    "word": "Well, who is the true God? The God that created everything that is beautiful in nature. We are to look up through nature to nature's God. There we are to see the true God, the Maker of the heavens and the earth. The first four of these commandments show our duty to God, and the last six to our fellow men. We cannot break one of these first four and be in favor with God. Neither can we break one of the last six and be in favor with God. These we must urge upon the people.",
