    "word": "\"Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?\" Now just as though God that places you in this world could not carry you through this world. If you are diligent, if you are patient, if you try, if you do what is fitted for you to do, and are colaborers with God, He says, \"Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?\" God works for you all the time. God Himself is taking care of you. \"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory [could not be compared with one of these] was not arrayed like one of these.\" \n\n\n                                     -268-",
