For years God has been calling out people out of Battle Creek, and the instruction given me is that he will never counsel them to make Battle Creek an educational center. This is contrary to his plan. The whole field \n                                                                           13\nneeds to be worked; and the calling of our youth from all parts of the field to the Battle Creek Sanitarium, robs the field of its workers.",
