    "word": "Suspension From the Church for Adulterers. Those who break the seventh commandment should be suspended from the church, and not have its fellowship nor the privileges of the house of God. Said the angel, \"This is not a sin of ignorance. \n                                                                           249\nIt is a knowing sin and will receive the awful visitation of God, whether he who commits it be old or young.\"",
