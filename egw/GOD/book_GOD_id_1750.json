    "word": "Let us turn to the story of the paralytic at Bethesda. The poor sufferer was helpless; he had not used his limbs for thirty-eight years. Yet Jesus bade him, \u201cRise, take up thy bed, and walk.\u201d The sick man might have said, \u201cLord, if Thou wilt make me whole, I will obey Thy word.\u201d But, no, he believed Christ\u2019s word, believed that he was made whole, and he made the effort at once; he willed to walk, and he did walk. He acted on the word of Christ, and God gave the power. He was made whole.",
