    "word": "Money may be locked up in various ways. It is still money, but it is of no special benefit to anyone. But money wisely invested brings money in return, which may be used to gain more money. Thus it is with the householder's treasure--the Word of the living God. The use made of the gems of truth determines their value to the possessor. They are to be used to help and bless and save those for whom the Lord gave His only begotten Son. Then they are of the highest value to us, and in this way our talents increase constantly. We add jewel to jewel.--Manuscript 88, July 10, 1898, \"The Parable of the Householder.\"",
