    "word": "City Colporteurs Needed.--Books containing the precious light of present truth are lying on the shelves of our publishing houses. These should be circulated. Canvassers are needed who will enter our large cities with these books. As they go from house to house, they will find souls who are hungry for the bread of life, to whom they can speak words in season. Canvassers are needed who feel a burden for souls. You may say, \"I am not a minister. I cannot preach to the people.\" No, you may not be able to preach; but you can minister, you can ask those you meet if they love the Lord Jesus. You can be an evangelist. You can be God's helping hand, working as did the disciples when Christ sent them \n                                                                           24\nforth. Young men, young women, you are called by the Master to take up His work. There is a famine in the land for the pure gospel.--Manuscript 113, 1901.",
