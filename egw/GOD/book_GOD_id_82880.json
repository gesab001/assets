    "word": "In the night season I was taken from place to place, from city to city, in the Southern field. I saw the great work to be done--the work that ought to have been done years ago. We seemed to be looking at many places. Our first interest was for the places where the work has already been established, and for the places where the way has opened for a beginning to be made. I saw the places in the South where institutions have been established for the advancement of the Lord's work. One of the places that I saw was Graysville, and another [was] Huntsville. The Lord led in the establishment of these schools. Their work is not to be discouraged, but encouraged. They are to receive encouragement and support. Both of these places have advantages of their own. There has been delay in pushing forward the work in these places. Let us delay no longer. At these schools students may gain an education that, with the blessing of God, will prepare them to win souls to Christ. If they unite with the Saviour, they will grow in spirituality, and will be prepared to present the truth to others.",
