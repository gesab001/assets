    "word": "THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF A MOTHER\u2019S PRAYERS.\u2014Those who keep the law of God look upon their children with indefinable feelings of hope and fear, wondering what part they will act in the \n196\ngreat conflict that is just before them. The anxious mother questions, \u201cWhat stand will they take? What can I do to prepare them to act well their part, so that they will be the recipients of eternal glory?\u201d Great responsibilities rest upon you, mothers. Although you may not stand in national councils, . . . you may do a great work for God and your country. You may educate your children. You may aid them to develop characters that will not be swayed or influenced to do evil, but will sway and influence others to do right. By your fervent prayers of faith you can move the arm that moves the world.\u2014(Adventist Home, 264.)",
