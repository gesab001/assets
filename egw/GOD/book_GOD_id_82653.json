    "word": "Christ Speaks to Laodicea.--I understood that both these men were at the General Conference [held in Battle Creek, February 17 - March 6, 1893], that is, S and C. Could they not discern there the revealings of the Spirit of God? Could they not see that God was opening the windows of heaven and pouring out a blessing? Why was this? Testimonies had been given correcting and counseling the church and many had made a practical application of the message to the Laodicean Church, and were confessing their sins and repenting in contrition of soul. They were hearing the voice of Jesus, the heavenly Merchantman, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man \n                                                                           350\nhear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me\" (Revelation 3:20).",
