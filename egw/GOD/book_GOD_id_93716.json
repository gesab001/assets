Bollman, no date, copied Oct. 20, 1895.) \n\n\n     I have again read the letter which was sent to you, and I cannot find in it anything that needs to perplex you. We are not to be dependent on the world in a manner to compromise the truth; we are not to be bribed or to attain the world's favor by bowing to the laws of men and setting aside the law of God; we are not to be brought in bondage to the world; and yet we are in the world to live as long as God shall permit, and the Lord has given us a special work to do to save the world. He says, \"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever\" [Daniel 12:3].",
