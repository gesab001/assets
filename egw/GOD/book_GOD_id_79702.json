Keep your hands off. Educate every one who is drawing from Christ the streams of salvation. It is not necessary that the word of God should be disseminated only by a few ordained ministers. The truth must be sown beside all waters. . . . O if the people of God would but realize how great is their accountability, they would deny self, they would lift the cross, they would go everywhere seeking to save souls that are perishing. God has given this promise for our encouragement: \"He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\" [MS., 1894.]",
