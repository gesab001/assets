    "word": "For the benefit of future generations, Christ made plain the meaning of the precepts of God's law. Himself the author of this law, He proclaimed its immutability, declaring that while God's throne remained, His law would also remain. Not the least part of it would ever be annulled. \"One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\" In these positive terms Christ declares the immutability of the law. His words leave no room for doubt or evasion.",
