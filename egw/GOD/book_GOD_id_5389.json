    "word": "When you respect each other, you will respect Jesus Christ.  You are to show no preferences; for the Lord does not show preferences to his chosen ones.  He says, \"I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth:  but I have called you friends; for \n40\nall things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\" This is the confidence that the Lord would have you cherish in each other.  Unless you do this more than you have done in your past experience, you will not walk and work under the dictates of the Spirit of God.  God would have you united in pleasant cords of companionship.  As the Lord's workmen, you are to open your plans one to another.  These plans must be carefully and prayerfully considered; for the Lord will leave those who do not do this to stumble in their own supposed wisdom and superior greatness. . . .",
