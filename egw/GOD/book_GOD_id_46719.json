    "word": "David was distressed as he saw those who once seemed to have the fear of God before them, now in old age seemingly forsaken of God and exposed to ridicule by the enemies of the Lord. And why were they thus situated?

Their jealousy unrestrained sometimes burned into a flame, because all did not agree with their failing judgment.

And others were so controlled by their jealous, covetous feelings, as to destroy their own children.",
