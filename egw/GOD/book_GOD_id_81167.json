    "word": "You are dying spiritually. You understand not your perilous condition. The love of the world is swallowing up your religion. You must awake. You must seek God. You must repent of your backslidings. In contrition take words and return to the Lord. Your religious duties have become merely a form. You have not religious enjoyment; for this enjoyment is dependent upon willing obedience. The willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land. You do not possess a bright evidence that you will dwell with God in his kingdom. You occasionally engage in the outward performance of religious duties, but your heart does not engage in the exercise. You occasionally drop a word of warning to sinners, and in favor of the truth; but it is a reluctant service, as though rendered to a task-master, instead of the cheerful service of filial affection. If your heart is aglow with Christian zeal, the most arduous duties will be pleasant and easy.",
