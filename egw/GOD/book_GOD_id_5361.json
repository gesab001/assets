    "word": "How can God move upon the churches to contribute their hard earned means to be handled by men who are self-sufficient, selfish, and so arrogant and overbearing that the frown of God is upon them?  Our institutions need cleansing as did the temple when Christ was upon the earth.  Man lords it over men's consciences, man dictates to his fellow-men as God.  Everywhere throughout the field this spirit is leavening hearts with the same narrow and selfish purposes.  Reaction must come, and who shall then set things in order?  Jesus says, \"He that will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\"--Letter 65, 1895, pp. 7, 8 (June 19, 1895).",
