    "word": "If in the providence of God you have been given riches, do not settle down with the thought that there is no need for you to exert yourself, that you have enough to draw upon, and that you can eat, drink, and be merry. Do not stand idle while others are using their capabilities in an effort to obtain means for the cause. Invest your means in the Lord's work. If you are doing less than you should do in giving light to the souls perishing around you, be sure that you are incurring guilt by your indolence.",
