    "word": "When Adam came from the Creator\u2019s hand, he bore, in his physical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker. \u201cGod created man in his own image\u201d (Genesis 1:27), and it was His purpose that the longer human beings lived the more fully they should reveal this image\u2014the more fully reflect the glory of the Creator.
