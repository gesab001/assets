    "word": "Although they may profess the truth, yet if men pass along day by day with no living connection with God, they will be led to do strange things; decisions will be made not in accordance with the will of God.  There is no safety for our leading brethren while they shall go forward according to their own impulses.  They will not be yoked up with Christ, and so will not move in harmony with Him.  They will be unable to see and realize the wants of the cause, and Satan will move upon them to take positions that will embarrass and hinder.--Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 423.",
