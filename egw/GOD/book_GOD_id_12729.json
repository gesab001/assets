    "word": "Dear Sister Lons:  I am happy to have made your acquaintance, and have my heart linked with your heart, and also with the widow, Sister Brown. We have all three of us been left in widowhood, and we have been much blessed of God, in that He hath not failed us in our times of trial. He has been to us a present help in every time of need. There has been in our individual experience the proving of God--resignation under affliction, patience when tried most severely, and humble childlike reliance upon God.",
