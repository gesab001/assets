    "word": "Meeting Sabbathkeeping Problems \n\n     No Cause to Worry or Fear.--Often when our workers present the testing Sabbath truth to the people, some stand hesitating for fear of bringing poverty and hardship upon themselves and their families.

But these scriptures [Luke 12:1-7] teach us that the Lord knows all about our experiences; He understands about our inconveniences; and He has a care for all who follow on to know the Lord. He will never allow His children to be tempted above that they are able to bear.",
