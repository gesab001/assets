    "word": "Let your mind dwell on the goodness of God, on the great love wherewith He has loved you. If he did not love you, He would not have given Jesus to die for you. His everlasting arms are underneath you. In all your afflictions He is afflicted. Then lift your eyes to Him. When doubt would sweep over your soul, continue to look to Jesus, casting your helpless soul on Him. He ever liveth to make intercession for you. You are precious in His sight.",
