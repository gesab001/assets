    "word": "How Shall We Learn of Christ? \n\n     How shall we follow him to learn of him who is our Teacher? We can search his word, and become acquainted with his life and works. His words we are to receive as bread for our souls. In every sphere where man shall be placed, the Lord Jesus has left us his footprints. We do well to follow him. The Spirit by which he spake, we must cherish; we are to present the truth as it is in Jesus. We are to follow him especially in heart-purity, in love. Self must be hid with Christ in God; then when Christ who is our life shall appear, we also shall appear with him in glory.",
