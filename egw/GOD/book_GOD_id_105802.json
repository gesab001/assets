    "word": "In praying for the sick, we are to pray that if it be God's will, they may be raised up, but if not, that He will give them His grace to comfort, His presence to sustain them in their suffering. Many who should set their house in order, neglect to do it when they have hope that they will be raised to health in answer to prayer. Buoyed up by a false hope, they do not feel the need of saying words of exhortation to their children, parents, or friends, and it is a great misfortune. Accepting the assurance that they should be healed when prayed for, they dare not make a reference as to how their property should be disposed of, how their family is to be cared for, or express any wish concerning their matters of which they would speak if they thought they should be removed by death. In this way disasters are brought upon the family and friends. For many things are left unmentioned, because they fear expressions on these points would be a denial of their faith that should be understood. Believing that they will be raised to health by prayer, they fail to make use of hygienic measures that are in their power to use, fearing that it would be a denial of their faith. I thank the Lord that it is our privilege to cooperate with Him in the work of restoration, availing ourselves of all possible advantages in the recovery of health. It is no denial of our faith to place ourselves in the condition most favorable to recovery.",
