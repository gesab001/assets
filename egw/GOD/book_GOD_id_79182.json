    "word": "\"God calls upon all who claim the name of Christians to keep their eyes fixed upon the Author and Finisher of their faith. They are to act under the divine eye, to adopt the divine standard, to make God their counselor in all their proceedings. Selfish, cheap ideas, little, mean advantages, should not be allowed to steal in and mar the nobility of the principles that should control all the proceedings in temporal matters.",
