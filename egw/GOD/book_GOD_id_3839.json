    "word": "Among the people of God there is to be no dissension, no controversy, no warfare against one another. The forces of righteousness are to be a unit in their conflict with evil. All the strength of God\u2019s people is to be directed against the forces of the enemy. The will of every child of God is to be placed on the side of God\u2019s will. Satan\u2019s strong efforts against good, and the terrible hatred of his agencies against God\u2019s agencies, show the need of union and harmony among the forces of righteousness.",
