    "word": "When Christ comes to take vengeance on those who have educated and trained the people to trample on God's Sabbath, to tear down his memorial, and tread down with their feet the feed of his pastures, lamentations will be in vain. Those who trusted in the false shepherds had the word of God to search for themselves, and they find that God will judge every man who has had the truth and turned from light because it involved self-denial and the cross. Rocks and mountains cannot screen them from the indignation of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.",
