    "word": "\"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me\" [Matthew 16:24]. \"So shall he be My disciple.\" The Lord Jesus is to be your Pattern. No man is to please himself. I want you to know what the grace of Christ can do for you. I want you to speak sound words, with true, eloquent utterance. Serve the Lord Jesus Christ with the whole heart. God expects you to purify your soul from all defilement. True conversion means a radical change of heart.",
