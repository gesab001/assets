    "word": "The former owner of this property seems to be well pleased that we have secured it. And I believe that the price is very reasonable; for there are horses and carriages, a number of cows, and almost everything that we need to begin work. There is all that we need for the present. Now let us all take hold interestedly to make this school what the Lord would have it to be. We need to seek wisdom from God, who has so wonderfully blessed us in preparing this place for our use.--Ms 59, 1909. (Talk, September 13, 1909).",
