    "word": "Many truths necessary to be known are hidden like precious ore in mines which must be diligently and perseveringly worked in order for the precious treasure to be discovered. Truths essential for us to know lie too deeply buried to be discovered by unaided human reason. God speaks to our senses in His created works. \"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handywork\" [Psalms 19:1]. The soul enlightened by inspiration can see the greatness and power of God in His created works.",
