    "word": "In looking upon the professed followers of Christ you see great deficiencies in the church, in families, and individuals: but you cannot make one soul clean. We must look to our High Priest, who ever liveth to make intercession for us. Thank God that human agents are not constrained to wear the official breastplate. Jesus is able to bear it. He is able to bear all your burdens. You are invited to cast all your care upon Him. He will be your counselor, your everlasting support. The enemy is working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness: but you must gird yourself with Christ's righteousness, and tell your experience that others may be benefited. Suffer not this or that event, the want of piety in professors, the lack of godly work in those connected with the cause of God confuse and startle you. You have the word of God, take it, believe it, plant your feet upon it, and you will find it is solid rock. In Christ you may stand firmly. \n\n\n                                    -11-",
