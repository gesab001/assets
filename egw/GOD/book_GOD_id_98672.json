    "word": "We are living amidst the perils of the last days. We are wisely to cultivate every mental and physical power; for all are needed to make the church a building that will represent the wisdom of the great Designer. The talents given us by God are His gifts, and are to be used in their right relation to one another, so as to make a perfect whole. God gives the talents the powers of the mind; man forms the character.",
