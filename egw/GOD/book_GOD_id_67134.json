    "word": "God's love and mercy are ever extended toward sinners. Shall men who themselves have sinned against God, refuse to forgive and accept a repentant sinner? . . . God loved us while we were yet sinners. How clear and unmistakable the line of duty is made by the words, \"As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise\" (Luke 6:31). . . . Only those who walk with Christ can be truly merciful.",
