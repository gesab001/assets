    "word": "From the commencement to the close, this chapter is full of precious lessons of instruction. We are to make the Bible the man of our counsel, and instead of taking from it that which we think will sustain us in our own opinions, we are to see in it the lessons of instruction God has given for us. There is truth for us in this Word, and that truth we must dig for as for hidden treasure.",
