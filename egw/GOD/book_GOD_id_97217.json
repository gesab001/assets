    "word": "In the midst of mirth, feasting, and forgetfulness of God, the command will go forth for the sword of the Lord to be unsheathed, that an end may be put to the insolence and disobedience of men. The prayers of God's people have ascended, \"It is time, O Lord, for Thee to work; for they have made \n\n\n                                    -224- \n\nvoid Thy law.\" These prayers will erelong be answered. When men pass the limit of grace, God must let the world see that He is God.",
