    "word": "They Know How to Help Others \n\n     The aged standard-bearers in the cause of God are far from being useless.  The men who have held the beginning of their confidence steadfast unto the end are not to be accounted second or third in the work of God. They are not to be cast aside as having outlived their usefulness.  God has an important part for them to act in His work.  By learning of Christ they have obtained a rich experience.  When they have made false steps, they did not refuse to be corrected.  When they wandered from the path that Christ trod, they allowed Him to lead them once more into it.  Thus they have learned to help others.  -- Ms 92, 1903.",
