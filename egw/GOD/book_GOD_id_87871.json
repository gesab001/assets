    "word": "I have been shown that sleepless vigilance is the price of safety. The truth is still the truth. Not a peg of the principles of our faith have been moved, or will be moved. Even though you and many others apostatize and turn from the precious light that has come to our world, you will not make truth error. Men will arise as they have done to impair confidence in the faith once delivered to the saints. \"Of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them\" (Acts 20:30). I tell you in the name of the Lord, that you will be of this party, just as surely is Canright and others have been, unless you receive the warnings and entreaties of the Spirit of God, and fall on the Rock, and are broken.",
