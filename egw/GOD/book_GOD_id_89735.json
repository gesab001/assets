    "word": "The truth is to be proclaimed in all places, and the human agents are to be co-laborers with Christ, building up a wall of security about the children, and cutting off as far as possible the strong current of evil. Parents who are thoroughly converted will seek the salvation of their children, training them to be sons and daughters of God. In doing this work in wisdom they are co-laborers with God. The responsibility of parents is great, and one father and mother converted makes Satan tremble, for he sees he will lose their children from under his control. The children of Christian parents are placed in their arms with the divine command, \"Take these children and train them for Me.\" Give these youth special attention, and surround them with hallowed influences; teach the father and mother, as well as the children, to let no harsh words proceed from their lips, but let the precious lessons of \n\n\n                                     -15- \n\nJesus' love be given from babyhood to childhood, and from childhood to youth. The influence of Christian example will surround them like a holy atmosphere. The words that fall from the lips, the ear hears and the heart receives for good or for evil. Parents have a solemn, responsible work, for wise management from the earliest years forms the framework of the children's characters.",
