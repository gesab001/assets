    "word": "Show that you believe in God. Self-will indulged will drive to infidelity. Self subdued will lead to the submission of thought, word, and action to Christ. The Word of God, not impulses, not impressions must be your guide. A solemn, sacred work is this, to preach the truth for these last times to perishing souls. Take the things God has revealed in warnings, reproofs, corrections, encouragements. But if we have eyes that see not, ears that hear not, and hearts that feel not, then it is in vain that the declaration from God has ever come to us.",
