    "word": "As you ask the Lord to help you, honor your Saviour by believing that you do receive His blessing. Mutual love between you and your Saviour will enable you to do His will against every opposing element. When you have a plain \"Thus saith the Lord\" for your course of action, He will sustain you. Cherish a spirit of kindness and affection for your children, but in your love for them do not lose sight of the requirements of God. Do not evade His claims.",
