    "word": "The Lord will not hold guiltless those who are deficient in doing the work that He requires at their hands--in seeing that the church is kept wholesome and healthy spiritually, and doing all their duty in allowing no neglect which will bring the threatened curse upon His people. A curse is pronounced upon all who withhold their tithe from God. He says: \"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house.\"",
