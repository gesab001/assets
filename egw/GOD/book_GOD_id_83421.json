    "word": "And if we are channels of light we can be helps to those who desire to walk in the light. If we have the true light we cannot keep it to ourselves, but will be ever seeking out others to whom to impart it. We must search the Scriptures in order to be enabled to discharge our duty aright. It is our duty to perfect a Christian character, and when such character is formed then our example will tell on the Lord's side. As children of God we should wait and learn what the Lord says to us, and thus we shall receive the needed blessing to enable us to do our duty. And thus we shall lay up treasures in heaven.",
