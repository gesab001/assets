    "word": "Every father and mother is to be a laborer together with God. The parents and children form a family firm, and whenever possible they should be kept together. Let not parents allow words of scolding to spoil their influence. To belong to the family firm should be regarded as a sacred privilege. Let the children be patiently and kindly restrained from evil. This restraint, ministered with mercy and tenderness, exercised intelligently, will be a constant school for the children. There are different temperaments in the family, and it is often necessary to let patience have her perfect work. Children from such homes will be a blessing to the school.",
