    "word": "Those newly come to the faith are to be instructed from the Word of God, line upon line, precept upon precept. They are to be taught to seek wisdom from God, to go for help to the Source of all efficiency that they may be strong, to be guided by the unerring Mind, that they may reach sound conclusions. All should be educated and trained to think for themselves, to seek guidance from God's Word.",
