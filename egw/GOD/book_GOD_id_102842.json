    "word": "Prospects \n\n     \"When the proposition to found a Seventh-day Adventist medical college began to be considered seriously, two or three years ago, it seemed an impossibility. The lack of means and men was apparent. The fulfillment of the promise, God shall supply all your needs, has certainly been verified to us. The very best apparatus, facilities, and appliances have been provided as needed, and we are not a whit behind the most up-to-date school as far as we have gone. Instructors have been provided \n\n\n                              -24- \n\nas required, and are conducting strong courses in every department of the college. Surely we might almost begin to walk by sight, but we shall not. What we do see and have seen certainly strengthens our faith to believe that we shall be able to provide whatever is necessary to make a strong, first-class medical college.",
