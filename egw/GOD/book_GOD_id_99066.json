    "word": "Oh, I love Him. I love Him, for He is my love. I see in Him matchless charms, and oh, how I want that we shall enter in through the gates into the city. Then shall every crown be taken off from every head and cast at the feet of Jesus our blessed Redeemer. He has purchased it for me; He has purchased it for you, and we shall acknowledged Him Lord of all. And we shall cast all our honor at His feet and crown Him Lord of all. We shall shout, \"Glory to God in the highest.\" I wish we would learn to praise Him more. \"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth\" God. I wish you would talk of it. I wish you would educate your hearts and lips to praise Him, to talk of His power and glory. I wish you would tell of His power. When you do it you are elevating your Saviour, and when you lift that standard up against your enemy he will flee from you. God help us to praise Him more and to be found faultless.--Manuscript 7, 1888.",
