    "word": "Throughout the history of God's people, great mountains of difficulty, apparently insurmountable, have loomed up before those who were advancing in the opening providences of God. Such obstacles to progress are permitted by the Lord as a test of faith. When [we are] hedged about on every side, this is the time above all others to trust in God and in the power of His Holy Spirit. We are not to walk in our own strength, but in the strength of the Lord God of Israel. It is folly to trust in man or to make flesh our arm. We must trust in Jehovah; for in Him is everlasting strength. The One who, in response to words and deeds of faith, made the way plain before His servant Zerubbabel, is able to clear away every obstacle devised by Satan to hinder the progress of His cause. Through the exercise of persevering faith, every mountain of difficulty may be removed.",
