    "word": "The Holy Scriptures were the essential study in the schools of the prophets, and they should hold the first place in every educational system; for the foundation of all right education is a knowledge of God.

As a book to discipline and strengthen the intellect, to ennoble, purify, and refine the character, it is without a rival.\"--Counsels, p. 422. \n                                                                           22",
