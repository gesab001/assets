    "word": "As God made Christ His messenger to the world, Christ has made all who claim Him as their Redeemer, to represent Christ in mercy, forgiveness, and pardon, to the world. Now, in every generation Christ has required that all who believe in His name should become His witnesses, bearing His message to the world, and expressing His character. All of us are pledged to do, in our individual instrumentality, for Christ, what Christ did in His human life here upon the earth as the Sent of God for the representation of the Father. All are to represent the goodness of God in His compassion and His love. They are channels of light, light bearers to the world. Graciously has the Lord made them partakers of the divine nature through Christ.",
