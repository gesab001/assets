    "word": "Evil Speaking a Misdemeanor--Notice these words: \"And let the peace of God rule in your heart.\" If you do this, a flood of words that have in them no virtue or goodness, will not pour from your lips. \"To the which also ye are called in one body, and be ye thankful. Let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.\"",
