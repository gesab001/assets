    "word": "With our deepest study and our broadest experience we shall never be able to describe heaven or our senses to comprehend it. All that is pure, all that is excellent and lovely is there. The possession of heaven is endless bliss, infinite glory, riches, and knowledge. The character of heaven is perfect love, holiness, peace. We know these things now only in part. \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him\" (1 Corinthians 2:9). It is the discipline imposed upon us all to walk by faith and not by sight.-- Letter 30, 1882, pp. 2,3. (To G. I. Butler, July 12, 1882.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. February 22, 1979",
