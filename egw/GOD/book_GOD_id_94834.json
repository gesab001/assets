    "word": "A work of reformation is to be carried on in our institutions. Physicians, workers, nurses, are to realize that they are on probation, on trial for their present life and for that life which measures with the life of God. We are to put to the stretch every faculty, every nerve and muscle, to bring saving truths to the attention of suffering human beings. This work must be carried on in connection with the work of restoring the sick. Then the work will stand forth before the world in the strength which God designs it shall have. The truth will be magnified through the influence of sanctified workers.",
