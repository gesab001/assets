    "word": "The words and actions of parents mold the characters of their children for this life and for the life to come. All will receive according to their works. When children are not diligently instructed to keep the way of the Lord, the enemy comes in to occupy the thoughts. God is forgotten. The deceiver takes control of the heart. Satan will stamp his image and principles upon the hearts of those who are not taught to obey God. Men and women transmit their characters, for good or evil, to their children and to their children's children. Curses are prepared for future generations by the doing of evil on the part of parents.--Ms. 33, 1900. (\"Unfaithful Shepherds,\" June 25, 1900.)",
