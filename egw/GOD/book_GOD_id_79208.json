    "word": "A. T. JONES--WHAT THIS SAYS IS: THAT GOD WILL BLOW ON ALL THE GAIN OF THE INSTITUTION UNTIL THIS THING IS CORRECTED. SO IT IS PERFECTLY PLAIN THAT YOU CAN NOT SPEND YOUR TIME MORE PROFITABLY THAN IN CORRECTING THIS THING. I HAVE NO CONDEMNATION FOR ANY OF YOU BRETHREN; BUT I DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO EXPLAIN ALL AWAY, AND EXCUSE YOURSELVES WHEN THIS IS READ, COMING UP TO DATE. BECAUSE IF THINGS ARE ALL CORRECT HERE, THEN THIS TESTIMONY HAS NO PLACE HERE AT ALL.",
