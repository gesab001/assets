    "word": "Much more needs to be brought before the church, which will be a test of character; and our acceptance is not on our own merits, not on our own capabilities, but on our acceptance of light, which cometh from God and worketh with us to regulate our conduct toward God in complete sanctification of our own mind and our own will by the infallible standard. The expression of His character is in the positive declaration of His law. \"Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints. Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name?\" (Revelation 15:3, 4).",
