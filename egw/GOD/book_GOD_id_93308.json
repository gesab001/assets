    "word": "I saw there had been considerable feeling with you and others in Vermont about the brethren coming West. You have not felt right about the matter. I saw that the greater work would be West. Many fields have not yet been visited that should be. It is true that many of those that have moved have not answered the design of God. God directed them to go, but not to do as they have done. After they were West, they should have lived out their faith; but they have acted like drunken men. But God is working for them. They see their sin and error, and are laying their possessions upon the altar, and preparing to labor for God.--Letter 2, 1851. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Jan. 22, 1988. Entire Letter.",
