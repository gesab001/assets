    "word": "(Chs. 22:4; 26:11.) Saul Deluded and Deceived.--Saul had an abundance of energy and zeal to work out an erroneous faith in persecuting the saints of God, confining them in prisons and putting them to death. Although his hand did not do the work of murder, yet he had a voice in the decisions and zealously sustained them. He prepared the way, and gave up the believers of the gospel into hands that took their lives. In reference to his zeal Paul himself says, I was \"exceedingly mad against them.\" \"I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both \n\nmen and women.\"",
