    "word": "MR No. 250 - Pure Doctrine Elevates and Ennobles\n\n     In our character-building, each person is responsible for the way in which he builds. We are to lay on the foundation stone material that will do honor to God. There are many in our work who teach speculative theories, rather than the simple truths which Christ taught. Every one will be tested, to see whether his conversion is real. The pure doctrines that are taught in working faith, the gold, silver, and precious stones that are brought to the foundation, will elevate and ennoble the receiver. But the teaching which is mingled with human philosophy can never sanctify.",
