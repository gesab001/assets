    "word": "Every Dollar Is Needed.--The end of all things is at hand, and God calls for men to come into active service and do their duty because He desires it and the world needs their help. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit men will become discreet in the outlay of means and will expend it according to the greatness and importance of the work which is to be done. . . . The Lord God of heaven calls upon men to put away their idols, to cut off every extravagant desire, to indulge in nothing that is simply for display and parade, and to study economy in purchasing garments and furniture. Do not expend one dollar of God's money in purchasing needless articles. Your money means the salvation of souls. Then let it not be spent for gems, for gold, or precious stones. . . .",
