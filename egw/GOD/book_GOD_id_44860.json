God is not with such a man, and you cannot with any safety hold onto him. An atmosphere of unbelief surrounds his soul. The comparisons he has made have led him to double-dealing. He says to himself,\"If such a one received such a sum, I should receive just as much.\" He becomes wise above what is written in the law, and appropriates means for his own use. Thus he robs the treasury. God looks upon this as He looked upon the sin of Achan. He sees that such men cannot give the right mold to the work. They cannot supply the necessities of those who are laboring in hard fields, who have to give part of their wages to the needs of these fields. God sees every such case, and He will pass judgment on those who thus measure themselves, selfishly taking care that they receive all they think they should have.--Manuscript 97, 1899.",
