    "word": "The Bible religion has been regarded by those who profess to believe the truth, as one influence among many others to act a part upon the human agent. The only correct position is to regard it as the one influence over all others. We should constantly ask ourselves, \"Is this the way of the Lord?\" \"Am I in all my words and all my actions treating God, my sovereign Ruler, as supreme? and do I love God with all my heart, with all my mind, and with all my soul, might, and strength, and my neighbor as myself?\" If the Bible truth were carried into every-day practice by those who teach the truth to others, they would represent Christ in the home life. There would be earnest work done, and souls would be given them as the reward of their ministry. Where the individual himself is wanting \n\n\n                        -24- \n\nin practical appreciation of the truth, God cannot administer to sin, he cannot co-operate with the man who is not a doer of his word.",
