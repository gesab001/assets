    "word": "There are solemn and important decisions to be made at this meeting, and God wants every one of us to stand in right relation to Him. He wants us to do a great deal more praying and a great deal less talking. He wants us to keep the windows of the soul opened heavenward. The threshold of heaven is flooded with the light of God's glory, and God will let this light shine into the heart of everyone who at this meeting will stand in right relation to Him.",
