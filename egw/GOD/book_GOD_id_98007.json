    "word": "God longs to have you reach after Him in faith. He longs to have you expect great things of Him. He longs to give you understanding in temporal as well as spiritual matters. He can sharpen the intellect. He can give tact and ingenuity. All that we have God gave us, and in return He expects us to lay ourselves at His feet. He will accept this offering, and will sanctify every power of mind and body.",
