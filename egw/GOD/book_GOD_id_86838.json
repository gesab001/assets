    "word": "MR No. 567 - Christ Expounded Old Truths\n\n     The Bible presents beautiful truths that all may understand, and at the same time it deals in deep mysteries and doctrines, which will require deep thought to understand. But nothing is to be misinterpreted, misapplied, or weakened as lightly inspired, if inspired at all. God does nothing by halves. His Word is inspired. And God designs that men shall take the Scriptures as His inspired Word, and any man that shall venture to distinguish between the portions of God's Word, exalting one and belittling another, and taking away from another, places himself in a dangerous position.",
