    "word": "Nature, Lessons From, Contrast of Nature and Man in Obedience to God.--These words [from] Zechariah 7:11-14, quoted in preceding paragraph are very impressive. The Lord calls upon dew and rain and the varied agencies of nature, and they obey His call, to be used either in blessings or in judgments. They are under His control. Inanimate nature is represented as being shocked at man's disregard for God's word. God calls for famine and plague and pestilence, for calamities by sea and by land to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The things of nature spring in response to the word of God to do His bidding either in wasting and destruction or in mercies and blessings.",
