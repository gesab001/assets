    "word": "In enjoining the importance of cleanliness upon the Hebrews, God did not design to exhibit his arbitrary power, by giving those definite commandments; but, knowing that the physical and spiritual prosperity of his people depended upon their conforming to natural laws, he compelled obedience to them, and showed, by the penalty he attached to those laws, the great importance with which he regarded them. If men do not obey the requirements of God they must expect to suffer in consequence. Those who inhale a deleterious atmosphere do it at the risk of health, and even life itself. But they who not only incur this danger themselves, but cause others to be exposed to the injurious effects of an impure atmosphere and unhealthy surroundings, are doubly reprehensible in the sight of God.",
