    "word": "I need not tell any of you that it is so, because you know it. Not one of us needs to feel a doubt as to where we are, or to think, \"I wish I knew where I stood before God,\" but, by living faith, we must sink ourselves in God; and when we do that, His life will shine upon us. There is not a particle of need of our being in a state of inefficiency and coldness. What is the matter with us? \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" It shall be given him. There are no \"ifs\" nor \"ands\" about it. \"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering\" (James 1:5, 6).",
