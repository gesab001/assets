    "word": "This great purpose had been shadowed forth in types and symbols. The burning bush, in which Christ appeared to Moses, revealed God. . . . The all-merciful God shrouded His glory in a most humble type, that Moses could look upon it and live. So in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, God communicated with Israel, revealing to men His will, and imparting to them His grace. God's glory was subdued, and His majesty veiled, that the weak vision of finite men might behold it. So Christ was to come in \"the body of our humiliation\" (Philippians 3:21, R.V.), \"in the likeness of men.\". . . His glory was veiled, His greatness and majesty were hidden, that He might draw near to sorrowful, tempted men.",
