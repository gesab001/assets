    "word": "Ministers of Jesus Christ should stand as reprovers to those who fail to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. When in a family or company composed mostly of Sabbathkeepers, if conversation is introduced, calculated to lead to conversation upon worldly things, it should be kindly rebuked. A spirit of devotion to God should be encouraged upon His sanctified, holy day. We should not feel as much at liberty to occupy God's holy sanctified time \n\n\n                                     -303- \n\nin an unprofitable, useless manner than we should any of the days of the week given to us. It is not pleasing to God to sleep off a greater portion of sanctified, holy, honorable time. While doing this, we are not honoring our Creator. By this example we testify the six working days are too precious for me to stop and rest. I must make money. I must not take even the allowance of sleep my physical wants require, I will make it up on the Sabbath, for that day is given to me as a rest day. I will not tax myself by attending meeting, but will rest, for I need rest.",
