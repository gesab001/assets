    "word": "It would be wrong of me to leave home to make another trip to take up the taxing labor of attending camp meetings. During the last four months I have worked to the extent of my power, and I would not dare to venture on another campaign unless the Lord said, \"Go.\" The light I have is that W. C. White and I shall devote our time and best energies to placing before the people the light God has given me. My writings must be gotten out as fast as possible. W. C. W. must remain with me, and we must labor earnestly to get the light before the people. This work must no longer be interrupted.",
