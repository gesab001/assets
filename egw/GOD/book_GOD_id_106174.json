    "word": "As has been stated before, wrong actions were taken in regard to \"The Gospel Primer.\" Certain selfish men in positions of responsibility took a decided course in the wrong direction, and Elder Olsen allowed them to follow this course. Thus was done a work which demanded restitution. This work robbed the Southern field of the means which God designed should go to it; and this money, both principal and interest, should be refunded. Not one penny of the money used in the publication of \"The Gospel Primer\" should have been charged against it. This should have been given as a donation. And the other books that shall be prepared for the Southern field should be published gratuitously.",
