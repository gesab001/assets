    "word": "Calamities to Increase.--He who remains true to principle will never be left by the Lord to become weak and corrupted. Let all who live in this age, even in the year 1900, remember that they are surrounded by the perils of the last days. The whole world, with all its iniquity, is passing in review before God. I am instructed by the Lord to warn our people not to flock to the cities to find homes for their families. To fathers and to mothers I am instructed to say, Fail not to keep your children within your own premises.--Ms 81, 1900.",
