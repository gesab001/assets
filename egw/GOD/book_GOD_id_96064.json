    "word": "Are not these subjects of sufficient moment to present to the people? Will not our people take their Bibles and study them, and see that their eternal interests are at stake? \"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\" \"Inasmuch as ye have done it,\" and, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not.\" Thus will the cases of men and women be decided. In that great day all will see that their course of action decided their destiny. They will be rewarded or punished according as they have obeyed or violated the law of God. In that great day the character of each individual will be plainly and distinctly revealed. God will look into all the feelings and motives. No one can then occupy middle ground. Men and women are either saints or sinners, either entitled to a glorious life of eternity, or doomed to eternal death.",
