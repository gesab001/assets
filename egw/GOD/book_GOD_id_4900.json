    "word": "Pre-natal Influences.--God had an important work for the promised child of Manoah [Samson] to do, and it was to secure for him the qualifications necessary for this work, that the habits of both the mother and the child were to be carefully regulated. \"Neither let her drink wine or strong drink,\" was the angel's instruction for the wife of Manoah, \"nor eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.\" [Judges 13:14.] The child will be affected for good or for evil by the habits of the mother. She must herself be controlled by principle, and must practice temperance and self-denial, if she would seek the welfare of her child. Unwise advisers will urge upon the mother the necessity of gratifying every wish and impulse; but such teaching is false and mischievous. The mother is by the command of God himself placed under the most solemn obligation to exercise self-control. \n                                                                           233",
