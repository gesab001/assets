    "word": "Some in Vermont are deceived in regard to Brother Buck. God does not acknowledge him as his servant to labor for the salvation of his fellowmen. He has long been a hindrance to the cause of God by his lack of consecration. He has so long suffered self to rule and has been controlled by a passionate and willful spirit that he is weak, too weak to help others. Unless there is a thorough reform on his part, God will not use him in His cause. His life has not been elevated, his expressions have been rough and unbecoming a Christian. His influence has not been good. He has been too ready to dictate. He has been making efforts to reform yet he has not taken all the stumbling \n\n\n                                    -421- \n\nblocks out of the way. He has spoken against this matter and that, and expressed himself very hard against them, and has not made thorough work to undo what he has done. When he makes clean work in the sight of God, then the church will know it. God sees not as man seeth. Only those who are holy without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, will Jesus present to His Father. God's work requires clean instruments, pure vessels. \"Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord\" [Isaiah 52:11].--Letter 3, 1864. (To Brother Czechowski, circa 1864.) \n\nReleased October 26, 1978.",
