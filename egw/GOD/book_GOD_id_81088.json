    "word": "Bro. Stone has not at all times acted in accordance with his faith. He has not heeded the testimonies of the Spirit of God, but has opened to the school a door whereby they could connect with the world. He might be a useful man if he would overcome his self-indulgent disposition. He has some excellent qualities. His talent for music might be a power for good, if held as God's gift and consecrated to his service. But it has been the means of leading him and others into friendship with the world, and has done more harm than good. The Lord has spoken to Bro. Stone in reproof and encouragement. Will he obey this voice from Heaven, or will his associates and habits prove too strong for him. He must give an account for his talents, whether they have been used to glorify God or to please himself and others who had not the fear of God before them.",
