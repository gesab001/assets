    "word": "I am deeply concerned about you and your prosperity. No man's prosperity can be built up on the ruins of truth. I entreat you for your soul's sake, no longer to dishonor God. Your heart is not satisfied. He who loveth silver shall not be satisfied with it. He who says to the pure gold, \"Be thou my confidant,\" may for a time appear to prosper, but he will sooner or later find that he has pierced himself through with many sorrows.",
