    "word": "Those who refuse to accept Christ's invitation to wear His yoke of obedience and to learn of Him His meekness and lowliness, will not form characters that fit them to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. Before the universe such persons bear a direct testimony against Christ. They do their Saviour a great wrong. By their choice they reveal that they despise the great salvation which the heavenly Father has placed within their reach. They do not properly estimate the value that Christ has placed upon them. They fail of realizing that Christ has purchased them at an infinite cost. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
