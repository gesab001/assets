    "word": "It has been a necessity to organize union conferences, that the General Conference shall not exercise dictation over all the separate conferences. The power vested in the [General] Conference is not to be centered in one man, or two men, or six men; there is to be a council of men over the separate divisions. . . . In the work of God no kingly authority is to be exercised by any human being, or by two or three.--Ms 26, 1903, p. 1. (\"Regarding the Work of the General Conference,\" April 3, 1901.)",
