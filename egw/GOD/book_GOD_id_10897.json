    "word": "Personal Debt Not to Hinder Liberality \n\n\n     Some have not come up and united in the plan of systematic benevolence, excusing themselves because they were not free from debt. They plead that they must first \"owe no man anything.\" But the fact that they are in debt does not excuse them. I saw that they should render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. Some feel conscientious to \"owe no man anything,\" and think that God can require nothing of them until their debts are all paid. Here they deceive themselves. They fail to render to God the things that are His. Everyone must bring to the Lord a suitable offering. Those who are in debt should take the amount of their debts from what they possess, and give a proportion of the remainder.--1T 220.",
