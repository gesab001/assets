    "word": "Moss, Norway, [Wednesday] June 15, 1887. Again we are favored of God with a bright, beautiful morning. The birds are caroling their songs of praise to their Creator and our hearts are filled with praise and love to God for His great goodness and mercy to the children of men. Yesterday Sister Ings was in Christiania all day. I was looking for her return at night and the boat did not arrive till half past ten o'clock. I did not sleep until about midnight.",
