    "word": "Every soul must be regulated by the law of God. Compare everything you propose to do with the law of God. Ask, is this the way of the Lord? As a man looketh into a looking-glass to see the defects in his face, so he must view his character in the great moral looking glass, comparing his character with the law of God. If men would do this they would see more clearly the result of their course of action upon their own souls and upon the cause of God, and they would fear to take one step in the wrong path.",
