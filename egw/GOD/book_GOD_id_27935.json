    "word": "As with life, so it is with growth. It is God who brings the bud to bloom and the flower to fruit. It is by His power that the seed develops, \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear\" (Mark 4:28). And the prophet Hosea says of Israel, that \"he shall grow as the lily\" (Hosea 14:5). \"They shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine\" (verse 7). And Jesus bids us \"consider the lilies how they grow\" (Luke 12:27). The plants and flowers grow not by their own care or anxiety or effort, but by receiving that which God has furnished to minister to their life. The child cannot, by any anxiety or power of its own, add to its stature. No more can you, by anxiety or effort of yourself, secure spiritual growth. The plant, the child, grows by receiving from its surroundings that which ministers to its life--air, sunshine, and food. What these gifts of nature are to animal and plant, such is Christ to those who trust in Him. . . .",
