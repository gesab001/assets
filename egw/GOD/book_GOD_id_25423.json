    "word": "In the plan that God has for every Christian there are no nonessentials. There are lessons for each one to learn in the daily experience. Be patient, and perform faithfully the work given you, however humble it may be. Go about your work calmly, relying upon God for strength. Look not anxiously into the morrow. Today employ your time to the very best account. Today let your light shine for Christ, even in the performance of little duties. . . . The faithful performance of today's duties will prepare you to take hold of tomorrow's work with fresh courage, saying, \"Hitherto hath the Lord helped me\" (1 Samuel 7:12)! Ever stand as minutemen before God.",
