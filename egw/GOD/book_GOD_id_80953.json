    "word": "The same error has been committed in the tract and missionary work. The time and means given to perfecting and teaching so exact and complicated a system has been an injury to the cause of God. The tract and missionary work is a good work, and it was needful that the right way of working should be set before the people; but time, study, and taxing effort should not be given to this one branch to the neglect of other branches equally important. Matters have been carried to extremes. There has been too much mechanical working, and too little vital godliness; too much dependence upon human wisdom, and too little earnest seeking for divine aid.",
