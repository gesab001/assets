    "word": "Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He hath purchased with His own blood.

Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Acts 20:28-30.",
