    "word": "Work of No Human Author Is Perfect.--The work of no human author is perfect. The depth of human intellect may be measured. The richest mines of human production are not inexhaustible. But the highest, deepest, broadest flight of the imagination can not find out God. There is infinity beyond all that we in our own strength can comprehend: \n\n\n                                                  103 \n\nthe Holy Spirit must reveal Him to us. Many are too well satisfied with the surface truths of revelation. Precious gems of truth are passed by because their value is not seen.--ST, Dec. 22, 1898.",
