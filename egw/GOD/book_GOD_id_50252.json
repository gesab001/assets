    "word": "A close connection with God must be maintained by all our teachers. If God should send his Holy Spirit into our schools to mold and fashion the hearts, elevate the intellect, and give divine wisdom to the students, there are those who, in their present state, would interpose themselves between God and those who need the light. They would not understand the work of the Holy Spirit; they have never understood it; in the past it has been to them as great a mystery as were Christ's lessons to the Jews. The working of the Holy Spirit of God is not to create curiosity; it is not for men to decide whether they shall lay their hands upon the manifestations of the Spirit of God. We must let God work.",
