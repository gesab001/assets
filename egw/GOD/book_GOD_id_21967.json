    "word": "The law of God, from its very nature, is unchangeable. It is a revelation of the will and the character of its Author. God is love, and his law is love. Its two great principles \n467\nare love to God and man. \u201cLove is the fulfilling of the law.\u201d [Romans 13:10.] The character of God is righteousness and truth; such is the nature of his law. Says the psalmist, \u201cThy law is the truth;\u201d \u201call thy commandments are righteousness.\u201d [Psalm 119:142, 172.] And the apostle Paul declares, \u201cThe law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\u201d [Romans 7:12.] Such a law, being an expression of the mind and will of God, must be as enduring as its Author.",
