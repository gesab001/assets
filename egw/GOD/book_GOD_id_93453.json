    "word": "Jan. 3, 1890. A Perfect Saviour. Christ unites in His person the fullness and perfection of the Godhead and the fullness and perfection of sinless \n\n\n                                     -332- \n\nhumanity. He met all the temptations by which Adam was assailed, and overcame these temptations, because in His humanity He relied upon divine power. This subject demands far more contemplation than it receives. Christians strike too low. They are content with a superficial spiritual experience, and therefore they have only the glimmerings of light, when they might have far greater knowledge, when they might discern more clearly the wonderful perfection of Christ's humanity, which rises far above all human greatness, all human power. Christ's life is a revelation of what fallen human beings may become through union and fellowship with the divine nature. The more deeply we study the life and character of our Redeemer, the more clearly shall we see the Father as He is, full of goodness and mercy, love and truth.",
