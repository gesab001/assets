    "word": "We are ever to be thankful that Jesus has proved to us by actual facts that man can keep the commandments of God, giving contradiction to Satan's falsehood that man cannot keep them.

He had demonstrated that a lifelong obedience is possible.--Ms 1, 1892, pp. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8. (\"Obedience to God Required,\" November 15, 1892.)",
