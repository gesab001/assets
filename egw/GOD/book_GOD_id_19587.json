    "word": "With the Word of God in his hands, every human being. . . may have such companionship as he shall choose. . . . He may dwell in this world in the atmosphere of heaven, . . . drawing nearer and nearer the threshold of the eternal world, until the portals shall open, and he shall enter there. He will find himself no stranger. The voices that will greet him are the voices of the holy ones, who, unseen, were on earth his companions-- voices that here he learned to distinguish and to love. He who through the Word of God has lived in fellowship with heaven, will find himself at home in heaven's companionship.",
