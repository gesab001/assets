    "word": "\"If your will is united with Jesus Christ, we shall see the work of God advance steadily in this place. It will reach to Riverside; it will reach to other places that are all around. There is a work to be done in many little settlements round about here. There is no virtue in settling down in one place, and spending all your time and energies there. There are many towns and settlements \n                                                                           11\nwhere earnest work needs to be done for the saving of souls. You are to have an arm of strength in all these places. The word comes to you: Be wise; be vigilant.",
