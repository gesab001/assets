    "word": "Many, instead of consecrating their means to God\u2019s service, look upon their money as their own, and say that they have a right to use it as they please. Like the inhabitants of the Noachian world, they use God\u2019s gifts in their own service. Even some who profess to know and love the Lord do this. God has revealed His will to them. He has called upon them to surrender all that they have to Him; but the love of the world has perverted their will, and hardened their hearts. They refuse to obey Him to whom they owe all that they have. Regardless of His call, they clasp their treasures in their arms, forgetting that the Giver has any claim upon them. Thus the blessings given by God are turned into a curse, because a wrong use is made of them.",
