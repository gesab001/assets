    "word": "Take a Firm Stand in Harmony with Light \n\n\n     But selfishness has been cherished. High opinions of one's self will not give strength, but weakness. Guard the appetite, act intelligently, take a firm stand in harmony with the light God has given, and maintain your position. Many things that dishonor God have been practiced because of the perversity of the human heart. All who have a part to act in counsels, or in educating, should first show that they themselves have the true kind of education. Such an education will lead to practical results in the choice and preparation of food for the table.",
