You do not realize the positive necessity of having a close connection with Heaven, but not one of you is in a safe position before God; not one of you is qualified to do His work in a right manner without this connection. You need to have greater respect for sacred things. You will place sacred things upon a level with common things, and judge them accordingly, unless you change decidedly in some matters.",
