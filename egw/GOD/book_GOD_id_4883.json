    "word": "From every Christian home a holy light should shine forth. Love should be revealed in action. It should flow out in all home intercourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselfish courtesy. There are homes where this principle is carried out,--homes where God is worshiped, and truest love reigns. From these homes, morning and evening prayer ascends to God as sweet incense, \n                                                                           222\nand his mercies and blessings descend upon the suppliants like the morning dew.",
