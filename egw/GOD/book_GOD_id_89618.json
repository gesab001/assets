    "word": "The churches have been cherishing a spirit which God cannot approve; and unless they humble their souls before God and possess a different spirit, they will reject God's light and follow spurious light to the ruin of their own and many other souls. They must have the converting power of God to transform them. This power needs to come into your heart, my brother, and mold you over anew. You are passing a crisis in your experience, and are in great danger of self-deception.",
