    "word": "\"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" [Philippians 2:12, 13]. The quality of our works is shown by our words. When our words and works harmonize in Christ, we show that we are consecrated to God, perfecting holiness in His fear. As we give ourselves, soul, body, and spirit, to Him, He works in us, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.",
