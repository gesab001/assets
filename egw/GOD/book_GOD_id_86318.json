    "word": "I feel very sad in regard to Sister Henry's death. The light given me by the Lord was that He had a work for her to do among the W.C.T.U, and that her strength must not be absorbed among our people. She could do for the W.C.T.U. that which no other one in our ranks could do, and she must not allow our people to lead her to use her God-given capabilities upon them. The Lord would go before her in her work.",
