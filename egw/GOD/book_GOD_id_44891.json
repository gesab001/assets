    "word": "Deserters from the Army of the Lord \n\n     In severing his connection with the work of God in the office, Brother X has done just what I had feared he would do. Had he denied self, standing at his post in obedience to the will of God and because this is the work of God, putting his whole heart into the work and bearing its responsibilities and burdens as others have borne them before him, even though he should not gain as much financially as in business for himself--had he done this, he would have made it manifest that he was not a timeserver. But how great was his interest for the office, if he could step out when he pleased, when it appeared to be for his interest to do so? Ought the soldiers in \n                                                                           214\nChrist's ranks to act in this way? Should soldiers in the army of the nation do this, they would be treated as deserters, and how does the heavenly universe look upon such soldiers in Christ's army? No one who engages in the work of God with an appreciation of its sacredness, could turn from the work to secure any worldly advantages whatsoever.",
