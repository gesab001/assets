    "word": "Though called a \"Cushite woman\" (Numbers 12:1, RV), the wife of Moses was a Midianite, and thus a descendant of Abraham. In personal appearance she differed from the Hebrews in being of a somewhat darker complexion. Though not an Israelite,  Zipporah was a worshiper of the true God. She was of a  timid, retiring disposition, gentle and affectionate, and greatly distressed at the sight of suffering.--PP 383 (1890).",
