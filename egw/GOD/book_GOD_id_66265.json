    "word": "Chap. 4 - Walk in All Humility\n     My dear Brethren and Sisters, \n     I would address you who have come to a knowledge of the truth in Africa. You are young in the faith, and there is great need of your walking humbly with God, and of learning daily in the school of Christ by dwelling particularly in meditation and conversation upon the lessons which He gave to His disciples. Walk in all humility of mind, distrustful of self, seeking wisdom from the God of wisdom, that all your ways and methods may be in firm and close connection with the ways and the will of God, that there may be no confusion.",
