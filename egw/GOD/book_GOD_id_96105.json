    "word": "When the Lord sees that we will trust Him implicitly, He will work in our behalf, and we shall see the salvation of God. The Lord proves us, He tests us to see if we will make Him our only trust. We need a much sharper, keener faith than we now have. We need to constantly cultivate an earnest, living, trusting faith, and in cause and spiritual work keep our petitions constantly ascending, seeking the Lord for clear discernment. And sharp spiritual eyesight will be given every true seeker. Has not the Lord told us, \"Seek ye My face\"? And will we not individually respond, \"Thy face, Lord, will I seek\"? This is the call of God, and this the appropriate answer to that call. The Lord wishes us to know Him by an experimental knowledge as a kind, tender Father who has our interest and happiness in mind just as a loving earthly father cares for his children.",
