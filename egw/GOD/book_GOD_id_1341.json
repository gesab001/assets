    "word": "Teach Children to Pay Tithe and Offerings.--Not only does the Lord claim the tithe as His own, but He tells us how it should be reserved for Him. He says, \"Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase.\" This does not teach that we are to spend our means on ourselves and bring to the Lord the remnant, even though it should be otherwise an honest tithe. Let God's portion be first set apart. The directions given by the Holy Spirit through the Apostle Paul in regard to gifts present a principle that applies also to tithing. \"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.\" Parents and children are here included.",
