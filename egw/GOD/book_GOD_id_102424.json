    "word": "Exorbitant Fees \n\n     Honesty, integrity, justice, mercy, love, compassion, and sympathy are embraced in medical missionary work. In all this work the religion of the Bible is to be practised. The Lord does not want anyone to labor as His representative who follows the wrong customs and practice of worldly physicians in treating suffering humanity.

Often an exorbitant fee is charged for even small services, because physicians are supposed to be governed in their charges by the practices of worldly physicians. There are those who follow worldly policy in order to accumulate means, as they say, for God's service. But God does not accept such offerings. He says, \"I hate robbery for burnt offering.\" Isaiah 61:8. Those who deal unjustly with their fellow-men while professing to believe My word, I will judge for thus misrepresenting Me.",
