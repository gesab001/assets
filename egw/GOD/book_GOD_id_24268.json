    "word": "The minister of God must first drink of the living fountain himself if he would firmly and intelligently lead others to that fountain. If he would present those \n120\nfor whom he labors, perfect in Christ, he must himself be perfect. Divine power alone will reach and melt the sinner's heart, and bring him, a penitent, to Christ. Neither Luther, Melancthon, Wesley, Whitefield, nor any other great reformer and teacher, could of himself have gained such access to hearts as to accomplish the work that these men accomplished. But God spoke through them. Men felt the influence of a superior power, and involuntarily yielded to it.",
