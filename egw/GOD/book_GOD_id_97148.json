    "word": "Such responsibility! It is to represent the faith you possess. It is to stand in the integrity of our soul. If you will be faithful to God, self shall be crucified. Self shall die, and Christ Jesus shall live in us, and He shall be the hope of our calling. We will represent Jesus Christ to the world. Inquire sincerely, \"Am I a Christian?\" If I am a Christian I am looking unto Jesus, the Author and the Finisher of my faith. In Him my hopes of eternal life are centered.",
