    "word": "The Word of God is to be of supreme authority. The Lord says, \u201cMy covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.\u201d God could not change one tittle of His law without ceasing to be supreme. People cannot bend the law of God to suit their ideas, and, failing to bring it into harmony with themselves, they break its commands and violate its precepts. All too late the world will learn that they cannot judge the Word of God, but that the Word of God will judge them. Would that everyone would consider how foolish and how wicked it is to contend with God! Would that they would cease to oppose their will against the will of the Infinite! Those who oppose God will yet learn that in so doing they have forsaken the only path that leads to holiness, happiness, and heaven.\u2014Signs of the Times, Jan. 9, 1896.",
