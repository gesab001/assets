    "word": "Please read the invitation to the supper, and the last call made. Study to see what is being done to meet the command of Jesus. I can not understand why this indifference is manifested, why you should stand off, and criticize, and draw away. The gospel-net is to be cast into the sea; and it draws both good and bad. But because this is so, shall men and women ignore the efforts made to save those who will believe, and who will unite in the work of reaching that class of which Christ spoke in his rebuke to the Pharisees? Sinners and harlots, he said, go into the kingdom before you. Will you not see that even in the church there are those who have no connection with God? But Christ says, Let the tares and the wheat grow together until the harvest; then I will send my angel to gather out the tares and burn them, but the wheat will I gather into my barn.",
