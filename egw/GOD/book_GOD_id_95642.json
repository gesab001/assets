    "word": "We have been warned by Christ not to yoke up with unbelievers to be molded by their ways. If we do thus yoke up with them, it will not be surprising if the Lord permits us to be bitterly chastened; for we place ourselves in the way of temptation, and walk entirely contrary to the plainest directions of the Word of God. We must rely upon the Holy Spirit to change the heart. No human friend, however close the relation, can do the work of the Holy Spirit.",
