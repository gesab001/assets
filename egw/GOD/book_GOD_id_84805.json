    "word": "Said the angel, \"Those who do not gather with Christ scatter abroad.\" There is no such thing as a neutral position. Every one has influence and his influence tells for or against. Individuals have stood ready to oppose every step of advance of God's people as God in His providence has led them. And those who would venture out have their hearts saddened and distressed by the lack of union and action on the part of their ministering brethren.\"-- Letter 16, 1861. (To the church in Roosevelt, New York, and vicinity, circa 1861.)",
