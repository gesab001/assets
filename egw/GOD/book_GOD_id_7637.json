    "word": "Through trial and persecution the glory--the character--of God is revealed in His chosen ones. . . . They follow Christ through sore conflicts; they endure self-denial and experience bitter disappointments; but thus they learn the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with abhorrence. Being partakers of Christ's sufferings, they can look beyond the gloom to the glory, saying, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us\" (Romans 8:18).",
