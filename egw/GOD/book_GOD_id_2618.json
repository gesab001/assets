    "word": "In the councils of heaven it was decided that principles must be acted upon that would not at once destroy Satan\u2019s power, for it was His [God\u2019s] purpose to place things upon an eternal basis of security. . . . God\u2019s order must be contrasted with the new order after Satan\u2019s devising. The corrupting principles of Satan\u2019s rule must be revealed. The principles of righteousness expressed in God\u2019s law must be demonstrated as unchangeable, eternal, perfect.\u2014Manuscript 57, 1896 (Manuscript Releases, vol. 18, pp. 360, 361).",
