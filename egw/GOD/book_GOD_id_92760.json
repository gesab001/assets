    "word": "Holiness, which means wholeness to God, is wholly acceptable to God. A Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God giveth the increase. \"He that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting\" [Galatians 6:8]. As the workers till the soil, they are to reap all the advantages possible by making an application of the lessons they receive. In the natural world unseen agencies are constantly at work to produce the essential results, but the harvest to be reaped depends upon the seed that has been sown. After man faithfully prepares the land, and plants the seed, God must work constantly to cause the seed to germinate. \n\n\n                                   -7-",
