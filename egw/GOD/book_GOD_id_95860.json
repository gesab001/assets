    "word": "You ask me what you shall do, for so little help is given to that portion of the field where you are working. Trust it all to the Lord.

Send no statement of the situation through our religious papers because it will not be honored. Send direct to the people. God's ways are not to be counterworked by man's ways.

The Lord has not specified any regular channel through which means should pass.",
