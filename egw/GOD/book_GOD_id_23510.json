    "word": "29\nTHE TEN COMMANDMENTS REVEALED TO ALL IN THE SKY.\u2014Through a rift in the clouds, there beams a star whose brilliancy is increased fourfold in contrast with the darkness. It speaks hope and joy to the faithful, but severity and wrath to the transgressors of God\u2019s law. Those who have sacrificed all for Christ are now secure, hidden as in the secret of the Lord\u2019s pavilion. They have been tested, and before the world and the despisers of truth they have evinced their fidelity to Him who died for them.",
