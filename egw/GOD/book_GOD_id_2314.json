    "word": "An Old-fashioned Idea.--To train children to walk in the narrow path of purity and holiness is thought an altogether odd and old-fashioned idea.

They are ambitious to compete with their neighbors and to compare favorably, in the dress of themselves and their children, with the members of the church to which they belong.",
