    "word": "The message of God has been presented to the people with clearness and force; it is the very message which God means that His church shall have at this time. Your refusal to listen to it, your rejection of it, while it will not stop the work, will result in great loss to your souls. Every ray of light that God has given to His people is necessary for them in the emergency that is to come; but if the rays of heaven's light are not discerned, if they are not appreciated, accepted and acted upon, you will lose the heavenly benefit yourselves, and keep the light from others whom God designed should receive it through you.",
