    "word": "Unless those who claim to believe the truth for this time submit to the training of God on earth for the future life, they will never see the King in His beauty. . . . They must cultivate patience, kindness, meekness, goodness, sympathy, and tender compassion for one another. All their rough, uncourteous, un-Christlike disposition must be purged away, for none of these unkind attributes are of Christ, but after the satanic order. The pure, heavenly graces are received and flourish in mind, heart, and character only as man becomes a partaker of the divine nature.... Heaven must begin on earth for every soul who will enter the heavenly mansions above.",
