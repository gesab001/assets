    "word": "Appeal to Evangelize the Cities of America--I am weighed down by the thought that our people do not realize the responsibility resting on them to proclaim the truth in the unwarned cities of America. God says to them, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee\" (Isaiah 60:1). Why are such cities as New York left unwarned? Do not those who know the truth understand the commission of Christ? Why then do they feel no burden to add new territory to the Lord's kingdom, to plant \n\n\n                                -221- \n\nthe standard of truth in new places? Why do they not obey the word: \"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not\" (Luke 12:33). Why do they not return to the Lord His own, to be invested in heavenly merchandise? Why do not our people wake up to the peril threatening the men and women in the cities of America? Why are not our churches aroused, and why is there not an earnest call made for volunteers to enter the whitening harvest field? When I bear my testimony in person, I want to bear it where it will be appreciated, where it will be heeded, where I shall not be afflicted by those who are so spiritually backslidden that they make no effort to proclaim the truth for this time.",
