    "word": "This poor blind man has greater spiritual blindness than that which marks his temporal vision. Satan has manufactured most loathsome vagaries to present as truth. Should the Bible present any such ideas, well might infidels be justified in their unbelief. We warn all who may be brought under the influence of these few deluded ones, to not receive them into their houses, or to bid them Godspeed; for they are doing the work of Satan as verily as the arch deceiver himself.",
