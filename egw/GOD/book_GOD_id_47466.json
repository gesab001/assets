    "word": "9. God's Law Did Not Die.--The apostle Paul, in relating his experience, presents an important truth concerning the work to be wrought in conversion. He says, \"I was alive without the law once\"--he felt no condemnation; \"but when the commandment came,\" when the law of God was urged upon his conscience, \"sin revived, and I died.\" Then he saw himself a sinner, condemned by the divine law. Mark, it was Paul, and not the law, that died (4SP 297).",
