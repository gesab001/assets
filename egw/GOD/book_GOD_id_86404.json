    "word": "MR No. 462 - 1883 General Conference Session\n\n     I want to say, brethren and sisters, that this conference--the Bible studies and other meetings and all indeed connected with the conference--has been one of deep interest to me; and I feel very grateful to God that I have enjoyed these meetings as I never have any meetings of the kind before. I know that we have had the presence and the blessing of God in our midst. And as we are about to separate, and our ministers will go to their different positions of labor, the question arises, Shall we meet again? Shall all of us ever meet again in conference? Probably not. We may never all assemble in meeting again as we are here today.",
