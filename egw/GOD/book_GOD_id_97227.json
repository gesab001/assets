    "word": "God declares that He came not to destroy the law or the prophets. Why, if God could have changed or altered one precept of His law to meet man in his fallen condition, Christ need not have left the royal courts; He need not have laid off His kingly crown and royal robe, and yielded up His position as Commander in the heavenly court. He gave up all. For our sakes He became poor. Why? That we through His poverty might be made rich; that man should have another test of his loyalty and be brought back to obedience to the law of God. This infinite sacrifice was not to be made to immortalize sin.",
