    "word": "Many turn away from the light, offended because a word of caution is given, and ask, \"May we not do as we please with ourselves?\" Did you create yourselves? Did you pay the redemption price for your souls and bodies? If so, you belong to yourselves. But the Word of God declares, \"Ye are bought with a price,\" \"the precious blood of Christ.\" The Word of God tells us plainly that our habits are to be strictly guarded and controlled. \"Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\" Shall we do this? The Word of God is perfect, converting the soul. If we diligently heed its precepts, we shall be conformed, physically, spiritually into the image of God.
