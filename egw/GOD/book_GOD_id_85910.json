    "word": "\"Because ye are strong.\" Do not spend your time reading magazines and novels. Read your Bible. You have many temptations to meet and overcome. You have a great truth to proclaim. Only by a constant study of the word of God can you gain the strength needed for this work. Put novel-reading out of your lives. Let not the novels appear upon your table or in your bookcase. You have none too much time in which to gain an understanding of what saith the Scriptures. The Lord wants the young men in His cause to stand where they are worthy of being trusted with sacred responsibilities.--Ms 56, 1905, pp. 7, 8. \n\n\n                                     -283- \n\n(\"Lessons from the First Epistle of John,\" talk given at the General Conference, May 16, 1905.)",
