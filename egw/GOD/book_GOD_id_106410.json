    "word": "Parents must regard God's Word with respect, obeying its teachings. To the parents in this day, as well as to the Israelites, God declares: \"These words....shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.",
