    "word": "When Conscience Is a Sure Guide.--He whose conscience is a sure guide will not stop to reason when light shines upon him out of God's Word. He will not be guided by human counsel. He will not allow worldly business to stand in the way of obedience. He will lay every selfish interest at the door of investigation and will approach the Word of God as one whose eternal interest is hanging in the balance.--MS 27, 1900.",
