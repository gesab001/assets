    "word": "And lest man should be terrified with gathering clouds, and falling rains, . . . God graciously encourages the family of Noah by a promise. \"And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood. . . . And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations. I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. . . . And the bow shall be seen in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth\" (Genesis 9:11-16).",
