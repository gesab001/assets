    "word": "With the talent of speech we are to communicate the truth as we have opportunity. It should ever be used in God's service; but this talent is grievously abused. Words are spoken which do great harm. Christ declared, \"Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned\" [Matthew 12:36, 37].--Ms 21, 1899.",
