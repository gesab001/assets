    "word": "There must be greater devotion to the work, \n                                                                           15\nand an unselfish interest in it, if the Office be kept in a prospering condition, so that the blessing of God may attend the labor of each. The Lord needs not the services of those who have not the missionary spirit, a devotion to, and a special interest in, the work. This he has shown frequently, and again it was presented in a more clear and positive manner. God designs that all the workers in that Office shall be instruments of righteousness, workmen, living stones, that emit light, that they may encourage the presence of heavenly angels. They are required, as it were, to be channels through which the spirit of truth and righteousness shall flow. There should not be a spirit of messing together to the exclusion of some; a few attached to each other, conversing with one another, walking and associating together, and neglecting and slighting others. We are all one in Christ Jesus. Yet some who have labored in that Office have partaken so largely of the spirit and influence of the world, that they act like the world. They have their likes and dislikes, and discern not excellence of character. Their conduct is not governed by the pure principles of Christianity, therefore they think only of themselves, their pleasure, and enjoyment, to the disregard of others. They are not sanctified through the truth, therefore realize not the oneness of Christ's followers the world over. Those who are most loved of God are those who possess the least self-confidence, and are adorned with a meek and quiet spirit; whose lives are pure and unselfish, and whose hearts are inclined, through the abundant measure of the spirit of Christ, to obedience, justice, purity and true holiness. \n                                                                           16",
