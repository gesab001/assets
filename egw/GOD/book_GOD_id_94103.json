    "word": "Some took advantage of this confidence and made false statements; they committed forgery, robbery, and theft. They squandered the money taken for books, money that belonged to their employers, and several who carried on this business considered it a good chance for them, and laughed one with another over the matter. The arrangements entered into were those which showed not the slightest appearance of distrusting their honesty. This business arrangement was not supposed to be made with men of corrupt hearts and corrupt morals. But every one of these dishonest transactions is registered in the books of heaven, and there they will remain until the judgment, unless by confession, repentance, and restitution, they [i.e., \"men of corrupt hearts and corrupt morals\"] shall seek God to write pardon against their names.",
