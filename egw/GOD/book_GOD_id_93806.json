    "word": "No sin is so general as the sin of selfishness. It has hidden the Saviour from our view. It is a root of bitterness springing up whereby many will be defiled. Were this obstruction removed, we would realize why the Saviour was \n\n\n                                  -143- \n\nlifted up upon the cross in our behalf. I am so glad that the Holy Spirit can enable us to understand that we have been bought with a price. We are Christ's purchased possession, and we are not at liberty to allow the mind to become so engrossed with the things of this world that we seldom think of the marvelous manifestation of God's love. Christ claims the entire consecration of the whole being. When selfishness is cut away from our experience, what a change will be seen in our lives. We shall not then be at variance with one another. We will not forget that upon us rests the responsibility of rightly relating ourselves to God and to our Redeemer, who gave His precious life for us that we might not perish, but have everlasting life. Let us adore Him who is our life, our hope, our eternal happiness.",
