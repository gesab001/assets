    "word": "I saw that those who have an evil heart of unbelief will doubt, and will think it noble and a virtue to \n119\ndoubt the word of God. Those who think it a virtue to quibble can have plenty of room to disbelieve the inspiration and truth of God's word. God does not compel any to believe. They can choose to rely upon the evidences he has been pleased to give, or doubt, and cavil, and perish.",
