    "word": "We must learn to stand upon the principles of God's Word. \"To the law and to the testimony.\" We need the Spirit of God to enlighten us. \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\" Revelation 3:20. We want to let the Saviour into our hearts, give Him our best affections, and let the work go on of sanctifying and purifying the heart, and then we shall see the King in His beauty. Let us rely upon God and realize the great sacrifice that has been made for us, and we shall wear the crown throughout an endless eternity.--Ms 43, 1886, pp.. 1-5.
