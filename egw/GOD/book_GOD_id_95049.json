If one man should bear rule, and another man should \n\n\n                                     -347- \n\nbear rule, there would be collision. What shall be done? Each may claim as much authority as the other. The Lord has His messengers to whom He has given a special message. These messages point out God's way. There must be men who take a firm stand for God and for conscience. The course of action some will pursue will be no rule for those who take the Lord as their counselor. The man who fears God, who believes and practices the Word of God with high, unbending integrity of character, will make straight paths for his feet, that the lame be not turned out of the way.",
