    "word": "God made Adam after His own character, pure and upright. There were no corrupt principles in the first Adam, no corrupt propensities or tendencies to evil. Adam was as faultless as the angels before God's throne. These things are inexplainable but many things which now we cannot understand will be made plain when we shall see as we are seen, and know as we are known.",
