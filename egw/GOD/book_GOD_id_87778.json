    "word": "Healing for Consumptives.--Many who are threatened with consumption will be healed through faith. Many others will be healed through proper eating and drinking and through living largely in the open air. To those who are suffering from this disease I would say, Take regular exercise, and keep as cheerful as possible. Keep busy, and live as much as possible out-of-doors. Keep your heart free from all jealousy and evil-surmising, and ask God to help you to improve as fast as possible. Some will overcome the disease; yes, many will, through faith in the mighty Healer. \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me;\" the Lord says, \"and he shall make peace with Me\" (Isaiah 27:5).--Manuscript 4, 1905, pp. 3, 4. (\"The Prevention of Consumption,\" December 27, 1904.) \n\nWhite Estate October 23, 1979",
