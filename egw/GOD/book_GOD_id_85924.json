    "word": "Participated in Testimony Meeting \n     [Torre Pellice] Sabbath, April 24, 1886. I sought to impress upon my hearers the importance of meekness in opening the truth to those who are in darkness. There are too many who love to fight and they have not the meekness of Christ. This is a great work, and most solemn, and must be carried forward in great wisdom. Our words must be well chosen, our deportment of that character that will recommend the truth we profess, because of its sanctifying power upon our character. The Lord blessed me in speaking and the people in hearing. In the afternoon there was a social meeting. Good testimonies were borne, an evidence that the word spoken in the forenoon had been received and was making impressions upon hearts to the good of souls and to the glory of God.--Ms 62, 1886, p. 12.
