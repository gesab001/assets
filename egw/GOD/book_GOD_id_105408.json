    "word": "Granville, N. S. W. September, 1895 \nTo Men in Responsible Positions in Battle Creek \n\nDear Brethren: \n\n\n     You have no right to absorb in Battle Creek the means that is sent in by our people, and leave mission fields impoverished. The funds that accumulate in Battle Creek have not been created by those who handle the means. It is the faith of the people in the cause and work of God that has brought tithes and offerings to the treasury.",
