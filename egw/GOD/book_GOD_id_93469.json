    "word": "Faithfulness in the Christian Life. Many are included in the Saviour's message to the church at Laodicea. No man should keep his foot on the brake to hinder the advancement of the Lord's work. The time has come for the people of God to take their light from under the bushel, and place it where it will shine forth in clear, distinct rays. Let the Lord's workers go forward, and let those who would hinder, stand out of the way.",
