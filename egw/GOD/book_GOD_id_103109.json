    "word": "The time of respite granted us seemed short, too short, to open to the world the great and wonderful things of God's law. The promises of God -- how we laid hold upon them! We could not bear all the glory! Our physical strength left us, and the power of God, like a halo of glory was over us. What praises went up to God! \"Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.\" There was a tarrying time for us, but He, our Lord, knew the end from the beginning. It was no delay, and from year to year we worked and prayed and believed. The errors that were rushing in upon us, we met in the power of God, and explained them. And the glory filled the room where we were assembled.",
