    "word": "This practice of speaking critical words of others does not tend to soften the heart, but works to sever very friends, to discourage souls who are passing through trials and difficulties. Instead of discouraging them, they should have sought to have uplifted them with their sympathy, to have spoken goodly, encouraging words, and to have prayed with and for them that God would give them divine strength. God requires that we shall help to sustain the fainting, discouraged soul in the hour of temptation. Let everyone who professes to belong to Christ work along His lines and make straight paths for their feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way.",
