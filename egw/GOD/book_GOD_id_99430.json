    "word": "Some have started in wrong and will never make a success until they are thoroughly converted. And that which makes the situation of these more difficult is they do not feel the need of improvement in the very things where they are so deficient. I am seeking the Lord daily to know His will, that I may do it. It is not safe to follow our own ways or our own judgment. Every dollar which the Lord has sent us in trust is to be wisely invested, to tell to the very highest interest in the work and cause of God.",
