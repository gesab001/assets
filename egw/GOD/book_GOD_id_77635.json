    "word": "Should be Leaders \n\n     Seventh-day Adventists are handling momentous truths. On the subject of temperance they should be in advance of all other people. The question of how to preserve the health is one of primary importance. When we study this question in the fear of God, we shall learn that it is best, both for our physical health and for our spiritual advancement, to observe simplicity in diet. Let us patiently study this question. We need knowledge and judgement, in order to move wisely in this matter. Nature's laws are not to be resisted, but obeyed.--\"Medical Ministry,\" p. 273.",
