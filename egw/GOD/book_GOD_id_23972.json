    "word": "81. One human being becomes Satan's copartner to tempt, allure, and deceive his fellow men to vicious practises; and the sure result is diseased bodies, because of the violation of moral law. \"Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\" It is Satan's determined purpose to deceive the human family so that he can bring them as a mass on his side, to work with him in making void the law of God. Thus he finds agencies which multiply his efficiency. And as they do this, he rules them with a rod of iron. And not only the human race, but the brute creation also are made to suffer through Satan's attributes wrought out through the human agent.-- U. T., Jan. 11, 1897.",
