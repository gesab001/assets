    "word": "The man who magnifies his own office in working in any line to bind about the conscience of another, be he president of the General Conference, president of a small conference, or the elder or deacon or lay member of a church, he is out of God's line. The Lord has been dishonored by the misrepresentations that have weakened and discouraged some of His servants, and deprived them of the opportunity to employ their talents because they will not sell their conscience or their powers for other men to use. God desires that men shall stand in their own individual responsibility, and while they are consecrated to Him there will be unity in their diversity, as branches of the true Vine.--Ms 66, 1898, pp. 5, 6. (To the General Conference and our publishing institutions, May 24, 1898.)",
