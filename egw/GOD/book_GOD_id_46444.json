Let us hear what God says about Eli's neglect: \"Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone that heareth it shall tingle.\" The Lord had borne long with Eli. He had been warned and instructed; but, like the parents of today, he had not heeded the warning. But when the Lord took hold of the case, He ceased not till He had made thorough work (RH May 4, 1886).  {2BC 1010.10}  \n     20 (ch. 7:9, 15). Samuel Takes Hold With Both Hands.--Samuel was now invested by the God of Israel with the three-fold office of judge, prophet, and priest. Placing one hand in the hand of Christ, and with the other taking the helm of the nation, he holds it with such wisdom and firmness as to preserve Israel from destruction (ST June 22, 1882).",
