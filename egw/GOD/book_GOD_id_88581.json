    "word": "I have been shown that unless we make most diligent work in purifying our own souls from all unkindness and bitterness, these traits will reveal themselves at times before we are aware of it, to do great harm to the cause we love. I have been shown that when we strictly heed the instructions God has given us in regard to cherishing pitying love, compassion, forgiveness, and kindness for others, and are forgetful of ourselves, we shall have a power of influence with our people such as no others can have. I was shown that it rests wholly with us whether we leave an influence behind us that is subduing, transforming and elevating--or to the contrary--whether we shall wound, injure, be dictatorial, overbearing, censuring, exalting and magnifying \n\n\n                                   -26- \n\nourselves, and it be a relief to many who love and fear God when our voice shall be silent in the grave, our influence no longer felt.",
