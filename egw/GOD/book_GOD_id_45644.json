    "word": "How to Overcome--1891.--John pointed the people to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world. He said, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" There is a great deal in that \"taketh away.\" The question is, Shall we keep on sinning as though it were an impossibility for us to overcome? How are we to overcome? As Christ overcame, and that is the only way. He prayed to His heavenly Father. We can do the same. . . . When tempted to speak wrong and do wrong resist Satan and say, I will not surrender my will to your control. I will cooperate with divine power and through grace be conqueror.-- Manuscript 83, 1891.",
