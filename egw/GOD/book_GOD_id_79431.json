    "word": "I am anxious to publish the Testimonies that have so long been in the hands of a few. The people are in ignorance as to the significance of the decisions of your councils, for they have not the light which you have received. As soon as other work can be completed I mean to publish the Testimonies that have been waiting so long. But if our brethren persist in their efforts to consolidate the publishing work, and bring the Pacific Press under the management of the authorities at Battle Creek, I should feel it my duty at once to gather up and publish the writings that have for the last twenty years expressed the will of God on this point. O, may God save His people in this perilous time! Wisdom seems to have departed from the prudent. The truth is hidden from wise men, and is revealed to babes. The cause of God will not be left in unconsecrated, unskilful hands. \n                       (Signed) E. G. White. July, 1896. \n\n                                               -",
