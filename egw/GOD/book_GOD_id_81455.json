    "word": "The brethren Lindsay and Gaskill are men who can, if consecrated to God, bear a greater weight of responsibilities than they have done. They have thought they would be prompt to respond to any call that should be made for means, and that this was the principal burden they had to bear in the cause of God. But God requires more of them than this. If they had trained their minds to a more critical study of the word of God, that they might have become laborers in his cause, and work for the salvation of sinners, as earnestly as they have to obtain the things of this life, they would have developed strength and wisdom to engage in the work of God where laborers are greatly needed.",
