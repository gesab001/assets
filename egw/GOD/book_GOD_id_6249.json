    "word": "I was shown that Satan's power is especially exercised upon the people of God. Many were presented before me in a doubting, despairing condition. The infirmities of the body affect the mind. A cunning and powerful enemy attends our steps, and employs his strength and skill in trying to turn us out of the right way. Too often it is the case that the people of God are not on the watch, and are therefore ignorant of his devices. He works by means which will best conceal himself from view, and he often gains his object.",
