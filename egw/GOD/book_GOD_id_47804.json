    "word": "14 (chs. 7:26; 13:20; see EGW on Acts 15:11; Ephesians 2:18). Everlasting Covenant Sealed Forever.--Christ was without sin, else His life in human flesh and His death on the cross would have been of no more value in procuring grace for the sinner than the death of any other man. While He took upon Him humanity, it was a life taken into union with Deity. He could lay down His life as priest and also victim. He possessed in Himself power to lay it down and take it up again. He offered Himself without spot to God.",
