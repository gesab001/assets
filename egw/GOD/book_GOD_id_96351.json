    "word": "We see home relations neglected. We see broken-down family altars. We see the first love left, the religion of Christ expelled from the soul, to give place to constantly increasing speculations. Men are leaving God and heaven out of their reckoning. It is regarded as a waste of time to search the heart. The Bible is neglected. A multitude of cares over-balance the truth in the heart, and the spiritual eyesight is blinded. They need the heavenly anointing, oh, so much!--Ms 29, 1890. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nJune 13, 1991. Entire Ms.",
