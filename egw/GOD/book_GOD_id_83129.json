    "word": "To neglect the very work God has given you, and take up a work He has not appointed, is not the devising of the Lord but your own devising. You cannot carry the work in Chicago as you have been doing, and perform acceptably the work the Lord has appointed you. No one who believes that we are giving the last message of mercy to the world is required by God to go over the ground you are going over.--Letter 33, 1900, pp. 2, 8. (To J. H. Kellogg, Feb. 27, 1900.)",
