Our efforts in missionary lines must become far more extensive. A more decided work than has been done must be done prior to the second appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. God's people are not to cease their labors until they shall encircle the world.\"--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VI, pp. 23-24.",
