    "word": "I never had a deeper sense of the precious truth and its power upon human minds than when addressing those students in the early meeting. Morning after morning I felt charged with a message from God. I also had special freedom in speaking twice upon the Sabbath. At every meeting several unbelievers were present, and they were much affected as the truth was presented. If we had a suitable place for meeting, we could invite the neighbors to come in. But our long, narrow dining-room crowded as closely as if packed, is not a very suitable place for worship. I am assigned a little space in the corner of the room, and am packed up close to the wall. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus is in the assembly. We know it. Some souls are thinking \n\n\n                        - 16 - \n\nvery seriously now upon the subject of the truth. We all know that the most severe and intense soul-struggles belong to the hour of the great resolve to act out the convictions upon the human heart. The consecration of the soul to God is committing the keeping of the soul to one who has purchased its freedom at an infinite price, and then we are to follow on to know the Lord, that we may know his goings forth are prepared as the morning. To obey is better than sacrifice. The whole work of the Christian is comprised in willing and doing.",
