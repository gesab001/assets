    "word": "Ministering to the Sick\n     During the life of Christ, the sick and afflicted were objects of his special care, When he sent out his disciples, he commissioned them to heal the sick, as well as to preach the gospel. When he sent forth the seventy, he commanded them to heal the sick, and next, to preach that the kingdom of God had come nigh unto them. Their physical health was to be first cared for, in order to prepare the way for their minds to be reached by those truths which the apostles were to preach.",
