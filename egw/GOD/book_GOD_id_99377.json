    "word": "If you are a disappointed man you will be a very unhappy one. You need a different mold upon your character, in order that you may be highly useful. You need to possess more of the Love of Christ that your own will may be subdued. You have not realized your obligations to God to be patient, kind, and respectful to your ministering brethren and to every member of the church. You need the kindness, courtesy, meekness, and lowliness of Christ. You have many valuable qualifications that should be perfected to do highest service in the cause of God.",
