    "word": "The youth who go to Ann Arbor [THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WAS LOCATED AT ANN ARBOR, SOME 65 MILES EAST OF BATTLE CREEK; IN 1891 ADVENTIST YOUTH SEEKING MEDICAL TRAINING STUDIED THERE.--COMPILERS.] must receive Jesus as their personal Saviour or they will build upon the sand, and their foundation will be swept away. The Spirit of Christ must regenerate and sanctify the soul, and pure affection for Christ must be kept alive by humble, daily trust in God. Christ must be formed within, the hope of glory. Let Jesus be revealed to those with whom you associate.--Letter 26, 1891.",
