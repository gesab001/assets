I should have written to you during the Minneapolis meeting, but the current setting in the direction of doubt and unbelief of the Testimonies was so strong that I had no liberty to present to others the counsel of God in their case. I was bidden by the Lord to wait, for warnings and reproofs would have no effect. Only as he should lead and impress me must I speak. Our brethren had not a heart to receive anything that would humble their pride. If it were presented, they would be offended or stumble at the word; for such was the spirit that prevailed in that meeting, and under its influence many would move rashly.",
