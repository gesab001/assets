    "word": "Many of the tried servants of God have fallen asleep in Jesus. We greatly appreciate the help of those who are left alive to this day. We value their testimony. Read the first chapter of First John, and then praise the Lord that notwithstanding your many infirmities you can still bear witness for Him. The Lord has brought you through many trying, difficult places. And He has given you the opportunity of laboring in connection with your wife. He has given her to you to help you, to be one with you, to have a care for you in her stronger physical strength. The Lord has given Sister Haskell a knowledge of the Scriptures, so that at the times when you are called away for a season of rest, she is able to take your place. I can see that the good hand of the Lord has been with you. \n\n\n                                     -220- \n\nHe will uphold you by His strong arm, saying, \"Lean on Me. I will be your strength and your exceeding great reward.\"",
