    "word": "I feel deeply in regard to the missionary work in South Africa. I do hope you will not look to man, nor trust in men, but look to God and trust in God. We may expect large things, even the deep movings of the Spirit of God, if we have faith in His promises. Our greatest sin is unbelief in God. Has He not shown us how precious we are in His sight, and with what value He regards our souls, by giving us Jesus? We are required to unite our souls with Jesus Christ that we may have no tame, commonplace experience.--Letter 92, 1896, p. 2. (To \"Dear Brother A. T. Robinson,\" September 2, 1896.)",
