    "word": "If God's servants will consider this matter rationally, if they will place themselves under the control of sound reason and good judgment, they will see that these errors need not be perpetuated. They will see that such defects can be overcome, and their efforts in the pulpit be of far greater advantage to the hearers, and far less taxing to themselves. Every minster should bear in mind that he is giving to the people the message which God has given him, and that this word involves eternal interests.--Ms 4, 1897.",
