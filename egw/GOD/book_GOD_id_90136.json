    "word": "MR No. 1043 - The Bible as Our Study Book\n\n     God calls upon teachers to behold the heavens and study the works of God in nature. [Psalms 19:1-3, quoted.] Shall we not commit to memory the lessons nature teaches? Shall we not open the eyes of our senses and take in the beautiful things of God? We would do well to read often the nineteenth psalm, that we may understand how the Lord binds up His law with His created works.",
