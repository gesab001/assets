    "word": "The church in Fresno is composed of fragments of other churches. They are not ignorant of the Scriptures and the power of God; and if they are what God would have them be, they will be light-bearers to the world. This church is too large. Many ought to be out carrying the light of truth to those who are in darkness. If they neglect this the woe of God will be upon them. Let them not carry there, but go out as workers together with God. We are not here in this world to please and glorify ourselves, but \n\n\n                            [4] \n\nto be co-laborers with God. Probationary time is about to close. Now is the time to work, and that without delay.",
