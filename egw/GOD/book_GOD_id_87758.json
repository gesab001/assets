    "word": "My dear sister, you have handled these subjects so often. Just appropriate them to yourself, and receive the consolation that it is your privilege to have. Look away from your poor, miserable self to Jesus. He is the beauty of holiness. He wants you to submit yourself, as a little child, to Him. You have prepared many things that God has given me for others. I entreat you to be encouraged by the thought that you have been permitted to help me in my work for so many years. Let this thought comfort you. I entreat you to look away from yourself to the Lord Jesus, and in simplicity trust your Redeemer.",
