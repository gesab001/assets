    "word": "We want Christ and His obedience and we want to drink in of the Spirit of God. I want to be like Him. I want to practice His virtues and be a doer of the Word. And what did He say on the Mount? \"Think not\"--on their startled ears fell the words, their very thoughts unrolled before them-- \"think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill\" (Matthew 5:17). He came to fulfill every specification of the law. \"Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled\" (v. 18). I want you to take this. It is the word of God. You will hear from the word of men that the law is abolished and that it is not binding upon men. And they act just so. But you cannot afford to work against God. \"Ye are laborers together with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). I would rather be a laborer with God than to be laboring counter to Him. I see in Him matchless charms.",
