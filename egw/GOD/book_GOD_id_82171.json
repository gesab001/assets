    "word": "Can we not see the corrupt condition of our world? Is not the terrible wickedness, which is continually increasing, sufficient to lead us to use every Christian activity in presenting to the world those books which contain the most beneficial instruction. God, the great moral Governor of the universe, desires His people to arouse and use their influence to lead others to understand what is coming upon our world. The Lord calls for workers to enter the canvassing field. He desires the books upon health reform to be circulated. Much depends upon the question of health reform. Unless our churches occupy a higher platform upon this subject, they will not be able to appreciate the truth for this time.",
