    "word": "How Daniel Overcame \n\n     When Daniel was in Babylon, he was beset with temptations of which we have never dreamed, and he realized that he must keep his body under. He purposed in his heart that he would not drink of the king's wine or eat of his dainties. He knew that in order to come off a victor, he must have clear mental perceptions, that he might discern between right and wrong. While he was working on his part, God worked also, and gave him \"knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.\" This is the way God worked for Daniel; and He does not propose to do any differently now. Man must co-operate with God in carrying out the plan of salvation.--R. & H., April 2, 1889. \n\n                                               -",
