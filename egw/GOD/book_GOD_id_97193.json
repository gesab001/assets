    "word": "If the peace of Christ is in the heart, plain food, seasoned by a good appetite, will be relished. We are to fulfill the command, \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\" \"Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.\" But how much is God brought into the thoughts of those who claim to be Christians? How much sanctified conversation is encouraged at the family board? If God were thought of when we eat and drink, the precious talent of speech would more often be employed to His glory.",
