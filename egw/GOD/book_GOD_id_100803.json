    "word": "When the Lord chose the Jewish nation, and bade them not to unite themselves with another people, it was that they might not be corrupted, that the light might be communicated to them to be given to the world. Did the Lord refuse to let his light shine upon other nations? No; but those idolatrous nations were raising up barriers, interposing obstructions, turning farther and farther away from the light; they were going deeper and deeper into the moral darkness, and becoming more and more blinded. One nation must be made the depository of sacred truth, so that there might be at least one channel through which the rays of light could shine forth to the world. So in this age God has committed to his people most sacred truth; he means that they shall have light to shed amid the darkness which surrounds them. \n                                                                           1013",
