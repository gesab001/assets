    "word": "An Appeal to the Ministers and Other Friends of the \n              Berrien Springs School \n\n\n     \"There are times when things do not look as bright and cheerful as we could wish, because difficulties stand in the way of rapid advancement; but we hope, my brethren and sisters, that you all will be encouraged to take a thorough interest in the establishment of the school at Berrien Springs, and aid it by the sale of \"Christ's Object Lessons,' and in other ways. Let the sale of 'Christ's Object Lessons' be taken hold of interestedly in our large cities, and in the smaller settlements. Brethren, wake up. The good hand of the Lord has been with our people in the selection of a good place to locate the school. This place corresponds to the representations given me as to where the school should be located. It is away from the cities, and there is an abundance of land for agricultural purposes, and room so that houses will not need to build one close to another. There is plenty of ground \n                                                                           15\nwhere students shall be educated to educate the land. 'Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.'\"",
