    "word": "Our canvassers are having marked success. And why should they not? The heavenly angels are working with them. Hundreds of those who believe the truth will, if they keep their hearts humble, do a good work, in the companionship of heavenly angels. God will use those who humble the heart before him, and sanctify themselves in faith and humility, following the example of the Great Teacher, and speaking words that will enlighten those not of our faith. We are to work patiently and disinterestedly, as the servants of the Lord, opening the Scriptures to others.--Letter 102, 1910.",
