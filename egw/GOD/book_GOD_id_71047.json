    "word": "Before Christ's Birth\n     In heaven it was understood that the time had come for the advent of Christ to the world, and angels leave glory to witness His reception by those He came to bless and save. They had witnessed His glory in heaven, and they anticipate that He will be received with honor in accordance with His character and the dignity of His mission. As angels approach the earth, they first come to the people God had separated from the nations of the world as His peculiar treasure. They see no especial interest among the Jews, no eager waiting and watching that they may be the first to receive the Redeemer, and acknowledge His advent.\u2014RH Dec. 17, 1872.",
