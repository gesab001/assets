    "word": "All the influence you are capable of exerting is now required on the Lord's side. It has been exerted long enough on Satan's side. God asks you to live no longer for self. You may wish to consult your own inclinations, but do not, I beg of you, do this work now. God is calling for your service. Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your heart. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. Do not say to the Spirit, \"Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for Thee.\" Give yourself to the Lord while mercy's sweet voice still invites you. God bless you, is my most earnest prayer.--Letter 133, 1901. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Jan. 22, 1988. Entire Letter.",
