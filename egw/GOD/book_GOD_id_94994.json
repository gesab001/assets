    "word": "Man can increase in knowledge without experiencing a change of heart, but this does not bring salvation. Paul declares, \"Though I ... understand all mysteries, and all knowledge ... and have not charity, I am nothing.... Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\" It is not position or profession that makes a man of value in God's sight. It is being good and doing good.",
