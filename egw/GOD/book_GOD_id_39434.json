    "word": "THE GREATER ENOCH\u2019S LABORS, THE MORE EARNEST HIS PRAYERS.\u2014In the midst of a life of active labor, Enoch steadfastly maintained his communion with God. The greater and more pressing his labors, the more constant and earnest were his prayers. He continued to exclude himself, at certain periods, from all society. After remaining for a time among the people, laboring to benefit them by instruction and example, he would withdraw, to spend a season in solitude, hungering and thirsting for that divine knowledge which God alone can impart.\u2014(Patriarchs and Prophets, 86, 87.)",
