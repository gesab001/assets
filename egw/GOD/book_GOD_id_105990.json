    "word": "Divine wisdom has his hand hold of the living machinery in human agencies; men are selected as fitting instruments to do a given work; and O! what a precious ability is given of God to man to know his fellow men, so that he can use, through the grace of God, the human agencies and organize a working company to do the best work, according to their recognized ability.
