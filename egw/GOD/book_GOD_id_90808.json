    "word": "Elder Simpson explains the prophecies by the means of charts, and makes it very plain that the end of all things is at hand. In some cases entire families have taken their stand to obey God, as in 1844. All are brought over the ground from the beginning, and many believe as the prophecies relating to the past, present, and future are explained. Jewelry which cost many hundreds of dollars has been given to Elder Simpson to be sold for the cause. There is no spirit of excitement in this movement. No fanaticism attends it. The truth takes hold of hearts; and men and women give their rings and bracelets although no call has been made for them to strip themselves of these idols. The work is earnest and quiet. The people take off \n\n\n                                   -251- \n\ntheir jewelry of their own freewill, and bring it to Elder Simpson as an offering up of their idols.",
