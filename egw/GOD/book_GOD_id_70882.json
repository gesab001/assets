    "word": "The Builders of Babel\n     Some of the descendants of Noah soon began to apostatize. . . . Some disbelieved in the existence of God. . . . Others believed that God existed. . . . Those who were enemies of God felt daily reproved by the righteous conversation and godly lives of those who loved, obeyed, and exalted God. The unbelieving consulted among themselves and agreed to separate from the faithful. . . . They journeyed a distance from them, and selected a large plain wherein to dwell. They built them a city, and then conceived the idea of building a large tower to reach unto the clouds, that they might . . . be no more scattered. . . . They would build their tower to a much greater height than the waters prevailed in the time of the Flood . . . and they would be as gods and rule over the people. . . .",
