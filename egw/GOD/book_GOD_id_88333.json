    "word": "False philosophy is proud, partial, exclusive, favoring only a few. In those who have this spirit the lowly awaken little sympathy. They possess \n\n\n                                  -248- \n\nno power or disposition to uplift the lowly. But Christ binds men to Himself, to God, and to one another. True, sanctified philosophy makes all human elements in Christ Jesus one. It builds up no walls of separation between man and his fellow man. Through Christ men and women have been adopted into the divine family as sons and daughters of God. They are given every advantage of the Saviour's power and redeeming love.--Ms. 85, 1899, pp. 1-16. (\"The Sanitarium: Where Shall It Be Located?\" June 5, 1899.)",
