    "word": "And you, my brother Olsen, are not clear before your God. While you allow yourself to be influenced and moulded as you have been, you are virtually saying to those whom God reproves, It is well with you. For years the Lord has been setting their sins before them, yet the reproofs and warnings are unheeded. What does it mean? I am sore troubled in your behalf, because you do not regard the light given. Unless you shall make a decided change in your policy, and no longer permit yourself to be guided by the words of unwise counsellors, the light in you will become darkness, and you will not have a clean record in the books of heaven. \n                                                                           1361",
