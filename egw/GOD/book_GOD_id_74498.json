    "word": "Why do we not believe the plain \"Thus saith the Lord\"? Do not cease to pray under any circumstances. The Spirit may be willing but the flesh may be weak, but Jesus knows all about that. In your weakness you are not to be anxious; for anxiety means doubt and distrust. You are simply to believe that Christ is able to save unto the uttermost all who come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for us.",
