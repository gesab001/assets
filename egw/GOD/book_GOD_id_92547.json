    "word": "A perversion of right principles is a transgression of God's law. Those who in their actions pervert the grand principles of His holy law are under condemnation, for the righteousness of Christ cannot cover one unconfessed sin. The law has been lightly regarded. \"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.\" We must obey God's law, if we are loyal to Him and accepted by Him.",
