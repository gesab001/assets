    "word": "God will be the sanctuary of His people, if they will obey His word, believing and proclaiming the simple gospel truths that Christ proclaimed when in this world. We need now to pray as we have never prayed before. We are living in the great day of atonement, and we are to confess our sins, and make diligent work for repentance. We are to put all our capabilities to work, that we may be delivered from wicked and unreasonable men. Satan comes down as a beautiful angel, and presents lovely pictures before the eyes of those who have so perverted their ways before God that they do not see what they are or know what they need. The enemy has come down with great power, to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish. God calls for repentance and reconversion. . . .",
