    "word": "Many laborers can work here in Washington, but there are some who are especially qualified to stand in the pulpits of our large cities and preach the truth as they have presented it acceptably for years. This class of work Brother Prescott is well fitted to perform. \n\n\n              -312- \n\nGod wants him out of Washington. He wants him to labor where he can see souls being brought to the truth through his instrumentality. I am instructed to say to Elder Prescott, You are needed in the fields that are opening for evangelistic work, and when you make the Lord your trust, and, like a little child, cast your helpless soul upon your Saviour, He will be your righteousness, He will be your sanctification, He will be your power to reach the people by the messages of truth. Wonderful reformations will be seen, and there will be an awakening and a conversion of many souls who are now ignorant of what is the truth for these last days.",
