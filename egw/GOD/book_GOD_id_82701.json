    "word": "When a man is filled with the Holy Spirit, the more severely he is tested and tried, the more clearly he proves that he is a true representative of Christ in word, in spirit, in action. Christ declares, \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father\" (John 14:12). What is the promise to every true believer? \"Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you\" (Acts 1:8). Might we not better, my brethren and sisters, take ourselves to task for our unlikeness to Christ? He says, \"Ye are my witnesses\" (Isaiah 43:10). What kind of witnesses are we for truth and righteousness? Are we striving with all our God-given powers to reach the measure of the stature of men and women in Christ? Are we seeking for His fullness, ever reaching higher and higher, trying to attain to the perfection of His character?",
