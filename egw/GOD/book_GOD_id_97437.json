    "word": "Words to Students\n\n     (A Talk given by Ellen White at the opening of the Fernando School, October 1, 1902.) \n\n\n     I am indeed glad to see so many here this morning. Students, will you remember that the prosperity of the school depends in a large degree on your endeavors? Will you remember that you are to help to make the school a success? Your teachers will find their task difficult as they try to understand for themselves and to help you to understand what the Word of God means and what its requirements comprehend. Will you resolve not to make the work of your teachers harder by your perversity? I plead with you as Christ's purchased possession to help your teachers and your fellow-students by being so closely connected with God that into this school heavenly angels can enter and abide. Let everyone see what he can do to bring into the school sunshine and sweetness. Let everyone manifest that conformity to God's will that brings His rich blessing.",
