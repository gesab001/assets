    "word": "Church Schools.--Is obedience to all the commandments of God taught the children in their very first lesson? Is sin represented as an offense toward God? I would rather that children grow up in a degree of ignorance of school education as it is today, and employ some other means to teach them. But in this country many parents are compelled to send their children to school. Therefore, in localities where there is a church, a school should be established, if there are no more than six children to attend. A teacher should be employed who will educate the children in the truths of the word of God, which are so essential for these last days, and which it is so important for them to understand. A great test is coming; it will be upon obedience or disobedience to the commandments of God. Intemperance is seen everywhere, disregard for the law of God, rioting, and drunkenness prevail.--Private Test., May 6, 1897.",
