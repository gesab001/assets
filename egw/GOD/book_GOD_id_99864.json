    "word": "Then let every soul not be afraid with any amazement. The tender compassion of God is toward his people. Faith, wondrous faith,--it leads the people of God in straight paths. Without this faith we shall certainly misunderstand His dealings with us, and distrust his love and faithfulness. Whatever may be the trials and sufferings caused by our fellowmen, we need more faith; let there be no faintheartedness, no peevish repining, no complaining thoughts respecting the providence of God and the hardships we are called to endure. Let faith lay hold upon the unseen, and the evidences we have of the forgiveness of God.",
