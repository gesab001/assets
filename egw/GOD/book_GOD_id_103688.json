    "word": "\"All these representations, and many more, passed as living reality before me. I felt grateful to God, as I realized what an influence an out-of-door life among the flowers and fruit-laden trees has upon those who are sick, both in body and in mind. . . \"Let our medical institutions be established on extensive tracts of land, where the patients can have opportunity for out-of-doors exercise. This will prove to be one means for their restoration of health. Encourage the patients to live out-of-doors. Devise plans to keep them out-of-doors, where they will become acquainted with God through nature. As they take exercise in the open air, restoration will begin in body, mind, and soul. . . Jesus expects those who believe in Him to give the patients in our medical institutions the messages of God's word as healing leaves from the tree of life.",
