We are to serve our heavenly Father with newness of life and gladness every day, knowing that we have access to the throne of grace and that our names are written in the Lamb's book of life. We are to be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. Then we shall realize by experience that the joy of the Lord is our strength.",
