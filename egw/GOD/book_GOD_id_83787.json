    "word": "The revelation of what concerns man's eternal destiny has been largely laid aside as a mystery. Other reading and other principles have been brought in. Human inventions, called education, have been counterworking the infinite counsels of Heaven. This is called higher education; but it is an insult to God. The themes that are to be man's study throughout eternal ages are so momentous that they not only disdain the discoveries of man, but engross to themselves the undivided attention of the only begotten Son of God. True education would have held its sacred holy principles belittled and degraded had it been mingled with the topics now called by men the higher science of education.",
