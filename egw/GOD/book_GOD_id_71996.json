    "word": "Religion is not pretense. All shallowness must be avoided. Christian character is built by receiving and believing in Christ. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:12). The true Christian carefully cherishes the truth, realizing that it is more precious than gold. He has an argument that is proof against all the assaults of the enemy.",
