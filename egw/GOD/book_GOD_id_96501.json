    "word": "Monday, May 21, 1900, Sunnyside, Cooranbong, Australia, EGW to G. A. Irwin \n\n\n     Dear Brother Irwin: . . . God would be pleased to see The Desire of Ages in every home. In this book is contained the light He has given upon His word. To our canvassers I would say, Go forth with your hearts softened and subdued by reading of the life of Christ. Drink deeply of the water of salvation, that it may be in your heart as a living spring, flowing forth to refresh souls ready to perish.--Letter 75, 1900. (Colporteur Ministry, pp. 126-127.)",
