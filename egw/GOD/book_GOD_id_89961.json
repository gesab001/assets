    "word": "What a blessing it has been to the work to have Brother and Sister Burden and her sisters associated with the other Sanitarium workers in Australia! They have done all they could to help you. The Lord has beheld the erection of the Sanitarium building. He has noticed every self-sacrificing act of the workers. He has had a special oversight over every stroke of work done. We hope that the ones whose hearts the Lord has moved to help in this good work by giving of their means, will take the greatest satisfaction in seeing the building occupied, and [the work] conducted in every department to the glory of God. \n\n\n                                   -169-",
