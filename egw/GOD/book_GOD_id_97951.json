    "word": "It is a mistake for one who has some defects of character, and whom the Lord has placed in connection with others who have a religious experience, to think that the little things in connection with his work, in the methods and plans and modes of thinking and acting, should be passed by without opposition. The Lord places persons in such positions that they may have an opportunity to become acquainted with themselves and learn to take heed to themselves. They are not to change their position, for this is appointed by God to bring them into connection with other minds, that they may discover the imperfections in themselves, and that they themselves need to make a decided change.",
