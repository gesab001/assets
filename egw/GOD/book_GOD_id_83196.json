He \"will render to every man according to his deeds: To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality.\" He will render \"eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, \n\n\n                                    -285- \n\nbut obey unrighteousness,\" He will render \"indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; but glory, honor, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: for there is no respect of persons with God\" [Romans 2:6-11].--Ms 38, 1895, pp. 1-22.
