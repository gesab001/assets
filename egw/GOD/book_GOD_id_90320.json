    "word": "Christ Uses Trials to Draw Wanderers Back to Himself.--The soul that surrenders all to Christ loses sight of self, and is filled with confidence in God. By the clear light shining on God's Word, he reads the promises telling of his heavenly Father's love and care. These promises appeal to him with soul-conquering evidence. Assured of God's power and willingness to fulfill His word, he returns to Him praise and thanksgiving. Peace and joy fill his heart.",
