    "word": "Go Under the Fig Tree \n\n     Nathanael heard John as he pointed to the Saviour and said, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29)! Nathanael looked at Jesus, but he was disappointed in the appearance of the world's Redeemer. Could He who bore the marks of toil and poverty be the Messiah? Jesus was a worker; He had toiled with humble workingmen, and Nathanael went away. But he did not form his opinion decidedly as to what the character of Jesus was. He knelt down under a fig tree, inquiring of God if indeed this man was the Messiah. While he was there, Philip came and said, \"We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" But the word \"Nazareth\" again aroused his unbelief, and he said, \"Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" He was full of prejudice, but Philip did not seek to combat his prejudice; he \n                                                                           415\nsimply said, \"Come and see.\" When Nathanael came into the presence of Jesus, Jesus said, \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\" Nathanael was amazed. He said, \"Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee\" (John 1:45, 46, 47, 48).",
