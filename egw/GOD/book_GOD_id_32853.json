    "word": "Ignorance may try to support skepticism by appealing to science; but instead of upholding skepticism, true science contributes fresh evidences of the wisdom and power of God.

Together they lead us to God by teaching us something of the wise and beneficent laws through which He works.--CT 426 (1913).",
