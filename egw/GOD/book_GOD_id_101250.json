    "word": "There is a sin among my people, saith the Lord. It is the want of Christ's love for the children of God who need sympathy and encouragement, who need the rich grace of Christ poured into the soul. God help us to care for the very ones it is our duty to care for, and to bless. May the Lord help us individually to represent Christ in our world. \n                                                  Ellen G. White.",
