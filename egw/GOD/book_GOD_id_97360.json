    "word": "Time, precious time, has been lost. Golden opportunities have passed by unimproved, because of a lack of clear spiritual eyesight and wise generalship to plan and devise ways and means to frustrate the enemy and preoccupy the field. These men think they have been doing a very wise work, but the Judgment will show what has been the character of their warfare and what has been lost to Christ through their maneuvering. Let us now wake up. There is earnest work to be done. If we will draw nigh to God, He will draw nigh to us.",
