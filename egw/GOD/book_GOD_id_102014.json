    "word": "May God help you all and help me. I want help and strength and power. But do not quote Sister White till you stand on vantage ground, where you know what you are doing. Take the Word of God. It is full of meat and drink. Study the Bible, and you will know more of God than you do now. You will have something fresh to impart to others. You will not go over the same ground again and again. You will realize that there is a world to save. I ask you to put on the whole armor, and be sure that your feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.--Manuscript 43, 1901. (A talk presented by Ellen White in the Battle Creek College library, April 1, 1901.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. December, 1983",
