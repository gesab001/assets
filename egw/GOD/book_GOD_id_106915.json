I have written out some instruction to ministers and physicians in regard to the subject of health reform. I have been shown that the example of some of our leading workers is not a healthful or praiseworthy example. They are losing ground, backsliding from the principles of health reform, and this is having its effect upon the church members. These brethren are very conscientious is some matters, but on points where they should be very strict, they are very slack. The Lord has instructed me to tell them that their example in the home and in the church and with those whom they visit, is causing the people to lose confidence in the light that God has given on this subject.",
