    "word": "The Lord, by close and pointed truths for these last days, is cleaving a people from out the world, and purifying them unto himself. Pride and unhealthful fashions, the love of display, the love of approbation, all must be left with the world, if we would be renewed in knowledge after the image of Him who created us. \"For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men, teaching us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world, looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\"",
