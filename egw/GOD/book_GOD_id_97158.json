    "word": "God grant that we may live in the light of His countenance, and at last hear Him say, \"Come up higher; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" What is that joy? Seeing sinners converted. That is joy. Let us go to work and see if you cannot help some poor, despondent soul that is crushed under the weight of discouragement. See if you cannot win some soul to Christ. You are bigger in your own eyes than you ought to be, but just see if you cannot win somebody to Christ; and as you win them to Christ you will become smaller and smaller in your own eyes, until you feel as though you were nothing. When you feel in that way, then Christ to you is everything. [This was followed by an altar call; many responded. See report in Signs, October 12, 1891.]--Manuscript 35, 1891. (MR 900.23)",
