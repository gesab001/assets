H. Kellogg.) \n\n\n     I am thankful to God that I can report that my health is improving. I am now able to walk up the stairs. My arms are not so lame, so I can support myself, as I go up and down, by the aid of the balusters. I can walk better, and my limbs are growing stronger. I have trouble with my back, but I can lie in bed much better than I have done. When speaking, I can stand quite straight on the platform, and my brain is clear.",
