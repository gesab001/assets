    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has placed himself where he could accomplish much good. He has not sought to divorce medical missionary work from the gospel. But while the ministers should have acknowledged medical missionary work to be the Lord's helping hand, many of them have stood aloof from it, refusing to cooperate with those who were trying to cooperate with Christ. The position taken by some claiming to be Seventh-day Adventists has brought a heavy burden on Dr. Kellogg, and at times he has become almost desperate because he has not received the sympathy which he should have received, but has met with prejudice and opposition from those who should have helped him. Some among our people have gone to worldly physicians, passing by the physician God has blessed and honored. Some have stood in Dr. Kellogg's way, to harass and oppose him. This pleased the enemy, for Dr. Kellogg has at times reproached them unsparingly in a way that grieved the Holy Spirit.",
