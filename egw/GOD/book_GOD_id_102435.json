    "word": "The Lord requires truth in the inward parts. He will give the Holy Spirit to all who ask Him in faith. He calls for men to act as gospel ministers, to act as physicians, whom no flattery can cause to swerve from the truth. Ministers and doctors are to be under the rule of God. He in whose heart the Spirit of God bears rule, will follow the example of Christ. The life, the character, will be so Christ-like that it will roll back the unjust reproach from the pure truth of Christ.",
