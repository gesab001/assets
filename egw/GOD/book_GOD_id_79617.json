    "word": "The church should respect the gospel ministry; for it is God's appointed means of communicating His messages to His people. The work of His ministers is to open to men and women the living oracles of truth. Let Church-members sustain the ministers by their prayers and their co-operation. Let no one venture to make a tirade on a minister; for in so doing he would be making a tirade against Christ in the person of one of His saints.",
