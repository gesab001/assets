    "word": "When thinking on the conflict, Paul writes to his Ephesian brethren exhorting them to \"be strong,\" not feeble, not wavering, tossed to and fro like the waves of the sea. But in what are they to be strong? In their own might? No. \"Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.\" He says, \"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places . . .\" (verses 10-13).",
