    "word": "It is when school work is ended, and decisions must be made as to the field and the character of future labor, that it is of the utmost importance that our young physicians shall realize that their talents are not their own, that they belong to the Master. Let them determine that they will not accept the praise and flattery of men, but that they will use wisely, judiciously, and with the strictest integrity, all the gifts God has lent them. Their talents are to be increased by wise use, and returned to the Giver. This the word of God specifies as their duty. They are to be producers as well as consumers.",
