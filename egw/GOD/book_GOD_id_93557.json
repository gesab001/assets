    "word": "Solomon was a man of high capabilities to whom God gave wisdom and understanding. But Solomon did not feel his continual dependence on God and His providence. Brethren Bourdeau, God has a work for you which our American \n\n\n                                      -8- \n\nministers cannot do. You need to exercise your powers, to put forth your efforts, and yet not rely upon these. You need to have self submerged in the will of God, His ways to be your ways. And you need at the same time that you are taking responsibilities in the work to feel a deep distrust of your own wisdom and prudence. You have been in danger of either self-confidence or despondency. You have not had that encouragement and that sympathy and consideration from your brethren that you should have had.",
