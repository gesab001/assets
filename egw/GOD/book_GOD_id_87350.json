Their thoughts may have been wandering, and their words light and trifling; notwithstanding, the injunction is to be holy in all conversation. \"What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness\" (2 Peter 3:11). \"In all holy conversation\" signifies that in all matters we are to be holy; and that means wholly the Lord's.

The redemption money has been paid as the \n\n\n                                     -54- \n\nprice of my soul, and instead of being a slave of Satan, I am to be indeed the child of God. I am His servant. Then shall we not every one of us draw in even cords with Christ? Shall we not yoke up with Him? Shall we not bear our end of the yoke?",
