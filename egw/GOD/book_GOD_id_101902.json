    "word": "A great work is in danger of being misshaped and deformed by human plans. It is in danger of being marred by men who do not lay their foundation upon the eternal Rock. They may regard some things as all right and other things as all wrong, just as they may be influenced in regard to the work. Their defective spiritual eyesight leads them to adopt a course of action that leaves God almost entirely out of the plans. They catch at ideas advanced by men who have not carried the burden of the work from the formation of the Church called Seventh-day Adventists. This people take the word of God just as it reads and keep the original Sabbath of the fourth commandment. \n                                                                           1680\nThey are distinguished from all others because they have obeyed the light given by the Lord in regard to the day to be observed as the Sabbath. After creating the world in six days, God rested on the Seventh, making that day a memorial of his creation. While the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy he sanctified and blessed the Seventh day. Seventh-day Adventists have been chosen by God as a peculiar people, separate from the world. The great Cleaver of truth has cut them out of the quarry of the world, and brought them in connection with himself. He has made them his representatives, and has given them the work of exalting his down-trodden law.",
