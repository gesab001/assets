    "word": "Let the mother take her children with her into the field or garden, and from the things of nature draw lessons that will point them to nature's God, and aid them in the struggle against evil. Let her point them to the lofty trees, the shrubs, and the carpet of green that covers the earth. Let her teach them how the lily, striking its roots down deep through the mire into the sand below, gains nourishment that enables it to send up a pure, beautiful blossom. Then let her show them how, by rejecting that which is impure, and choosing that which is pure, they may grow up into pure, noble men and women. . . .",
