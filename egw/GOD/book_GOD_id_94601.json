    "word": "When attending camp meeting I never ask myself whether I am sick or well. I must stand at my post. I cannot throw off the responsibility. And when I stand before the people, the wants of the cause come up before me and I am forced to relieve my soul of its burden. I feel as though called up before the bar of God to answer for the souls before me. The scenes of the judgment, when every case will be decided, urge themselves upon my mind.",
