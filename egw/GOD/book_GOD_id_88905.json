    "word": "Not for Us to Say How God's Message Should Come or Who Should Be Messenger-- God has sent you a message that He wishes you to receive--a message of light and hope and comfort for the people of God. It is not for you to choose the channel through which the light shall come. The Lord desires to heal the wounds on His sheep and lambs through the heavenly balm of the truth that Christ is our righteousness. . . .",
