    "word": "The world's Redeemer has said, \"Search the scriptures\" (John 5:39). In them is laid open the bounteous provisions for human necessities, and the strongest motives are set forth to influence to repentance and obedience. Here the seeker for truth may read, contemplate, and be stirred to the very depths of his being by that which a good and gracious God has done and is continually doing for him. He will be amazed that he should ever have treated with indifference the marvelous love and pardon proffered, for in redeeming man, God gave the greatest gift that He could offer. And if the objects of so great a love neglect salvation, there is nothing that Heaven can do more in their behalf. . . .",
