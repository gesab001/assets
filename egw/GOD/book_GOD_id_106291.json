    "word": "My brethren, have faith in a living all pitiful, and loving Saviour. I have words given me for you and Brother Sutherland, \"Fear thou not, for I am with thee, be not dismayed, for I am thy God: with the right hand of my righteousness. Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded, they shall be nothing, and they that strive with thee shall perish. Thou shalt seek them, and thou shalt not find them, even them that contend with thee: they that war with thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. For the Lord will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not, I will help thee: fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel, saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.\"",
