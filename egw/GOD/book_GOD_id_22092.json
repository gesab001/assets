    "word": "Yet the finite minds of men are inadequate fully to comprehend the plans and purposes of the Infinite One. We can never by searching find out God. We must not attempt to lift with presumptuous hand the curtain behind which he veils his majesty. The apostle exclaims, \u201cHow unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!\u201d [Romans 11:33.] We can so far comprehend his dealings with us, and the motives by which he is actuated, that we may discern boundless love and mercy united to infinite power. Our Father in Heaven orders everything in wisdom and righteousness, and we are not to be dissatisfied and distrustful, but to bow in reverent submission. He will reveal to us as much of his purposes as it is for our good to know, and beyond that we must trust the Hand that is omnipotent, the Heart that is full of love.",
