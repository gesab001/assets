    "word": "No Excuse for Flirting. There is no excuse for indulging a love-sick sentimentalism; no excuse for this trifling, flirting of married men with young girls, or married men with widows. Let men professing godliness heed the apostle's admonition, \"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak evil against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation\" [1 Peter 2:11, 12].",
