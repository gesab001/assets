    "word": "Christ is our efficiency. How do I know this? I know it by experience. For a while, many years, ago, I was in despair. Then I cast myself on the mercy and love of the Saviour, and his power came upon me. At one time those who were working over me thought me dead. But all at once I raised my voice in prayer. The power of God was upon me all night long, and henceforth I understood that I must look to Christ, and not to any human being for relief. I had been praying and praying for help, and all the time my Saviour was by my side, waiting for me to recognize him as my sufficiency, my strength, my grace. I learned the lesson, and after that, when I kneeled down to pray, I believed that I would receive an answer, whether I felt as if I would or not. Feeling is not to be our guide. Feeling is not faith, but it is as widely separated from faith as the east is from the west.",
