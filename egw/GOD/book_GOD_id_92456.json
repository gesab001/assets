    "word": "From the lowest and most obscure to those highest in position, each one has his place in the family of God. Each one has been entrusted with gifts. He is to make the most of his talents, putting them out to the exchangers. The smallest gift should not be ignored or despised. It is not the number of talents that makes men valuable in the sight of God, but the way in which they appreciate and employ their talents. God's gifts are not to be used to glorify self. They must be prized as His gifts, and sacredly consecrated to His glory.",
