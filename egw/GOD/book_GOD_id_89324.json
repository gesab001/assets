    "word": "The Lord accepts all the obedience of every creature He has made, according to the circumstances of time in the sun-rising and sun-setting world. Obedience is the test; and all this plowing into the intricacy of the precise minutes and hours of the Sabbath--it is the test of man's obedience to honor and glorify God. To sin, or transgression of His law, God will prove a consuming fire. The Sabbath observance is \"a sign between Me and you throughout your generations forever.\"--Letter 167, 1900, pp. 1, 2. (To G. A. Irwin, March 23, 1900.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. Dec. 2, 1982",
