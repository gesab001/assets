    "word": "I Will See No Wicked Thing.--Parents must exercise unceasing watchfulness, that their children be not lost to God. The vows of David, recorded in the 101st \n                                                                           409\nPsalm, should be the vows of all upon whom rest the responsibilities of guarding the influences of the home. The psalmist declares: \"I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.\"",
