    "word": "The great principles of the law, of the very nature of God, are embodied in the words of Christ on the mount. Whoever builds upon them is building upon \n                                                                           149\nChrist, the Rock of Ages. In receiving the word, we receive Christ. And only those who thus receive His words are building upon Him. \"Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" 1 Corinthians 3:11. \"There is none other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" Acts 4:12. Christ, the Word, the revelation of God,--the manifestation of His character, His law, His love, His life,--is the only foundation upon which we can build a character that will endure.",
