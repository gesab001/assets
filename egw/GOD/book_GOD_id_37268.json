    "word": "If people find the Bread of Life at prayer meeting, they will go there to receive it.--The prayer meetings should be the most interesting gatherings that are held; but these are frequently poorly managed. Many attend preaching, but neglect the prayer meeting. Here, again, thought is required. Wisdom should be sought of God, and plans should be laid to conduct the meetings so that they will be interesting and attractive. The people hunger for the Bread of Life. If they find it at prayer meeting, they will go there to receive it.--4T 70.",
