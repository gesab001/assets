    "word": "God has work to be done outside of the church. There are privileges for the Christian in service in every city or town or village. It is not enough for you to remain in the church because you enjoy the preaching. There are many who need the very truths that you have heard, and which you should be imparting to others. May God put upon the members of His church a burden to labor for souls as they that must give an account.",
