    "word": "64\n     When I consider that the Lord has placed ample means in the hands of His servants to be used not improvidently, but wisely, not extravagantly, but economically as the case seems to demand, there would not be a dearth of means in the treasury, but an ample supply to meet the demands for this time, to plant the banner of truth in many dark places of the earth. But the blessing which the Lord has bestowed upon His stewards, with few exceptions, is misappropriated, bound up in selfish enterprises where God does not direct. Carefully should every dollar be considered, that it shall not be expended to please fancy, to administer to pride in expensive buildings, but to administer where there is a necessity, working in lines where God is working to establish His kingdom in the earth, in harmony with the prayer given by Christ, \u201cThy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\u201d Let the works harmonize with the prayer, for men are the human agents through whom the divine agents are working. \u201cWe are labourers together with God; ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\u201d The Lord's work calls for labourers everywhere. As God bountifully gives, we should deliberately, prayerfully resolve that we will honour God with our substance, and with the first-fruits of our increase.",
