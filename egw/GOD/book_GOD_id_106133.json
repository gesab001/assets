    "word": "From the light given me in regard to the location and building up of our school interests, I know that it is the purpose of God that this institution be established at a distance from the city that is so full of temptations and snares, of amusements and holidays, which are not conducive to purity and piety and religious devotion. He designs that we shall connect manual labor with the improvement of the mental powers. I have been shown that study in agricultural lines should be the A B and C of the educational work of our schools. This institution must not depend upon imported produce,--for the fruits so \n\n\n                                  -135- \n\nessential to healthfulness, and for their grains and vegetables. This is the very first work that must be entered upon. Then as we shall advance and add to our facilities, advance studies and object lessons should come in. We are not to subtract from that which has already been taken hold of as a branch of education.",
