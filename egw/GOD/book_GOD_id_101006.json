    "word": "When you and my nephew, Frank Belden, accepted such large wages from the Office, you both showed that you did not appreciate the character of the work. If the Lord calls either of you to the exalted position of co-operating with him in this work, and you maintained your consecration to God and your connection with him, you could not have consented to accept the wages offered to you. It was not the Spirit of God that moved the board to offer you such terms. Whatever position a man may fill in connection with the office of publication, he is not to be paid an exorbitant sum, for God does not work in this way. You lacked spiritual eyesight, and you needed the heavenly anointing, that you might see that the work of God was founded in a sacrifice, and only by a sacrifice can it be carried forward.",
