To the parents in this day, as well as to the Israelites, God declares: \"These words . . . shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as \n                                                                           80\nfrontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.\" . . .",
