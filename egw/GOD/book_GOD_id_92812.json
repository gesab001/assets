    "word": "Now, in these last days of this earth's history, the commandment-keeping people of God by keeping His law are to make earnest efforts to exalt the Lord God of heaven. The Word of God is specific, marking to a certainty the opposing influences against the seventh-day Sabbath, which is the sign of God and by which the loyalty of His people is tested. \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily My Sabbaths \n\n\n                                   -31- \n\nye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.",
