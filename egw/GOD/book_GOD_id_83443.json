    "word": "There is a boundary to the mercy of God, for He does not always strive with men. A record is kept of all the blessings offered and how those blessings are treated; and if we neglect our duty we shall soon see, as did the Jews, that the anger of God is not withheld but we shall be given over to the power of Satan. While it seems astonishing to us that the Jews rejected Christ, we ourselves will act out the same thing if we refuse the light for this time.",
