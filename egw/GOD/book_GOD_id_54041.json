    "word": "I was shown that the usefulness of young ministers, married or unmarried, is often destroyed by attachment shown to them by young females. They do not realize that other eyes are upon them, and that the course pursued by them may have a tendency to very much injure the influence of the minister they give so much attention. If they would strictly regard the rules of propriety, it would be much better for them, \n                                                                           127\nand much better for their ministers. It places him in a disagreeable position, and causes others to look upon him in a wrong light. Yet I saw that the burden of the matter rests upon the ministers. They should show a distaste to these things, and if they take the course God would have them, they will not be troubled long. It is their duty to cut off every appearance of evil, and when young females are very sociable, it is their duty to let them know such things are not pleasing. They must repulse this forwardness, even if they are thought to be rude. Such things need a rebuke, in order to save the cause from being brought into disrepute. If young females are converted to the truth, and to God, they can bear this, and will be reformed.",
