    "word": "The tree of knowledge of good and evil represents worldly schools. \n\n\n     \"Shall the education given in our schools be after God's order, or after the wisdom of this world, which the Lord pronounces foolishness? Shall the hearts of students become estranged from God by eating of the tree of knowledge, which hardens the heart into disobedience, and ministers to vanity and pride? Shall not the education given in our schools be of that character which will give a more decided knowledge of God's Word, and which will bring the soul into a vital connection with God, keeping God before the mind's eye, and arousing every better feeling in the soul? This is the kind of education which is as enduring as eternity.\"--P.C.",
