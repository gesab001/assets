    "word": "I have had that cloud settle upon me at times, but I knew that God was there just the same. . . . \"Ask in faith, nothing wavering.\" Don't let one single suggestion of the devil come in. It is to be \"nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea\" (verse 6). The Lord will do great things for us if we will only show our trust in Him.--Manuscript 93a, July 23, 1899.",
