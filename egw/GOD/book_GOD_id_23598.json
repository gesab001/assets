We tried to call up our greatest trials, but they looked so small compared with the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory that surrounded us, that we could not speak \n83\nthem out, and we all cried out, \u201cAlleluia! heaven is cheap enough!\u201d and we touched our glorious harps and made heaven\u2019s arches ring.\u2014LS 67.",
