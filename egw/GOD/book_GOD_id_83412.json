    "word": "Nimes, October 16, 1886. It is Sabbath. Brother Ings spoke in the early morning meeting, also in the afternoon upon the restoration of the Sabbath. All seemed to be pleased with his talk. I spoke in the forenoon and evening. In the afternoon there was a social meeting and sixteen intelligent testimonies were borne by those who had embraced the Sabbath. All were much pleased to listen to these testimonies which were interpreted to us. These witnesses for God were indeed to reflect light in this wicked city.",
