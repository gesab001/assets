    "word": "Please bear in mind, if the minds of believers are not appropriating to themselves the promises of God, and receiving by faith the higher influences, emanating from heaven, they are appropriating the lower influences. Every moral action leaves its imprint upon the moral character. The conversation at the table, the conversation at the fireside, the spirit that pervades the family circle, testifies whether we are faithful in our daily duties. Through the constant culture of correct habits we are becoming qualified for \n35\nthe upbuilding of the church, fitted to feed the sheep and the lambs, and prepared, through a faithful discharge of every duty to hear the heavenly benediction, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant;... enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d",
