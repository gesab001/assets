    "word": "You will need to have patience with the tardy ones, who do not feel the necessity of doing anything promptly, thoroughly, earnestly. They have so much to say, so much unbelief to express, and so much criticizing, that they lose the peace and joy and happiness in the purposes of God before they can decide to move. We must become men and women of God's opportunity. I am so glad that so much harmonious action has been shown in striving to carry out this purpose of God, and to make the most of His providences.--Letter 141, 1900, pp. 1-3, 6, 7. (To Brethren Magan and Sutherland, October, 1900,)",
