    "word": "God has a living testimony, not a tame, lifeless, sermonizing. Men in responsible positions are not to study to meet the world's plans, to cater to the world's ideas, to speak smooth words and prophesy deceit. The Comforter--the Holy Spirit of God whom Christ said the Father would send in His name--with unsparing lips reproves the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. \"Reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and doctrine.\" 2 Timothy 4:2.",
