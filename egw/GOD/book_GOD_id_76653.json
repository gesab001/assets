    "word": "To my brethren who are carrying responsibilities in the Southern field I would say: Having begun a good work in harmony with the will of God, do not abandon it now because of difficulties; for this would result in the loss of an agency that might be made a power for good in warning the people of Nashville and other cities of the South. To give up at this time, would also bring discouragement to those who might be involved in the surrender, and to many others who would be affected by the influence of such a decision. For our brethren to question and waver, and submit to defeat, at the Nashville Sanitarium, would be detrimental to the best interests of the cause of God in the Southern States.",
