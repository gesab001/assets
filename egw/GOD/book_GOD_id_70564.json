    "word": "Afflictions are oft mercies in disguise. We know not what we might have been without them. When God in His mysterious providence overthrows all our cherished plans, and we may receive sorrow in the place of joy, we will bow in submission and say, \u201cThy will, O God, be done.\u201d We must and we will ever cherish a calm, religious trust in One who loves us, who gave His life for us. \u201cThe Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?\u201d . . .",
