    "word": "Every one is accountable to God for these few golden moments of probationary time. God will not require of man a more strict account than how his time has been occupied. Have we done our work with fidelity? Have we wasted and abused our precious time? God has given us the precious boon of life, not to be devoted to selfish gratification. Our work is too solemn, the time to serve God and our fellow-men too short, to seek for fame. We must seek to be spiritual, intellectual Christians. If men would only stop in their aspirations, where God has set the bounds, what a different service would the Lord have. The mind that is desirous of obtaining the favor of men will pursue a course that will sacrifice principle. True elevation and fidelity are constantly being sacrificed. Men who have souls to save or lose are in jeopardy in having such examples given them from professed Christians.",
