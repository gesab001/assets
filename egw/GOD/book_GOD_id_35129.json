    "word": "God does not want us to place ourselves upon the judgment seat and judge each other. . . . When we see errors in others, let us remember that we have faults graver, perhaps, in the sight of God than the fault we condemn in our brother. Instead of publishing his defects, ask God to bless him and to help him to overcome his error. Christ will approve of this spirit \n128\nand action, and will open the way for you to speak a word of wisdom that will impart strength and help to him who is weak in the faith.",
