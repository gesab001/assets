    "word": "\"Again, the devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and saith unto Him, All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me.\" Verses 8, 9. He did not present the kingdoms of the world as they now appear, but in all the glory and attraction in which it is possible to present them. He desired that Christ should acknowledge him as His superior, and on this condition promised to give the world into His hands. But could Jesus admit that the world belonged to Satan? Could He acknowledge the usurper as His superior, when there was but One to whom he owed homage? \"Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\" Verse 10.",
