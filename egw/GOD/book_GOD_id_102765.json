    "word": "God blesses the work of men's hands. They are to act their part as faithful stewards by returning to the Lord his portion. They are to devote their means to his service, that his vineyard may not remain a barren waste. They are to study what course the Lord would pursue were he in their place. They are to take all difficult matters to the Lord in prayer. They are not to use all the means at their command in supplying with an over abundance of facilities the portion of the vineyard in which they are placed. They are to unselfishly impart that which they have to the Lord's workers in hard places. They are to study methods and ways whereby their fellow workers shall have opportunity to improve their portion of the Lord's vineyard. All God's workers are to reveal an unselfish interest in the building up of the work in all parts of the vineyard. The Lord's principles are to be carried out with clear, sharp discernment.",
