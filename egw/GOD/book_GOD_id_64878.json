    "word": "No Concealing of Sins From God. God sees the sinner. The eye which never slumbers knows everything that is done. It is written in His book. One may conceal his sin from father, mother, wife, and friends, and yet all lies open before God, and is placed in His book of record. . . . David was a repentant man, and although he confessed and hated his sin, he could not forget it.",
