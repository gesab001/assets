    "word": "It has become customary in many families, with parents as well as with children, to be more pleasant when in the society of others than in their own home. This is not the plan that God has devised for parents and children. Save some of your smiles and praise and courtesy for the home circle. You should strive to be tender, thoughtful, kind, to exercise Christian politeness in the home. The gracious spirit of home religion is to be cultivated. . . .",
