    "word": "When men are not under the control of the Word and the Spirit of God, they are captives of Satan, and we know not to what lengths he may lead them in sin. The patriarch Jacob beheld those who take pleasure in wickedness. He saw what would be the result of association with them, and in the Spirit he exclaimed, \"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united\" (Genesis 49:6). He lifts up the danger signal, to warn every soul against such associations. The apostle Paul echoes the warning: \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness\" (Ephesians 5:11). \"Be not deceived: Evil company doth corrupt good manners\" (1 Corinthians 15:33, R.V.).",
