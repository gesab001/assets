    "word": "E. G. White: [It is a haphazard method, which God does not approve. To men who have suggested such tests, I have said, \"No, no.\" The sacred things which concern the cause of God must not be dealt with by such methods. God does not instruct us that we are to learn His will in any such way.  {2SM 327.2]  \n     Will it furnish us with experiences that will glorify God, for us to decide what is His will by the dropping of a card or a coin, and observing how it falls? No, no. Such tests as this will spoil the religious experience of the one who adopts them. Everyone who depends upon such things for guidance, needs to be reconverted. [INSERTED BY MRS. E. G. WHITE WHEN READING THIS REPORT.]}",
