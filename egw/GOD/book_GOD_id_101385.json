    "word": "The Lord has bidden us look to Jesus for spiritual knowledge, not that we may hide the light under a bushel, but that it may give light to all who are in the house. God has given his Son \"for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.\" (Please read also Isaiah 43:9-13;  44:3-8.)",
