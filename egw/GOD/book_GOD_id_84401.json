    "word": "My other little one is many hundred miles from me. Sometimes Satan tempts me to complain and think my lot is a hard one, but I will not harbor this temptation. I should not want to live unless I could live to do some good to others. I want all self to die. I have this consolation that God is pleased with my sacrifice, that of offering up my children to him. Do pray for me. I need much grace to perform my duty faithfully and deliver the straight message that God lays upon me to deliver.--Letter 30, 1850, pp. 2, 3. (To Brother and Sister Loveland, December 13, 1850.)",
