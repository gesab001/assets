    "word": "God presents before us two classes. For the one--the wicked--He says, \"There is no peace\" [Isaiah 48:22]. Of the other, \"Great peace have they that love thy law: and nothing shall offend them\" [Psalms 119:165]. Of that law He says, \"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments \n\n\n                                    -237- \n\nof the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward\" [Psalms 19:7-11]. We should deem our service for God a pleasure, and should make it the expression of our love for Him.",
