    "word": "Omnipotence, God Exerts, Over Himself--The longsuffering of God is remarkable, for it indicates that He is putting constraint upon His own attributes. It is His omnipotence exerted over Himself. Why has the Lord borne with the continual increase of defiance against His laws, given to govern the human agencies He has created?  He has borne long with their perversity, and at the same time He has been giving continual light to those who remain obedient. He sees that life is becoming intolerable because of cruelty. This is because men have changed His laws.--Ms 59, 1906. \n\n\n                                     -350-",
