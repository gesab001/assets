    "word": "The Pope has changed the day of rest from the seventh to the first day, and has thought to change the very commandment that was given to cause man to remember his Creator, so that the nations might not forget God. He has thought to change the greatest commandment in the decalogue, and thus make himself equal with God, or even exalt himself above God. I saw that God is unchangeable, therefore his law is immutable; but the Pope had exalted himself above God, in seeking to change his immutable precepts of holiness, justice and goodness. He has trampled under foot God's Sanctified Day, and put in its place one of the six laboring days, on his own authority. And the whole nation has followed after the beast, and every week they \u201crob God\u201d of his Holy Time. The Pope has made a breach in the holy law of God, but I saw that the time had fully come for this breach to be made up by the people of God, and the waste places built up.",
