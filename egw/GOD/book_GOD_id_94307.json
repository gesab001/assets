    "word": "Well is it for us that God is full of pity and compassion. He has given command that the wheat and the tares are to grow together until the harvest. He sees that the roots of the wheat are entwined with the roots of the tares, and that if the tares were ruthlessly torn up, the wheat also would be disturbed; and He says, \"Let both grow together until the harvest.\" The Lord alone can separate the wheat from the tares, and this He will do at the appointed time.",
