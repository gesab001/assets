    "word": "Danger By Night. We are nineteen hours behind time. We had to stand still some twelve hours. Freight train wrecked ten miles ahead on the track. We passed the washouts night before last. I was aroused suddenly as though a hand was laid upon me, and words had been spoken, \"You are in a dangerous place. Pray, pray.\" I looked out the window and saw a fearful-looking sight. Fires were built along beside the track, and men with lanterns were standing by the track and men upon the platform, making the fearful places light as day. The train merely moved over these dangerous places. I did pray, and I felt trust in God and an assurance that He would care for us and bring us safely to our journey's end.",
