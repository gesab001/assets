R. \n\n\n                       \"Sunnyside\", Cooranbong, April 17, 1899. \n\nTo Our Chief Physician: \n\n\n     My dear brother,--- \n\n\n     I have  a most intense interest in you and your work, and I pray that the Lord will guide my pen as I write to you. The Lord has made you a man of His appointment, and the angels of God have been your helpers. The Lord has placed you in the position that you occupy, not because you are infallible, but because He desires to guide your mind by His Holy Spirit. He desires you to impart to those with whom you come in contact a knowledge of present truth. Grave responsibilities have been entrusted to you, and on no account should you allow yourself to be entangled in work that will weaken your influence with Seventh-day Adventists. The Lord has chosen you to fill a place of His appointment, to stand before the medical profession, not to be moulded, but to mould minds. Every day you are to be under the supervision of God. He is your Maker, your Redeemer. He has a work for you to do, not separated from Seventh-day Adventists, but united with them.  You are to be a great blessing to your brethren by giving them the knowledge that He has given you.",
