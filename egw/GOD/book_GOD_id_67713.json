    "word": "Enoch walked with God. He was of one mind with God. The prophet asks, \"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?\" If we are of one mind with God, our will will be swallowed up in God's will and we shall follow wherever God leads the way. As a loving child places his hand in that of his father, and walks with him in perfect trust whether it is dark or bright, so the sons and daughters of God are to walk with Jesus through joy or sorrow. . . .",
