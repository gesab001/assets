    "word": "The Lord has given you great blessings. Will you then show that you appreciate your position of trust, as not created by yourself but by the Lord God of heaven? My brother, you can pursue a course that will deprive you of the wisdom God has given you; but I do not want you to do this. I want you to remain as true as steel to your God and to your brethren. Just as soon as you begin to show a sense of superiority and a masterly spirit, the Lord will work to show that He is God and not man. Walk humbly with God. Bear in humility all the honor God has seen fit to give you. Do not exalt yourself \n\n\n                                     -47- \n\nand demerit your brethren; for then you show distinctly that the Spirit of the Lord is departing from you, and that you will be left to your own wisdom.",
