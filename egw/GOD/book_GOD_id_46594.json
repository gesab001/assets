    "word": "The Book an Ally in Work of Reform.--In his position as king, it was the work of Josiah to carry out in the Jewish nation the principles taught in the Book of the law. This he endeavored to do faithfully. In the Book of the law itself he found a treasure of knowledge, a powerful ally in the work of reform (GCB April 1, 1903). \n                                                                           1039\n {2BC 1038.10}  \n     2 (2 Chronicles 34:30). Josiah's View of His Highest Position.--To be a reader of the Book of the law, containing a \"Thus saith the Lord,\" Josiah regarded as the highest position that he could occupy. . . . The highest work of princes in Israel,--of physicians, of teachers in our schools, as well as of ministers and those who are in positions of trust in the Lord's institutions,--is to fulfill the responsibility resting upon them to fasten the Scriptures in the minds of the people as a nail in a sure place, to use their God-given talent of influence to impress the truth that \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" For the leaders in Israel to extend a knowledge of the Scriptures in all their borders is to promote spiritual health; for God's Word is a leaf from the tree of life (MS 14, 1903).",
