    "word": "What shall we do for London? London has received too little attention. That which has been done by Elder Jones (the Seventh Day Baptist) in advocating the Sabbath of the fourth commandment has amounted to very little, and as long as he works in the lines in which he is now working, his work will amount to still less. The truth, the present truth, the truth for this time, is what is needed in London. We should enter the great cities with the message of God's truth; but without means or workers, we have a most discouraging outlook for work of this kind. But if the work is not entered upon when circumstances look forbidding, it will never be accomplished. \n\n\n                                    -7- \n\nThere must be far less mincing about the matter, and far greater firmness, assurance, and faith.",
