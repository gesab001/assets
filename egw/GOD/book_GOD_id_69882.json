    "word": "After resting upon the seventh day, God sanctified it, or set it apart, as a day of rest for humankind. Following the example of the Creator, dwellers on earth were to rest upon this sacred day, that as they should look upon the heavens and the earth, they might reflect upon God\u2019s great work of creation; and that as they should behold the evidences of God\u2019s wisdom and goodness, their hearts might be filled with love and reverence for their Maker.",
