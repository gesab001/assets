    "word": "Now, here is the word: \"That the world may believe that thou hast sent me, And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them\" [verse 21]. That is what we are waiting for here; we want some of that glory; and it is our privilege to have it. There is darkness enough in the world, and we want the light of the glory of God to lighten our pathway and to lighten the pathway of others. We want some of that glory, that you may go forth to your labors with that glory shining upon our countenances, expressed in your words and in your testimonies, that it will make an impression on minds wherever you go.",
