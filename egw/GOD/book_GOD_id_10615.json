    "word": "The First Duty to God \n\n     Some have felt under sacred obligations to their children. They must give each a portion, but feel themselves unable to raise means to aid the cause of God. They make the excuse that they have a duty to their children. This may be right, but their first duty is to God. . . . Let no one throw in his claims and lead you to rob God. Let not your children steal your offering from God's altar for their own benefit.--1T 220.",
