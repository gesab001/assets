    "word": "Christ says you may be known by all men if ye have love one for another. Now in order to have this love in the heart one for another it must be cultivated, and if this grace is attained then you will be a spectacle unto the world and to angels. We have a great truth and we must seek to be in harmony with it. If we are living stones we should emit light, and have an influence upon others for their good. If every member should seek to honor God then you would be a power that would be felt. We want an increase of faith. We need a faith that will enable us to meet infidelity.",
