    "word": "For two or three years my mind continued to be locked to an understanding of the Scriptures. In the course of our labors, my husband and I visited Father Andrews, [SEE NOTE ON PAGE 206.] who was suffering intensely with inflammatory rheumatism. We prayed for him. I laid my hands on his head, and said, \"Father Andrews, the Lord Jesus maketh thee whole.\" He was healed instantly. He got up, and walked about the room, praising God, and saying, \"I never saw it on this wise before. Angels of God are in this room.\" The glory of the Lord was revealed. Light seemed to shine all through the house, and an angel's hand was laid upon my head. From that time to this I have been able to understand the Word of God.",
