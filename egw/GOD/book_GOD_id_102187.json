    "word": "He must put out of his life all superficial reading, for if his mind is filled with trash the Holy Spirit cannot work and impress the mind with truth, and bring right things to the memory. He is beginning to form an appetite for trashy reading -- an appetite like the inebriate's. He cannot possibly understand the Word and practice the truth, bringing it into the home life and having a mind for prayer -- being instant in prayer. There has been a dishonoring of God by nonconformity to the Word of God. He should have brought truth and righteousness into his home. He should have established the family altar and should keep the sacrificial offering, the praises of his lips, ascending to God. He should be most earnestly seeking for a power from above to exercise in his own family.",
