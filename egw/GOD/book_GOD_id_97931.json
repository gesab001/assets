    "word": "Christ died for the sins of the world that we might have an opportunity of showing to the universe loyalty to God and His law. Today He is making an atonement for us before the Father. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous\" [1 John 2:1]. Pointing to the palms of His hands, pierced by the fury and prejudice of wicked men, He says of us, \"I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands.\" The Father bows in recognition of the price paid for humanity, and the angels approach the cross of Calvary \n\n\n                 -113- \n\nwith reverence.
