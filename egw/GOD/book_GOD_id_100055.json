    "word": "Again, my brother, I tell you that you know not what manner of spirit you are of. You have great zeal, but it is not a zeal that God imparts. The Great I AM speaks to you, Know thyself. The spirit you have brought to the investigation of Scriptures is the very same spirit the Jews possessed in the days of Christ. They thought they knew it all; they thought they were wise and could learn nothing. Christ said, \"Ye have ears, but ye hear not; ye have eyes but ye see not.\" The prejudice, the self-esteem, the pride of heart which you now possess, unless it is removed by the spirit of God, will cause you to walk in the sparks of your own kindling, and lie down in sorrow. There can be no calamity greater that could come to our conferences, than for men to go to the different churches with such a blind zeal, and such a lofty self-sufficient spirit as some have carried through this meeting. Ourself being one of them, I tell you in the name of the Lord to search your own heart. Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, else He will humble you. Seek the Lord; break your heart by falling on the Rock, Christ Jesus.",
