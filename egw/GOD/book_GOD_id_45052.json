    "word": "To bow down when in prayer to God is the proper attitude to occupy. This act of worship was required of the three Hebrew captives in Babylon. . . .

In doing so, they would, to all intents and purposes, be bowing to the king of Babylon.

But Christ came in person and walked with them through the fire, and they received no harm.",
