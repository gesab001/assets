    "word": "Bro. Howard, in your labors in the tract and missionary work, you should have the spirit of Christ in all you do and say. You need the spirit of the Great Teacher. You need the spirit of a little child, conscious of your weakness, and willing to be instructed in the right way. If you had this spirit, you would not be dry and formal, and lifeless, you would learn from the Great Teacher precious lessons of wisdom. Self-esteem, which is hateful to God, has been nourished and strengthened by many of our brethren, and some of them have thought it a virtue to criticize the ideas, plans and work of others. Brn. Madison and Howard Miller, have taken \n                                                                           391\na prominent part in criticizing plans which were made for the advancement of the work. They have felt that they must fasten upon everything objectionable, and make every difficulty apparent; and if their opinions had been received, and their counsel acted upon, far less would have been done, than has been accomplished to advance the work of God. While they are ready to suggest plans, and to criticize the efforts of others, they do not put their whole soul in the work, even to carry out their own plans. It is not pleasant for others to unite with them, because of their habit of holding back and criticizing. It is hard for workers to advise with them, or for them to take advice. When these men are placed upon committees to consult in regard to ways and means to advance the cause of God, they often burden the work with criticisms, so that it is difficult to carry it forward. Their words not only fail to give encouragement, but often they are a positive hindrance.",
