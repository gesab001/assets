    "word": "When Irritated, Refuse to Speak.--Let those who are easily irritated refuse to retaliate when words that vex them are spoken. Let them seek the Lord in prayer, asking Him to show them how to work for souls perishing in sin. He who keeps busy in this work will be so thoroughly imbued with the Spirit of God that his manners, his voice, his whole life, will be a revelation of Christ. Try it, brethren, try it. Crucify self, in the place of seeking to crucify your brethren. \"If any man will come after Me,\" Christ said, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me\" (Matthew 16:24).--Lt 11, 1905.",
