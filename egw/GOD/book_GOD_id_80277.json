    "word": "This is the message given by God to be sounded forth in the loud cry of the third angel. The sign or seal of God is the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, and the Lord's memorial of his work of creation. \"The Lord spake unto Moses saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am Lord that doth sanctify you.\" Here the Sabbath is clearly defined as a sign between God and his people.",
