    "word": "NO SEA.\u2014The sea divides friends. It is a barrier between us and those whom we love. Our associations are broken up \n139\nby the broad, fathomless ocean. In the New Earth there will be no more sea, and there shall pass there \u201cno galley with oars.\u201d In the past many who have loved and served God have been bound by chains to their seats in galleys, compelled to serve the purpose of cruel, hardhearted men. The Lord has looked upon their suffering in sympathy and compassion. Thank God, in the earth made new there will be no fierce torrents, no engulfing ocean, no restless, murmuring waves.\u2014Ms 33, 1911 quoted in Mar 351.",
