    "word": "This departure from God and his word has for a long time been coming in; and it was God who called the attention of several of our brethren to the Scriptures, calling upon them to dig for the truth which had been buried beneath customs and traditions, as for hidden treasure. Truths which to many minds have been a great mystery are to be unfolded. \"The word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" This word is in a special sense to be proclaimed, that those who believe in Christ as a personal Saviour may have eternal life.",
