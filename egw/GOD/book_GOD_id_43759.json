They contain all that I have ever been shown in regard to the definite time of the Lord's coming. \n                                                                           76\nI have not the slightest knowledge as to the time spoken by the voice of God. I heard the hour proclaimed, but had no remembrance of that hour after I came out of vision. Scenes of such thrilling, solemn interest passed before me as no language is adequate to describe. It was all a living reality to me, for close upon this scene appeared the great white cloud, upon which was seated the Son of man.-- Letter 38, 1888.",
