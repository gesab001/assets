    "word": "Parents are not thorough in the education of their children. They do not see the necessity of molding the minds of their children by discipline that they should. They give them a superficial education, manifesting greater care for an ornamental rather than a solid education which would develop the faculties, and direct them to bring out the energies of the soul, that the powers of the mind should expand and strengthen by exercise. The faculties of the mind need cultivation that they may be exercised to the glory of God. Careful attention should be given to the culture of the intellect, that the varied organs of the mind may have equal strength, by being brought into exercise, each in their distinctive office.
