    "word": "The moment you grasp God's promises by faith and say, I am the lost sheep that Jesus came to save, a new life will take possession of you, and you will receive strength to resist the tempter.

You must not look for some great change to take place; you must not expect to feel some wonderful emotion. . . .",
