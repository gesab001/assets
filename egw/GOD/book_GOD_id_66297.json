    "word": "In every family, especially where there are children, there is a want of deeper piety, of the sanctifying grace of Christ brought into the home. Missionary endeavour should consist more in imparting than in receiving. The question is, Are not home duties \u2014 home missionary work \u2014 neglected? I answer, Yes, Were the love and fear of God circulating through every household, the children and youth instructed as they should be, the conversation of an educational character, that they should feel their accountability to use their intellect and hearts to do the work assigned them of God, the children would co-operate with their parents in the dedication of their time and talents to the service of God. In this kind of education and labour the expenditure would not exceed the receipts. Christian activity and growth of personal piety will be symmetrical and proportionate.",
