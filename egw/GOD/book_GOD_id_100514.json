My physical strength is still small but I will continue to believe. When the time comes that I shall stand before the people at eleven o'clock a.m. then I shall realize an all-efficient Helper for my time of need, for the promises of God will not fail me. \"I will not leave you comfortless: I will \n                                                                           883\ncome to you.\" \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\" John 14:18, 27.",
