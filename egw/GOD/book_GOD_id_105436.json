    "word": "\"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; \n                                                                           419\nthey shall mount up with wings and eagles.\" The man who waits upon the Lord is strong in His strength, strong enough to hold firm under great pressure. Yet he is easy to be entreated on the side of mercy and compassion, which is the side of Christ. The soul that is submissive to God is ready to do the will of God; he diligently and humbly seeks to know that will. He accepts discipline, and is afraid to walk according to his own finite judgment. He communes with God, and his conversation is in heaven.",
