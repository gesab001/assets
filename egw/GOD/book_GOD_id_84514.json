    "word": "Those who beg at midnight for loaves to feed the hungry souls, will be successful. The law of God is that as we receive we are to impart. . . . In the name of the Lord I entreat you, ask and receive the Holy Spirit. Press to the side of Christ. But this Spirit can only be received by those who are consecrated, who will deny self, lifting the cross and following the Lord.--Letter 10, 1899.",
