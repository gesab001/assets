    "word": "How artfully had Satan approached Eve in Eden! \u201cYea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\u201d Thus far every word that Satan spoke was truth, but his manner of saying them was a disguised contempt for the words of God. There was in his words of truth a covert negative, a denial, a doubt of the divine truthfulness. He sought to instill into her mind the thought that God would not do as He had said, that the withholding of such beautiful fruit was a contradiction of His love and compassion for them.",
