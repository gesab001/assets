    "word": "In fields where the conditions are so objectionable and disheartening that many workers refuse to go to them, most remarkable changes for the better may be brought about by the efforts of self-sacrificing lay members.

The amount of good that these workers accomplish will never be known in this world. 7T 22, 23.",
