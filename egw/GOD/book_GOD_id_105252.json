    "word": "\"All heaven is filled with amazement that when this love, so broad, so deep, so rich, so full, is presented to men who have known the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, they are so indifferent, so cold and unmoved. What does it mean that such amazing grace does not soften our hard hearts? Oh, it is because of the power of unbelief - because \"thou hast left thy first love.\" This is why the Word of God has so little influence. It is as a fire, but it cannot penetrate nor warm the ice bound heart that cherishes unbelief.",
