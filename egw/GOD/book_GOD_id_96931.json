    "word": "Here is my family that will be sanctified because of my right course of action. If I have spoken defiling words, if guile has passed my lips, if I have been peevish and cross, then I shall lie against the truth which I claim to believe. Therefore I will not be on that side of the question at all. I will have my mouth clean and my tongue sanctified. I will have my heart sanctified that I shall not take up a rumor against my brother, because I am told in the Word of God that he that taketh up a reproach against his neighbor shall not dwell in the hill of the Lord. [Psalms 15:3] Therefore, I must have clean hands and a pure heart, for it is they that shall stand in the hill of the Lord. Now, I want to be of that number that shall stand in the hill of the Lord. It does not make one whit of difference with my character whether anyone shall think ill of me or think good of me. It does not affect me, but it will affect them. May God help us that we may come up to that very place where we can appreciate these things. \n\n\n                                     -77-",
