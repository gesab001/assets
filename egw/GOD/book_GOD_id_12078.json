    "word": "You know how it was with Brother -----. He wrote much, and he thought that what he wrote should be published. Then the Lord wrought upon his mind, and he gave up the idea, and burned up his manuscript. But he could not let it be, he reproduced his theories, and upon his death he left money and charged his wife that she should have his manuscript published. She did not think it so essential that the matter should be published as he did, and after she had given the manuscript into the hands of the proper persons for publication, she withdrew it and gave up all the burden of its publication. Brother -----'s production was never printed. He was a good man, beloved of all who knew him; but the matter which he had brought together was not the subject that should appear, not meat in due season for the flock of God. It was of a character that would start into life erroneous theories that would be nourished by human agents, and would bear fruit in dissension and discord.",
