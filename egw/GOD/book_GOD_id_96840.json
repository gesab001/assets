    "word": "Christ said to His disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world. . . . Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\" [Matthew 5:14-16]. It may seem to you that you have shown great self-denial and self-sacrifice in obeying God's law. Does He require more self-denial on your part than He has shown for you, that you should not perish but have eternal life? He has led the way, will you follow? He says, \"I have kept my Father's commandments\" [John 15:10]. Will you keep the commandments of God? He left the royal throne in heaven, and changed the crown of glory for one of thorns. He placed His feet in the blood-stained path which led the way to Calvary. He has told us that those who will be partakers with Him in His sufferings, will be made partakers with Him in His glory also.",
