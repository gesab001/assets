    "word": "Purchase of Sunnyside--The plat of land I am to purchase [Sunnyside, Cooranbong, Australia] costs me $1,350. I have forty acres and it was supposed I would have twenty; but I want to embrace as much as forty acres, for some must be left as woodland and a portion for grazing and cultivation. Sometimes I think forty is scarcely sufficient. The purchase of this land is really a necessity for the school, and everything seems to be struggling to advance. Why we are here is that we shall have a suitable place to have the children who attend school receive all the benefits of a healthful, beautiful location, and our influence will be a help to many souls if we continue in the love of God. . . .",
