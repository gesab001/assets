    "word": "It becomes every one who has any connection with the work of God to move modestly and cautiously, if he would not be deceived by the enemy of souls. If you do not individually have divine enlightenment, you will certainly make great mistakes; you will call good evil, and evil good. I have been shown that you should have less burden of form, and a greater burden to see deep heart work in the Sabbath-school. Every teacher in the school should feel that he is a missionary for God. He must improve his moments and his ability to obtain a knowledge of the Word of God, that he may impart the same to his scholars. Teachers will become disqualified for their position if they are not learners. They need freshness of ideas, fresh, wise plans, life, tact, and spirit in their work. They must be apt to teach.",
