    "word": "From the light I have, Brother Faulkhead can fill a position that cannot be filled by any other man you have in the new office. If he makes Christ his trust, he will do honor to the work. You cannot afford to spare him from the position he has filled for years. There is not a man who is so well fitted for the place, and the Lord will help him and impart to him new capabilities, if he seeks counsel and depends upon his God.",
