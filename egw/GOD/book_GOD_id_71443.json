    "word": "Now the work that is before us we want clearly to understand. It is a work of mercy, a work of love, a work just in Christ's lines. Just as Christ worked.

It is not the man's work. He is not to feel that all he has to do is to attend to his own individual self. No, there is a broader field. He is to occupy \"till I come,\" and what is it to occupy? To be laborers together with God. Therefore, it is of the greatest consequence that we understand in clear lines what it is to be laborers together with God.",
