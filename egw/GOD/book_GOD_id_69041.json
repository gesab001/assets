    "word": "Many act in this our day as though this were a matter of small importance. But had the human family, even after the fall of Adam, worked according to the example of Christ, every father and every mother would leave their children an example of how to conduct themselves so as to fulfill their obligations to God, then the world would have been as Eden.
