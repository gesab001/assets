    "word": "All are to gather the precious treasures of love, not merely for every soul who has his hand and heart in the work of the ministry; for all who do this work are the Lord's. Through them he works. Learn lessons of love from the life of Jesus. Let men be careful how they speak to their fellow-men. There is to be no egotism no lording it over God's heritage. A bitter answer should not rise in any mind or heart. No tinge of scorn be heard in the voice. Speak a word of your own, take an indifferent attitude, show suspicion, prejudice, jealousy -- and by mismanagement the work may be done for a soul.",
