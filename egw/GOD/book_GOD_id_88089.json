    "word": "In His Word God has marked out a plan for the education of children, and this plan parents are to follow. They are to teach their children to overcome every indolent habit. Each child should be taught that he has a work to do in the world. Mothers, there is no work more important than the training of your children for usefulness in this life. It is in the home that a child shows whether he is prepared to take his place in the world.",
