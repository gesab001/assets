    "word": "No man is called by God, in the use of the talents entrusted to him, to lay off his individual responsibility that another man may do his trading for him. To every man God has given his work, and man is accountable to God for how that work is done. The soul that accepts the great trust that God has given him, cannot transfer that talent to another. No man can transfer his influence to another person, to serve for him, or to be mind or judgment for him.",
