    "word": "Wednesday, April 18, 1900.--The Lord has blessed me, greatly blessed me, as I have taken my position in regard to the amusement question and the games which have been unwisely introduced by the faculty, without one word of counsel with me. We should not forget the things which have happened in the past in America. Little did I suppose that these games would be introduced and carried on upon the anniversary of the opening of our school in Cooranbong. Was this the service of thanksgiving that should have been rendered to God? I feel so sorry as I think of this, and I am instructed to say, All these movements should be sharply rebuked; for there has been no sparing of instruction on this point.--Ms 92, 1900, pp. 6-8. (Diary, April 16 to 18, 1900.) \n\nReleased May 20, 1977.",
