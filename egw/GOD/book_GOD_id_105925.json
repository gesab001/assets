    "word": "Speak gently to ministers who are seeking, fully as earnestly as your own self, to do their duty under difficulties. They are but men, with all the clamoring of Satan to discourage them. \"Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.\" Be careful to make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but rather let it be healed. \"Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.\"",
