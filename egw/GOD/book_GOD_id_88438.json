    "word": "MR No. 827 - Blessed Light from the Word of God\n\n     It is a great and grand thing to have an eye single to the glory of God. Self must not come into our serving. We need now to present the truth in its important bearings. We are to walk every step understandingly. Blessed light from the Word of God is to come to the people. No new and strange thing is to be introduced now, unless it is proved by much diligent investigation and most earnest prayer. Blessed light from the Word of God is ours to receive and in assurance give to people.--Letter 127, 1910. (Written to W. C. White from Sanitarium, California, November 22, 1910.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. January 8, 1981",
