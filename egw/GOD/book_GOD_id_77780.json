    "word": "Dr. Ginley is not blind to his peculiar temperament. He sees his failings, and when he feels the pressure upon him, he is disposed to beat a retreat, and turn his back upon the battle-field. But he will gain nothing by pursuing this course. He is situated where his surroundings, and the pressure of circumstances, is developing the strong points in his character, which need the rough edges removed, and he to be refined and elevated. For him to flee from the contest, will not remove the defects in his character. If Dr. Ginley should run away from the Health Institute, he does \n                                                                           45\nnot, in so doing, remove or overcome the defects in his character. He has a work before him, to overcome the defects in his character, if he would be among the number before the throne of God, without fault, who have come up through great tribulation, having washed their robes of character, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. The provisions have been made for us to wash. The fountain has been prepared by infinite expense, and the burden of washing rests upon us who are imperfect before God. The Lord does not propose to remove these spots of defilement without our doing anything on our part. We must wash our robes in the blood of the Lamb. We may lay hold of the merits of the blood of Christ by faith, and through his grace and power we may have strength to overcome our errors, our sins, our imperfections of character, and come off victorious, having washed our robes in the blood of the Lamb.",
