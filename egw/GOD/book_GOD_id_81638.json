    "word": "Bro. Amadon was connected with the work of God in the Office years ago. He was deficient in many respects, yet his interest and heart have been in the work. He has been devoted to the work, and labored hard and unselfishly. He has had the fear of God before him, and has worked to the best of his ability, yet he is not now as well qualified to bear responsibilities in the work as he was years ago. The enemy has worked through sister Amadon, and her influence has been such that it has worn upon her husband until he is almost unfitted for the work. Bro. Amadon is a one-idea man. He cannot take in many things at a time. He has not powers of discrimination. He does not take a course which commands respect of the hands in the Office. George is not qualified for the responsible position he occupies. But as there has not yet been a man raised up for the place, it has seemed necessary for him to work in the department he has. The position George now occupies should be filled by one of experience, who has a well-organized mind, that can see the many things requiring attention at a glance, and who is not easily confused; one who is unselfish and discriminating, courteous, kind, yet firm and decided to carry out the \n                                                                           30\nregulations of the Office. The care and responsibilities that George now bears are wearing his mind, for he is not adapted  to the work. It would be far better for George to take some position where he has not to direct, or have the charge of others.",
