    "word": "No Reproach but a Kindly Hand.--If you see one whose words or attitude shows that he is separated from God, do not blame him. It is not your work to condemn him, but come close to his side to help him. The parable of the straying sheep needs to be placed as a motto in every dwelling. The Divine Shepherd leaves the ninety and nine, and goes out into the wilderness to seek the one that is lost.",
