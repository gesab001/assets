    "word": "There, when the veil that darkens our vision shall be removed, and our eyes shall behold that world of beauty of which we now catch glimpses through the microscope; when we look on the glories of the heavens, now scanned afar through the telescope; when, the blight of sin removed, the whole earth shall appear in \u201cthe beauty of the Lord our God,\u201d what a field will be open to our study! There the student of science may read the records of creation and discern no reminders \n149\nof the law of evil. He may listen to the music of nature\u2019s voices and detect no note of wailing or undertone of sorrow. In all created things he may trace one handwriting\u2014in the vast universe behold \u201cGod\u2019s name writ large,\u201d and not in earth or sea or sky one sign of ill remaining.",
