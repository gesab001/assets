    "word": "There are among us ministers and church members who are not courteous and kind, who seem to have forgotten that in all they do or say they are either following a righteous or an unrighteous course, gathering with Christ or scattering from Him. Self is idolized. The burning ambition of the heart is to exalt self. Whether or not they are fitted for positions of trust in our institutions, they want to be first. They seek to grasp responsibilities that they have neither tact nor ability to carry. They have lost a sense of what is due from man to his fellow man, and in God's sight they are novices. By the spirit they cherish, by the words they speak and the deeds they do, they show that they have lost their first love.",
