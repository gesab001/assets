    "word": "What can I say more than I have said? The Old Testament should be studied most diligently. The New Testament does not present a lower standard than the Old. In his sermon on the mount Jesus set forth the very principles that came from his lips to Moses, to be given to the children of Israel. Christ delineated the duties of men to God and to their fellow men in much stronger lines, because through disobedience men had become confused in regard to God's claims. Read carefully the sermon on the mount.",
