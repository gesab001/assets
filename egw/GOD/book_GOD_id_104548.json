    "word": "God calls upon his people to be Christians in thought, in word, in deed. Luther made the statement that religion is never so much in danger as among reverend men. I can say that many who handle the truth are not sanctified through the truth. They have not the faith that works by love, and purifies the soul. They become accustomed to handling sacred things, and because of this, many handle the word of God irreverently. They have not walked in the light, but have closed their eyes to light.",
