    "word": "-308- \n\n     The soul temple must be cleansed, and the experience of many must be seen in its true light. The buyers and the sellers must be driven out, and the Spirit of God must take possession of heart and mind. Let none question their need of a personal Saviour. The Lord cannot use the worker into whose experience true conversion has not entered. Character must be formed after the divine pattern. We are to work with Christ in the forming of character after the divine similitude.",
