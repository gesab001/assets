    "word": "The light which the Lord has given should be respected for your own safety, as well as for the safety of the church of God. If the steps being taken by a few become established among the remnant people of God, you will certainly not be sustained of God for the Lord will bring to naught the counsels of the prudent--the ones who flattered themselves that they were prudent. It is made evident by your own course of action that you have laid your plans and purposes without the aid of the One mighty in counsel. The Lord will work. The men who come to these decisions need their eyes anointed with spiritual eyesalve. You have felt mighty in your own strength, and there is One who can bind the arm of the mighty and bring to naught the counsels of the prudent. \n     1 Peter 2:1-12.",
