    "word": "As a people we are certainly in great danger, if we are not constantly guarded, of considering our ideas, because long cherished, to be Bible doctrines and on every point infallible, and measuring everyone by the rule of our interpretation of Bible truth. This is our danger, and this would be the greatest evil that could ever come to us as a people. While I was in Europe I felt deeply moved by the Spirit of God, as I never did before, that there must be altogether a different spirit and element brought into our conferences. If one should hold ideas differing in some respects from that which we have heretofore entertained--not on vital points of truth--there should not be a firm, rigid attitude assumed that all is right in every particular, all is Bible truth without a flaw, that every point we have held is without mistake or cannot be improved. This I know to be dangerous business and it proceeds from that wisdom that is from beneath.",
