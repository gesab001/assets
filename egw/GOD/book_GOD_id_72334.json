    "word": "What does it amount to to live in this world dependent upon the applause and amusements that we can find here? Do these bring us happiness? No; they bring us only unrest and dissatisfaction, and at the same time we are losing the most precious treasure, the richest blessings that God can bestow upon us. We need to understand much more than we do the worth of our souls. We need to know what we shall do that we may work the works of God. \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent\" (John 6:29). He can be to us all that we desire.",
