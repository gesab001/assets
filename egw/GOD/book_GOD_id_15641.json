    "word": "Opposition Avoided by Personal Work.--In God's service obstacles must be met and difficulties encountered. Events belong to God; and His servants must meet with difficulties and opposition; for they are His chosen methods of discipline and His appointed conditions of sure progress, advancement, and success. But I entreat the servants of the Lord Jesus to remember that there is a work which may be done quietly, without arousing that strong opposition which closes hearts to the truth.--Letter 95, 1896.",
