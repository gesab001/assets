    "word": "When Christ came into the world, He was the origin of truth. The lessons He had given to the prophets had been placed in false settings, and it was His work to place them in the true. He was the foundation and the originator of all truth, and His work was to strip off all traditions of men, for they taught the commandments of men instead of the commandments of God. Those who had been in the school of the prophets, and had been obtaining their education, were considered to know more than all the nations and all other people upon the face of the earth. He turns to them and says, \"Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God\" [Matthew 22:29]. They saw trees as men walking. And why was not the truth distinct in their minds? The reason was, they were not connected with the God of all truth. \n\n\n                                      -107-",
