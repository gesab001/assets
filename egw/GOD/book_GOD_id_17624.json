    "word": "Parents, you have a work to do for your children which no other can do. You cannot shift your responsibilities upon another. The father's duty to his children cannot be transferred to the mother. If she performs her own duty, she has burden enough to bear. Only by working in unison, can the father and mother accomplish the work which God has committed to their hands.",
