    "word": "The rejection of the truth of the gospel by some prepares the way for its reception by others, who can see the weakness and inconsistency of the arguments used to make the truth of none effect. Thus those who oppose the counsel of God are by their inconsistency advancing the truth rather than hindering it. One thing we must be prepared to encounter: the enemy's determined resistance. He works through human agencies whom he can use to hold the people in ignorance of the word of the Lord.",
