    "word": "The working material in the church is mostly branches of three families, connected by marriage. There is talent, and good material to make workmen, in the church at Olcott, more than can be employed to good advantage in that locality. The entire church is not growing in spirituality. They are not favorably situated to call into exercise the talents God has given them, and develop strength. There is not room for all to work. One gets in the way of the other. There is a lack of spiritual strength. If the church in Olcott was less a family church, each would feel individual responsibility.",
