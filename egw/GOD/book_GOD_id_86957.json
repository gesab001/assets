    "word": "The believer who is imbued with a true missionary spirit, is a living epistle, known and read of all men. The truth goes forth from his lips in no feigned words. His piety and zeal and consecrated judgment grow with the passing days, and the unbelieving world sees that he is in living communion with God, and is learning of Him. The words spoken by converted lips are accompanied by a power that touches the cold hearts of unbelievers; for even those who know not God are enabled to distinguish between the human and the divine.",
