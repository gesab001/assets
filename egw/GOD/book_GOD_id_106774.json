    "word": "The Lord has reproved those who claim to believe present truth for failing to cooperate with Dr. Kellogg and his faithful co-workers in walking in the light of health reform. Dr. Kellogg is to stand as God's physician, and is to do an exalted work. But if he is left to follow his own judgment in all things, he will make mistakes. He is laboring beyond his strength. He is doing three times as much as he should do. This is not God's will. By thus overworking, he is shortening his life. He is God's property, and he should keep himself hidden with Christ in God. Dr. Kellogg must not embrace so much as he has done in the past. And in some things his planning must be different.",
