    "word": "At every institution where I go I testify that the Lord would have His workers reach a higher standard. It is His will that the Holy Spirit should indite our words, and give us speech that will impress hearts with the truth of God. It should be our aim to help all within our reach who need help. There are many in our sanitarium who have never enjoyed the privilege that the helpers have had. Let all see that you are attaining to a high standard of Christian experience. Let them see that you refuse to indulge in careless and trifling words. The sick are here; pray for them. God can do great things for the sick, believers and unbelievers, through the ministry and prayers of consecrated helpers.",
