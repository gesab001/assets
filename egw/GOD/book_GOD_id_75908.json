    "word": "\"All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field; the grass withereth, the flower fadeth; . . . but the word of our God shall stand forever.\" As God Himself is true, so surely will His word be fulfilled. \n                                                                           52\n\n     \"O Zion, that bringest good tidings, \n     Get thee up into the high mountain; \n     O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings \n     Lift up thy voice with strength; \n     Lift it up, be not afraid; \n     Say unto the cities of Judah, \n         Behold your God! \n     Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, \n     And His arm shall rule for Him; \n     Behold, His reward is with Him, \n     And His work before Him.\"",
