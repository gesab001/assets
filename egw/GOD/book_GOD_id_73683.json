    "word": "The requirement of the gospel is far-reaching. Says the apostle, \"Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him\" (Colossians 3:17). \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God\" (1 Corinthians 10:31). Practical piety will not be attained by giving the grand truths of the Bible a place in the outer courts of the heart. The religion of the Bible must be brought into the large and the little affairs of life. It must furnish the powerful motives and principles that will regulate the Christian's character and course of action. . . .",
