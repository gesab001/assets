    "word": "Truth, saving truth, must be given to the starving people, who are in darkness. I saw that many prayed for God to humble them; but if God answered their prayer, it would be by terrible things in righteousness. It was their duty to humble themselves. I saw that if self-exaltation was suffered to come in, it would surely lead souls astray, and if not overcome, prove their ruin. When one begins to get lifted up in his own eyes, and thinks he can do something, the Spirit of God is withdrawn, and he goes on in his own strength until he is overthrown. One saint, I saw, could move the arm of God if he were right; but a multitude together, if they were wrong, would be weak, and could effect nothing.",
