    "word": "Study the Revelation in connection with Daniel; for history will be repeated. We must be true and faithful amid the abounding iniquity that prevails. At no period of time are we in such danger as when prosperity seems to crown our efforts. Self must be hidden in God. We are living amid the perils of the last days, and many are insensible to the perils that threaten our world. We, with all our religious advantages, ought to know far more today than we do know. \"Watch, and pray,\" said Jesus, \"for ye know not when the time is.\" \"Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when ye think not.\" Repentance is not a desirable emotion. Christ said, \"Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\" The right eye is to be plucked out; the right hand is to be cut off. There is hidden depravity that needs to be carefully considered and uprooted. God help us individually to purify our souls by obeying the truth. \n\n\n                     - 56 -",
