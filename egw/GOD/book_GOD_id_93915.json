    "word": "You are to watch and pray, and remember that no matter how others may treat you, they cannot compel you to harbor a wrong thought or to perform a wrong action. We are daily deciding our own destiny, making it evident to the angels of God whether we are to enjoy the society of the saints in light, or to have the gates of heaven closed against us. We are not to consider our reputation so much as the honor of the cause of truth. Our reputation is in God's hands. We are to manifest zeal for the cause of God.",
