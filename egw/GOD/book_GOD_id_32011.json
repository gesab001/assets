    "word": "Enfolds Human Brotherhood in God's Embrace.-- Sanctified love for one another is sacred. In this great work Christian love for one another--far higher, more constant, more courteous, more unselfish, than has been seen--preserves Christian tenderness, Christian benevolence, and politeness, and enfolds the human brotherhood in the embrace of God, acknowledging the dignity with which God has invested the rights of man. This dignity Christians must ever cultivate for the honor and glory of God.--Lt 10, 1897. (5BC 1140, 1141.) \n\n\n                                                     245",
