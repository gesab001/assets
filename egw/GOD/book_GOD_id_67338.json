    "word": "We are to cultivate the loveliness of Christian character, and to seek the inward adorning. . . . The religion of Christ never degrades the receiver; it ennobles and elevates.

Through faith in Christ and obedience to the requirements of His law we are offered a life that shall run parallel with the life of God. And in that immortal life there shall be no sorrow, no sighing, no pain, no sin, no death. O that we might be more heavenly-minded and bring more of heaven into our life and conversation!",
