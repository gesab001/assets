    "word": "There shall come forth out of Zion a Deliverer who shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. [See Romans 11:26.] But every soul needs to turn his face toward the light that he may reflect this light. We need to praise God much more than we do. We are to show that we have cause of rejoicing. \"Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath \n\n\n                                     -270- \n\ncalled you out of darkness into His marvellous light.\" Are we doing this as fully as we should? Are we revealing that love in the home that will honor and glorify our Redeemer?",
