    "word": "Now, Enoch was a representative of those who will be upon the earth when Christ shall come, who will be translated to heaven without seeing death. But be sure that if your hearts are inclined not to do God's will, not to keep the way of the Lord but to follow your own way, then you are not in harmony with the God of heaven. We want to pray with David, \"Open Thou \n\n\n                                     -33- \n\nmine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law\" [Psalms 119:18]. Many close their eyes lest they shall see the truth. They do not want to see the defects in their life and character, and they are disturbed if you mention anything about God's law. In this they show that they have a human standard of their own; that their will is not the will of God. We want that you should not be deceived by Satan, the first great adversary of God's law. We want to bear in mind that God's law is the only standard by which He will judge man.",
