    "word": "You are God's delegated messenger. You are to act in His place. Then represent Christ, and not your individual, rash temperament. Angels of God are close beside you, and they will keep you in peace, and will give you words to speak which will be as a sweet odor. This will show that you have the Spirit of Christ and of the truth. It is not by your show of knowledge or of superior talent or philosophy that you reveal Christ, but by keeping your own soul emptied of your natural self.",
