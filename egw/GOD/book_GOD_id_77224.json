    "word": "The young are ignorant of the many dangers to which they are daily exposed. They can never fully know them all; but if they are watchful and prayerful, God will keep their consciences sensitive and their perceptions clear, that they may discern the workings of the enemy, and be fortified against his attacks. But many of the youth have so long followed their own inclination that duty is a meaningless word to them. High and holy duties which they may have to do for the benefit of others and to glorify God, they do not sense, and they utterly neglect to perform them.",
