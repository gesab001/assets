    "word": "There is such a thing as overdoing the personal treatment given to sick persons. Quietude, rest, sleep, careful diet, cheerful surroundings, and plenty of sleep will be essential. Sleep I cannot obtain as I would. I carry far too intense an interest for souls that know the truth and are out of the way. I am deeply moved by the consideration that there are many cases who need words of counsel, reproof, exhortation; many are not growing up into Christ, seeking His favor and strength from His strength, and many need encouragement. Often I am unable to sleep past twelve o'clock. I retire between seven o'clock and eight. My heart is drawn out in deep, earnest desire to see and understand what is my lot and place for me to occupy. Next November 26 I shall be 75 years old. I praise God for my memory and my reason, even in my infirmities.",
