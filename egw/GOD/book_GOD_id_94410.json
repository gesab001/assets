    "word": "There may be those who have naturally a good intellect and a good, cultivated understanding, who have so misapplied and abused these precious gifts of heaven that their standard is low and their habits dissipated. This was the character of one employed in the Office. I knew him only by the name of Gus. I learn he died without repentance and without God. How much his associates are accountable for their influence which they might have exerted and did not, over this sad case, must be left for the judgment to unfold, when every man's work will stand for just what it is. There will be no glossing over of wrongs and sins. Right will stand out, clear and prominent, as right; fidelity and true integrity will not be called narrowness or meanness. Lawlessness and unfaithfulness will not be termed liberality, toleration, and benevolence. Neglect and unfaithfulness will be neglect and unfaithfulness. God's estimate will be placed upon character.",
