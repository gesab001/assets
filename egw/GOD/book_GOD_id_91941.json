    "word": "The improvement of our God-given talents composes a strong feature in our probationary state in the development of character. Now we are on test and trial to reveal Christian character. If we are unguarded now, if we let time pass and act indifferent to the requirements of God, if we misuse our talent of reason, of intellect, if we fritter away upon amusements and self-gratifications our precious opportunities and talents, we are being conquered by the enemy in this life and depriving God of the service due Him, and are imperiling our interests for eternity.",
