    "word": "The Message Will Triumph in Spite of Opposition--When the message of God meets with opposition, He gives it additional force that it may exert greater influence. Endowed with vital, heavenly energy, it will cut its way through the thickest barriers, dispel darkness, refute error, gain conquests, and triumph over every obstacle. I speak that [which] I do know. I testify of that which I have seen. Those who would triumph in the truth will have to act a part in the sight of the universe that will bring to them the reward of \"Well done.\" They will be known as laborers together with God.",
