    "word": "Labor to Win Confidence of Helpers.--Let all in the publishing houses remember that they are in a school, from which they are to go forth prepared to bear spiritual responsibilities. Let those in charge of the work take up the work of soul saving, laboring earnestly to prepare workers to enter new fields. Let them present the truth, not only in precept but in practice, giving in the life a perfect representation of the religion they profess to believe. As they strive earnestly to overcome, they will teach others how to overcome. God works with the faithful steward who seeks to do as Christ would do in his place.",
