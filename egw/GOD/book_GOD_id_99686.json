    "word": "My brethren, the Lord is not pleased to have us settle down in unbelief, and question and quibble over matters of truth as you have done. It is indeed human to err, and the wisest often make mistakes, but it is noble to confess error, and not enclose the heart in prejudice to make yourselves and others believe you have pursued a right course. You reject Christ by rejecting the message He sends; in so doing, you place yourselves under the control of the prince \n                                                                           400\nof darkness. Your spiritual discernment has been blunted. God has sent messages of light to His people which would have been as healing balm had they received them; but you with others did not do this.  Like the men of Nazareth, you set yourselves to refuse the light, you exalted your own opinion and judgment as more valuable than the judgment of those whom God has made channels of light. This course has brought you where your faith has become confused. The sweet, subduing love of God has not characterized your labors. You have presented dry theories of doctrine, which are not productive of fruit. You would be satisfied with the present understanding and exposition of what is truth, but remain dry and spiritless.",
