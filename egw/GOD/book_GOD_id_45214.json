    "word": "The World is Watching \n\n     God's commandment-keeping people are described by the prophet as \"men wondered at.\" We are to be a people distinct from the world. The eyes of the world are upon us, and we are observed by many of whom we have no knowledge. There are those who know something of the doctrines we claim to believe, and they are noting the effect of our faith upon our characters. They are waiting to see what kind of influence we exert, and how we carry ourselves before a faithless world. The angels of heaven are looking upon us. \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men\" (1 Corinthians 4:9).--The Review and Herald, June 18, 1889.",
