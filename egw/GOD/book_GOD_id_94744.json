    "word": "As the Lord presents before me the selfish indulgence, the spirit of worldliness, that seems to be introduced into families and is pervading the church, I am in an agony of fear. The departure from Christlike simplicity makes me afraid. There is little appreciation of that which the Lord has done. When the Holy Spirit moves the hearts of believers, when the truth is appreciated, the servants of God will not labor in vain. Christ is an abiding presence in the heart, and we have a sense of the great mercy and lovingkindness of God.",
