    "word": "The youth should be learners for the next world. Perseverance in the acquisition of knowledge, controlled by the fear and love of God, will give them an increased power for good in this life, and those who have made the most of their privileges to reach the highest attainments here, will take these valuable acquisitions with them into the future life. They have sought and obtained that which is imperishable. The capability to appreciate the glories that \"eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,\" will be proportionate to the attainments reached in the cultivation of the faculties in this life.",
