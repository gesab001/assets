    "word": "Our Duty to Preserve Health\n     I am pained at heart as I see so many feeble ministers, so many on beds of sickness, and so many closing the scenes of their earthly history,\u2014men who have carried the burden of responsibility in the work of God, whose whole heart was in their work. The conviction that they must cease their labor in the cause they loved, was far more painful to them than their sufferings from disease, or even death itself.",
