    "word": "A tithe of all our increase is the Lord's. He has reserved it to Himself, to be employed for religious purposes. It is holy. Nothing less than this has He accepted in any dispensation.

If all professed Christians would faithfully bring their tithes to God, His treasury would be full.--R. & H., May 16, 1882.",
