    "word": "It was not the will of God that the sinless pair should know aught of evil. He had freely given them the good, and had withheld the evil. But, contrary to His command, they had eaten of the forbidden tree, and now they would continue to eat of it\u2014they would have the knowledge of evil\u2014all the days of their life. From that time the race would be afflicted by Satan\u2019s temptations. Instead of the happy labor heretofore appointed them, anxiety and toil were to be their lot. They would be subject to disappointment, grief, and pain, and finally to death.\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 58, 59.",
