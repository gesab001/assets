    "word": "\"Children, obey your parents in the Lord,\" the apostle writes, \"for this is right. Honour thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise: That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long upon the earth\" (Ephesians 6:1-3). But who is going to teach these children to honor God, unless the father and mother teach them? Who is going to teach them what that promise means, if not their parents? There is nothing, parents, that will give your children such strength of character as to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Let them see that discipline is a part of God's purpose for them. He wants us to harmonize with His plans, not allowing the children to grow up careless and unrestrained, but to submit to the will and the guidance of His Spirit. \n     [Verses 10-17, quoted.] \n\n\n                                  -105-",
