    "word": "Physicians, superintendent, and matron should realize their responsibility before God, and should work with reference to the future life. Satan is working unperceived to obtain control of the minds of physicians and others in responsible positions, that he may through them mold the entire institution. To a greater or less degree he has accomplished his purpose, because their minds are not fully brought into subjection to the will of Christ. The soul is not fortified by a firm and implicit trust in God.",
