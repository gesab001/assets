    "word": "To all Christ sends the invitation, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). For ages this invitation, Come, all ye who are weary and heavy laden, has been ringing in clear tones above the world's confusion and trouble. God will not give man up to his own way and will, to be lost, without a determined effort to recover him. The aim of Christ's ministry, the scope of His far-reaching mercy and power, is without bounds.--Letter 78, Jan. 20, 1900, to Brother and Sister Haysmer.",
