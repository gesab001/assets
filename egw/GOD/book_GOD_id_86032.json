    "word": "If we are to be co-laborers with God, we must hold direct communion with Him: we must ask His guidance in everything we undertake. We cannot commit to another the explanation, or ask them to direct us. But how few know what it is to hold intercourse with God. How readily some place the responsibility of their duty on others, and ask them to tell them what to do. We say to all such, You must know your duty from God. Many have depended on their fellow-men until they have no individual experience. They are towed along as a barge by a steamer.",
