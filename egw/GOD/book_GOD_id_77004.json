    "word": "An Appeal in Behalf of our Sanitarium \n                in Denmark. \n\n\n     At Skodsborg, a suburb of Copenhagen, our brethren have established a sanitarium. In this they moved forward hopefully, under the conviction that they were doing the very work God has enjoined upon his people. Our brethren generally have not taken that interest in the establishment of sanitariums in the European countries that they ought, and our dear brethren having the Skodsborg Sanitarium in hand have moved forward faster than the means in hand warranted, and now they are in difficulty and distress.",
