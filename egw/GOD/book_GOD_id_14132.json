    "word": "Gospel Order\n\n\n     The Lord has shown that gospel order has been too much feared and neglected. [THE ADVENTISTS WERE OF ALL CHURCHES, AND AT FIRST THEY HAD NO IDEA OF FORMING ANOTHER CHURCH. AFTER 1844 THERE WAS GREAT CONFUSION, AND THE MAJORITY WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO ANY ORGANIZATION, HOLDING THAT IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PERFECT LIBERTY OF THE GOSPEL. THE TESTIMONY AND LABORS OF MRS WHITE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO FANATICISM, AND IN THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN THROUGH HER, ORGANIZATION IN SOME FORM WAS EARLY INSISTED UPON, AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT CONFUSION.] Formality should be shunned; but, in so doing, order should not be neglected. There is order in heaven. There was order in the church when Christ was upon the earth, and after His departure order was strictly observed among His apostles. And now in these last days, while God is bringing His children into the unity of the faith, there is more real need of order than ever before; for, as God unites His children, Satan and his evil angels are very busy to prevent this unity and to destroy it. Therefore men are hurried into the field who lack wisdom and judgment, perhaps not ruling well their own house, and not having order or government over the few that God has given them charge of at home; yet they feel capable of having charge of the flock. They make many wrong moves, and those unacquainted with our faith judge all the messengers to be like these self-sent men. Thus the cause of God is reproached, and the truth shunned by many unbelievers who would otherwise be candid and anxiously inquire, Are these things so?",
