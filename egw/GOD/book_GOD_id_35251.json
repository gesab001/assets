    "word": "Christ\u2019s love for His children is as strong as it is tender. It is a love stronger than death, for He died for us. It is a love more true than that of \n162\na mother for her children. The mother\u2019s love may change, but Christ\u2019s love is changeless. \u201cI am persuaded,\u201d Paul says, \u201cthat neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord\u201d (Romans 8:38, 39).",
