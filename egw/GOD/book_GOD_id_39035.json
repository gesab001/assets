    "word": "Remember that you have at least one talent. Resolve by the \n32\ngrace of God to use your talent wisely, and see whether you can gain another one. Thank God that He has manifested His great love to you by entrusting you even with one talent. By word and action show that you appreciate this gift, and that you regard it as a treasure greater in value than anything else you possess. Put your talent out to the exchangers. If you use it faithfully, you will gain another talent; and by a faithful use of these two talents, you will gain two more.",
