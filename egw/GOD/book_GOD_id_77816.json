    "word": "\"Children are the lawful prey of the enemy, because they are not subjects of grace, have not experienced the cleansing power of Jesus, and the evil angels have access to these children; and some parents are careless, and suffer them to work with but little restraint. Parents have a great work to do in this matter, by correcting and subduing their children, and then bringing them to God and claiming His blessing upon them. By the faithful and untiring efforts of the parents, and the blessing and grace entreated of God on the children, the power of the evil angels will be broken, a sanctifying influence is shed upon the children, and the powers of darkness must give back.\"--Review and Herald, March 28, 1893.",
