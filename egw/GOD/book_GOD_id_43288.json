    "word": "I cannot endure the thought of any of our aged believers decreasing in influence and efficiency.  The Lord wants you to cooperate with Him in making all you can of yourself.  If you will unite willingly with Him in this work, your last days will be your brightest and best.  Heed the cautions that I have given you.  Keep close to the clear lines of truth, and do not let your voice sink so low that the hearers can scarcely catch the sound.  You will be much benefited healthwise if you will put forth determined effort to make your voice heard.  It is a God-given duty to improve in speech, and this you can do if you will try with determination. -- Letter 11, 1901.",
