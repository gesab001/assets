    "word": "These white clouds are advancing, rolling first down the mountainsides and then rising higher and spreading over the snow-capped mountains. They appear like mountains of snow in the noonday sun. It was a picture of loveliness upon which I delighted to gaze. Some took the shape of thrones. I thought of Christ coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. I can never give in language a description of this sublime scene. Was it not such a cloud as this that was sometimes the refuge of God's people that they might escape in its friendly shelter from the sight of their persecutors?--Ms. 29, 1885, p. 12.
