    "word": "Let us come to God as reasonable beings to know for ourselves what is truth. But if you want to take a position that only one man can explain the truth, I want to tell you that this is not as God would have it. Now, I want harmony. The truth is a unit. But if we fasten to any man we are not taking the position that God would have us take. We want to investigate every line of truth, especially if it bears the signet of God. Can you tell in what way God is going to give us new truth?",
