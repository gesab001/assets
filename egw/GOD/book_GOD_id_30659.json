    "word": "Will you not all put on Christ, not to lay Him off again, but to let His Spirit stamp your mind and character? When all in this institution are truly converted, there will be just as surely a wonderful work done as when on the Day of Pentecost the disciples received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The Lord Himself will be with you, to teach and to lead and to guide. You will see of the salvation of God. You may be disheartened at times. Discouragements will arise, but it is your privilege at all times to lay hold of the hope set before you in the gospel. Watch unto prayer. Believe that God will help you to speak words that will cheer and encourage and increase the faith of those with whom you associate. . . . \n                                                                           202",
