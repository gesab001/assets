    "word": "MR No. 1593 - A Call to Prepare for the Final Crisis\n\n     (Written January 30, 1906, from Sanitarium, California, to Brother and Sister Farnsworth.) \n\n\n     I cannot sleep after twelve o'clock. I am encouraging souls to examine their own hearts and to seek counsel most earnestly from God. Now is the time for us to afflict our souls by fasting and prayer. We cannot lay out the way in which the Lord will work, but we can follow the leadings and drawings of His Holy Spirit. We shall gain nothing by lifting up our souls unto vanity and in self-confidence.",
