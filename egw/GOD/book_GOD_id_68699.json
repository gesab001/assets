    "word": "It is our duty, as children of God, to talk faith, and not doubt. We are to be hopeful and cheerful in the Lord. Let us not look on the dark side of circumstances, but look up, and believe in the One whom God gave to the world to save us from our sins. Christ accomplishes our salvation by inspiring faith in our hearts and a belief in the truth. The truth makes free; and those whom the Son makes free are free indeed. Let us seek to honor God by revealing a constantly increasing confidence in the assurance that He will accept every soul who serves Him in sincerity.",
