    "word": "Example of Faithfulness \n\n     There are two great principles, one of loyalty and the other of disloyalty. Christian strength is obtained by serving the Lord faithfully. We all need greater Christian courage, that we may uplift the standard on which is inscribed, The commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. We are to make no compromise with the leaders of rebellion. The line of demarcation between the obedient and the disobedient must be plain and distinct. We must have a firm determination to do the Lord's will at all times and in all places.",
