This could be done only by cultivating home religion. But it was not possible for Abraham to do this while \n                                                                           287\nhe was surrounded by his idolatrous kinsfolk and friends. He must at God's command go out alone, and listen to the voice of Christ, the leader of the children of Israel. Jesus was on the earth to instruct and educate the chosen people of God.
