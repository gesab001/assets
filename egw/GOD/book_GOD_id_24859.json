    "word": "The Lord desires us to improve in prayer and to offer our spiritual sacrifices with increased faith and power. . . . He has given His own Son for your redemption. If by living faith we accept Him as our Saviour, we are placed on vantage ground with God; for Christ stands before His Father, saying, \"Lay their sins on me. I will bear their guilt. They are my property. I have graven them upon the palms of my hands.\" In our behalf He presents before His Father the marks of the crucifixion which He will bear throughout eternity.",
