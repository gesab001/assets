    "word": "The seeds of truth that are being sown by missionary efforts, will then spring up, and blossom, and bear fruit. Souls will receive the truth who will endure tribulation, and praise God that they may suffer for Jesus. \"In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" When the overflowing scourge shall pass through the earth, when the fan is purging Jehovah's floor, God will be the help of his people. The trophies of Satan may be exalted on high, but the faith of the pure and holy will not be daunted.",
