    "word": "My brethren and sisters in Iowa, with humble, contrite hearts study your Bibles. That which is revealed in the Scriptures is for you and for your children. Eat the Word, and digest it: for it is the bread of life. Do not be eager to know something in regard to things that are not revealed. Some do not seem to comprehend that which is plainly opened before them in the Scriptures concerning their salvation, and, as a result, their religious life is greatly deficient. If they would study and obey the Word of God, their minds would not be so full of conjectures in regard to things that they need not understand.",
