    "word": "Whereas [people merely with] human nature might search the Bible, study its pages, be able to see its beauty, yet the searching would profit them nothing, but when they come with a humble heart, with a prayerful spirit, when they take hold of that Word with reverence, and open its pages with a prayerful heart, why the enterings of that Word--the Word must enter into the heart. It is not enough to read it merely, but it must enter, it must take right hold of the soul, and bring your spirits into subjection to the Spirit of God.",
