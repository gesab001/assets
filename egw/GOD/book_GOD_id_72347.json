    "word": "The trumpet has not yet sounded. Those who have gone down into the grave have not yet cried, \"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\" (1 Corinthians 15:55). The righteous dead have not yet been caught up with the living saints to meet their Lord in the air. But the time is near when the words spoken by the apostle Paul will have their fulfillment, \"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord\" (1 Thessalonians 4:16-18).",
