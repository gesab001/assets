    "word": "In the arrangement of Systematic Benevolence, some have not come up and united in this work, and have excused themselves because they were not free from debt. They plead that they must first \"owe no man anything.\" But being in debt does not excuse them. I saw that they should render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. \n                                                                           52\nSome feel conscientious to \"owe no man anything,\" and think that God can require nothing of them until their debts are all paid. Here they deceive  themselves. They fail to render to God the things that are God's. Every one must bring to the Lord a suitable offering. Those who are in debt should take the amount of their debts from what they possess, and give a proportion of the remainder.",
