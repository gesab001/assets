    "word": "We are very sorry to see the result of gathering a large number to Battle Creek. Ministers who have been believers in the foundation truths that have made us what we are--Seventh-day Adventists--ministers who went to Battle Creek to teach and uphold the truth of the Bible, are now, when old and grey-headed, turning from the grand truths of the Bible and accepting infidel sentiments. This means that the next step will be a denial of a personal God, pulling down the bulwarks of the faith that is plainly revealed in the Scriptures. In the Word is given the warning, \"Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils\" (1 Timothy 1:4).",
