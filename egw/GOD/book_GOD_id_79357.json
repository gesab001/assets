    "word": "God's instrumentalities are not chosen of men, or under their jurisdiction. They are to prepare a people to stand in the day of the Lord. . . . By no sharp dealing or underhand advantage is the Lord to be glorified or His truth served. Money acquired in this way to supply the treasury will benefit no one; for God will not serve with the sins of oppression and selfishness.",
