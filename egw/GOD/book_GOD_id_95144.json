    "word": "Those who deal with human minds must cultivate self-control, patience, kindness, forbearance, and Christlike love. These souls may be their companions through the ceaseless ages of eternity. There is no respect of persons with God. All with whom we stand related in any capacity should see in us Christlike attributes, not satanic. Everything should be set in order and everything guarded against that would cast a shadow over the religious life of the workers or the soul of one who has not accepted Christ, thus making his salvation more difficult.",
