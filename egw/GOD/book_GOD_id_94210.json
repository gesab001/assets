    "word": "Only look up. Don't look at the dark and boisterous waves, but look up in faith and confidence and hope. Our heavenly Father is acquainted with every purpose of the soul. He will not leave you in darkness. He will give you the light of His divine presence. Let us pray each day in faith, not only for health but to be imbued with the Spirit of God, that we may do the work committed to our trust to His acceptance. This is what I live for. I have no other ambition. I feel my heart go out in great love and tenderness to you.",
