    "word": "The judgments of God are in the land, and Christ is soon to come. Fire and flood and earthquake are warning us that the end of all things is at hand. Believers need to arise to their privileges and responsibilities. Our understanding needs to be quickened daily by the Holy Spirit. We need to stand humble and contrite before God. It is no time to lift up our souls in pride, or to manifest carelessness and indifference. We need to arouse and give to our youth the evidence that we believe this last message of warning. Let us lay our freewill offerings upon the altar of the Lord. In doing this we are only giving Him what is already His: for Christ has paid the price for our redemption. \"Ye are not your own,\" Christ declares; \"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's\" (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20). Letter 322, 1908, pp. 1-5. (To the Members of Our Churches in the California Conference, November 1, 1908.)",
