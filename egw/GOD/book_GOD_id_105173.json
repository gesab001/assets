    "word": "The enemy has worked in Southern California, and has tried to thwart the purposes of God. Messages of reproof have been sent to leading men whose work was not done in righteousness. Reformations have been called for. What is now needed is that the leaders in the Lord's work shall be fully converted. It is time that the Lord's voice was heeded, and that men should put away the spirit of self confidence and self sufficiency. Should the ideas of some who are wise in their own estimation be carried out, there would result a condition of things that would demand a most thorough reformation.",
