    "word": "Chap. 16 - Social Purity\n     \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.\u201d [Matthew 5:8.] Man has fallen, and the work of his life-time, be it longer or shorter, must be to recover through Christ what he has lost by sin,\u2014the likeness to the divine. This work requires a thorough transformation of soul, body, and spirit. God mercifully sends rays of light to show man his true condition; but if he will not walk in the light, it is manifest that he takes pleasure in darkness. He avoids the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.",
