    "word": "MR No. 1062 - Learning from Nature\n\n     God has entrusted human beings with talents. The gifts of reason and speech are special treasures. He has given men and women intellect, that they may study His dealings with them. All have the privilege of knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. Shall we then follow our own inclinations, and indulge our inherited and cultivated tendencies to wrong, without reference to God's Word?",
