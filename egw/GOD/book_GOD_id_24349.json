    "word": "Satan may tell you that you cannot be blessed; but Jesus says that he will come in, if you will open the door of your hearts. Which will you believe? Here is another precious promise that all may claim. It is not addressed to those who are perfect, but to sinners; to those who have wandered away from Christ. \u201cSeek ye the Lord while he \n142\nmay be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\u201d Is there one here who dares not claim this promise? Is there one who will say, \u201cI am so sinful that this does not mean me\u201d? Put away such thoughts. Christ will accept you, polluted by sin though you may be, if you will come to him with contrition of soul. He invites all to come into the light of his presence. Then why should you remain away? We want these doubting ones to go from this meeting strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.",
