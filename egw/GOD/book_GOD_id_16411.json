    "word": "The life thus imparted is in like manner sustained. \"By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\" (Matthew 4:4) shall man live. The mind, the soul, is built up by that upon which it feeds; and it rests with us to determine upon what it shall be fed. It is within the power of every one to choose the topics that shall occupy the thoughts and shape the character.",
