    "word": "How anxiously I watched during the camp meeting to see who would give heed to the Saviour's invitation, and seek unto Him for the water of life. I watched to see who would fall on the Rock and be broken. Some of our sisters who might have been helped and blessed were not helped because they were in a condition very like that of those at the Minneapolis meeting. They had the same spirit; they were doing a similar work in seeking to find spot and stain in others. I longed to see the work of the Spirit of God upon their hearts. But there was no perceptible change. I knew that when the divine enlightenment came to them, there would be such an emptying of self that there would be a vacuum to be supplied by the Holy Spirit working in the human heart with saving power.",
