    "word": "Humility is the constant attendant of true wisdom. Those who have this grace will patiently listen to the advice and counsel of others and give it due weight. They will not give up their own judgment for another's, but if advice and counsel bear the recommendation of age and experience, they will carefully weigh the matter and incorporate it into their own experience and mind because they see the force of the counsel and advice given. These men will never feel that they have a sufficient experience, but that the knowledge they have gained is so small in proportion to what they may obtain that they are stimulated to continue perseveringly to learn as well as to teach. God wants men of thought, of logical minds, yet not so slow as to lose golden opportunities to do the very work the time demands.",
