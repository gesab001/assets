    "word": "The Lord designs that the death of His servants shall be regarded as a loss, because of the influence for good which they exerted and the many willing offerings which they bestowed to replenish the treasury of God. Dying legacies are a miserable substitute for living benevolence.  The servants of God should be making their wills every day, in good works and liberal offerings to God.  They should not allow the amount given to God to be disproportionately small when compared with that appropriated to their own use.  In making their wills daily, they will remember those objects and friends that hold the largest place in their affections.",
