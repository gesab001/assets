    "word": "God has been at the expense of sending His Son Jesus Christ to be a sacrifice for us, to die that man might have eternal life. He has been at all this infinite expense to bring the angels of God in connection with men, that men should not fight the battle with the wily foe in their own strength. And while all heaven is interested in watching over the children of men that they shall not perish but have everlasting life, while they are sheltering and guarding them on the right and on the left, they take themselves right out of the hands of the angels of God and put themselves into the hands of the devil.",
