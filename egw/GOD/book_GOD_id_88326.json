    "word": "When as God's peculiar people we take heed to His words, then will every one of us be able to say, \"Our soul waiteth for the Lord: He is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in His holy name\" (Psalm 33:20, 21). \"I will bless the Lord at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together. I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto Him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed\" (Psalm 34:1-5). \"Blessed are the people who hear the joyful sound\" (see Psalm 89:15). I will \"create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy\" (Isaiah 65:18).",
