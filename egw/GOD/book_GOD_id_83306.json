    "word": "Why is it that so many claim to be holy and sinless? It is because they are so far from Christ. I have never dared to claim any such a thing. From the time that I was fourteen years old, if I knew what the will of God was, I was willing to do it. You never have heard me say I am sinless. Those that get sight of the loveliness and exalted character of Jesus Christ, who was holy and lifted up and His train fills the temple, will never say it. Yet we are to meet with those that will say such things more and more, every year.--Ms 5, 1885, pp. 8-9. (\"Hearing and Doing,\" Sermon at Santa Rosa, March 7, 1885.) \n\nReleased May, 1964.",
