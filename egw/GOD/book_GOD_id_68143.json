    "word": "The agencies of God are many! But all those who are willing to work according to God's plan are included in the words, \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). God's servants are to move so that no spiritual gift shall be lost. Their will is to be held in abeyance, and when God's time comes, the rod will blossom. What form the work will take no one can know, but God's servants are to be minutemen, able to understand the ways and will of their Leader.--Letter 8, Jan. 23, 1899, to Dr. J. H. Kellogg, medical superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.",
