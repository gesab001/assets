    "word": "Repetition of Sin Lessens Powers of Resistance.-- He who has once yielded to temptation will yield more readily the second time. Every repetition of the sin lessens his power of resistance, blinds his eyes, and stifles conviction. Every seed of indulgence sown will bear fruit. God works no miracle to prevent the harvest.-- PP 268 (1890).",
