    "word": "Children May Have a Part in the Work \n\n\n     \"Parents, your children should be your helping hand, increasing your power and ability to work for the Master. Children are the younger members of the Lord's family. They should be led to consecrate themselves to God, whose they are by creation and redemption. . . . With you the children should share spiritual as well as physical burdens. By helping others they increase their own happiness and usefulness.\" --Id., Vol. VII, p. 63. \n                                                                           23",
