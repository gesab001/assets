    "word": "The Master-worker is God, and not finite man; and yet He calls upon men to be the agents through whom He can impart light to those in darkness. God has jewels in all the churches, and it is not for us to make sweeping denunciation of the professed religious world, but in humility and love to present to all the truth as it is in Jesus. Let men see piety and devotion, let them behold Christlikeness of character, and they will be drawn to the truth. He who loves God supremely, and his neighbor as himself, will be a light in the world. Those who have a knowledge of the truth, are to communicate the same. They are to lift up Jesus, the world's Redeemer; they are to hold forth the word of life.",
