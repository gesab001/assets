    "word": "MR No. 820 - Historical and Geographical Backgrounds Helpful, Not Essential\n\n     The study of history, an acquaintance with the countries, nations, and customs referred to in the Word, a study of the men whom the Lord has enlightened, are important helps in an understanding of the Word of God, but are not absolutely essential to enable the inquiring mind to find the path to heaven. The Bible makes plain the pathway of life, and \"the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.\" The gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ is made apparent in the Bible.--Ms 12b, 1896, p. 15.
