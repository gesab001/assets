    "word": "Christian Leadership is in Touch With God--Those engaged in the work of God cannot serve His cause acceptably unless they make the best use possible of the religious privileges they enjoy.  We are as trees planted in the garden of the Lord; and He comes to us seeking the fruit He has a right to expect.  His eye is upon each of us; He reads our hearts and understands our lives.  This is a solemn search, for it has reference to duty and to destiny; and with what interest is it prosecuted.",
