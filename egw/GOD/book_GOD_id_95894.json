    "word": "The twelfth chapter of First Corinthians contains instruction for all who minister before God. The apostle says, \"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. . . . For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ\" (1 Corinthians 12:4-6, 12).",
