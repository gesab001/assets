    "word": "All your good purposes and good intentions will not enable you to withstand the test of temptation. You must be men of prayer. Your petitions must be, not faint, occasional, and fitful, but earnest, persevering, and constant. It is not essential to be alone, or to bow upon your knees, to pray; but in the midst of your labor, your souls can be often uplifted to God, taking hold upon his strength; then you will be men of high and holy purposes, of noble integrity,--who will not for any consideration be swerved from truth, right, and justice.",
