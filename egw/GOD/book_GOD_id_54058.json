    "word": "We are living in an unfortunate age for children. A heavy current is setting downward to perdition, and it needs more than childhood's experience and strength to press against this current, and not be borne down by it. Satan and his angels are leading the youth generally to certain destruction. They seem to be his captives. Satan and his angels are warring against the government of God, and all who have a desire to yield their hearts to him and obey his requirements, Satan will try to perplex, and overcome with his temptations, that they may become discouraged and give up the warfare.",
