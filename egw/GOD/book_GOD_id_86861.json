    "word": "Our time is precious. We have but few days left of probation, in which to qualify ourselves for the future eternal life. We are not to devote these precious moments to cheap, common, or superficial things. We shall have to guard against the holding of ideas and maxims which may be presented as essential from a human standpoint, for it is not the words of worldly wisdom, it is not the maxims of men, or the theories of human beings that will qualify us for acceptable service. Rather, it is the word of the living God. In all our schools this word is to be made the essence of education. It is in feeding upon the word of God that we obtain the divine element that the soul needs in order to secure a healthy development of all its spiritual powers. Those who dig deep for the hidden treasure will find their reward in the precious veins of ore, and these hidden truths will make them wise unto salvation. They are following the example of their Saviour, and all the wiles and subtilties of Satanic agencies cannot beguile them from a position of steadfast self-denial.--Letter 60a, 1896, pp. 1-6. (To \"The Friends of the [Avondale] School,\" December 20, 1896.)",
