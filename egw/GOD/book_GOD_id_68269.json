    "word": "All our varied capabilities belong to God. He has bought us by the gift of His only begotten Son, and those who have a sense of their obligation to God will cooperate with the divine purpose. Those who carry responsibilities in this work of giving the third angel's message to the world are to show a determined purpose to advance the work of God. Heart and soul and voice are to be consecrated to Him that they may reach the highest degree of excellence--a likeness to the character of God. Every faculty, every attribute with which the Lord has endowed us is to be employed for the uplifting of our fellow men. If we will do our best, working with unselfish spirit, the Lord will accept our service.--Letter 50, March 3, 1909, to a physician in private practice.",
