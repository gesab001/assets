    "word": "\"Thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.\" Romans 2:1. Thus those who condemn or criticize others, proclaim themselves guilty, for they do the same things. In condemning others, they are passing sentence upon themselves, and God declares that this sentence is just. He accepts their own verdict against themselves. \n\n\n     \"These clumsy feet, still in the mire, \n       Go crushing blossoms without end; \n     These hard, well-meaning hands we thrust \n       Among the heartstrings of a friend.\" \n                                                                           125",
