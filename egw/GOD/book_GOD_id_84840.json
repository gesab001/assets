    "word": "One teacher stated before the church that he thought it right to send the children on the Sabbath, quoting the words of Christ, \"it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath day.\" The question is Shall we transgress the plain \n\n\n                                    -80- \n\nletter of the commandment in order that our children may be educated in the schools? In the very act of giving them lessons in which there is no sacredness, the Sabbath, which is to be a test to the world, a sign between God and His people, is brought down on a level with the common working days. When we see the law of God made void in our world, then it is the work of every loyal child of God to elevate the standard and show that we are hearkening diligently to the voice of God and teaching His statutes to his children.",
