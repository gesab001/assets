    "word": "No one who has enlisted to serve God will be free from temptation. Satan will say, \"Do not be carried away with any whimsical notion. Do not work like a slave unless you are well paid for it.\" Every man is tempted as was Christ when the kingdoms of the world were proffered to Him if He would only bow to Satan's terms. Have you not in a large degree sacrificed spiritual and eternal interests for mere worldly, temporal things? How near has the work and cause of God been to your soul? Has not your self-sacrifice for Jesus been very small?",
