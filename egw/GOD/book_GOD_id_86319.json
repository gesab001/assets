    "word": "Light has been given me that there are those with most precious talents and capabilities in the W.C.T.U. Much time and money has been absorbed among us in ways that bring no returns.

We are to let them see and understand that the foundation of the principles of our doctrine is the Word of God. \n\n\n                                    -168-",
