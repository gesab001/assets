    "word": "We must reveal a sense of a present Saviour, a firm trust that Jesus is at the helm, and that He will see the noble vessel safe into harbor. We are to know that it is impossible to save ourselves or any soul. We have no power to bestow salvation upon the perishing. Jesus, our Redeemer, is the Saviour. We are only His instrumentalities and dependent every moment upon God. We are to magnify His power before His chosen people and before the world for the great salvation which through His atoning sacrifice and His blood He has conferred upon us.--Lt 19a, 1892.",
