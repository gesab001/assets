    "word": "Here is the garden of God. Here is the precious Word, and we should take that Word and study it carefully; study its pages thoroughly and be in a position where we can gather the divine rays of light from glory, and reflect them on those around us. God wants us to be fruitful in the Scriptures. And when you may go forth to your fields of labor, you may indeed feel that you are weak men, but you are not handling weak subjects. You are \n\n\n                                     -70- \n\nhandling subjects of eternal moment, and you are to study and search the Scriptures for yourselves. You are to dig in this mine all the time, and the \"entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple\" [Psalm 119:130].",
