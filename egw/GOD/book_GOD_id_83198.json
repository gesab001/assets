    "word": "I do not know how many of you have made a profession of Christianity, but I trust that while you are here as students you will all give careful thought to this subject.

In order to make it possible for you to have this advantage, Jesus Christ has given His precious life. If you do not avail yourselves of the privileges thus purchased for you, if through Christ you do not become partakers of the divine nature, you will in the day of final reckoning be found without excuse.",
