    "word": "Dear brother, I have written thus to you that you may stand in the confidence and love of the people of God, and that no one may be uncertain as to where you do stand. The mystic chain of love must bind the followers of Christ heart to heart. When Jesus was about to be crucified, Herod and Pilate, enemies before, became friends, and were united in a corrupt harmony over the condemnation of our Lord; and shall not those who claim to love our Lord Jesus Christ be constrained by the divine principle of love? Shall not all heart-burnings, alienations, and estrangements be forever expelled from the soul, and antipathies be overcome, through the grace of Christ?",
