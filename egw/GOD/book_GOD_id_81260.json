    "word": "None are standing in greater danger than our beloved brother, Dr. Kellogg. He is honored not only by the most of our own people, but by all who know him. He is in danger of feeling that his mountain standeth sure. It is then that his feet will begin to slide. Temptations will come, one after another, and so imperceptible will be their influence upon the life and character, that, unless kept by divine power, he will be corrupted by the spirit of the world, and will fail to carry out the purpose of God. All that he is, God has given him, and if he improves his abilities to God's glory, he will be an honored instrument to do much good; but he can no more live a religious life without constant prayer and the performance of religious duties, than he can have physical strength without partaking of temporal food. He must daily sit down at God's table. He must receive strength from the Living Vine, if he is nourished.",
