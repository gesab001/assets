    "word": "If men would only humble themselves before God, if they would not exalt their judgement as the all-controlling influence, if they would make room for the Lord to plan and work, the Lord would use the qualifications He has given them in a way that would glorify His name. He will purify His workers from all selfishness, trimming down their superfluous plans, cutting off the branches that would entwine around this and that undesirable object, pruning the vine so that it will produce fruit. God is the great Husbandman, He will make everything in the lives of those who are laborers together with Jesus Christ, by making them partakers of the divine nature, to cause them to bear fruit abundantly. He desires His people, through actual experience in the truth of the \n\n\n                                -32- \n\ngospel to become true, solid, trustworthy, experimental missionaries. He would have them show results for higher, holier, and more definite than have been revealed in the last fifteen years.",
