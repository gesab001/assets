    "word": "Stones have been used as memorials of God's dealings with His people. Joshua, knowing that the time of his service as the visible leader of Israel was about to end, gathered together the people who had been chosen by God, and caused them to renew their covenant with their Maker. He wrote what he had said, in the book of the law, and \"took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the Lord. And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which He spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God\" [Joshua 24:26, 27]. \n\n\n                                   -337-",
