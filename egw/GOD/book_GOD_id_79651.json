    "word": "There is work for every one in the vineyard of the Lord. None should be idle. Angels of God are all astir, ascending to heaven, and descending to earth again with messages of mercy and warning. \n                                                                           11\nThese heavenly messengers are moving upon minds and hearts. There are men and women everywhere whose hearts are susceptible of being inspired with the truth. If those who have a knowledge of the truth would now work in unison with the Spirit of God, we would see a great work accomplished.",
