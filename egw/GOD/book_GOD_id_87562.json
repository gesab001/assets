    "word": "Trust in God to Accomplish the Task \n     You may feel sorry that you cannot do at once all that you feel should be done, but do your best, as God's helping hand, and His blessing will surely come upon you. In all your dangers, in all your difficulties, in all your thinking and planning, in every undertaking, place yourself firmly on the word of the living God, pleading His promises. Thus it is that your faith makes all things possible. Cling to the mighty One. Continue to say, I will not fail nor be discouraged.--Letter 349, 1906, p. 10.",
