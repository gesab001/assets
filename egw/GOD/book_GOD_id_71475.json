    "word": "\"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" (Hebrews 11:1). Have we not proved this in the past as we have moved out in faith to produce the things now seen? . . . Faith is not only to look forward to things unseen; it is to be confirmed by looking at past experience, at tangible results, the verification of God's Word. . . . Pray, \"Lord, increase my faith.\" Faith quickens the senses to work diligently to produce results. Faith elevates and ennobles the powers of the soul, enabling it to lay hold upon the unseen. . . .",
