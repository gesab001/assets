Christ has placed everlasting life within your reach, and He has promised to give you help in every time of need. . . . We should never rest satisfied with present attainments. If we put mind and heart into the work of reaching God\u2019s ideal for us, if we go to Christ, the mighty helper, for aid, He will give us the very assistance that we need.
