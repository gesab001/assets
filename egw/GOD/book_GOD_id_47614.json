    "word": "(1 Corinthians 9:27.) Paul Remained Humble.--The apostle Paul was highly honored of God, being taken in holy vision to the third heaven, where he looked upon scenes whose glories might not be revealed to mortals. Yet all this did not lead him to boastfulness or self-confidence. He realized the importance of constant watchfulness and self-denial, and plainly declares, \"I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway\" (RH May 3, 1881).",
