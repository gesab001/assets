    "word": "Never should familiarity with suffering cause the physician to become careless or unsympathetic. In cases of dangerous illness, the inflicted one feels that he is at the mercy of the physician. He looks to that physician as his only hope, and that physician should ever point the trembling soul to One who is greater than himself, even the Son of God, who gave His life to save him from death, who pities the sufferer, and who by His divine power will give skill and wisdom to all who ask Him.",
