    "word": "Those who are employed at our Sanitarium have in many respects the best advantages for the formation of correct habits. None will be placed beyond the reach of temptation; for in every \n\n\n                     -20- \n\ncharacter there are weak points that are in danger when assailed. Those who begin to be careless of their steps will find that before they are aware of it their feet will be entangled in a web from which it is impossible for them to extricate themselves. It should be a fixed principle with all to be truthful and honest. Whether they are rich or poor, whether they have friends or are left alone, come what will, they should resolve, in the strength of God, that no influence shall lead them to commit the least wrong act. One and all should realize that upon them, individually, depends in a measure the prosperity of the Sanitarium.",
