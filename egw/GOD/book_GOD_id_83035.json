    "word": "Item Concerning Killing of Insects and Spraying Fruit Trees. There are those who say that nothing, not even insects, should be killed. God has not entrusted any such message to His people. It is possible to stretch the command, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" to any limit, but it is not according to sound reasoning to do this. Those who do it have not learned in the school of Christ.",
