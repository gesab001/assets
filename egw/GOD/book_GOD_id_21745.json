    "word": "Miller found the literal, personal coming of Christ to be plainly taught in the Scriptures. Says Paul, \u201cThe Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God.\u201d [1 Thessalonians 4:16.] And the Saviour declares: \u201cThey shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.\u201d \u201cFor as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\u201d [Matthew 24:30, 27.] \n322\nHe is to be accompanied by all the hosts of Heaven. \u201cThe Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him.\u201d \u201cAnd he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect.\u201d [Matthew 25:31; 24:31.]",
