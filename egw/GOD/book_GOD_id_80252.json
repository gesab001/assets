    "word": "In the parable of the Good Samaritan, the priest and the Levite looked on the wretched man who had been robbed and wounded, but it did not seem to them desirable to help the one who most needed help because he was helpless and forsaken. The priest and Levite represent many, many in Battle Creek. The Lord has represented to me the fact that thousands of souls are longing for something better than they have. Many can be saved if the Southern field can have simply a small part of the means expended so lavishly in Battle Creek, to make things more convenient. The Lord's heritage has been strangely neglected, and God will judge his people for this thing. Pride and the love of display are gratified by the accumulated advantages, while new fields are left untouched. The rebuke of God is upon the managers for their partiality and selfish appropriation of his good.",
