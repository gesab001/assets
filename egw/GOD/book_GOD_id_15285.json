    "word": "A Decided Stand.--Men may raise up all the combativeness they please, but the commandments of God are the commandments of God still. We have decided to keep God's commandments and live, and [preserve] His law as the apple of our eye. Let men rail out against the law of God and trample His commandment-keeping people under their feet. Can they do it and live? It is impossible. God has His measurement of character, and it is those who obey Him that live, and those who keep His law as the apple of their eye that He preserves.--Manuscript 5, 1891.",
