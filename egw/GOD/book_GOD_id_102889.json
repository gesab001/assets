    "word": "In order to be ready to receive the impressions of the Holy Spirit, in order to advance in harmony with the will of the Lord, we need consecrated minds and hearts. Let not human beings seek to put their own plans and preferences in the place of God's plans. Those who do this will hinder the Lord's work. Let no one say or do anything that will discourage Christlike effort. To each one God has given his work. (73) If every one would be zealous to do that which will increase his ability to labor, how much would be accomplished.",
