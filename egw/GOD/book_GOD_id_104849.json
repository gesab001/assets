    "word": "Christ removed every obstruction that man might return to his allegiance to God. Christ became subject to suffering in behalf of man. And yet man by his selfish indulgence, is willing to place himself in slippery places, and through unnatural appetite obliterate the image of God. Man, who has been endowed with physical, mental, and moral power, has placed himself where he is a weakling. Satan knows that he cannot overcome man unless he can control his will. He can do this by deceiving man so that he will co-operate with him in transgressing the laws of nature in eating and drinking, which is transgression of the law of God.",
