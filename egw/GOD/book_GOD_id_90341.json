    "word": "We are in danger of encouraging one another to lean upon human aid. It is only too true that man has educated himself to look to man for directions and guidance in spiritual service. Why cannot each man and each woman fill the place given them, with the realization that if they ask for directions, seeking God for help, He will give liberally, and upbraid not. Then men will not lean upon men, but upon God, and from Him they would receive intelligence and keen perceptions.",
