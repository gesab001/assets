    "word": "There is danger of doubting whether the plans of others are what they should be and of advancing our special ideas and plans when we have not sufficient experience to show that our ideas are perfect and will prove a success. Do not encourage in your hearts the disposition to question another's plans, another's ideas. Until you have evidence that they are wrong do not criticize your fellow laborers. Let God take care of your brethren. He requires us to surrender our own souls to him. Brethren, do not keep yourselves in your own hands. Do not, either of you, think that of yourselves you are a whole, because you are not. You are only threads in the great web of humanity, and your work is to do your part in binding humanity together.",
