    "word": "\"Every one who is born of God doth not commit sin.\" He feels that he is the purchase of the blood of Christ, and bound by the most solemn vows to glorify God in his body and in his spirit which are God's. The love of sin and the love of self are subdued in him. He daily asks, \"What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?\" \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" The true Christian will never complain that the yoke of Christ is galling to the neck. He accounts the service of Jesus as the truest freedom. The law of God is his delight. Instead of seeking to bring down the divine commands, to accord with his deficiencies, he is constantly striving to rise to the level of their perfection.",
