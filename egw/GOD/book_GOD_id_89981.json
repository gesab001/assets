    "word": "Sometimes the men chosen to preside over the State Conferences are not the best and most trustworthy men. Some cannot reason correctly, because they have lost their spiritual eyesight. Spiritual things are \"spiritually discerned\" [1 Corinthians 2:14]. Much careful consideration should be given to the matter of appointing State Conference presidents. Much prayer should be offered to God. He should be sought most earnestly, that the presidents of the State Conferences may show themselves to be men of ability in spiritual understanding. The Lord requires this of all who come near to Him.",
