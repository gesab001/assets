    "word": "MR No. 1504 - Giving Proof of the Call to the Ministry\n\n     (Written September 24, 1859, from Topsham, Maine, and October 10, 1859, from Roxbury, Vermont.) \n\n\n     I was shown the state of things in Vermont. Their condition is not pleasing to God. They should have order among them, and have everything done up exact, straight, and square. There is too much leaving things at loose ends, and I saw there has been too much leaving the important truths to dwell on little things. There has been a stiff, unbending spirit with some in Vermont, and a desire to bend others to their ideas or notions.",
