    "word": "\"You are a responsible member of the family. You have been redeemed by the blood of the only begotten Son of God. He gave His life for you. He bore the penalty of sin and transgression for every son and daughter of Adam, that they should not perish if they believe in Him but have everlasting life. The voice of God speaks to you from His holy Word. It is to be believed, studied, and obeyed. Truth and righteousness are brought to you for your acceptance. 'Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?' Ignorant of your sinfulness you cannot consider your responsibilities to God.\"",
