    "word": "All through the Word of God are the most precious promises, but we must dig for them as the miner digs for the precious ore. We need to understand and practice the truth. As we are purified through the truth, we stand on vantage ground with God, because Christ has taken away our sins. As John saw the Saviour, he exclaimed, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Christ had no sin, and therefore He was able to bear our sins. That He might make an offering for the human race, that they might be members of the royal family, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ, He laid aside His kingly crown and royal robe, and stepped down from His high command, clothing His divinity with humanity.",
