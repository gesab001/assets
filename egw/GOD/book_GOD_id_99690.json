    "word": "Self must be kept hid in Jesus. O, if I could but set Him forth before you! O that our brethren could be brought to see the necessity of self-crucifixion, then I would have hopes that they might not only be useful, in this life, but might attain unto the future, \n                                                                           403\nimmortal life. May the Lord imbue me with His Holy Spirit constantly. O, that I could present the attractions of Christ so as to engross the whole mind of those for whom I labor! O that my brethren might appreciate the promises of God in all their breath and fullness! Then they might be saved from themselves, from self-confidence, criticism, unbelief, and phariseeism. Then self-exaltation would not be increasing, but decreasing--spiritual pride undone. There are many who claim to believe in Christ, who have not yet fallen upon the Rock and been broken, self lives, and is exalted. To such Christ does not appear what He is, or what He will be to all those who believe on Him.",
