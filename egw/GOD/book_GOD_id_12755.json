    "word": "Christ ate with publicans and sinners, as well as with Pharisees. When He was invited to their homes, He accepted the invitation. In this He offended the scribes and Pharisees, who thought that a Jew should not thus forget the wall of partition that tradition had erected. But with God there is no sect or nationality. When thus accused, Christ answered, \"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"  He placed Himself in the very avenue where He could gain access to perishing\n237\nsouls, and plant in human hearts the seeds of truth, seeds that would spring up and bear fruit to the glory of God.",
