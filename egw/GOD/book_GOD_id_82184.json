    "word": "A personal religion is essential for every physician if he would be successful in watching the diseased. He needs a power greater than his own intuition and skill. God would have physicians link up with Him, and know that every soul is precious in His sight. He who depends upon God, realizing that He alone who made man knows how to direct, will not fail as a healer of bodily infirmities. Letter 205, 1899, p. 8. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, December 19, 1899.)",
