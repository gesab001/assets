    "word": "The change of heart represented by the new birth can be brought about only by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit. . . . Pride and self-love resist the Spirit of God; every natural inclination of the soul opposes the change from self-importance and pride to the meekness and lowliness of Christ. But if we would travel in the pathway to eternal life, we must not listen to the whispering of self. In humility and contrition we must beseech our heavenly Father, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\" Psalm 51:10. As we receive divine light, and cooperate with the heavenly intelligences, we are \"born again,\" freed from the defilement of sin by the power of Christ.",
