He read this to the people, and they pledged themselves to obey all the words which the Lord had said. Moses then wrote their solemn pledge in a book, and offered sacrifice unto God for the people. \u201cAnd he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people, and they said, All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.\u201d\u2014Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, pp. 269, 270.",
