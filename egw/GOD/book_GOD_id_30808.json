    "word": "It is plain that two meals a day are better than three. I believe and practice this, but I have no \"Thus saith the Lord\" that it is wrong for some to eat the third meal. We are not to be as the Pharisees, bound about by set rules and regulations. God's word has not specified any set hours when food should be eaten. We are to be careful not to make laws like the laws of the Pharisees, or to teach for doctrines the commandments of men.",
