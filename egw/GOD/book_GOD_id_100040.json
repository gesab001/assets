    "word": "Sometimes the Lord speaks with me in the night season. Sometimes He speaks to me when I am standing on my feet, opening before me the sins of which some have been guilty. The Holy Spirit flashes light before me, giving me instruction to give to the people. This makes me glad; because I know that some will receive the light, and because I know that God, in infinite love and compassion, is still calling His people.",
