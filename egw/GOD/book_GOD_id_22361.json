    "word": "668\n     There are papist priests and prelates, who claimed to be Christ's ambassadors, yet employed the rack, the dungeon, and the stake to control the consciences of his people. There are the proud pontiffs who exalted themselves above God, and presumed to change the law of the Most High. Those pretended fathers of the church have an account to render to God from which they would fain be excused. Too late they are made to see that the Omniscient One is jealous of his law, and that he will in nowise clear the guilty. They learn now that Christ identifies his interest with that of his suffering people; and they feel the force of his own words, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d [Matthew 25:40.]",
