    "word": "I am very sorry for the poor souls who have braced themselves to carry out plans that are rooted in self. Those who have lost their discernment of the will and way of God, notwithstanding His requirements have been laid before them in clear lines, will lead other souls into by[ways] and forbidden paths. There is no safety for anyone unless the truth is enthroned in the heart. We are not to put confidence in man or make flesh our arm. We are to be molded and fashioned by the precious truths of the Bible. Daily we are to hold communion with Him who knoweth the end from the beginning. Those who do not do this will be false and unreliable.",
