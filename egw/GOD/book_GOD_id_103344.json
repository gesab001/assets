September 19,`07 Dr. Lillie Wood Starr, Loma Linda, Calif. \n\nDear Sister Starr:- \n\n\n     I feel very thankful that you have had the privilege of becoming better acquainted with the workers of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Our workers should make special efforts to come in touch with this organization, and to connect with the workers in the temperance cause. This will prove a great help to our own people, and also to these women workers. If the present truth is presented to them in the simplicity of godliness, they will see and accept it. We must keep close to the Lord. If we are imbued with His Spirit, the light will shine forth. It is Christ in the life that will make the truths we advocate forcible, and will lead souls to accept Him.",
