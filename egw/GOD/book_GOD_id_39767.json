    "word": "As, seeing the sinfulness of sin, we fall helpless before the cross, asking forgiveness and strength, our prayer is heard and answered. Those who present their petitions to God in Christ\u2019s name will never be turned away. The Lord says, \u201cHim that cometh to Me I will in nowise cast out.\u201d\u201cHe will regard the prayer of the destitute.\u201d Our help comes from Him who holds all things in His hands. The peace that He sends is the assurance of His love to us.",
