    "word": "If we would love God supremely and our neighbor as ourselves, we must come to Christ to be imbued with His love. Let every member of the church try to realize what he is and what he may be if he yields to Christ's control. Under the Saviour's guidance he will exert upon others a saving, restoring influence. Christians must be brought into family relationship with Christ. He must be formed within, the hope of glory.",
