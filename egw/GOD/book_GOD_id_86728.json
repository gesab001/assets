    "word": "The enemies of the truth know that they have not strong arguments to sustain their position; therefore they will try the mettle of the one who presents the truth. In the position where you are placed to vindicate the truth, keep self out of sight, make no boast of knowledge, place your feet upon the Word, the eternal Word of truth. Make no reference to any sly thrusts of your opponent. Do not manifest a spirit of retaliation. But ever maintain the gentleness of Christ. Put on Christ. Your physical infirmities urge you to hasty feelings and hasty words, which give your opponent an advantage. Abide in Christ. For the truth's sake, for Christ's sake, preserve the dignity, the elevated and ennobling character of the truth. Your zeal will need to be controlled by the Holy Spirit of God, lest it quicken into impatience as you see the Scriptures wrested and fables and human assertions \n\n\n                                    -24- \n\npresented as truth. Men who know that they have the truth can have power only as they present the truth as it is in Jesus. . . .",
