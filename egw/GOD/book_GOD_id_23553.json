    "word": "TITLE TO THE KINGDOM.\u2014We have His promise. We hold the title deeds to real estate in the kingdom of glory. Never were title deeds drawn up more strictly according to law, or signed more legibly, than those that give God\u2019s people a right to the heavenly mansions. \u201cLet not your heart be troubled,\u201d Christ says: \u201cye believe in God, believe also in\n56\nme. In my Father\u2019s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also\u201d (John 14:1-3)\u2014Letter 144, 1903 quoted in TDG 202.",
