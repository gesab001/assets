    "word": "When the student recognizes God as the source of all knowledge, and honors Him, submitting mind and character to be molded by His word, he may claim the promise, \"Them that honor Me I will honor.\" 1 Samuel 2:30. The more studiously the intellect is cultivated, the more effectively it can be used in the service of God if it is placed under the control of His Spirit. Talents used are talents multiplied. Experience in spiritual things widens the vision of saints and angels, and both increase in capability and knowledge as they work in their respective spheres.",
