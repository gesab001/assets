    "word": "I want you all, brethren, to seek the Lord and see light for yourselves and follow your own convictions after the presentation of that which I consider light from the Lord. Do not make a decision unless that light is your own light and you can step forward in confidence because that which has been spoken by me to you commends itself to your judgment and it becomes light to you as it has to me. Will you keep this prayer constantly ascending to God, Show me Thy way, O God? The Lord desires to lead you whom He will make representative men, who will be taught of God if you walk humbly before Him. But if any one of you becomes wise in your own conceit, be sure the Lord will leave you to follow your own finite judgment. The Lord God is our Strength, our Guide, our Counsellor. Keep mind and heart in constant prayer when in consideration on the land. Oh, do not regard this matter of little consequence, for it means much.",
