    "word": "The Lord is soon to come. We are to do our best as laborers together with God, exerting our God-given faculties to a good purpose; helping others by our carefulness to practice economy; teaching our children that we live not to please ourselves; teaching habits of industry, and not dressing for display; teaching all with whom we come in contact to develop better faculties and to form their characters after the character of Christ; and teaching that whether we eat or drink or whatsoever we do, to do all to the glory of God. By using the money to advance God's glory, all such work may be accomplished, and indolence will not be encouraged.",
