My mind is now clear in regard to matters about which I have been uncertain. I have been asking my heavenly Father to pardon me for looking to men, supposing that they must be wise. The Lord gave me warnings, which at first were presented to me in figures, but are now clearly opened before me. God has instructed me in regard to the work to be done in Nashville.",
