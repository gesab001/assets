    "word": "You are educating Homer to receive ideas that will lead him to superficial views of what constitutes a Christian character. You do not come up anywhere near to the Bible standard yourself, and your influence is to lead others to be satisfied with low attainments. While we have been earnestly laboring for the conversion of the youth, you, with other youth, have been leading them to be satisfied with hopes and pursuits that will disqualify them to stand amid the perils of the last days. You have had great light. You have been placed where you have had opportunities and privileges to know God's requirements, and you are quick to discern evidence presented as to what is truth. You will be without excuse in the great day when every soul will be judged, not by his own ideas of the standard of righteousness but by God's own moral standard of holiness. By that he will stand or fall.",
