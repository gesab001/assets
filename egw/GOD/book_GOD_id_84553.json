    "word": "\"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" To be justified means to be pardoned. To those whom God justifies He imputes Christ's righteousness; for the Saviour has taken away our sins. We stand before the throne of God justified and sanctified. We are emptied of self, and through the sanctification of the truth Christ abides in our hearts.--Letter 202, 1902, pp. 1, 2.
