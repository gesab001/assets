    "word": "God presented the case [of A.] before me. I told it to Brother B. when we were in Des Moines. Said I, \"If you don't come out as Elder Canright, it is because you will be a converted man; but every soul that is connected with you, that you have educated and trained as a debater, you will wish that work were undone.\" Brethren, we are not here for this work. We are not here to study infidel authors, to open our minds to the suggestions of the devil. We are here to get ready for the judgment, and we are right on the borders of the eternal world.--Ms 4, 1890, pp. 2, 3. (Sermon, March 8, 1890.)",
