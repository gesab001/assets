    "word": "Christ the Medium of Prayer and Blessing. \n\n\n                      Balaclava, Victoria, Australia, \n                                   March 25, 1898. \n\nTo a Sanitarium Physician-- \n     My Dear Brother: I have just received your letters. I see that you are having a close battle financially. I am so glad that you can heed the encouragement in the words, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\" Isaiah 27:5. Let us have faith in God. Let us put our trust in Him. He understands all about the situation in which we are placed, and He will work in our behalf. He is honored when we trust in Him, bringing to Him all our perplexities. \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name,\" Christ says, \"that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\" John 14:13. God's appointments and grants in our behalf are without limit. The throne of grace itself is occupied by One who permits us to call Him Father.",
