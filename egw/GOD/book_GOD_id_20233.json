    "word": "Fragments\n\nPersonal Experience\n\nGod's Willingness to Save\n     God is very pitiful, for he understands our weakness and our temptations; and when we come to him with broken hearts and contrite spirits, he accepts our repentance, and promises that, as we take hold of his strength to make peace with him, we shall make peace with him. O what gratitude, what joy, should we feel that God is merciful! \u2014 Vol. 3, p. 239.",
