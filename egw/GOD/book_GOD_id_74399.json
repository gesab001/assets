    "word": "The heavy judgments that were to befall the impenitent--war, exile, oppression, the loss of power and prestige among the nations--all these were to come in order that those who would recognize in them the hand of an offended God might be led to repent. The ten tribes of the northern kingdom were soon to be scattered among the nations, and their cities left desolate; the destroying armies of hostile nations were to sweep over their land again and again; even Jerusalem was finally to fall, and Judah was to be carried away captive; yet the Promised Land was not to remain wholly forsaken forever.--Review and Herald, March 11, 1915.",
