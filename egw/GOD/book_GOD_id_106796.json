    "word": "There are many present who have been much interested in missionary work in the South. To these I say, Rejoice, that the Southern field is being worked. Today I wish to leave this impression upon the mind of every one that is here, that the Southern field is to be thoroughly worked. This burden, as God has laid it upon us as a people, has been kept before us for many years. And the question for each individual is, What am I to do? To every man God has appointed his work. If we would only remember this, and seek humbly and perseveringly to know and to do our appointed work, guidance and grace would be given us to meet the trails and hardships of the way.",
