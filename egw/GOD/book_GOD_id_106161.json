    "word": "When all hope was excluded from Adam and Eve, in consequence of transgression and sin, when justice demanded the death of the sinner, Christ gave himself to be a sacrifice for the sin of the world. The world was under condemnation. Christ became substitute and surety for man. He would give his life for the world, which is represented as the one lost sheep that had strayed from the fold, whose guilt as well as helplessness was charged against it in the way, hindering its return. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. Every son and daughter of God, if they have an abiding Saviour, will act our Christ. Every soul that has not an abiding Saviour will reveal in unChristlikeness of character. Love is not cherished and put into exercise. \"Lift him up, the risen Saviour,\" in our words, in our conversation, in our dealing with the erring.",
