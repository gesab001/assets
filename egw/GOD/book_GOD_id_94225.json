    "word": "Many Echoes have been sold. This is well so far as it goes, but many more are to come before the people. There is a great need of leaflets and tracts, some containing short articles, others presenting the messages of warning, the second advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Sabbath, treated in brief, and its relation to the truth of the doctrines substantiated by the Scriptures should be circulated. It is not enough to merely sell the Echo. There is a world to be warned. Health subjects in clear, forcible, spirited articles, health and temperance principles, and experiences of faith and hope--all should be presented to the world. The branch office in the city may do a good work in this line. These silent words will make impressions on minds, and will awaken an interest in the truth of God.",
