    "word": "Measured by finite minds, men are called learned and great, but with all their boasted wisdom, their science and learning, they cannot thus know God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. . . . No man who has ever lived, or who ever will live, can claim to be the infallible guide, the supreme revealer of truth. Men may seek to reach the highest standard in learning, but there is One, \"a teacher sent from God,\" who still stands higher than they. No human teacher can equal Him.",
