    "word": "All who would have the seal of the living God, must be laborers together with God to make up the breach that has been made in the law of God by the man of sin, and to raise up the foundation of many generations. \"Ye are laborers together with God. They will turn away their feet from trampling on the law of God, and by precept and example turn the feet of many others from the path of disobedience. They will keep the Sabbath from polluting it; they will call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable, and will honor him, not doing their own ways, nor finding their own pleasure, nor speaking their own words. \"Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord, and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\"",
