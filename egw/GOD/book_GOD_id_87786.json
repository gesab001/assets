    "word": "A Worldwide Message.--The message of the angel following the third is now to be given to all parts of the world. It is to be the harvest message, and the whole earth will be lighted with the glory of God. The Lord has this one more call of mercy to the world, but the perversity of men diverts the work from its true bearing, and the light has to struggle amid the darkness of men who feel themselves competent to do a work that God has not appointed them to do.--Letter 86, 1900, pp. 8, 9. (To A. G. Daniells, June 18, 1900.) \n\n\n                                   -291-",
