    "word": "The great truth that was to be kept before men, and imprinted upon mind and heart, was this, \"Without shedding of blood is no remission.\" In every bleeding sacrifice was typified \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" Christ Himself was the originator of the Jewish system of worship, in which, by types and symbols, were shadowed forth spiritual and heavenly things. Many forgot the true significance of these offerings; and the great truth that through Christ alone there is forgiveness of sin, was lost to them. The multiplying of sacrificial offerings, the blood of bulls and goats, could not take away sin.-- The Signs of the Times, Jan. 2, 1893.",
