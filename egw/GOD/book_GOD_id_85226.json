    "word": "MR No. 329 - Securing the Paradise Valley Sanitarium\n\n     I hope that you will look to God for counsel, and that you will endeavor to carry out the plans that were decided upon before Willie left for the East. Work steadily to the point. Show tact and skill in devising, and promptitude in action. You will have to exercise your own judgment; for we may be called away from California. It may be that the Lord will impress me that it is my duty to spend some time in Washington. And I may be directed to remain here with my workers.",
