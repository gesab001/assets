    "word": "Patience, charity, and Christian courtesy are to be brought into the work of helping our institutions in Europe. This will show soundness of faith and healthfulness of soul. It will show that true Bible principles are practiced. There has been a work accomplished which in no way pleases the enemy of righteousness. Who will now place themselves on the Lord's side and as His helping hand engage in doing His work? Who will now seek to build up, not to tear down? This is a work which should go forward in strong lines. God's people should serve Him in truth and righteousness. Who will now appropriate their God-given means to relieve the painful pressure upon our beloved fellow workers? Who will now enter into partnership \n\n\n                                -228- \n\nwith God to dispense His means in this emergency? All our churches should now work actively and wholeheartedly for God, each member determined to avert the great calamity which threatens the Lord's instrumentalities.",
