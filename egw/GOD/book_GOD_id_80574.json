    "word": "Suppose that twenty men and women should present themselves as subjects for prayer at some of our camp-meetings. This would not be unlikely; for those who are suffering will do anything in their power to obtain relief, and to regain strength and health. Of these twenty, few have regarded the light on the subject of purity and health reform. They have neglected to practise right principles in eating and drinking, and in taking care of their bodies, and some of these who are married have formed gross habits and indulged in unholy practises, while of those who are unmarried some have been reckless of life and health, since in clear rays the light has shone upon them; but they have not had respect unto the light, nor have they walked circumspectly; yet they solicit the prayers of God's people, and call for the elders of the church. Should they regain the blessing of health many of them would pursue the same course of heedless transgression of nature's laws, unless enlightened and thoroughly transformed. They solicit the prayers of God's people and call for the elders of the church. But little is known of their home or private life. Sin has brought many of them where they are,--to a state of feebleness of mind and debility of body. Shall prayer be offered to the God of heaven for his healing to come upon them then and there, without specifying any condition?--I say, No, decidedly no. What, then, shall be done?--Present their cases before Him who knows every individual by name.",
