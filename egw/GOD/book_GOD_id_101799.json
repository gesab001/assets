    "word": "No action is transacted toward one of your fellow-men in which God is not concerned. He is the eternal, universal guardian of justice. You cannot get away from his presence, if you would. He takes part against all who would commit one act of wrong against their fellow-men, high or low, rich or poor. His own hand is spread out as a buckler over the rights of brother toward brother. No man can wound or bruise the soul or rights of his brother without smiting against the hand of justice which holds the sword.",
