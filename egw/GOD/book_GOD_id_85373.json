    "word": "The widow and the fatherless are the objects of the Lord's special care, and those who in any way rob them of the means they should have, those who regard their wants with indifference, will be dealt with by the Judge of all the earth. Men cannot receive God's favor while they are unfeeling and selfish. The Lord will test His people as individuals. He will not suffer His heritage to be oppressed. . . .",
