    "word": "How soon the Israelites distrusted God! They had witnessed all his judgments upon Egypt to compel the king to let Israel go, and when their confidence in God was tested they murmured, notwithstanding they had seen such evidences of his power in their wonderful deliverance. Instead of trusting in God in their necessity, they murmured at faithful Moses, reminding him of their words of unbelief which they uttered in Egypt. They accused him of being the cause of all their distress. He encouraged them to trust in God, and withhold their expressions of unbelief, and they should see what the Lord would do for them. Moses \n                                                                           233\nearnestly cried to the Lord to deliver his chosen people.",
