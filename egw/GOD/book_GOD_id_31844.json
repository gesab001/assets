    "word": "Many who profess not the love of God do control their spirit to a considerable extent without the aid of the special grace of God. They cultivate self-control. This is indeed a rebuke to those who know that from God they may obtain strength and grace and yet do not exhibit the graces of the Spirit. Christ is our model. He was meek and lowly. Learn of Him and imitate His example. The Son of God was faultless. We must aim at this perfection and overcome as He overcame if we would have a seat at His right hand.--3T 336 (1873). \n\n126",
