    "word": "The infinite wisdom of God has employed human agencies to cooperate with Him in His work for the salvation of men. He has a variety of agencies, with different gifts, and they are to cooperate harmoniously, each filling his own God-given sphere of action. We are to work for the salvation of our fellow men, not by judging them, but by showing forth what the Lord has done for us in the transformation of character. Your faith, your sympathy, your forbearance, your love, your gentleness, your temperance in all things, will be as a light shining in a dark place.",
