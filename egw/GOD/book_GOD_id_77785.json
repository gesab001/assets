    "word": "God now requires unselfish, valiant men and women. As Bro. and sister Palmer now are, it would not improve matters for them to move to Battle Creek. If they were transformed by the renewing of the mind; if they loved themselves less, and their neighbor as themselves, they would be just the ones to help keep the fort at Battle Creek. But the influence of sister Palmer in Battle Creek, in her love for dress, and in her love of self, and her lack of sympathy, benevolence, and love for others, would make her a body of darkness and burden to the cause.",
