    "word": "All duties are irksome into which the heart is not brought. Time is golden. There is a work to be done, and into the doing of this work we are to put our whole hearts. The duties that God places in our way we are to perform, not as a cold, dreary exercise, but as a service of love. Bring into your work your highest powers and sympathies. And you will find that Christ is in it. His presence will make work light, and your heart will be filled with joy. You will work in harmony with God, and in loyalty, love, and fidelity.",
