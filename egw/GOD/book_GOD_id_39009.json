    "word": "Heaven brought nearer\n     Will it make us miserable to follow this plan of Christian progression?\u2014No. It will bring heaven nearer to us. We may have the sweet peace and consolation of God in doing this work. These steps will take us into the atmosphere of heaven; for as God sees His children seeking to carry out His instruction in their habits and thoughts, He multiplies grace, and gives them that wisdom that cometh down from above, that is \u201cfirst pure, then peaceable, \n21\ngentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits.\u201d",
