    "word": "The work at our campmeetings should be conducted not according to man's devising, but after the manner of Christ's working. The church members should be drawn out to labor. The light is to be taken from under the bushel, that it may reach to the many that \n\n\n                              -439- \n\nneed it. I am instructed to say that the angels of God will direct in the opening of fields nigh as well as afar off, that the work of warning the world may be accomplished. God calls upon believers to obtain an experience in missionary work by branching out into new territory, and working intelligently for the people in the byways. To those who will do this, openings, for labor will come. The light of truth will shine forth to the (world through the) efforts of missionary workers.",
