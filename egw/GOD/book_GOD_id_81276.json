    "word": "I have been shown that the physicians should come into a closer connection with God, and stand and work earnestly in his strength. They have a responsible part to act. Not only the lives of the patients, but their souls also, are at stake. Many who are benefited physically, may, at the same time, be greatly helped spiritually. The health of the body and also the salvation of the soul is in a great degree dependent upon the course of the physicians. It is of the utmost consequence that they are right; that they have not only scientific knowledge, but the knowledge of God's will and of God's ways. Great responsibilities rest upon them.",
