    "word": "Ministry means much more than sermonizing; it means earnest personal labor. The church on earth is composed of erring men and women, who need patient, painstaking labor, that they may be trained and disciplined to work with acceptance in this life, and in the future life be crowned with glory and immortality. Pastors are needed,--faithful shepherds,--who will not flatter God's people, nor treat them harshly, but who will feed them with the bread of life,--men who in their lives feel daily the converting power of the Holy Spirit, and who cherish a strong, unselfish love for those for whom they labor.",
