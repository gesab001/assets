    "word": "\"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul\" [Psalm 19:7]. The grace of God alone can give you the experience that comes from a perfected character. God alone can enable you to walk before Him with a perfect heart. The Holy One has given erring finite beings rules for their guidance. These rules form a standard from which there can be no sinless swerving. He who does not make God's will paramount has yet to learn the first principles of holiness. \n\n\n                                   -211-",
