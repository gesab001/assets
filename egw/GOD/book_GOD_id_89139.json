    "word": "MR No. 931 - Events Related to Christ's Second Coming\n\n     Need for Aggressive Work to Be Done--A great work is to be done to prepare a people to stand in the day of the Lord. Missionaries should be at work in every large city, where our publications should be kept for distribution. Missionaries should be in all quarters of the earth to enlighten those who are in darkness, to make ready a people for the soon coming of Jesus. There is a great work to be done to combat all the prejudice, not only of the ignorant but of the learned. There are schools to be supported, that we may educate the youth and teach them the Bible and to love and reverence God.--Letter 65, 1884, p. 4. (To Brother Osborn, Feb. 7, 1884.)",
