    "word": "There is a belief that is not a saving faith. The Word declares that the devils believe and tremble. The so-called faith that does not work by love and purify the soul will not justify any man. \"Ye see,\" says the apostle, \"how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.\" Abraham believed God. How do we know that he believed? His works testified to the character of his faith, and his faith was accounted to him for righteousness.",
