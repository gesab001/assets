    "word": "But all are to realize their individual responsibility to employ their talents to the glory of God according to their ability. Let no man or council of men assume the responsibility of making as little of these talents as possible, according to their human estimate of God's entrusted qualifications. No man is to weigh in the balances of human judgment the talents God has given to other men. Let every man appreciate God's gifts to himself, and faithfully trade upon them. No man is to merge his individuality in that of any other man. There are diversities of gifts, and a large work to be done in our world in the use of God's entrusted goods, and the efforts that have been made to turn all the profits from the talents of writers into the hands of the conference or the publishing house will not prove a success; for the plan is not just and equal.",
