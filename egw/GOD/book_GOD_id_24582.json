    "word": "Religion is our only safeguard. Knowledge is power for good or for evil, but it is only when balanced by religious principle that it is a power for good. To many, education means a knowledge of books; but \u201cthe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d The true object of education is to restore the image of God in the soul. The first and most precious knowledge is the knowledge of Christ, and wise parents will keep this fact ever before the minds of their children.",
