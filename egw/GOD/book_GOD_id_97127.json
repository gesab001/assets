    "word": "What we all need is a conscience, and with many it is dead. What souls need is to die to self and be born again. Conscience needs a resurrection. What is wanted is to know what religion is; to know what it is to have a living connection with the God of heaven; to know God and Jesus Christ, whom He hath sent, for we read, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\" [John 17:3]. Then there is a knowledge. Why, I ask you, do you devote so little time to prayer, so little time to your Bibles, searching the Word that you may be sure you are following the directions therein given that you may secure eternal life? Why do you feel so little burden to consecrate yourselves and your household to God? Why do you make it a mere form of worship? Many of you would be terribly surprised if Christ should answer your prayers. You do not expect it. You are not making calculations for it. You have a form, and the prayers of many of you do not rise any higher than your head. What do we want? Repentance of your sins. Confess your sins before God and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come and He shall send Jesus [see Acts 3:19, 20].",
