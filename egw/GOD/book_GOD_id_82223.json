    "word": "The work of the medical profession calls for men who love and fear God. The people have long been afflicted with unconverted men, who have acted independently of the church, and have followed their own unsanctified judgment, imperiled our institutions by the unsanctified independence. But our institutions need not accept unconsecrated men and women, because they know not what better to do; for converted physicians will be raised up to take their place in the work. Unless the principles of divine truth control the physicians as they have not done hitherto, God will be dishonored, souls will be lost, and the institution established for the benefit of the sick and suffering, will not meet the mind of the Spirit of God. . . .",
