    "word": "IN ISAIAH 8:19, 20, IS A PROPHECY OF THE FAMILIAR SPIRITS OF THE PRESENT TIME, AND THE LAW IS GIVEN AS A TEST: \"TO THE LAW AND TO THE TESTIMONY: IF THEY SPEAK NOT ACCORDING TO THIS WORD, IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIGHT IN THEM.\" WHY SAY, \"IF THEY SPEAK NOT,\" IF THERE WAS TO BE NO TRUE SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATION OR PROPHESYING AT THE SAME TIME? JESUS SAYS, \"BEWARE OF FALSE PROPHETS. . . . YE SHALL KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUITS.\" MATTHEW 7:15, 16. THIS IS A PART OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT, AND ALL CAN SEE THAT THIS DISCOURSE HAS A GENERAL APPLICATION TO THE CHURCH THROUGH THE GOSPEL AGE. FALSE PROPHETS ARE TO BE KNOWN BY THEIR FRUITS; IN OTHER WORDS, BY THEIR MORAL CHARACTER. THE ONLY STANDARD BY WHICH TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR FRUITS ARE GOOD OR BAD, IS THE LAW OF GOD. THUS WE ARE BROUGHT TO THE LAW AND TO THE TESTIMONY. TRUE PROPHETS WILL NOT ONLY SPEAK ACCORDING TO THIS WORD, BUT THEY WILL LIVE ACCORDING TO IT. ONE WHO SPEAKS AND LIVES THUS, I DARE NOT CONDEMN. \n                                                                           139",
