    "word": "The Lord is our Helper, our Defense. God has provided that no soul that trusts in Him shall be overcome by temptation. Christ is just as much with His believing ones when they are compelled to be associated in any sense with the world as when they meet in His house to worship Him. Think of these words: \"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life\" (Revelation 3:4, 5).--Manuscript 97, Aug. 11, 1898, \"The Necessity of a Close Walk With God.\"",
