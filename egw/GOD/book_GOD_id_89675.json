    "word": "From the desert where single-handed Christ wrestled with the temptation of the enemy, to the cross, Satan was on the Saviour's track. All hell was leagued against Christ. And the people that God had honored by making them the repositories of sacred truth, that they might be lights in the darkness of the world, joined the ranks of the great rebel, and sought to extinguish the light that was to lighten every man that cometh into the world. \"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not\" [John 1:10]. Satan had thrown his hellish shadow across their pathway, to intercept the rainbow of promise. Priests and rulers confederated with him to catch Christ in His words, but they failed. At times the temptations were most painful, but step by step Christ advanced in the path of humiliation and self-sacrifice. All Satan's attempts to inspire Him with his own attributes were unsuccessful.",
