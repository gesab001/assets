    "word": "Office Workers Should Be Literature Evangelists.-- The Lord's work has many branches. The ways in which the Lord condescends to employ human agents are numerous. As God's stewards each man and woman has a work to perform. Each one is given capabilities which qualify him for this work. If those in responsible positions in the office put aside all selfishness, if they faithfully weigh the probabilities and possibilities, they will see that if there are any employed in the office to do a work that might better be done outside the office, these should be placed where they can use their ability in other lines of the Lord's work. There is great need of canvassers, and none of us are in this world to please and glorify self.--MS 54, 1899.",
