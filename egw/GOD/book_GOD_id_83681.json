    "word": "Put away your feelings against Elder Daniells right here on the ground. You are to be in unity, not because he is perfect; he makes mistakes. He is making mistakes on this ground. But the Lord's eye is upon him; he is beloved of God. And if you do not cling closely to God you will make much graver mistakes than he has made. . . . The Lord loves Elder Daniells and He will reprove and instruct you both where you err.--Ms 35, 1895, p. 10. (Untitled, no Date.)",
