    "word": "Not all who name the name of Christ are one with Christ. Those who do not have the Spirit and the grace of Christ are none of His, no matter what may be their profession. By their fruits ye shall know them. The customs and practices that are after the order of the world do not carry out the principles of God's law, and therefore do not breathe of His Spirit nor express His character. Christlikeness will be revealed only by those who are assimilated to the divine image. Only those who are being molded through the operation of the Holy Spirit are doers of the Word of God, and express the mind and the will of God.",
