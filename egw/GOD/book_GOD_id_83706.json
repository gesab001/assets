    "word": "When you were here last January, I did advise you not to sell The Morning Star. I have seen how the Lord moved upon the hearts of our brethren to provide funds to build the boat, how He guided in planning its construction, and how the angels of God have preserved it in its work, and guarded your life from the perils that surrounded you. Nothing less than the loving care of the life-preserving Saviour kept you in the perils through which you have passed on The Morning Star. This boat was often an asylum of safety, enabling you to leave places where, even though you knew it not, your life was in danger, and to accomplish a work in other places where people were not so bitterly opposed. . . .",
