    "word": "All who would work for the Master must submit to the yoke of Christ. This submission involves self-sacrifice and entire consecration of body, soul, and spirit. As they learn of Christ, His meekness and lowliness, they will find that His yoke is easy and His burden is light. They will not become weary in His service. . . . Let all ask of God, and they will receive wisdom to carry on His work under the ministration of the Holy Spirit. . . .",
