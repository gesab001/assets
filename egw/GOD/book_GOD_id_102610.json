    "word": "Those who claim to believe the truth should obey the word of God just as it reads, practicing its instruction. Remember that those who love not their brethren deny the faith. Many because their brethren do not follow their leading, manifest toward them a spirit of hatred. Is their leading right? Is it wrong? God has never bidden us follow the leading of any man, and he has said, \"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of a tumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.\" Can we not see from this what it means to be at variance?",
