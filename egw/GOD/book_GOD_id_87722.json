    "word": "Christ Able to Cleanse From Sin.--Now brethren, you want to get hold of the pillars of your faith. Here is Christ in the great antitypical Day of Atonement and you must understand that you need a special preparation for the Day of Atonement. We want our sins taken away, we want to confess them that they may go beforehand to judgment. Do not go away in discouragement, but believe that Christ is able to cleanse you from all unrighteousness. We must cease to sin because sin is the transgression of the law. Put away sin and then cling to the Mighty One who is able to wash away every stain of sin. Now this is a work of humility at this time, and we must confess our sins and get nearer to God so He can write \"Pardon\" against our names.",
