    "word": "It is the Word of the living God that is to decide all controversies. It is when people mingle their own human smartness with God\u2019s words of truth, in giving sharp thrusts to those who are in controversy with them, that they show that they have not a sacred reverence for God\u2019s Inspired Word. They mix the human with the divine, the common with the sacred, and they belittle God\u2019s Word. . . .",
