    "word": "In His Word the Lord has made it plain that His people are a joyful people. True faith reaches up the hand and lays hold upon the One who is behind the promise \"Great shall be the peace of thy children\" (Isaiah 54:13). \"Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river\" (Isaiah 66:12). \"Behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy\" (Isaiah 65:18). In God we may \"rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory\" (1 Peter 1:8). \"Men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed\" (Psalm 72:17). Let us strive to educate the believers to rejoice in the Lord. Spiritual joy is the result of active faith. God's people are to be full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. Then He will be glorified in them.--Bible Training School, Apr. 1, 1905.",
