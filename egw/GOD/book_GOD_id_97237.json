    "word": "Did Christ die to let loose the whole of humanity to worship idols instead of God, when the commandment said, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\"? \"And the Lord made the heaven and the earth,\" and what then? \"And rested the seventh day and sanctified it,\" and gave it to you to observe as God's memorial--a memorial that He is the living God that created the heavens overhead and the earth upon which we stand. (See Exodus 20.) He made the lofty trees, and put the covering upon every flower. He gave to each one its tints, and the Lord of heaven made man and gave him the Sabbath. What for? For all the posterity of Adam. It was a gift to all his posterity.",
