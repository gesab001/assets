    "word": "Fearful perils are before those who bear responsibilities in the cause of God--perils the thought of which make me tremble. But the word comes, \"My hand is upon the wheel, and I will not allow men to control My work for these last days. My hand is turning the wheel, and My providence will continue to work out the divine plans, irrespective of human inventions. Man's plans will be overthrown, and the Lord God of heaven will reveal His glory. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit will work out Heaven's law. These three great Powers have pledged themselves to bring to nought the inventions of idolatrous human minds. They have put the infinite treasures of heaven at the command of God's struggling people. As the wheel is \n\n\n                                     -152- \n\nturned by a divine hand, the philosophy of the wisest men who are working contrary to My purposes will become intricate and confused.\"",
