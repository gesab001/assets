    "word": "Satan stood by your side to afflict and destroy, that you might be numbered with the transgressors. Fervent and effectual prayer prevailed in your behalf. Angels were sent to wait and watch about you to guard and protect you from Satan's power and preserve your life. God has, in his matchless love, granted you another trial. Not because of any goodness or virtue in you, but because of his mercy he has answered the prayers of faith. Your probation was lengthened that you might have an opportunity to redeem the past, overcome the defects in your character, and show in your life that devotion to God which he claims from you. You have had emotions of gratitude, but you have not experienced that heart-felt thankfulness and becoming humility that should have been kindled by his unsurpassed love.",
