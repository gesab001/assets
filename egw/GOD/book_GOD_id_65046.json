    "word": "Marriage as Firm as the Sabbath. Men who are placed in important positions, as those at the Health Retreat, are made the special objects of Satan's attacks. They are brought necessarily into the society of men and women. Some of these have a coarse, passionate, sensual nature, who when under temptation would do anything, regardless of God, regardless of consequences. They would break down the barriers of the marriage relation, that they may form new connections.",
