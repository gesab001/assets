    "word": "Next I heard them crying unto God earnestly. Through the day and night their cry ceased not. I heard these words, \"Thy will, O God, be done! If it can glorify Thy name, make a way of escape for Thy people! Deliver us from the heathen round about us! They have appointed us unto death; but Thine arm can bring salvation.\" These are all the words I can bring to mind. They seemed to have a deep sense of their unworthiness, and manifested entire submission to the will of God. Yet everyone, without an exception, was earnestly pleading, and wrestling like Jacob for deliverance.--Review and Herald, Dec. 31, 1857.",
