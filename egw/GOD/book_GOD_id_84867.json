    "word": "I speak because I know what I am talking about. For more than forty years I have stood in the desk proclaiming salvation to sinners, and my heart has yearned over them. God has opened before me the glory of heaven, and I have obtained a sight of the majesty and glory of my Redeemer. I have obtained a sight of the angels in glory. I was very young when the physicians said, \"You must die, you cannot live more than three months.\" It was then that God gave me a sight of His glory, and said, \"Go proclaim the message I give you, to the people.\" I started out in my weakness. I could hardly stand. I had not spoken aloud for weeks, but when I stood before the people, God's power came upon me. Voice was given me and I talked from two to three hours with clearness. But when I had finished, my voice again was gone. I traveled for three months in this way and then the pain of the lungs ceased, and ever since I have been doing the work which the Master has given me to do. I have traveled and labored, and God has given me strength to continue unto this day.--Ms 6a, 1886, p. 11. (Sermon, \"Preparation for the Judgment,\" June 27, 1886.)",
