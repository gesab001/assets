    "word": "The church needs to be begotten again unto a lively hope \"by the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.\" When the church awakes to a sense of what must be done in our world, the members will have travail of soul for those who know not God and who in their spiritual ignorance, cannot understand the truth for this time. Self-denial, self-sacrifice, is to be woven into all our experience. We are to pray and watch unto prayer, that there may be no inconsistency in our lives. We must not fail to show others that we understand that watching unto prayer means living our prayers \n                                                                           47\nbefore God, that He may answer them.",
