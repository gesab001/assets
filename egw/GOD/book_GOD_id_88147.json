And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having \n\n\n                                  -146- \n\non His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in Thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for Thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe\" (Revelation 14:12-15).",
