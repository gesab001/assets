    "word": "God's Condescension in Saving Man--The Son of God does indeed call men, uniting them with Him as brethren, conferring upon them the honor of divine sonship. What wonderful condescension on the part of Christ. He became our elder brother, that we might become sons and daughters of God. We have been bought with a price--and what a price! Christ volunteered to come to this earth and stand at the head of fallen human beings, who were heirs of guilt, under sentence of eternal death. We must have perished had He not borne our guilt and the wrath of God.",
