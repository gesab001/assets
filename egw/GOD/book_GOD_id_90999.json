    "word": "Men have broken God's laws, and despised and trampled on His Sabbath. Thus they have broken their contract with God, and He cannot work in their behalf. The Lord tells us in words too plain to be misapprehended that that metal of the faith of His once chosen people is corrupted. They have a spurious faith. They have changed leaders, and no longer bear the King's sign. They cannot be trusted in time of test or trial, for they will act the traitor's part. They do not draw from the Lord's foundry.",
