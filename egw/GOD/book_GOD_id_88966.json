    "word": "You may close your eyes and ears to the messages that God sends, but after all, you do believe them. And you may depend on this: A mother could not hold more firmly to a child that she dearly loves than I shall hold to you. I expect to see you engaged in the work that God has given you, and I pray for you constantly, in private prayer and at family worship. Sometimes I am awakened in the night, and rising, I walk the room, praying, \"O Lord, hold Dr. Kellogg fast. Do not let him go. Keep him steadfast. Anoint his eyes with the heavenly eyesalve, that he may see all things clearly.\" --Letter 174, 1902, pp. 2, 6, 9. (To J. H. Kellogg, Nov. 11, 1902.)",
