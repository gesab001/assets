    "word": "The qualities which it is essential for all to possess are those which marked the completeness of Christ's character,--His love, His patience, His unselfishness, and His goodness. These attributes are gained by doing kindly actions with a kindly heart. . . . Christians love those around them as precious souls for whom Christ has died. There is no such thing as a loveless Christian; for \"God is love.\" . . . \"This is my commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you.\" This is the fruit that is to be given back to God.",
