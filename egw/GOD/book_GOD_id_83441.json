    "word": "Obedience to the will of God will involve a cross. Christ says: \"Think not that I am come to send peace on the earth.\" \"I came not to send peace, but a sword.\" Matthew 10:34. And we find that the truth for this age, if lived out, will \"set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\" Verses 35, 36.",
