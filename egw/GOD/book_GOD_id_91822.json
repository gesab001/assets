    "word": "Then why is there not a practical carrying out of this principle of love? Christ gave His own life for the life of the world. \"Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life for the sheep.\" Why do not these words of Christ stir our souls with intense desire to love one another as He has loved us? Christ engaged in covenant with God the Father to represent the love of God in His humanity for the fallen race. Christ knew that this great display of the grace of God, which He Himself engaged to represent--nothing less could represent that love of infinity than in giving His own Son to save the guilty sinner. Christ undertook the plan when He knew all things, that nothing else than the infinite capabilities that made Him equal with the Father could possibly express the plan unless He became one with humanity, taking upon Him the nature of man, and thus bearing all the temptations as man, and dying that man might live through faith in His redeeming power.",
