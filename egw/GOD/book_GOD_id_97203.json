    "word": "We are not to lean upon man. God is to be consulted. All our trust is to be placed in Him. But to walk by faith and not by sight does not mean that we are to close our eyes and see nothing. We must open our eyes as wide as possible, but they must be directed to the Saviour. If we continue to look to Him, He will guide us into all truth. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the author and finisher of our faith.",
