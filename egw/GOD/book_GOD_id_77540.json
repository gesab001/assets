    "word": "I hope that every man and woman who names the name of Christ in Fresno will consider the words I have written you with solemn earnestness, and that you will not flatter Elder Daniels. Give him no [plaudits], to encourage him in his unbelief. He may despise the warnings of God; he may act an unchristian part; and yet do you insist that there is no man like Elder Daniels? That you must have him, even under the rebuke of God, because his entertaining sharpness pleases a certain class of minds? Do you think that you can get along if he is not spiritual? That if he only pleases and interests you, piety, holiness, and the Christian graces are not essential? Do you know, brethren in Fresno, that the whole heavenly universe is looking upon you, to see whether you will exalt the standard of Christianity, or lower it in the very dust? God is looking upon you; Jesus, who has given you an example in his holy life, is watching to see whether you, as a church, feel that it is an important matter that you should discern between true godliness and sin.",
