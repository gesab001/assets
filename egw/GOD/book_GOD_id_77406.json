    "word": "If the lessons of Christ, the truths of the Bible in their simplicity can be placed before these souls, they will recognize the light and rejoice in it. Their perplexities will vanish before the light of truth as dew before the morning sun. Their conceptions of Bible truth will be expanded, and the revelation of God in Christ will come to them, showing them the depth, breadth, and height of divine spiritual mystery, that they did not before discern, that cannot be explained, but only exemplified in Christ-like character.",
