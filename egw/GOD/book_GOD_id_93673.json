    "word": "I am pleading earnestly with God in my own behalf that He will give me physical strength to bear my testimony. I am praying that my eyesight may be preserved that I may continue to use my pen in giving the warning message to our people. I would plead with our churches to watch unto prayer, lest they fall under the deceptive arts of Satan. Watch, watch lest the enemy obtain a hold upon your souls. Satan is playing the game of life for every soul, and those who are unguarded will be caught in his snares. These may be men in official positions; they may be ministers of the gospel. They may be physicians \n\n\n                                    -66- \n\nin our sanitariums who have not a true sense of their responsibilities and who are letting precious opportunities slip by unimproved, by which they might speak a word in season to souls who need it.",
