    "word": "\"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God: having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\" This class will be developed among us as a people as well as in the world. Great, then, is the need that we stand in that position where every jot of our powers may be used to magnify God and His truth.",
