    "word": "There stood Jesus, meek and humble before the infuriated multitude, while they offered him the meanest abuse. They spit in his face--that face which they will one day desire to be hid from, which will give light to the city of God, and shine brighter than the sun--but not an angry look did he cast upon the offenders. He meekly raised his hand, and wiped it off. They covered his head with an old garment; blindfolded him, and then struck him in the face, and cried out, Prophesy unto us who it was that smote thee. There was commotion among the angels. They would have rescued him instantly; but their commanding angel restrained them.",
