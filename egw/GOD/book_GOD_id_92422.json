    "word": "Men whom we had reason to believe would maintain their integrity against all wrong have proved to be unreliable, unable to bear the test of trial. Brother H. W. Kellogg was not proof against the representations of Brother A. R. Henry and some others. Professedly, these men were working for the interests of the publishing institution, and though Brother Henry Kellogg at first declared that he would not adopt certain resolutions or act upon certain methods, which he knew were not fair in business lines or in keeping with the way of the Lord, yet he finally accepted these propositions, which meant act after act of complicated robbery--robbery which was clothed in angels' garments. I say complicated, for everything seemed to have reference to some other line and some other interest. This, if you desire, I can define; but my guide cautioned me in no case to accept propositions coming from the board of directors of the publishing house in Battle Creek; for they meant robbery, robbery of those dependent upon the talents and abilities which God had given them. They meant robbery on the right hand and on the left, even more so than the men who advocated them could discern.",
