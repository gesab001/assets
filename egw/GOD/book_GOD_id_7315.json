    "word": "God's messengers in the great cities are not to become discouraged over the wickedness, the injustice, the depravity, which they are called upon to face while endeavoring to proclaim the glad tidings of salvation. . . . In every city, filled though it may be with violence and crime, there are many who with proper teaching may learn to become followers of Jesus. . . . God's message for the inhabitants of earth today is, \"Be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh\" (Matthew 24:44). . . . We are standing on the threshold of the crisis of the ages. . . .",
