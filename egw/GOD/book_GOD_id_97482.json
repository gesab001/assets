    "word": "One-time Dr. Trall said to me, \"I must tell you that you put forth too much strength when you stand before the people. If you continue to do as you are doing you cannot live over three years, and I do not know that you can live three months.\" I had with me a copy of the book, How to Live, and I asked Dr. Trall if he would read the book. He replied that he would, and I let him take it. A few days afterward he said to me, \"Mrs. White, where did you get your instruction in medical science?\" I replied that I had received it by revelation from God. As he handed the book back to me, he said, \"That book is filled with truth. I hope it may have a wide circulation.\" Dr. Trall was an unbeliever, and he used often to speak against our ministers, but he would never say one word against Mrs. White. He is now dead, and I, whom he thought could live only a short time, have been preserved all these years. I shall soon be seventy-eight years old. I have placed myself in the hands of God, and He has sustained me, enabling me to bear my testimony in many parts of the world.",
