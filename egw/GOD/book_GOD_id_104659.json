    "word": "Many whom God has qualified to do excellent work by giving them powers to use to his glory, accomplish little because they attempt little. Thousands who come into the world pass through life as though they had no definite object for which to live, no standard to reach. Such will obtain a reward proportionate to their works. Health and a clear conscience will attend those who work faithfully keeping the glory of God in view. There are many who are mere fragments of men. In Christ is seen the perfection of Christian character. He is our Pattern. His life was not a life of indolence or ease. He lived not to please Himself. He was the Son of the infinite God, yet He worked at the carpenter's trade with His father. As a member of the home firm, He faithfully acted His part in helping to support the family.",
