    "word": "God cares no less for the souls of the African race that may be won to serve Him than He cared for Israel. He requires far more of His people than they have given Him in missionary work among the people of the South of all classes, and especially the colored race. Are we not under even greater obligation to labor for the colored people than for those who have been more highly favored? . . . The truth must be carried to them. They have souls to save as well as we. . . .",
