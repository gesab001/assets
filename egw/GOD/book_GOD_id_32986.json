    "word": "Chap. 89 - Appendix B\n\nImplicit Trust Irrespective of Changes in Emotional Atmosphere \n\nThe Author's Personal Experience \n\n     When you are deeply shadowed, it is because Satan has interposed himself between you and the bright rays of the Sun of righteousness. In times of trouble the brightness is eclipsed, and we do not understand why the assurance seems to be withdrawn. We are led to look at self and the shadow of the cross, and this prevents us from seeing the consolation there is for us. We complain of the way and withdraw the hand from the hand of Christ. But sometimes God's favor breaks suddenly upon the soul, and the gloom is dispelled. Let us live in the sunlight of the cross of Calvary. Let us no longer dwell in the shadow, complaining of our sorrows, for this only deepens our trouble.",
