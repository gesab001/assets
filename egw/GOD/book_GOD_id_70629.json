    "word": "Christ, the loved Commander in the heavenly courts, stooped from His high estate, laid aside the glory that He had with the Father, in order to save the one lost world. For this He left the sinless worlds on high, the ninety and nine that loved Him, and came to this earth, to be \u201cwounded for our transgressions\u201d and \u201cbruised for our iniquities\u201d (Isaiah 53:5). God gave Himself in His Son that He might have the joy of receiving back the sheep that was lost. . . .",
