    "word": "God's Plan for the Work Today.--When Jesus sent His disciples forth to labor, . . . they did not feel as some do now, that they would rather work alone than have anyone with them who did not labor just as they labored. Our Saviour understood what ones to associate together. He did not connect with the mild, beloved John one of the same temperament; but He connected with him the ardent, impulsive Peter. These \n                                                                           73\ntwo men were not alike either in their disposition or in their manner of labor. Peter was prompt and zealous in action, bold and uncompromising, and would often wound; John was ever calm, and considerate of others' feelings, and would come after to bind up and encourage. Thus the defects in one were partially covered by the virtues in the other. [SEE ALSO PP. 103-107, \"ALLOWING FOR MORE THAN ONE MAN'S METHOD.\"]",
