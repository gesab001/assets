    "word": "Our bodies belong to God, and it becomes our duty, not only for our own sake but for the sake of those with whom we associate, and for the sake of Christ, who has purchased us with the dear sacrifice of His own life, to become intelligent in regard to our own organism, and feel that it is a sacred duty to obey the laws which God has established in our being. It is as much the religious duty of every individual to study the laws of life and obtain a knowledge of how to live as it is to study any of the requirements of the Word of God. It is impossible to obey the precepts of God's Word while our habits of life are at war with nature.",
