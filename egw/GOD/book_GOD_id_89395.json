    "word": "Union of Church and State Produces Spiritual Poverty--Earnest movements have been made here in the Parliaments to have God acknowledged in the government of this nation. [AUSTRALIA.] Earnest efforts have been made to prevent this, knowing that it meant nothing less than religious bigotry and oppression.
