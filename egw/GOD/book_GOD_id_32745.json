    "word": "Do Not Trust in Feeling (counsel to a doubter).--The great plan of mercy from the beginning of time is to have every afflicted soul trust in His love. Your safety at the present time when your mind is tortured with doubt is not to trust in feeling but in the living God. All He asks of you is to put your trust in Him, acknowledging Him as your faithful Saviour, who loves you and has forgiven you all your mistakes and errors.--Lt 299, 1904. \n\n\n                                                     673",
