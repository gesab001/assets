    "word": "Now Elder Waggoner's prejudice came in, causing him to pass his judgment on the work, and others followed in its wake. I verily believe you had but little of the Spirit of God in your camp meeting, for I cannot see how God could work with your efforts--at least with some who were leaders in the meeting--because they were not where the Lord could bless their efforts. I beseech of you, brethren, to study more thoroughly in the school of Christ and be sure that self and personal feelings do not mingle with your judgment of the work of God. We must have more spiritual power, individually, and when you see persons confessing their sins, let the current of the Spirit of God flow and wash out and cleanse the moral impurities. We are very destitute of the quickening influences of the Spirit of God because, as in the case at Healdsburg, we would not recognize God, but, like Jacob, think it was an enemy that visited us.",
