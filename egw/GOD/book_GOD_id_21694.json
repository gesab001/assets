    "word": "When France publicly prohibited the Bible, wicked men and spirits of darkness exulted in their attainment of the object so long desired,\u2014a kingdom free from the restraints \n286\nof the law of God. Because sentence against an evil work was not speedily executed, therefore the heart of the sons of men was \u201cfully set in them to do evil.\u201d [Ecclesiastes 8:11-13.] But the transgression of a just and righteous law must inevitably result in misery and ruin. Though not visited at once with judgments, the wickedness of men was nevertheless surely working out their doom. Centuries of apostasy and crime had been treasuring up wrath against the day of retribution; and when their iniquity was full, the despisers of God learned too late that it is a fearful thing to have worn out the divine patience. The restraining Spirit of God, which imposes a check upon the cruel power of Satan, was in a great measure removed, and he whose only delight is the wretchedness of men, was permitted to work his will. Those who had chosen the service of rebellion, were left to reap its fruits, until the land was filled with crimes too horrible for pen to trace. From devastated provinces and ruined cities a terrible cry was heard,\u2014a cry of bitterest anguish. France was shaken as if by an earthquake. Religion, law, social order, the family, the State, and the Church,\u2014all were smitten down by the impious hand that had been lifted against the law of God. Truly spake the wise man: \u201cThe wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.\u201d \u201cThough a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him; but it shall not be well with the wicked.\u201d [Ecclesiastes 8:11-13.] \u201cThey hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord;\u201d \u201ctherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.\u201d [Proverbs 1:29, 31.]",
