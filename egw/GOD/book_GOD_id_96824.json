    "word": "Let there be that littleness, that humbleness of soul, that they may know that you have been taught in the school of Christ. And when He shall appear in the clouds of heaven, we shall exclaim, \"Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us\" (Isaiah 25:9). Then it is that the crown of life will be placed upon the brow of the faithful ones. Then will \n\n\n                                     -24- \n\ncome the voice of the Saviour saying, \"Well done thou good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\" (Matthew 25:21-23). What, faithful in putting their feet upon the law of God? No, No. These have not the mark of the beast upon them. I want that peace that comes through an obedience to all of the commandments of God. Amen.--Ms. 5, 1885. (MR 900.8)",
