    "word": "Satan did not appear to Christ as he is often falsely represented, as an imp with bats' wings and cloven hoofs. The Scriptures plainly declare that he \"is transformed into an angel of light.\"--2 Corinthians 11:14. It was as a heavenly angel that Satan accosted the Son of God. He told the Redeemer that He need fast no longer; that His long abstinence was accepted by the Father; that He had gone far enough; and that He was at liberty to work a miracle in His own behalf. The tempter said, \"If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\" Matthew 4:3. And Jesus answered him, \"It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" Verse 4. If man had always heeded this great truth, the race would never have fallen.",
