    "word": "There is an alarming condition of things in our churches. Says the Word of God, \"Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you. For among My people are found wicked \n\n\n                                   -288- \n\nmen: they lay in wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. . . the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and My people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?\" (Jeremiah 5:25, 26, 31). \"They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, Peace, Peace; when there is no peace\" (chapter 6:14). \"And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not; therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by My name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh, And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brethren\" (chapter 7:13-15). God will surely fulfill His word to those who will not hear, will not see, and refuse the light that He sends them.",
