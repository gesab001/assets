    "word": "Elder Burden has been given this work, and he has good helpers and advisers in the workers who are associated with him. The Lord appointed Elder Burden to the position he occupies, and he is to bear his responsibilities in that position without interference. He is fully capable of doing the work that has (422) been given him to do. The Lord has not told you to watch and criticize, and interfere with his work. He bids you, my brother, to stand out of the way. Elder Burden has proved in the past that he can do his work acceptable. He is to stand in his lot and place, exercising his God-given right to ask wisdom of Him who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not.",
