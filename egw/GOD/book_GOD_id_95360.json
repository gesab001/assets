    "word": "It is in the exercise of His long-sufferance that God gives men opportunity to come to their senses. A time of probation is granted, but if they go on making gold and silver their god, erecting their expensive buildings and accumulating iniquity by false dealings, they may expect nothing but an outbreak of the Lord's indignation to extinguish the sinner. And those who have been deceived by satanic agencies have often deceived others to their eternal ruin.",
