    "word": "Unfaithfulness Exposed. \n\n     I was shown that Bro. Gage has serious deficiencies in his character, which disqualify him for being closely connected with the work of God where important responsibilities are involved. He has head work, but the heart, the affections, have not been sanctified to God, therefore he cannot be relied upon as qualified for so important a work as the publication of the truth in the Office at Battle Creek. A mistake, or neglect of duty in this work, affects the cause of God at large. Bro. Gage has not seen his failings, therefore he does not reform.",
