    "word": "Christ died to bring life and immortality to light through the gospel, and therefore man is of value in God's sight. He is to do his part, working where he finds himself best adapted; for God has given him talents and power to use these talents. He is to cultivate his capabilities. He is not to be a machine, a shadow of another man, but is to use his God-given intellect, and with humble, contrite heart ask God for wisdom. He is not to absorb another man's propositions simply because that man is in a high position of trust, but is to remember that there is a fountain of living water from which he may drink, and drink again. The source of divine power is open to all.",
