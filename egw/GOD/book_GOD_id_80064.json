    "word": "I address these words to the church at Battle Creek, to move in the counsels of God. There is need of your moving--many from Battle Creek--and there is also need of your having well-defined plans as to what you will do when you go out from Battle Creek. Do not go in a rush, without knowing what you are about. You may be enthused with the Spirit of God, saying, Now it is time we awake out of sleep; and, Arise, and shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord has arisen upon us. Let not one go to enlighten others unless his own soul has been touched with the divine love of Jesus Christ. \"Thus saith the Lord;\" \"It is written,\" let it be oft spoken, and bring from the treasure-house things new and old. A great work is to be done, and an important work for this time; work for the Master may be done anywhere in this great moral vineyard. O for generals, wise and considerate, well-balanced men, who will be safe advisers, who have some insight into human nature, who know how to direct and counsel in the fear of God!",
