    "word": "Now I want to read another scripture: \"Be careful for nothing.\" What does that mean? Why, don't cross a bridge before you get to it. Don't make a time of trouble before it comes. You will get to it soon enough, brethren. We are to think of today, and if we do well the duties of today, we will be ready for the duties of tomorrow. \"But in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.\" Thanksgiving is to be brought in. \"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.\" Then we are not given over into the hands of the devil; we have a loving heavenly Father, and He has given His Son to bear our iniquity.",
