    "word": "We need to pray without ceasing. Let the heart long after God. Let the heart go out in daily, hourly prayer, believing, trusting, holding on to the promise, saying as did Jacob, \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me\"; [and saying as did David], \"Hold up my goings in Thy path.\" O God, \"that my footsteps slip not\" into the pitfalls which men have dug for my feet. [Psalms 17:5]",
