    "word": "Chap. 3 - Counsel to Missionaries in Africa\n     Battle Creek, Michigan \n     March, 1890 \n\nDear brethren now labouring as missionaries in the field of Africa: \n     You have not all the same stamp of character, and each will be inclined to think that the work must be moulded according to his own ideas and views. Unconsciously to yourselves, this spirit will be cherished, and you will seek to introduce methods of your own. The workers should first obtain the grace of Christ, so they will be enabled to sink self out of sight; then there will be unity, even among a diversity of dispositions. Before any of you went to Africa as missionaries, it was shown me that there would be difficulty in your labours, not necessarily because the workers were so differently constituted, but because of each esteeming himself above his brethren. The brethren varied so evidently in organization and in their views of the work, that each, instead of modifying his own strong traits of character, would be in danger of drawing away from the others, and this drawing apart would leave an influence among the new converts that would retard the work and dishonour God.",
