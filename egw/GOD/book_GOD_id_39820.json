    "word": "PRAYERS OF HYPOCRISY.\u2014The prayers that are offered to God to tell Him of all our wretchedness, when we do not feel wretched at all, are the prayers of hypocrisy. It is the contrite prayer that the Lord regards. \u201cFor thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive \n260\nthe spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\u201d",
