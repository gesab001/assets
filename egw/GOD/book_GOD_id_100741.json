Those whom we suppose to be our friends will become alienated from us. Your motives will be misrepresented, your losses, trials, self-denial, sufferings, and labors will not be appreciated, and your work will be disparaged. But was not this what Christ has to endure? Do we who are Christ's followers expect a better portion than had Jesus? We are to be partakers of the sufferings of Christ, that we may be partakers with him of his glory. Serve God with full purpose of heart, and let not your spirit be chafed over that which you cannot help.",
