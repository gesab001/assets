    "word": "Christ gave Himself to a shameful, agonising death showing His great travail of soul to save the perishing. O, Christ is able, Christ is willing, Christ is longing to save all who will come unto Him. Talk to souls in peril and get them to behold Jesus upon the cross, dying to make it possible for Him to pardon. Talk to the sinner with your own heart over-flowing with the tender, pitying love of Christ. Let there be deep earnestness, but not a harsh, loud note should be heard from the one who is trying to win the soul to look and live. First have your own soul consecrated to God. As you look upon your Intercessor in heaven, let your heart be broken, Then, softened and subdued, you can address repenting sinners as one who realises the power of redeeming love. Pray with these souls, by faith bringing them, to \n\n\n                     - 39 - \n\nthe foot of the cross; carry their minds up with your mind, and fix the eye of faith where you look, upon Jesus, the sin-bearer. Get them to look away from their poor, sinful selves to the Saviour, and the victory is won. They behold for themselves the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world. They see the Way, the Truth , and the Life. The Sun of Righteousness sheds its bright beams into the heart. The strong tide of redeeming love pours into the parched and thirsty soul, and the sinner is saved to Jesus Christ.",
