    "word": "If those with whom you are laboring do not immediately and readily grasp the truth, do not censure, do not criticise and condemn, but ever remember that you are to represent Christ in his meekness and gentleness and love. Then you will be indeed a laborer together with God, teaching the truth as it is in Jesus; and every soul won to Christ will be a star in the crown of your rejoicing. Through you should meet with the bitterest opposition.-- \n\n\n                       -30- \n\n\n        Do Not Denounce Your Opponents. \n\nThey may think as did Paul, that they are doing God service, and to such we must manifest patience, meekness, long-suffering. This is the only way in which we can be a savor of life unto life.",
