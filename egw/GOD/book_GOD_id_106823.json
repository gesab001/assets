    "word": "Of Elder Haskell and Elder Butler, God says, \"I will guide them. I will put my grace in their hearts. Because they have not been turned away from the truth to give heed to seducing spirits, but have stood firm, declaring the message given them, they are to be highly esteemed. They will not exchange the faith that they have boldly and fervently declared, for another doctrine, which is not true.",
