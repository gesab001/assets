    "word": "Emotional Preaching--If the preaching is of an emotional character, it will affect the feelings, but not the heart and conscience. Such preaching results in no lasting good, but it often wins the hearts of the people and calls out their affections for the man who pleases them. They forget that God has said:  \"Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils.\"--5T 301.",
