    "word": "We behold God in Jesus. Looking unto Jesus we see that it is the glory of our God to give. \"I do nothing of myself,\" said Christ; \"the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father.\" \"I seek not mine own glory,\" but the glory of Him that sent Me (John 8:28; 6:57; John 8:50; 7:18). In these words is set forth the great principle which is the law of life for the universe. All things Christ received from God, but He took to give. So in the heavenly courts, in His ministry for all created beings: through the beloved Son, the Father's life flows out to all; through the Son it returns, in praise and joyous service, a tide of love, to the great Source of all. And thus through Christ the circuit of beneficence is complete, representing the character of the great Giver, the law of life.--The Desire of Ages, pp. 19-21.",
