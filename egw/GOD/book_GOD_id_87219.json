    "word": "MR No. 648 - Letter to M. B. Czechowski\n\n     In the vision given me at Roosevelt, [August 3, 1861,] I was shown that your moving to New York City was wrong. You followed your own judgment. You looked with suspicion upon the very ones in whom you should safely confide and whose judgment would benefit you. The enemy tempted you in regard to Brethren Whipple and Taylor. You were shown to me looking upon them and their families with suspicion and distrust. You misjudged them. These brethren are conscientious and would do their duty if they knew what it was. They are experienced. God loves them. Brother Taylor's spirit is precious in the sight of the Lord.",
