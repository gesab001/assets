    "word": "Satan is working with masterly power to corrupt the experience of human beings, so that the influence of the truth will not appear in their lives and become a savor of life unto life to all who believe. Those who are purified and sanctified will have that faith that works by love and purifies the soul. The principles of Christ's life are to be received into the soul by wearing His yoke, and learning of Him the lesson of obedience. \"Learn of Me,\" says the great Teacher, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" In following My example of meekness and lowliness, you will find rest. There will be no strife for the supremacy, no envy, no evil surmising. The soul will rest in the pure, holy love of God. The speech is pure, for it comes from lips that have been touched with a live coal from off the altar, thus [are] we prepared to deliver the message God shall give. \n\n\n                                     -107-",
