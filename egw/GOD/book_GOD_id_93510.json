    "word": "Great efforts will be made by those who suppose their own wisdom to be supreme, in exactly the same lines on which Satan worked, and which caused so much mischief in the Paradise of God. The very same working is revealed in \n\n\n                                     -360- \n\n1896. The very same principles are upheld. When a man is elected to a position of trust, to preside over important interests, large and broad, or interests of less consequence but still important, Satan stirs up the minds of those who are selfish, who are not consecrated to God's service with an eye single to His glory. He puts into their hearts the spirit of criticizing and accusing. If they are not specially advantaged, they will tell others of the mistakes and errors of the one against whom they are working. This step taken, Satan, whose special business it is to create alienation and strife, will place matters before these persons in a most deceiving way, and they will bring against those in positions of trust the most unjust and false charges, in order to discourage and destroy God's servants.",
