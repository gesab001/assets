    "word": "MR No. 333 - Our Health Message\n\n     I have seen in vision that tobacco was a filthy weed, and that it must be laid aside or given up. Said my accompanying angel, \"If it is an idol it is high time it was given up, and unless it is given up the frown of God will be upon the one that uses it, and he cannot be sealed with the seal of the living God.\" If it is used as a medicine, go to God, He is the great Physician, and those that use the filthy weed for medicine greatly dishonor God.--Letter 5, 1851. (To Brother Barnes, December 14, 1851.)",
