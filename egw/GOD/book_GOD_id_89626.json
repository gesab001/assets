    "word": "Dr. Kellogg is a finite man and has his errors as well as other men, but God has done a work through him and has been giving him strength. He does not now feel exasperated, as he once did, when he is misjudged. He \n\n\n                                    -380- \n\nneeds wise men for counselors, for their wisdom will be required to set things right and keep them right. Men are needed in the sanitarium and out of the sanitarium who can appreciate the situation on all sides, who will take in all in their hearing and not say Yes, Yes, to every proposition, but who, if they see danger of wrong moves that will injure the reputation of Dr. Kellogg and the sanitarium, will not be afraid to speak frankly and honestly. This is just as much a part of their duty as to approve and sanction; but they should do this with a Christian spirit and in such a reasonable way that the words will not appear a thrust, or condemnatory, but will have a right effect.",
