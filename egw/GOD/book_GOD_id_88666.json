    "word": "By His Holy Spirit the Lord will demonstrate that His word is the only thing that can make men right and keep them right. I have been shown that God's revealed truth alone can keep men in the path of humble obedience. Standard bearers are falling around us, not only through death, but through the deceptions of Satan. All heaven is looking upon the remnant people of God, to see if they will make truth alone their shield and buckler. Unless the truth is presented as it is in Jesus, and is planted in the heart by the power of the Spirit of God, even ministers will be found drifting away from Christ, away from piety, away from religious principle. They will become blind leaders of the blind.",
