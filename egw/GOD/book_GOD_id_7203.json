    "word": "The faith of Asa was put to a severe test when \"Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots,\" invaded his kingdom. In this crisis Asa did not put his trust in the \"fenced cities in Judah\" that he had built, with \"walls, and towers, gates, and bars,\" nor in the \"mighty men of valor\" in his carefully trained army.
