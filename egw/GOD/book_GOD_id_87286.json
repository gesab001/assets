    "word": "This high standard Christ has made it possible for us to reach. He will be present in His grace and strength, to help every striving soul not to fall short of His high calling. Our expectations need to be elevated far above that which is seen in the piety of many professing Christians. God calls upon us to reveal the Saviour to the world in works of righteousness. He calls upon us to remember that we are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.-- Manuscript 17, 1906, p. 5.
