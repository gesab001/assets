    "word": "Belshazzar's Feast\n     While they were that night in the midst of idolatrous mirth, the king's countenance suddenly pales, and he seems paralyzed with terror; for lo! a bloodless hand is tracing mystic characters on the wall over against him. The revelers discern the curious and, to them, unintelligible writing. The exciting merriment dies away, and a painful silence falls upon the throng. The king's thoughts troubled him, \u201cthe joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.\u201d Trembling with alarm, he \u201ccried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed in scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.\u201d But these men are no more able to interpret the mystic characters traced by the hand of an angel of God than they\n141\nwere to interpret the dream of Nebuchadnezzar.\u2014RH Feb. 8, 1881.",
