    "word": "Now, brethren, I say, clear the King's highway, for your soul's sake. If you have interposed between the people and the light, get out of the way, or God will move you out of the way. I tell you that God calls for men to come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. They are not to pull back; they are not to put their weight against the chariot so as to pull it back; but they are to push with all the might and energy that God has given them.",
