    "word": "The Lord takes no pleasure in seeing us spiritually weak. \"God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.\" We have conflicts and trials to meet, but we need not fail or be discouraged. The apostle says, \"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body\" [2 Corinthians 4:8-10].",
