    "word": "At the portals of the city of God an innumerable company of angels await His coming. As Christ approaches the gates, the angels who are escorting Him, in triumphant tones address the company at the portals: \n\n\n          \"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; \n           And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; \n           And the King of glory shall come in.\" \n     The waiting angels at the gates inquire: \n          \"Who is this King of glory?\" \n     This they say, not because they know not who He is, but because they desire to hear the answer of exalted praise: \n          \"The Lord strong and mighty, \n           The Lord mighty in battle. \n           Lift up your heads, O ye gates; \n           Even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; \n           And the King of glory shall come in.\" \n     Again the waiting angels ask: \n          \"Who is this King of glory?\" \n     The escorting angels reply in melodious strains: \n          \"The Lord of hosts, \n           He is the King of glory.\" \n                                       -Psalm 24:7-10. \n                                                                           171",
