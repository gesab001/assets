    "word": "Christ teaches all who believe on His name, that instead of seeking their own glory they must humble themselves to bear the cross and to walk in His footsteps. He would reform others must first reform himself. He must obtain the spirit of his Master, and be willing like Him, to suffer reproach, and to practice self-denial. In comparison with the worth of one soul, the whole world sinks into insignificance. A desire to exercise authority, to lord it over God's heritage, will, if indulged, result in the loss of souls. Those who really love Jesus will seek to conform their own lives to the Pattern, and will labor in His spirit for the salvation of others. \n\n\n                                  -143-",
