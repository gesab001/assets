    "word": "Remember that however great the wisdom a man may appear to have, if Christ does not abide in his soul, if he is not sustained by the life-giving power of the leaves of the tree of life, he will lead your feet into false paths. However great the capabilities and talents entrusted to a man, unless he is breathed upon by the Lord Jesus, unless the life-giving current from Christ circulates through his soul, unless he receives nourishment from Christ as the branches of the vine receive the sap from the parent-stock, he is not, with all his endowments and intelligence, to be trusted as a safe guide for the people of God.",
