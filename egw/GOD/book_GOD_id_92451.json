    "word": "This is true in regard to those who have done a work which God has not authorized them to do. The very work that should be done, brought to view in Isaiah 61:1-3, has been strangely neglected. Some have been very ready to pronounce judgment upon the work of their fellow men, because it did not exactly represent their ideas. But has God pronounced them infallible? The spirit they have manifested in pronouncing judgment upon God's messengers shows their fallibility and their ignorance, both of the Scriptures and of the power of God. These men are counterworking the work of God. They have felt at liberty to make decisions and laws which would bring talent under their jurisdiction. They have placed themselves in the judgment seat, to control their fellow men. But has \n\n\n                                   -201- \n\nGod appointed them to do this work? He would say of them, \"What doest thou here? Who sent you on this journey? Who gave you this errand to perform? Who made you a critic and judge on matters of doctrine? Who appointed you to pick and to choose the words and expressions which My servants shall use?\"",
