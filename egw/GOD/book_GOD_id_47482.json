    "word": "Let men remember that they have a Ruler in the heavens, a God who will not be trifled with. He who puts his reason to the stretch in an effort to exalt himself and to delineate God, will find that he might far better have stood as a humble suppliant before God, confessing himself to be only an erring human being.  {6BC 1079.10}  \n     God cannot be understood by men. His ways and works are past finding out. In regard to the revelations that He has made of Himself in His Word, we may talk, but other than this, let us say of Him, Thou art God, and Thy ways are past finding out.  {6BC 1079.11}  \n     There is a knowledge of God and of Christ which all who are saved must have. \"This is life eternal,\" Christ said, \"that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\"  {6BC 1079.12}  \n     The question for us to study is, What is truth--the truth for this time, which is to be cherished, loved, honored, and obeyed? \n                                                                           1080\nThe devotees of science have been defeated and disheartened in their effort to find out God. What they need to inquire is, What is truth (MS 124, 1903)?  {6BC 1079.13} \n \n                             Chapter 12 \n\n     A Sermon Written for Our Instruction.--A study of the twelfth chapter of Romans would be of profit to us. It is a sermon by the apostle Paul, written for our instruction (MS 50, 1903).",
