    "word": "Abraham left the servants by the way and proposed to go alone with his son to worship some distance from them.... Firmly walked on that stern, loving, suffering father by the side of his son. As they came to the place which God had pointed out to Abraham, he built there an altar and laid the wood in order, ready for the sacrifice, and then informed Isaac of the command of God to offer him as a burnt offering.
