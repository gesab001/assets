    "word": "The Lord's goods are to be used with the greatest discretion. As we build houses, places of worship, or sanitariums, we should carefully count the cost, building with reference to the destitute places which must be entered and worked. We should build for the advancement of the cause of God, and nothing should be of a shoddy character. Everything should be done with an eye single to the glory of God. The buildings should be erected savingly, but with taste and skill.",
