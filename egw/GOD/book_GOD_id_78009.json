    "word": "The Pharisee who invited Christ to his house on this occasion was a ruler in Israel, a member of the Sanhedrin, a man of influence. Jesus had not accepted his invitation for the purpose of satisfying his appetite, or to furnish himself with an hour of amusement; but he had accepted it for the purpose of representing the character of God. Christians may safely accept invitations to dinners where promiscuous company should gather, if they will but follow the example of Christ, and act from the same motives as did our Saviour.--Signs, No. 4, 1896.",
