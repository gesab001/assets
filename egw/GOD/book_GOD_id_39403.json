    "word": "SOMETIMES GOD DOES NOT GIVE US WHAT WE PRAY FOR BECAUSE HE HAS SOMETHING BETTER FOR US.\u2014When we come to Him we should pray that we may enter into and accomplish His purpose, and that our desires and interests may be lost in His. We should acknowledge our acceptance of His will, not praying Him to concede to ours. It is better for us that God does not always answer our prayers just when we desire, and in just the manner we wish. He will do more and better for us than to accomplish all our wishes, for our wisdom is folly.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, 148.)",
