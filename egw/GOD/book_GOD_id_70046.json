    "word": "On every hand there is that which would tempt the Christian to forsake the narrow way; but those who would perfect a character fit for eternity must take the will of God as their standard, separating entirely from everything that is displeasing to Him. Thousands are betrayed into sin because they leave the citadel of the heart unguarded. They become engrossed with the cares of this world, and true godliness is driven from their hearts. They rush eagerly into speculation, seeking to accumulate more of this world\u2019s treasure. Thus they place themselves where it is impossible for them to advance in the Christian life. \u201cBe ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.\u201d And while you pray, strive earnestly to guard your heart from all pollution; for prayer without effort is a solemn mockery.",
