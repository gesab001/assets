    "word": "How can the Lord bless those who manifest a spirit of \"I don't care,\" a spirit which leads them to walk contrary to the light which the Lord has given them. But I do not ask you to take my words. Lay Sister White to one side. Do not quote my works again as long as you live until you can obey the Bible. When you make the Bible your food, your meat and your drink, when you make its principles the elements of your character, you will know better how to receive counsel from God. I exalt the precious word before you today. Do not repeat what I have said, saying, \"Sister White said this,\" and, \"Sister White said that.\" Find out what the Lord God of Israel says, and then do what He commands.--Ms 43, 1901, p. 10. (E. G. White talk in college library, April 1, 1901.)",
