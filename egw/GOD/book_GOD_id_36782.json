Who is ready to engage in this work with all the heart? ... \n     \"Thine is the seedtime; God alone \n      Beholds the end of what is sown; \n      Beyond our vision, weak and dim, \n      The harvesttime is hid with Him; \n      Yet unforgotten where it lies, \n      The seed of generous sacrifice, \n      Though seeming on the desert cast, \n      Shall rise with bloom and fruit at last.\"",
