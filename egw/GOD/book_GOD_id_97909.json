    "word": "As I was speaking to my natural sister, the wife of a Methodist minister, in regard to the requirements of the Word of God, she said she would keep the Sabbath if the whole world would keep it.

And if the parent expects to bring up his children in the right way he cannot play the lad. He must have growing dignity that Christ gives to a man. God so appreciated every soul that He \"gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
