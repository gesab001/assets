    "word": "Harmon Lindsay will either be converted to the truth or be disconnected from the work, A.R. Henry and Harmon Lindsay believe not the Third Angel's Message. They are not only saying in their hearts, 'My Lord delayeth his coming', but in spirit, in words and actions wherever they go. It pains me to see these two bodies of death sent from place to place upon important business in connection with the cause of God, when they are imbued with the spirit of Satan working in secret. They have not the Spirit of God. They are separated from God, and have been ever since the Minneapolis meeting, walking in the imaginations of their own hearts. Isaiah 50:10, 11.",
