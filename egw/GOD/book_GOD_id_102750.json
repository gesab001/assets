    "word": "By accepting a spurious rest day the churches have dishonored God. The people of the world accept the falsehood, and are angry because God's commandment keeping people do not respect and reverence Sunday. The Lord sanctified and blessed the seventh day. God says, \"Her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works; in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her; for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord who judgeth her.\"",
