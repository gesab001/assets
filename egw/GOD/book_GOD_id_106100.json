    "word": "God help you, strengthen and comfort you, is my prayer. Look up always. Jesus is a risen Saviour. He is not in Joseph's tomb with a great stone rolled before the door. We have a living, risen Christ, who stands at the head of his church. I hope our people will hang their helpless souls upon God. He can bear your weight; he can carry all your burdens. In much sympathy with all your perplexities, I will close this long letter. \n\n\n                                       (Signed) Ellen G. White",
