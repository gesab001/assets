    "word": "There is a great work yet to be accomplished in all the fields from  which we have heard reports. All through these countries there is precious  talent that God will use; and we must be wide awake to secure it. The great  obstacle to the advancement of the work is the lack of means. Ought we not to  make this a special subject of prayer? Men who have means will receive the  truth in this country; but the Lord would have us labor earnestly in faith  until that time comes. He would have all who accept the truth become light-bearers. They should act as though they had a message of infinite  importance to present. It is God's truth, and all should be sanctified  through it. All should have a living faith, a living connection with heaven.",
