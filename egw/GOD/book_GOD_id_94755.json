N. Haskell.) \n\n\n     I have received and read your encouraging letter in reference to the doors that are opening in different parts of New York for the entrance of truth. Thank the Lord, my brother and sister, that you are able to stand in your lot and in your place. The Lord is giving you evidence that He is going before you. But while you are anxious to do all that you possibly can, remember, Elder Haskell, that it is only by the great mercy and grace of God that you have been spared these many years to bear your testimony. Do not take upon yourself loads that others who are younger can carry.",
