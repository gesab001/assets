    "word": "Let us, as Christians for whom Christ has given His life, do our duty to our children. Let us fit them for the heavenly mansions. \"I go,\" said Christ, \"to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye be may be also\" [John 14:2, 3]. Let this ever be kept before their minds, while we ourselves are improving in every way possible. God forbid that Christ should say of any of us, \"I cannot acknowledge you as members of My family. Your traits of character are such that you would spoil your own pleasure and that of others in heaven.\"",
