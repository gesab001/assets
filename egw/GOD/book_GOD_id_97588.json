    "word": "Should we not honor the One who gave His Son to a life of trial and reproach for us? In giving His Son to a life of suffering God would teach us that because we suffer we have no reason to feel that we are not children of God, and thus lose faith in Him. When we are in trouble, let us think of this. If we would have more faith, we would see more of the glory of God than we do.",
