    "word": "I have not been able to sleep after one o'clock. Through the night season the light has been given me that it is not wise to keep ministers in the same locality year after year, that it is not right to keep the president of the conference in one place through a succession of years. His position as president should be carefully considered, and changed as soon as God shall open the way for another to take his place. It is not justice to have the burdens that must come upon the president of any conference placed upon one man year after year, for a condition of things will come into existence that will not be for his good, or for the good of the conference. It is in this way that one man's mind and judgment comes to be thought infallible. The work is in the Lord's hands, and He will signify to us when He has a man prepared for the place. Until then we may let our minds rest.--Letter 87, 1898, p. 1. (To N. D. Faulkhead, October 20, 1898.)",
