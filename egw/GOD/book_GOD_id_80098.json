    "word": "George Warren is a dangerous associate. He is a subject of this vice. His influence is bad. The grace of God has no influence upon his heart. He has a good intellect, and his father has trusted much to this to balance him. But mental power alone is not a guaranty of virtuous superiority. The absence of religious principles makes George Warren base and corrupt at heart, and sly in his doings of wrong. His influence is pernicious everywhere. He is infidel in his principles, \n                                                                           26\nand glories in his skepticism. When with those of his own age, or those younger than himself, he talks knowingly of religious things, and jests at sacred things. He sneers at truth, and the Bible; pretends knowledge, which has its influence to corrupt minds and lead young men to feel ashamed of the truth.",
