    "word": "When we are brought into adverse circumstances, when our natural feelings are stirred, and we want to give vent to them, then our faith is tried; then we are to manifest the meekness and gentleness of Christ. Not by one word are we to give expression to the feelings of the natural heart. \"If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body\" (James 3:2)--the whole man. What we want is to be under the control of Jesus. We do not want our own way. I have heard some plead as an excuse for their wrong course, \"You know that it is my temperament, it is my disposition, transmitted to me from my parents.\" Yes; and they have cultivated it and educated themselves in it and thus excused all their wrongdoing. Instead of yielding to temptation, they should lay hold upon the arm of Infinite Power, saying, \"I will come to God just as I am, and plead with Christ to give me the victory. I shall be more than conqueror through Him that loved me.\"",
