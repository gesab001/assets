    "word": "The people are encouraged to center in Battle Creek, and they pay their tithe and give their influence to the building up of a modern Jerusalem that is not after God's order. In this work other places are cut off from facilities which they should have. Enlarge ye, spread yes; but not in one place. Go out and establish centers of influence in places where nothing, or next to nothing, has been done. Break up your consolidated mass; diffuse the saving beams of light, and shed light into the darkened corners of the earth. A work needs to be done something like that which is described as an eagle stirring up her nest. \"Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.\" This is true of many Christians who are coming into Battle Creek. Many have a spasmodic zeal, but it is like a meteor that flashes across the heavens, and goes out. Let God's own workmen, who have his cause at heart, do something for the Southern field. Let not God's stewards be content with just touching it with their fingers' ends. Let those at the heart of the work plan for the field in earnest. You have talked about it; but what are you doing as the stewards of God's means?",
