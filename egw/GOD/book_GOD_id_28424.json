    "word": "This work Christ has laid upon every one whom He has purchased. The Lord will give ample light to all who will be true and loyal to Him. . . . His mercy and the gracious influences of His Spirit remain the same for all who will receive them. His offer of salvation does not change. It is man who changes His relationship to God. Many place themselves where they cannot recognize His grace and His salvation. . . .",
