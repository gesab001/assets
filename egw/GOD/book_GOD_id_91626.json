    "word": "In selecting teachers for our schools we should use every precaution, knowing that it is as solemn a matter as selecting men for the ministry. Let wise men who can discern character make the selection, choosing those who are calm and kind, who have the love of God in their hearts, for in every sense teachers are to be missionaries. Their course of action, like that of teachers in the Sabbath school, should tend to the winning of their pupils to Jesus. If teachers have not love in their hearts, they will give a wrong mold to the character of their pupils. Kindness and love will induce obedience where arbitrary authority, strict rules, and an overbearing, commanding manner will work utter failure in the management of pupils.",
