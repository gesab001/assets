    "word": "July 5. This morning I shall continue the subject begun some months ago in my diary. Properly conducted, the canvassing work is missionary work of the highest order. We cannot too highly estimate the work of bringing before the people the books which are necessary for their spiritual education and enlightenment. There are many who though hungry for the bread of life have not the privilege of hearing the truth from the lips of God's delegated ministers. The canvasser may find these souls, and minister to them according to his God-given ability.",
