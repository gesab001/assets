    "word": "God was with Joseph in his new home. He was in the path of duty, suffering wrong but not doing wrong. He therefore had the love and protection of God, for he carried his religious principles into everything he undertook. What a difference there was in Joseph\u2019s case and the case of young people who apparently force their way into the very field of the enemy, exposing themselves to the fierce assaults of Satan. Joseph suffered for righteousness\u2019 sake, while the trials of others are of their own procuring. Joseph did not conceal his religion or manly piety to avoid persecution.",
