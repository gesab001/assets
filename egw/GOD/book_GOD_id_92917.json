    "word": "\"If Christ be not risen,\" wrote the apostle Paul, \"Then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ: whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain: ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished\" [1 Corinthians 15:14-18]. \"And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus\" [Acts 4:33].",
