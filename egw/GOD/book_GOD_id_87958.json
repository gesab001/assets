    "word": "Our cities in the East have been passed by and scarcely worked at all. The question was asked, \"What have you done for these cities?\" God asks it. The Lord looks upon this neglected work and declares, \"Divide, and change, and re-elect, if necessary, but be sure that self is first under rule to God.\" The Lord is displeased that so large a work, embracing such vast responsibilities, is permitted year after year to be borne by so few--the same men--when the special message has been over and over set before the General Conference that specified centers are to be made.",
