    "word": "There are churches in different places which we may find that are ready to die. If they were ready to die to self and sin, if covetousness and the love of pleasure would die, they would not be so bad; they would be led to bring all their powers into exercise for doing the work of the Master, and then it would be a good death. But it is a spiritual death that pervades our churches. There are not those who feel the importance of teaching the members of the church and trying to get workers for the cause of God, to educate them that they may see the importance of putting to the stretch every power and talent that God has given them.",
