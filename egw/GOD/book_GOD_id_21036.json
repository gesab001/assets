    "word": "The people will seldom rise higher than their minister. A world-loving spirit in him has a tremendous influence upon others. The people make his deficiencies an excuse to cover their own world-loving spirit. They quiet their consciences, thinking that they may be free to love the things of this life and be indifferent to spiritual things, because their ministers are so. They deceive their own souls, and remain in friendship with the world, which the apostle declares to be \"enmity against God.\" [Romans 8:7.] Ministers should be examples to the flock. They should manifest an undying love for souls, and the same devotion to the cause which they desire to see in the people.--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. II, pages 645, 646. \n\n                                               -",
