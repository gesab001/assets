    "word": "The question is asked, What is the higher education? There is no education higher than that contained in the principles laid down in the words that I have read to you from the sixth chapter of Second Corinthians. Let our students study diligently to comprehend this. Through His own chosen messengers God has given us light and instruction as to what constitutes the higher education. There is no higher education to be gained than that which was given to the early disciples, and which is given to us through the word. May the Holy Spirit of God impress your minds with the truth that there is nothing in all the world in the line of education that is so exalted as the instruction contained in the chapters to which I have referred. Let us advance just as far as the word will take us. Let us work intelligently for this higher education. Let our righteousness be the sign of our understanding of the will of God committed to us through His messengers. \n\n\n                               -406-",
