    "word": "\"Filled with all the fulness of God.\" I wish that now every empty human vessel might be receiving the showers of Christ's grace. The love of God is an inexhaustible fountain. This great love is for us. We may enjoy it. You have had the privilege, dear children, of tasting that love and knowing that the Lord is good. His is a reservoir that is continually supplied with abundant grace and goodness and love. Our hearts may be filled and expand and overflow with the love of God.",
