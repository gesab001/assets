    "word": "Joseph told the king that there would be seven years of great plenty. Every thing would grow in great abundance. Fields and gardens would yield more plentifully than formerly. Fruits and grain would yield abundantly. And these seven years of abundance were to be followed by seven years of famine. The years of plenty would be given that he might prepare for the coming years of famine. \"And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following, for it shall be very grievous. And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.\"",
