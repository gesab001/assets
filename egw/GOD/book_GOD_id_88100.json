    "word": "God's Love in the Human Soul Nearly Obliterated \n\n     The message of warning comes to us as it came to Noah. We are to warn all that the Lord is at the door. We are to urge those who are disloyal to God to repent, and render obedience to His law. Man was created in the image of God, but in him this image has been sadly disfigured. The traces of God's love in the human soul have been nearly obliterated. Men have chosen darkness rather than light. Obedience to God's commands wins eternal life. Disobedience places man on Satan's side of the question.--Manuscript 88, 1897, p. 5. (\"As It Was in the Days of Noah,\" no date.)",
