Loma Linda, Calif., May 19, 1907. \n                       An Open Letter Dear Brethren and Sisters:- \n\n\n     The Lord has greatly blessed our people in Southern Calif., in enabling them to secure at very low cost valuable sanitarium properties. Through the institutions that are established here, the Lord desires to reach a class that can be reached in no other way. Therefore I would urge upon our people to whom the Lord has entrusted the talent of means, that they make loans and gifts to place these institutions in a position where they can do without embarrassment the work that will be to the honor and glory of God.",
