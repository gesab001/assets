    "word": "God gave his only begotten Son that man might be restored to oneness with Christ. And however indifferent the human agent may think it his privilege to be, he will be judged according to the provisions of grace which cost heaven so much. Man may ignore his responsibility. He may choose to be inspired and controlled by Satan, to withdraw himself from all righteous principles, as though he lived by his own invention. Nevertheless he will be judged as one who might have used all his capabilities in the service of God, but who refused to do this, and took his position under the black banner of the powers of darkness. His failure to do the good he might have done, had he been a partaker of the divine nature, will be recorded against him as a sign that he despised and neglected the great mercy and loving kindness of God, refusing to recognize God's claim to his service.",
