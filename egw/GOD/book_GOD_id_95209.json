    "word": "He who is engaged in God's service must look constantly to Jesus, filled with the determination to follow Him who gave His life for the life of the world. Our abrupt words and actions show a zeal that is not according to knowledge. We need always to be on watch lest the policy of the world creep in, and one-sided plans unbalance the mind. Many are in positive danger of being led astray because they do not realize that they are in positive danger. They breathe the tainted atmosphere of the enemy, and as a thief in the night deception creeps upon them. The clear spiritual vision is dimmed. A line of action formed on false conceptions is followed, and the Holy Spirit is grieved.",
