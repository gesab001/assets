    "word": "The Lord has been leading his servants in their efforts to establish important institutions at Nashville. It is for the glory of his name and for the advancement of his cause in the Southern States, that various lines of work have been undertaken in and around Nashville. He has been leading in these enterprises, and we have had evidence of his guidance in the securing of valuable properties suitable for the different branches of our work. For us now to allow discouraging circumstances to slacken our efforts, would be \n                                                                           34\nout of harmony with God's purpose; for to connect failure with any of the enterprises undertaken under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, would bring dishonor upon God. If there comes a time in our experience when we find it advisable to withdraw our support from any of our institutions, it should be when that institution is in a prosperous condition. We should ever guard against the tendency to withdraw our strength from a chosen agency or working-center, in a time of discouragement.",
