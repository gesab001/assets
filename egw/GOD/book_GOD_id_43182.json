    "word": "Then let us open our hearts to the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. Let us work cheerfully, joyfully, in the service of our Master. Let us praise Him, not only by our words in the congregation of His saints, but by a well-ordered life and godly conversation--a life of active, noble Christian effort. Let us give diligence to make our calling and election sure, remembering that we shall triumph at last, if we do not become weary in well doing.--Signs of the Times, June 24, 1886.",
