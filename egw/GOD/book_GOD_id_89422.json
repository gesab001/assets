    "word": "The man who is niggardly, who possesses a narrow, self-serving mind, is himself responsible for those objectionable traits of character; for Christ has made it possible for him to be freed from these defects. He has placed within the reach of man the possibility of receiving Him. And He bears testimony, \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name\" [John 1:12].",
