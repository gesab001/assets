    "word": "MR No. 981 - Ellen White's Sixty-Eighth Birthday\n\n     I received your letters today, two of them. We left Armadale, Tuesday, November 26, on my 68th birthday, and I knew it not until past. Another year of my life has passed into eternity. Another year of my life has commenced. God grant me more largely of His Holy Spirit, and lead and guide me. I fear and tremble before God as I see the perils of the last days upon us. What is before us we know not.--Letter 22a, 1895, p. 1. (To Marian Davis, from Hobart, Tasmania, Nov. 29, 1895.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 31, 1983",
