Another year has commenced; 1890 has passed into eternity with its burden of record. I renew my consecration to God. Said Christ, \"I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified.\" \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\" I claim the rich promises of God through the matchless love and spotless character of Jesus Christ my Advocate. I have labored almost constantly and yet I see so much that needs to be done that it makes me restless, for it seems I have done so little compared with the great work to be done.",
