    "word": "The Importance of Exercising Faith\n\n       (A talk presented at Harbor Heights, Michigan, July 22, 1891.) \n\n     Matthew 7:1-7. [Verse 7 says, \"Ask, and it shall be given you.] Are there any \"ifs\" in this matter? There is no \"if\" except \"if ye ask.\" There is no condition of the mind that excludes from asking, if only you desire those things for which you ask. [There are] no conditions spiritually. So, if we desire the things of God we must comply with the condition of seeking them. [Verses 8-11.] \"Good things,\" according to Luke, is [the gift of the] Holy Spirit, and that is what we want, to thirst after godliness. [Verse 12.]",
