    "word": "The ministers of Christ, who bear the message of truth to men, will never become self-sufficient or self-exalted if they have correct views of the character and work of Christ, the author of man's salvation. The unworthiness, weakness, and inefficiency of their own efforts, in contrast with those of the Son of God, will make them humble, distrustful of self, and will lead them to rely upon Christ for strength and efficiency in their work. Habitually \n265\ndwelling upon Christ, his exalted character, and the all-sufficient merits of his sacrifice, increases faith, sharpens the imaginative powers, strengthens the longing desire to be like him, and creates holy earnestness in prayer that makes it efficacious.",
