    "word": "The showing at the Battle Creek Sanitarium is not in harmony with the Lord's design for that institution. I have been instructed that in building so large a sanitarium in Battle Creek, men have followed their own devising. They have not been led by the Lord, but have done directly contrary to the light that He has given. I write these words in order that the example that has been set in Battle Creek shall not be followed in other places; for it is not in accordance with God's plan. Instead of so large an institution being built in one place, plants should have been made in many cities in which there is nothing to represent the truth.",
