    "word": "Let every one labor for God and for souls; let each show wisdom, and never be found in idleness, waiting for some one to set him to work. The \"some one\" who could set you to work is overcrowded with responsibilities, and time is lost in waiting for his directions. God will give you wisdom in reforming at once; for the call is still made, \"Son, go work today in My vineyard.\" \"Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.\" Hebrews 3:7, 8. The Lord prefaces the requirement with the endearing word \"son.\" How tender, how compassionate, yet withal, how urgent! His invitation is also a command.--Counsels to Teachers, p. 419.",
