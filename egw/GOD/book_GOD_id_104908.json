    "word": "Please read carefully what is published in Testimonies, Vol. 7, regarding the health food work and the evangelical work. I feel more and more impressed that we must make diligent efforts to present the truth. I need not write much now regarding these lines of work, for the light has been in print for some time. But since these testimonies were published, circumstances have arisen that reveal the necessity for the cautions that have been given. Health reform needs a reformation, before it shall stand as God designs it should. We need to practice true godliness in every undertaking. In all the restaurants in our cities there is danger that the combination of many foods in the dishes served, shall be carried too far. The stomach suffers when so many kinds of food are placed in it at one meal. Simplicity is a part of health reform. There is danger that our work shall cease to merit the name which it has borne.",
