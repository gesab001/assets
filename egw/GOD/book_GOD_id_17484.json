    "word": "When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship the beast and his image and receive his mark, will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt when God was about to deliver Israel, were similar in character to those more terrible and extensive judgments which are to fall upon the world just before the final deliverance of God's people. Says the revelator, in describing those terrific scourges: \"There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.\" The sea \"became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.\" And \"the rivers and fountains of waters . . . became blood.\" Revelation 16:2-4. Terrible as these inflictions are, God's justice stands fully vindicated. . . .",
