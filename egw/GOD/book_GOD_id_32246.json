    "word": "Self-indulgence debars the human agent from witnessing for the truth. The gratitude we offer to God for \n\n392 \n\nHis blessings is greatly affected by the food placed in the stomach. Indulgence of appetite is the cause of dissension, strife, discord, and many other evils. Impatient words are spoken and unkind deeds are done, dishonest practices are followed, and passion is manifested--and all because the nerves of the brain are diseased by the abuse heaped on the stomach.--MS 93, 1901.",
