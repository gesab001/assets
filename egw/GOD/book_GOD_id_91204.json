    "word": "Satan is playing the game of life for the souls of men. Will those who claim to be Christians work with him to weaken the forces of [God's] army and to strengthen the forces of the enemy? Every worker is now to be wide awake, but he is not to train his imagination to see defects in others and designs and mischief against themselves. They are not to use their capabilities to tear down the influence of those whom God has chosen to do his work. Keep quiet. Let the precious talent of speech be used to win minds to God. Silence is eloquence unless in patience, kindness, and tenderness you can speak to win souls to Christ's side. Separate from the tempter, and cling to the Lord. . . . Unity is the element so much needed in the work of God. This drawing apart, this scolding and fretting, this pettish spirit of fault-finding, might better be cut away; for it is a root of bitterness springing up, whereby many are defiled. He who is imbued with the love of God will be at unity with his fellow workers.",
