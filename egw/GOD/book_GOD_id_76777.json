    "word": "John read their motives, and met them with the searching inquiry, \"Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\" Had they heard the voice of God speaking to their hearts, they would have given evidence of the fact, by bringing forth fruit meet for repentance. No such fruit was seen. They had heard the warning as merely the voice of man. They were charmed \n\n\n                     [10] \n\nwith the power and boldness with which John spoke; but the Spirit of God did not send conviction to their hearts, and as the sure result bring forth fruit unto eternal life. They gave no evidence of a change of heart. Without the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, John would have them understand that no outward ceremony could benefit them.",
