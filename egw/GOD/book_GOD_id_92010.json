    "word": "\"How shall we do?\" [THE QUESTION ASKED BY ELISHA'S SERVANT IN 2 KINGS 6:15.] Stand upon the platform of eternal truth, and see the salvation of God. Bear in mind that we are praying for you. Do not let self manifest a spirit of retaliation. Guard your words, that they may drop as silver and gold. Never for a moment lose the consciousness that you are Christ's ambassador, speaking in Christ's stead.",
