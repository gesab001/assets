    "word": "The office is fast losing its peculiar character of the Lord directed in its establishment, and it is never to take a worldly mold. Those who are welded together to sustain each other, determined to carry out certain plans without the counsel of the church or the people, any succeed for a time, but not long; for God will not permit it. \n                                                                           389\nThere is too much self, too much confidence in what men can do, too little confidence and dependence upon God, the divine ruler. Men handling sacred things, are not to speak lightly, but with trembling of the work of God. God's grace must be manifested in all the work, of whatever kind it may be. The proud heart must be humbled every day before God, lest he shall humble it. Success of the right kind will attend your efforts in proportion to your consecration, self-denial, and self-sacrifice.",
