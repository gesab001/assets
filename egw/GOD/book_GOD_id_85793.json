    "word": "I feel so grateful that we have this farm on which to carry on our school work. I am so glad that it is land which will produce. But it cannot be expected to produce fruit if it is left uncultivated. From this we may learn a spiritual lesson. \"It is My Father's good pleasure,\" Christ says to His disciples, \"that ye bear much fruit.\" But you cannot bear much fruit unless you take out of your lives the weeds of evil, and let the word of truth dwell in you richly, that your lives may produce the fruits of righteousness and holiness. If you will do this, you will see in the kingdom of God the result of what you have learned on this school farm. Pull up the weeds, and plant the seeds of truth. . . .",
