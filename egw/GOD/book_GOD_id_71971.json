    "word": "Shall the compassionate, self-sacrificing Saviour find us wanting in tenderness, love, sympathy for those for whom He gave His life? God has granted us gracious opportunities for service. He has provided us with precious talents, and we are answerable to Him for the use we make of them. If we use them wisely, God will call us laborers together with Him. If we cleanse ourselves from every impure, selfish principle, we shall one day hear the benediction, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant\" (Matthew 25:21).",
