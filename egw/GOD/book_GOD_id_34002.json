    "word": "The Sabbath of the Lord is to be made a blessing to us and to our children. . . . They can be pointed to the blooming flowers and the opening buds, the lofty trees and beautiful spires of grass, and taught that God made all these in six days, and rested on the seventh day, and hallowed it. Thus the parents may bind up their lessons of instruction to their children, so that when these children look upon the things of nature, they will call to mind the great Creator of them all. Their thoughts will be carried up to nature's God--back to the creation of our world, when the foundation of the Sabbath was laid, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.",
