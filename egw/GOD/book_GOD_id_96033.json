    "word": "The secret of success is not in our learning, not in our position, for \"all ye are brethren,\" not in our numbers or entrusted talents, not in the will of man. All the Lord's workers, feeling their inefficiency, must contemplate Christ, and through Him who is the strength of all strength, the thought of all thought, the willing and obedient will gain victory after victory. The Lord God of Israel is our strength.",
