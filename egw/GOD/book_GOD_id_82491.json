    "word": "Men bring upon themselves great and unceasing responsibility, and tax both brain and body, in seeking to carry the many plans they have devised. \n                                                                           239\nThis is one of the greatest disadvantages we have to meet, and one the solving of which will wear out the human energies. Activity is needed in God's cause, but let not this talent be misdirected. When men learn to be servants of Jesus Christ, they will understand that in every church, workers are to be set to work to take the oversight of things. Pastors and teachers are to work intelligently in their lines, instructing church members how to work in medical missionary lines. When the professed followers of Christ have an indwelling Saviour they will be found doing as Christ did. They will have no opportunity to rust through inaction. They will have enough to do. And the work which they do under the auspices of the church will be their greatest means of communicating light. The man who is working according to God's plan will pray, \"Let it be known this day in my work for suffering humanity that there is a God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant. Let it be seen that I am working not according to my own impulse and wisdom, but according to Thy Word.\" When man places himself in this attitude, and realizes that he is working out God's plan, and that God is working out His plan through him, he is in possession of divine power, which knows nothing of defeat. All the power of counter agencies is of no more account than the chaff of the threshing floor.",
