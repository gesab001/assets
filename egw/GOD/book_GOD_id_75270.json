    "word": "The Judgment of Amalek. \n\n     God pledges his most holy word that he will bless you if you will walk in his way and do justice and judgment. \"Thou shalt not have in \n\n\n                       - 29 - \n\nthy bag divers weights, a great and a small. Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and small. But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteousness, are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt: how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.\"",
