    "word": "Just as you are, come to Him, and trust yourself in His hands. Believe that He does accept you as He has promised. Do not try to do some great thing to recommend you to God, but trust in Him now, just now. . . . Come by humble faith to Him who has never said to the needy and suffering, \"Seek ye My face in vain.\" We know that we are sinners and that we often err and are frequently overcome with temptations; but this should not lead us in our great need to keep away from the only One who can help us and save us from the power of Satan. This is the enemy's work to discourage and drive to despair.",
