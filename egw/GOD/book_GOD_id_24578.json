    "word": "Had they lived in close connection with Jesus, they would have realized the worth of souls, and would have felt a burden for those who have not the light of truth. The spirit of the third angel's message would have led them to practice self-denial. But association with unbelievers clouds their faith. They lose sight of their responsibility as the light of the world; and in their dress, in the arrangement of their houses, in their style of living, they conform to the world, and deprive the cause of God of the means which he has lent them to advance his work. The children imitate their parents. Pride and worldliness are encouraged in them, the love of the truth grows cold in their hearts, and they are lost to the cause of God.",
