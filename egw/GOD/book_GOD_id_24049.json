    "word": "Hasty Eating. \n     671. In order to have healthy digestion, food should be eaten slowly. Those who wish to avoid dyspepsia, and those who realize their obligation to keep all their powers in the condition which will enable them to render the best service to God, will do well to remember this. If your time to eat is limited, do not bolt your food, but eat less, and eat slowly. . . . Those who are excited, anxious, or in a great hurry would do well not to eat until they have found rest or relief; for the vital powers, already severely taxed, cannot supply the necessary gastric juice. . . . Eat slowly, and allow the saliva to mingle with the food.--R. and H., 1884, No. 31.",
