W., \n                                  Jan. 16, 1896.\n Dear Brethren Who Occupy Responsible Positions in \n     the Work:-- \n     The Lord has a controversy with you. I have no need to specify the reasons; you have had them laid open before you again and again. The clean hands, the pure, unselfish, holy purposes have not been brought into your practise, and the benediction of God has not come upon many of those who handle sacred things. The lifting up of the soul and speaking vanity, and the lifting up of men to manage their fellow men, body and soul, is all open before God, with whom we have to do. There is no man or set of men that can manage men. \"All ye are brethren.\" The Holy Spirit of God alone can do this. When you, because of your position, supposed you could say the word, and it would be done just after your idea, you made a mistake. Truth, honor, and integrity have been compromised to gain certain advantages. Justice hath fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.",
