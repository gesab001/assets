    "word": "Though Jesus was subject to his parents, he began at a very early age to act for himself in the formation of his character. While his mother was his first human teacher, he was constantly receiving an education from his Father in heaven. Instead of poring over the learned lore handed down by the rabbis from century to century, Jesus, under the Divine Teacher, studied the words of God, pure and uncorrupted, and studied also the great lesson-book of nature. The words, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" were ever upon his lips, and \"It is written,\" was his reason for every act that varied from the family customs. He brought a purer atmosphere into the home life. Though he did not place himself under the instruction of the rabbis by becoming a student in their schools, yet he was often brought in contact with them, and the questions he asked, as if he were a learner, puzzled the wise men; for their practises did not harmonize with the Scriptures, and they had not the wisdom that comes from God. Even to those who were displeased at his non-compliance with popular customs, his education seemed of a higher type than their own.",
