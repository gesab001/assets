    "word": "I am thankful that Elder Loughborough can still use his abilities and his gifts in God's work. He has stood faithful amid storm and trial. . . . A few of our old standard-bearers are still living. . . . We present them before you as men who know what trials are. I am instructed to say, Let every believer respect the men who acted a prominent part during the early days of the message, and who have borne trials and hardships and many privations. These men have grown gray in service. Not long hence they will receive their reward.--Letter 47, 1902, pp. 3, 5, 6. (To Brother and Sister Haskell, February 5, 1902.)",
