    "word": "God would have all such confederacies broken to stone and remodeled upon Christlike principles. The foundation stone must be mercy. Human minds are not to be trampled, and bound and driven by human hands. The Lord Jesus must hold the reins in his own hands that were pierced to bring peace and comfort and hope to every soul who will believe on him. He gives to the purchase of his blood the guardianship of his grace; they shall move in his light, clad in the robes of his righteousness. To every man is given his work; and while souls are brought into church capacity, work is assigned them of God. They are to move as winds that are under the controlling influence of God.",
