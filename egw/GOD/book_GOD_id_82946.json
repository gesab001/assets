    "word": "We wish to present temperance and health reform from a Bible standpoint, and to be very cautious not to go to extremes in abruptly advocating health reform. Let us be careful not to graft into health reform one false shoot according to our own peculiar over-strained ideas and weave into it our own strong traits of character, making these as the voice of God, and passing judgment on all who do not see as we do. It takes time to educate away from wrong habits.",
