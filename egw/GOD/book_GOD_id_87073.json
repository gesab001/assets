    "word": "Do not allow other studies to occupy the largest portion of the time and the Bible the less. I have had presented before me that there is only a limited time given to the perusal of the Word of God. The Bible study is not to be the least but the greatest. It is to take the place of reading books and from the Word are to be presented lessons that shall crowd out as much as possible other books. The Lord's words and lessons are those which all the students recently attending school need above everything else. I write because I know that the Bible studies are not amply given, and the Lord will not sanction this. The Bible is our educator, our studybook. Please bear this in mind. It is not to be a book among books, but the Book of all books to educate. The mind must be impressed, and this must be the main study.--Ms 69, 1899, p. 1.
