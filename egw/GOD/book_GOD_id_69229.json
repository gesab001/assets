    "word": "Our heavenly Father is never unmindful of those whom sorrow has touched. When David went up the Mount Olivet, \"and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot\" (2 Samuel 15:30), the Lord was looking pityingly upon him. David was clothed in sackcloth, and his conscience was scourging him. The outward signs of humiliation testified of his contrition. In tearful, heartbroken utterances he presented his case to God, and the Lord did not forsake His servant. Never was David dearer to the heart of Infinite Love than when, conscience-smitten, he fled for his life from his enemies, who had been stirred to rebellion by his own son. The Lord says, \"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.\" Revelation 3:19. Christ lifts up the contrite heart and refines the mourning soul until it becomes His abode.",
