    "word": "The Sanitarium at Wahroonga is to be furnished with help of no ordinary character. If Dr. Caro had learned the lessons that he ought to have learned after he came to Australia, he would today be where the Holy Spirit would work through him.

For this institution there is needed an economical, God-fearing physician, who will link up with Dr. Kress and his wife, standing with them shoulder-to-shoulder and heart-to-heart.",
