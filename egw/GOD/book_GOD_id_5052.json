    "word": "Then I was taken to a world which had seven moons. There I saw good old Enoch, who had been translated.\n99\nOn his right arm he bore a glorious palm, and on each leaf was written \"Victory.\" Around his head was a dazzling white wreath, and leaves on the wreath, and in the middle of each leaf was written \"Purity,\" and around the wreath were stones of various colors, that shone brighter than the stars, and cast a reflection upon the letters and magnified them. On the back part of his head was a bow that confined the wreath, and upon the bow was written \"Holiness.\" Above the wreath was a lovely crown that shone brighter than the sun. I asked him if this was the place he was taken to from the earth. He said, \"It is not; the city is my home, and I have come to visit this place.\" He moved about the place as if perfectly at home. I begged of my attending angel to let me remain in that place. I could not bear the thought of coming back to this dark world again. Then the angel said, \"You must go back, and if you are faithful, you, with the 144,000, shall have the privilege of visiting all the worlds and viewing the handiwork of God.\"",
