    "word": "\"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled\" [Matthew 5:6]. The word of Christ is eternal truth, and is the bread of life. If we eat of this bread, we must die to self; the narrow sphere of personal, selfish interests must be enlarged, for it is impossible for a Christian to live unto himself. Self must be hidden in Christ, and divine help has been pledged to the aid of all those who will surrender their whole heart to God. It is in order that we may die to self that we are called upon to endure trials. In our sorest distress, Christ comes to our refuge. When every professed follower of Christ will make a covenant with God by sacrifice, will be determined that he will not indulge in selfish gratification, in studying his own ease, but will diligently plan to do God's service, then all will find the Lord a present help in every time of emergency.",
