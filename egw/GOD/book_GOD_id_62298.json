For thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning . . . this city.

And it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them.\" \"In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.\" Jeremiah 33:2-9, 16. \n\n\n                                             (229)",
