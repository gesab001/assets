    "word": "Sanitariums are to be so established and conducted that they will be educational in character. They are to show to the world the benevolence of Heaven. Though Christ's visible presence is not discerned, yet the workers may claim the promise, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Matthew 28:20. He has assured His followers that to those who love and fear Him He will give power to continue the work that He began. \n                                                                           249\nHe went about doing good, teaching the ignorant and healing the sick. His work did not stop with an exhibition of His power over disease. He made each work of healing an occasion of implanting in the heart the divine principles of His love and benevolence. Thus His followers are to work. Christ is no longer in this world in person, but He has commissioned us to carry forward the medical missionary work that He began; and in this work we are to do our very best. For the furtherance of this work institutions for the care of the sick are to be established, where men and women suffering from disease may be placed under the care of God-fearing physicians and nurses.",
