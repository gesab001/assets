    "word": "Ellen Misses James's \"Manly Arm\" During his Illness--Yesterday after I left the cars I rode twelve miles in the stage. The scenery was beautiful. The trees with their varied hues, the beautiful evergreens interspersed among them, the green grass, the high and lofty mountains, the high bluffs of rocks--all are interesting to the eye.

If we chasten our souls before God and truly repent of all our wrongs, will He not be entreated, for the sake of His dear Son, to heal your father?--Letter 16, 1866, p. 2. (To Edson White, October 14, 1866.)",
