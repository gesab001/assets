    "word": "I have sought to do my duty. I have specified the special sins of some. I was shown that the sins and errors of all in the wisdom of God would not be revealed. All would have sufficient light; all could see, if they desired to do so, and earnestly wished to put their sins and errors from them, and perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord. They could see what sins God marked and reproved in others. If these sins were cherished by them, they should know that they were abhorred of God, and were separated from him; and unless they earnestly and zealously set about the work to put them away, they would be left in darkness. God is too pure to behold iniquity. A sin marked in one is just as grievous in the sight of God in every case. There will be no exception made by an impartial God. All who are guilty are addressed in these individual testimonies, although their names may not be attached to the special testimony borne; and if individuals pass over their own sins because their names are not especially called, if they cover their sins, they will not be prospered of God. They cannot advance in the divine life, but will become darker and darker until the light of Heaven will be entirely withdrawn.",
