    "word": "Statement Regarding the Importance of the Mother's Work \n\n\n     To bring up the children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord is the greatest missionary work that parents can perform. The mother is entrusted with a greater work than is the king upon his throne. She has a class of duty to perform in connection with her children that no other one can perform. If she daily learns in the school of Christ, she will discharge her duty in the fear of God, and care for the children as the Lord's beautiful flock. Ms 38, 1895, p. 15. (To \"the church in Hobart [Tasmania], May, 1895.)",
