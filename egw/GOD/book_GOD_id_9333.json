    "word": "Who Will Say, \"Send Me\"? \n\n     Christ's work is to be done. Let those who believe the truth consecrate themselves to God. Where there are now a few who are engaged in missionary work, there should be hundreds. Who will feel the importance, the divine greatness, of the call? Who will deny self? When the Saviour calls for workers, who will answer, \"Here am I, send me\"? \n                                                                           33",
