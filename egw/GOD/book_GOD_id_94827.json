    "word": "The human family is suffering because of the transgressions of the laws of God. Satan is constantly weaving in his principles, and thus seeking to counterwork the work of God. He is constantly representing the chosen people of God as a deluded people. He is an accuser of the brethren, and his power of accusing he is using constantly against those who work righteousness. The Lord would have His people stand out from the customs and practices of the world. Still greater truths are unfolding for this people as they near the end of time, and God designs that those who see the light and believe the truth of the third angel's message shall establish institutions where those who are in darkness in regard to the needs of the human organism may be educated, that they may in their turn lead others into the light of health reform. The blind leaders of the blind must learn the truth of healthful living as taught in the Scriptures.",
