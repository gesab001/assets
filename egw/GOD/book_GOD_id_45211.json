    "word": "Our Distinctive Sign \n\n     The banner of the third angel has inscribed upon it, \"The commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\" Our institutions have taken a name which sets forth the character of our faith, and of this name we are never to be ashamed. I have been shown that this name means much, and in adopting it we have followed the light given us from heaven. . . . The Sabbath is God's memorial of His creative work, and it is a sign that is to be kept before the world. \n                                                                           385",
