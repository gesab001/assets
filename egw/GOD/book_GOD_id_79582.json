    "word": "God sees the end from the beginning. He has given us an expression of His love for the world,--an amazing manifestation, that can never be computed. He is constrained, by His love and His goodness, to delight in the well-doing and the happiness of the beings formed in His image. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16. He gave His Son as the propitiation for the sins of a guilty world. This is the message that is to be borne throughout the Southern states. What a work there is before us! The Lord desires the desert places of the South, where the outlook appears so forbidding, to become as the garden of God.",
