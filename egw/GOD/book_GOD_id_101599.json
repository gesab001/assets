    "word": "Cannot you see that eternal interests are involved in your life practice? Every one is deciding his own destiny. He who reigns in heaven allows every man to take his position to hasten or retard his Lord's appearing. All who consent to be freed from their natural selfishness, and to [be] charged with the Holy Spirit of God, are taking part with God; as the human channel they are pouring forth the currents of a divine influence. Their work has God's blessing within it. They are building upon the foundation, gold, silver, precious stones. \n                                                                           1512\nWhen the day of judgment shall try every man's work, of what sort it is, the gold, silver, precious stones, are imperishable; the wood, hay, stubble, are consumed, and the life work of the builder is lost. Just in proportion to man's consecration to God in this life, will be his advancement in the future life. According to its character, his work is rewarded, and determines his place in the temple of God.",
