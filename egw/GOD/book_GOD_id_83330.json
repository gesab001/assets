    "word": "Let every speaker and every one who believes the truth, show by their actions that they are not children, tossed to and fro, but men and women who thoroughly believe that they have saving truth. Frequently when a congregation is at the very point when the heart is prepared for the Sabbath question, it is delayed through fear of the consequences. This has been done, and the result has not been good. God has made us depositaries of sacred truth; we have a message, a saving message, which we are commanded to give to the world, and which is pregnant with eternal results. To us as a people has been committed light that must illuminate the world.",
