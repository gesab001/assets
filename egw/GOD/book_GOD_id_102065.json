    "word": "Some think that they must be so wonderfully orthodox, but they are not orthodox at all after Christ's order. They catch some little point and dwell upon it, magnifying it above all else. Of those who do not see as they do they say, \"We do not want this man to preach because he does not see this point,\" and, \"We do not want that man to preach because he does not see that point.\" But they do not know what they are about. Leave that man with God.",
