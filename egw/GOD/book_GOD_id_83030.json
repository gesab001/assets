    "word": "This day I consecrate myself unto God anew. We are privileged as well as summoned to be workers together with Jesus Christ. We are to work out our own salvation with fear and with trembling. For it is God that worketh in us to will and to do of His good pleasure. Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit, which are God's. Why do we falter, Why do we faint, Why do we become discouraged? Our gracious Redeemer has given us from His own lips, \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.\" \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.\" Whomsoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, for Christ's sake, \"he cannot be My disciple.\" These are the terms of our discipleship in the Christian life. Christ that gave Himself has positively stated the terms of our discipleship. We become His followers when we comply with the terms He has specified. Here is the standard of our duty in the clear light of a perfect authoritative example. Christ Jesus is our only hope. Believe in Him. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. Christ has explicitly commanded us to follow Him and we shall not walk in darkness. Thank the Lord Jesus.",
