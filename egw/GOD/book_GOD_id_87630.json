    "word": "MR No. 720 - Discipline of SDA Church Members\n\n     Church Difficulties.--Those who had a ruling influence in the church [at Ligonier, Indiana] were not right in heart themselves, notwithstanding they made high profession of faith. The outside was apparently right, as far as belief and profession were concerned, while the inward work of the heart--the grace of God in the life developing characters--was very much at fault. They had not the Spirit of Christ, and they labored with another spirit exhibiting self. Strong feelings would rise up under contradiction, or, if others differed with them in both their ideas or opinions, their own hearts being controlled by selfishness, they sought to exalt themselves, and censure and judge their brethren--a work God had not given them at all.",
