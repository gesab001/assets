    "word": "In the cities of Riverside, Redlands, and San Bernardino a mission field is open to us that we have as yet only touched with the tips of our fingers. A good work has been done there \n\n\n                             -261- \n\nas far as our workers have had encouragement to do it; but there is need of means to carry the work successfully. It was God's purpose that by the sale of \"Ministry of Healing\" and \"Christ's Object Lessons\" the necessary means would be raised for the work of our sanitariums and schools, and thus our people be left free to donate of their means for the opening of the work in new fields. If our people had engaged in the sale of these books as God purposed they should, we would now have the means to carry the work in the way the Lord designed.",
