    "word": "Angels are commissioned to watch in every family. Each one has the watchcare of a holy angel. These angels are invisible, but sometimes they let their light shine so distinctly that it is recognized. I believe this to be the case in the revealing you have had. This manifestation is teaching you that the Lord loves you, and that His angels are guarding you. You are kept by the power of God.",
