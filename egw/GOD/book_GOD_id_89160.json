    "word": "Where is our dependence? Where is our help? God's Word tells us: \"The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you\" (John 14:26). The Holy Spirit is ready to cooperate with all who will receive Him and be taught by Him. All who lay hold on the truth and are sanctified through the truth are so united with Christ that they can represent Him in word and action. They have put on Christ, and they possess a power that enables them to reveal the truth to others. May the Holy Spirit speak to the hearts of God's chosen people, that their words may be as choice as gold, as they give the bread of life to those in transgression and sin. [John 14:21, 23, 24, quoted.]",
