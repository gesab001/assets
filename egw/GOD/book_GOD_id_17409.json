    "word": "The people of God must be prepared to withstand the wily foe. It is this resistance that Satan dreads. He knows better than we do the limit of his power and how easily he can be overcome if we resist and face him.

Therefore Satan's step is noiseless, his movements stealthy, and his batteries masked. . . .",
