    "word": "Brother Porter was on his feet, all broken up so that he could say nothing for a few moments; then he said that when I had spoken to him personally, before those assembled in the office chapel, he rose up against it, but he felt now that it was just what he needed, and he thanked the Lord for the reproof. He confessed the wrong that he had done me and Elder Waggoner, and humbly asked us to forgive him. He said he could not see clearly on all points in regard to the covenants, but that he would walk humbly before God, follow Jesus and seek light all the time. He said that he had been disbelieving the testimonies, but he said, \"I believe them now. God has spoken to us through Sister White this morning. I believe every word; I accept the testimony as from God. I take my stand upon them, for I believe that to be the Lord's side.\"",
