    "word": "So in searching the field and digging for the precious jewels of truth, hidden treasures are discerned. Unexpectedly we find precious ore that is to be gathered and treasured. And the search is to be continued. Hitherto very much of the treasure found has lain near the surface, and was easily obtained. \n                                                                           38\nWhen the search is properly conducted every effort is made to keep a pure understanding and heart. When the mind is kept open and is constantly  searching the field of revelation, we shall find rich deposits of truth. Old truths will be revealed in new aspects, and truths will appear which have been overlooked in the search. Ms 75, 1897, p. 3. (\"The Position God's People Should Occupy,\" 1897.)",
