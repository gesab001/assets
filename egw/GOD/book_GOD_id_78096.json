    "word": "\"Let every medical student aim to reach a high standard. Under the discipline of the Greatest of all teachers, our course must ever tend upward to perfection. All who are connected with the medical missionary work must be learners. Let no one stop to say, 'I can not do this'. Let him say instead, 'God requires me to be perfect, he expects me to work away from all commonness and cheapness, and to strive after that which is of the highest order'.",
