    "word": "There are but few in B. C. who have an experimental knowledge of the sanctifying influence of the truths they profess. Their obedience and devotion has not been in accordance with their light and privileges. They have no real sense of the obligation resting upon them, to walk as children of the light, and not as children of darkness. If the light had been given Sodom and Gomorrah that has been given to the church at B. C., they would have repented of their sins in sackcloth and ashes, and would have escaped the signal wrath of God. It will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of Judgment than for those in B. C. who have been privileged with the clear light, and who have had a vast amount of labor and have not profited by it. They have neglected the great salvation God in mercy was willing to bestow. They were so blinded by the devil, they verily thought they were rich and in the favor of God, when the True Witness declares them to be wretched, miserable, poor, and blind, and naked.",
