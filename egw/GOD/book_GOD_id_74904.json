    "word": "Dealing With Precious Souls. \n\n     Those who occupy important positions, who are brought in contact with souls for whom Christ has died, should place upon men the estimate God has placed upon them, and regard them as precious. But many have treated the purchase of Christ's blood in a harsh manner, in harmony with the disposition of men instead of according to the mind and spirit of Christ. Of his disciples Christ says, \"All ye are brethren.\" We should ever keep in mind the relation which we bear one to \n\n\n                          - 57 - \n\nanother, and remember that we must meet those with whom we associate here, around the judgment-seat of Christ. God will be the Judge, and he will deal justly with every individual. John says, \"I saw the dead small and great stand before God, and the books were opened: and another book was opened which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works.\" Let every one who professes the name of Christ consider the fact that he must meet every act of injustice, give an account for every harsh word, at the judgment-seat of Christ. It will not be pleasant to review the words that have been spoken that have wounded and bruised souls, to review the decisions that have worked against souls for whom Christ died. Every action will come into judgment, and the spirit that prompted it will be made manifest. The fruit of every selfish, arbitrary exaction will be made plain, and men will see the results of their doings even as God sees them. They will see that they have turned precious souls out of the right path by dealing with them in an unchristlike manner. We are living in the great day of atonement, and it is now time that every one should repent before God, confess his sins, and by living faith, rest upon the merit of a crucified and living Saviour.",
