    "word": "Chap. 4 - Selection of Colporteur Evangelists\n\n     Those Who Feel Burden of Service.--Since canvassing for our literature is a missionary work, it should be conducted from a missionary standpoint. Those selected as canvassers should be men and women who feel the burden of service, whose object is not to get gain, but to give light to the people. All our service is to be done to the glory of God, to give the light of truth to those who are in darkness. Selfish principles, love of gain, dignity, or position, should not be once named among us.--Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 317. (1900)",
