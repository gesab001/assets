    "word": "The Lord still moves upon the hearts of kings and rulers in behalf of His people. Those who are laboring for Him are to avail themselves of the help that He prompts men and women to give for the advancement of His cause. The agents through whom these gifts come may open ways by which the light of truth shall be given to many benighted lands. These people may have no sympathy with God\u2019s work, no faith in Christ, no acquaintance with His Word; but their gifts are not on this account to be refused.",
