    "word": "I knelt by my chair to pray, feeling disheartened in reference to my journeying. Many appointments were before me. I had not uttered a word when the whole room seemed filled with a soft, silvery light, and my pain and disappointment and discouragement were removed. I was filled with comfort and hope and the peace of Christ. \"My peace will I give unto you.\" I knew it was upon me. The presence of Jesus was in the room. Genesis 28:12-15. I could better understand the meaning of these words: \"And Jacob . . . said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\" And he was in a desolate wilderness.",
