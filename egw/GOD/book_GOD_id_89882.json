    "word": "I am glad that you could be with us in the meetings held when you were at St. Helena, because you have had little opportunity to learn of the character of the work that the Lord gave me when I was but 16 years old, work which ever since He has sustained me in doing. I know that the Lord gave me the words to speak that you heard when you were here. His power and grace sustained me. His power was with me all the way through the last General Conference, and had the men in responsibility felt one quarter of the burden that rested on me, there would have been heartfelt confession and repentance. A work would have been done by the Holy Spirit such as has never yet been seen in Battle Creek. Those who at that time heard my message, and refused to humble their hearts before God, are without excuse. No greater proof will ever come to them.",
