    "word": "The Lord sends His messages to correct the erring, however highly they may regard themselves. He asks that they submit their judgment to His control. Every soul must be under discipline to God. To occupy an exalted position is not always evidence that the Lord has placed an individual in that position. It is the works, not position, that testify to the value of a man. Hereditary traits of character need to be overcome. A man cannot safely be entrusted with the control of others. unless he himself is under the sanctification of the Holy Spirit.",
