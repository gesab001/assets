    "word": "In order that the great work of sanctification that needs to be carried forward in the churches of Southern California, may be accomplished, the minds and wills of our ministers, and physicians, and teachers should be united, their hearts blending in one spirit to give the trumpet a certain sound. Let every voice proclaim distinctly the third angel's message. In word and act let those who are proclaiming the message, reveal that they are numbered among those \"that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\"",
