    "word": "In this country the greatest fraud is practiced by the physician. He receives a call to go 25 miles. He steps into the [railroad] cars, and in one or two hours is at his post of duty. He comes in, looks at the patient, tells him to go to the hospital, or perhaps gives him a little liquid in a bottle, and for this charges the patient from five to ten pounds. This is extortion and robbery of the afflicted, and is directly opposed to the precepts of the law of God.",
