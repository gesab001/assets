    "word": "The men whom God has called and chosen may, if they will, learn of Christ to be true. They may work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in them to will and to do of His good pleasure. But when young men and young women begin to put on airs of importance, they are not looking to the Lord Jesus. They are not learning from Him to be meek and lowly. They form habits of arbitrary authority, and are full of conceit, full of boasting about what they are going to do, and what wonderful improvements they will make in advancement and growth.",
