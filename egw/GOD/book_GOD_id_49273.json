    "word": "Let me point you to the life of Christ, to His compassion, His humility and love, His inexpressible tenderness. You are to copy His example. God has given you life and all the rich blessings that make it enjoyable, and in return He has claims upon you for service, for gratitude, for love, for obedience to His law. These claims are of the first importance, and cannot be lightly disregarded; but He requires nothing of you that will not make you happier, even in this life.",
