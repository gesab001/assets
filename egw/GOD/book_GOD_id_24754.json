    "word": "Imagine, if possible, the nature and degree of Christ's sufferings. This suffering in humanity was to prevent the outpouring of the wrath of God upon the whole of those for whom Christ died. Yea, for the church this great sacrifice will be efficacious throughout eternity. Can we compute the amount of her transgression in figures? Impossible. Then who can approach unto a conception of what Christ has endured when standing in the place of surety for His church . . . ? . . . [He was] the only One who could bear the strokes in behalf of the sinner and because of His innocence not be consumed. . . . In the sacrifice of God's only-begotten Son is demonstrated the awful glory of divine justice and holiness.",
