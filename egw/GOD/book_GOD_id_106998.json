    "word": "You may say, The world will not acknowledge us. What if the world will not acknowledge you? It is the power of God that makes the impression upon human mind. Let it be more and more deeply impressed upon every student that everyone of us should have an intelligent understanding of how to treat the physical system. And there are many who would have greater intelligence in these matters if they would not confine themselves to years of study without a practical experience under the instruction of learned physicians and surgeons. The more fully you put yourself under the direction of God, the greater knowledge you will receive from God. As you keep yourself in connection with the Source of all power, and as you minister to the sick, suggestions will come to your mind how you can apply to the case in hand the principles learned in your student days. \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" He is to be your Chief Instructor. \n                                 Ellen G. White.",
