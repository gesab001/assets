    "word": "Will the people of God frown down all this corrupting influence? Will they give their hearts to God? Will they deal mercifully with their fellow men? Will Seventh-day Adventists bear in mind that they cannot swerve from truth in their dealings with their fellow men, that they cannot violate justice, or let go their integrity without forsaking God. Anything that dishonors Him will never benefit you. The man who expects to prosper by violating the eternal principles of righteousness is laying up for himself a harvest he will not care to reap. He places himself in the enemy's ranks and brings degradation upon himself. Although for a time he may seem to prosper, he can never help to compose the family of God.--Letter 108, 1898 (MR 900.62).",
