    "word": "The meeting was opened at once. I spoke from John 14, dwelling particularly upon that portion which refers to the commandments of God, verses 15, 21-26. The Lord strengthened and blessed me in speaking to the people.

Satan proved disloyal and was expelled from heaven, with the disloyal angels.",
