    "word": "Chap. 3 - Workers in the Cause\n[EXTRACTS FROM THE\nTESTIMONIES, VOL. V, PP. 721-729.]\n\n     As year by year the work extends, the need of experienced and faithful workers becomes more urgent; and if the people of God walk in His counsel, such workers will be developed. While we should rely firmly upon God for wisdom and power, He would have us cultivate our ability to the fullest extent. As the workers acquire mental and spiritual power, and become acquainted with the purposes and dealings of God, they will have more comprehensive views of the work for this time, and will be better qualified both to devise and to execute plans for its advancement. Thus they may keep pace with the opening providences of God.",
