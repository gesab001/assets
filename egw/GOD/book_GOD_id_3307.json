    "word": "Nehemiah\u2019s experience in connection with the rebuilding of Jerusalem teaches lessons that will be needed by God\u2019s people as long as time shall last. The times call for men and women of strength and decision of character. Paul says, \u201cFinally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\u201d The enemy will mingle his evil with every good work that is done if the workers are not on guard. Thus he seeks to spoil God\u2019s purposes.\u2014Manuscript 58, 1903.",
