    "word": "The Word of God is to be studied and taught. Converse with God through the medium of His Word. Thus our characters will be transformed. The ideas and habits once thought essential, will be changed. God's Word is to be our lesson book. It is through the medium of this Word that we are to learn all about that better country, and the preparation essential for every one to obtain an entrance into the kingdom of God. That word obeyed cheerfully and willingly, will ennoble your whole being. . . . . . . . . \n                                      Mrs. E. G. White \n\n\n                                    -53-",
