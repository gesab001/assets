    "word": "There are many who profess to believe the truth who are corrupt in morals and who tarnish the purity in thoughts and impulse of others; who ruin souls under the pretense of saving souls; who utter words to the unwary, Satan speaking through them, as he spoke through the serpent when he tempted Eve. For all such there is a terrible retribution. They will reap that which they have sown. It is a terrible thing to use God's entrusted gifts, lent to bless the world and perverted in their use, leaving a blight, a woe, a curse, instead of a blessing. But I have written largely upon this, as you have seen in different forms.",
