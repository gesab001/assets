    "word": "In the plague that follows, power is given to the sun \u201cto scorch men with fire. And men were scorched with great heat.\u201d [Revelation 16:2-6, 8, 9.] The prophets thus describe the condition of the earth at this fearful time: \u201cThe land mourneth;. . . because the harvest of the field is perished.\u201d \u201cAll the trees of the field are withered; because joy is withered away from the sons of men.\u201d \u201cThe seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate.\u201d \u201cHow do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture. . . . The rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.\u201d \u201cThe songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord God; there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.\u201d [Joel 1:10-12, 17-20; Amos 8:3.]",
