    "word": "I am instructed to say to those professing to be medical-missionary workers: Remember that the Lord has a very large vineyard which He designs shall be cultivated. He saw that the Battle Creek Sanitarium was too large. The work was not being accomplished by physicians that God desired should be accomplished. There was not seen that unselfish purity of principle that marks true medical-missionary work. Many things were done, many plans were made, by which the law of God was not honored. Plans were carried out, and \n\n\n                                    -46- \n\npassed as medical-missionary work that God refused to acknowledge--plans that greatly dishonored God.",
