    "word": "\"Whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck. . . . Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off\" (Matthew 18:5, 6, 8).

Unless you are, you are under the condemnation of God today, and ought to be converted.",
