    "word": "God calls upon His servants to reveal a spirit of unvarying kindness and love. Nothing is gained by harsh denunciations and bitterness of spirit. To be harsh in trying to correct wrong is to commit sin in reproving sin. True reformers are not destroyers. They never seek to ruin those who do not harmonize with their plans. Reformers must advance, not retreat. They must be firm, decided, resolute, unflinching. But firmness must not be allowed to degenerate into an overbearing spirit. God would have those who serve Him as firm as a rock to principle, and yet meek and lowly, like Christ. Abiding in Christ, they can do the work that He would do were He in their places.",
