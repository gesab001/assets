    "word": "The more earnestly we apply our minds to the investigation of truth, the clearer will the evidences of truth appear, and the more closely we relate ourselves to the God of all wisdom, coming into communion with Him who has created all things, the richer will be our knowledge, the more fully shall we comprehend divine truth. God has graciously endowed men with intellectual powers, and these powers are to be wisely improved, that men may have ability to search into and understand rich depths of knowledge in the character, Word, and works of God. God will open the treasures of His love to the willing and obedient; he that willeth to do the will of God shall know of the doctrine.",
