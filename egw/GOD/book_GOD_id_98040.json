    "word": "I love my Saviour. I have given my life to His service, and never have I seen the moment when I could be ashamed of Him. I love Him because I have proved Him, and I know that He will do all that He has promised to do. He gave His life for me, and I have given all that I have to Him. I know that He accepts it. I feel so grateful that though I am 73 years old, I still have strength to serve God by speaking of His love to those who know Him and those who know Him not.",
