    "word": "Although the plan of salvation calls for the deepest study of the philosopher, it is not too deep for the comprehension of a child. In dying for sinners, Christ manifested a love that is incomprehensible; and in beholding this love the heart is impressed, the conscience is aroused, and the soul is led to inquire, \u201cWhat is sin, that it should require such a sacrifice for the redemption of its victim?\u201d . . . The apostle Paul gave instruction in regard to the plan of salvation. He declares, \u201cI kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d John, speaking of the Savior, says, \u201cYe know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.\u201d . . .",
