    "word": "How to Deal with Faultfinders\n     There are in our churches those who profess the truth who are only hindrances to the work of reform. This class are frequently in trial. Doubts, jealousies, and suspicion, \n273\nthe fruits of selfishness, seem to be interwoven with their very nature. They are a burden to the church and to the ministers of Christ. Much of the time and labor of the ministers is required to undo their work of evil, and restore harmony and union in the church. This takes from the courage and strength of God's servants, and unfits them for the work that he has for them to do in saving perishing souls from ruin.",
