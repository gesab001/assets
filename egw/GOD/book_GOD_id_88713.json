    "word": "Focus Attention on the Cross of Christ--Educators who will not work in these lines [Christian education] are not worthy of the name they bear. Teachers, turn from the examples of the world; cease to extol the professedly great men; turn the minds of your students from the glory of everything save the cross of Christ. That cross is to be bravely and manfully borne. Christ declares, \"Whosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Mark 8:34). And to all who will lift it and bear it after Christ, the cross is to them a pledge of the crown of immortality which they shall receive, which can never fade away.--Ms. 11, 1898, p. 6. (\"Word of God as a Study Book,\" Feb. 4, 1898.)",
