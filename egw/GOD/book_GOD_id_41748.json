    "word": "Books Given to Community Leaders.--I gave the mayor the best bound volume of Desire of Ages; and the Kerr brothers, three in number, each have one of my books and can interchange one with another; and I have placed my books into the hands of several others. This, I think, is the very best way I can leave with them the light God has given me. This has been all along under the direction of God. A gift in this line is letting the light shine forth in many families, and the message is appealing to the whole family.--Lt 218, 1899.",
