    "word": "Our sanctification is God's object in all his dealing with us. He has chosen us from eternity that we may be holy. Christ gave Himself for our redemption, that through our faith in His power to save from sin, we might be made complete in Him. In giving us His Word, He has given us bread from heaven. He declares that if we eat His flesh and drink His blood, we shall receive eternal life. Why do we not dwell more upon this? Why do we not strive to make it easily understood, when it means so much? Why do not Christians open their eyes to see the work God requires them to do? \n\n\n                                    -352- \n\nSanctification is the progressive work of a lifetime. The Lord declares, \"This is the will of God, even your sanctification.\" Is it your will that your desires and inclinations shall be brought into conformity to the divine will?",
