    "word": "My dear brethren and sisters, God is not pleased with your spirit of criticism and fault-finding. We must humble our hearts daily before God, and seek for a new conversion, that we may be brought into right relationship with Jesus Christ. Those who are striving to keep the commandments of God ought to be in harmony, and to show a spirit of humility and love. God \n\n\n                                       -362- \n\nis not in any of the differences that are so apparent. He does not inspire words of fault-finding. He is now calling upon us to humble ourselves under the hand of the Almighty, in order that He may lift us up.",
