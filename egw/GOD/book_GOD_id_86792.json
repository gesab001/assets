    "word": "Elder Smith was one mentioned to connect with you, and help you. But be assured that, if you will move in Christ's order, your inability will bring out the assurance of God's sufficiency. What is impossible for the human agent to do, God will do through you. Begin then, and advance. Do the work, believing that it is the right thing to do, and expecting the Lord to help you and your wife, and lead you in clear lines, working in and through you. As the Lord's mind becomes your mind, a divine tenderness will take possession of your soul. The channel that has been choked with misunderstandings will be cleared, the debris will be swept away by the current of Christ's love. The love of Christ will flow out to your brethren, and through them to others. Be pitiful to those whom you regard as weak and erring. In your work manifest the compassion of Christ. See how often His love broke forth in expression of sympathy for the unshepherded flock, the hungry multitudes.",
