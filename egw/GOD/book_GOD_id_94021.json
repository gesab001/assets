    "word": "My Instructor slowly and solemnly spoke the following words: \"Form a confederacy; to whom they shall say, 'Form a confederacy'; and they shall be broken in pieces.\" Three times were these words spoken. \"Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us\" [Isaiah 8:9,10].",
