    "word": "ELECT OBEY WITH CHILDLIKE SIMPLICITY.\u2014The Father sets His love upon His elect people who live in the midst of men. These are the people whom Christ has redeemed by the price of His own blood; and because they respond to the drawing of Christ, through the sovereign mercy of God, they are elected to be saved as His obedient children. Upon them is manifested the free grace of God, the love wherewith He hath loved them. Everyone who will humble himself as a little child, who will receive and obey the word of God with a child\u2019s simplicity, will be among the elect of God.\u2014ST January 2, 1893 quoted in OHC 77.",
