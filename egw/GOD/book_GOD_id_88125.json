    "word": "Bear in mind that to be a minister does not mean that you must do much preaching. Brethren, I entreat of you to keep your own souls in the love of God, and never let the wellsprings dry. A cold, joyless discourse will kill the church. Bring animation into your words and prayers. There must be no cheap, faithless sermons given. The truth abiding in the heart, sanctifying the soul, will give you an appetite to feed on Christ, the Bread of Life, and as you partake of the heavenly manna, you will be able to say, Come and eat that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Let all your energies be consecrated. . . . The Lord wants you to represent the truth as it is in Jesus. Let there be nothing like striving for supremacy. \n\n\n                                  -130-",
