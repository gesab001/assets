    "word": "Cry unto God the Lord, Pardon our infirmities, and their infirmities: but give not up one hour of service. Keep all at work in their own line, and handicap none of God's servants because they did not come to you for counsel, and do according to your bidding. You have bidden and directed too much. God's ministers should look to him for their directions. Your plans were not God's plans. Had your brother come to you for instruction, you would have discouraged or misdirected him. No man whom God has chosen to do his work is to be under the control of any other man's mind. Men may converse as equal men, but when it comes to laying down the rules and commands, leave that for the Lord to do. This is not the line in which you are called to work.",
