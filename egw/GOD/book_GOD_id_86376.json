    "word": "Satan was charging the people of God with all his attributes, and presenting before them the sins he had instigated them to commit. Satan clothed their characters with his own filthy garments of sin, and nothing was lost in his reckoning of their misdeeds. But these souls who were represented as wearing the black robes of Satan's weaving in his hellish loom, were not an appropriate representation; for they had repented of their transgressions. The Lord who searcheth the heart and understandeth the imagination of the thoughts, had set their sins before them, and had given them the promise: \"If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off forever.\" The Lord, the everlasting God, is ever present to observe, \n\n\n                                    -203- \n\ninspect, and examine all things. The hearts of all are read as an open book. \"The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth.\"",
