You are not in a condition of body and mind to labor. You must stop and rest and be happy, and not worry your mind about the responsibilities of the work and cause of God.  Be peaceful, calm, and happy, and trust yourself in the work and cause of God, feeling that you are now to soften, sweeten, ripen up for heaven.  God loves you.  But, with your advanced age and your strong peculiarities, you will certainly mar the work of God more than you can help it.",
