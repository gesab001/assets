    "word": "14-16 (2 Timothy 2:23-26; 2 Timothy 4:1-5; Colossians 2:8; see EGW on Revelation 14:1-4; 18:1). Cease All Idle Speculation.--[2 Timothy 2:14 quoted.] This is a warning appropriate for this time. Then comes a charge which will often need to be given: \"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" Learn to take the truths that have been revealed, and to handle them in such a way that they will be food for the flock of God.",
