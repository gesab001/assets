    "word": "The Beauty of Simplicity \n\n     Those children are most attractive who are natural and unaffected. It is not wise to give children special notice and repeat their clever sayings before them. Vanity should not be encouraged by praising their looks, their words, or their actions. Nor should they be dressed in an expensive or showy manner. This encourages pride in them and awakens envy in the hearts of their companions. Teach the children that the true adorning is not outward. \"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in \n                                                                           142\nthat which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\" 1 Peter 3:3, 4. . . .",
