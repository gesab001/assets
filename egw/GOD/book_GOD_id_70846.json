    "word": "She [Eve] really thought the serpent had a knowledge of her thoughts, and that he must be very wise. She answered him, \u201cWe may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\u201d [Genesis 3:2-5.]",
