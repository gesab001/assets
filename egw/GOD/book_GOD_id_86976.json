    "word": "Let us double our diligence to make our calling and election sure. Victory, victory, will be ours if we endure a little longer. I do beg and pray to be more like Jesus that I may reflect His lovely image. More and more I long to be filled with all the fullness of God. It is our privilege to rejoice in a whole Saviour, One that saves us from all sin. We will not rest unless we know the length and breadth, height and depth of perfect love. I expect you are buffeted by the enemy. Do not yield one inch to him. Let faith be in lively exercise. Let it enter within the second veil and take hold upon the most excellent glory.--Letter 30, 1850, p. 2. (To Brother and Sister Loveland, December 13, 1850.)",
