    "word": "The Two Houses.--Christ declares that those who do His words are like a man who built his house upon a rock. This house the tempest and flood could not sweep away. Those who do not do Christ's words are like the man who built his house upon the sand. Storm and tempest beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. It was an entire wreck. The result of professing to keep the law of God, yet walking contrary to the principles of that law, is seen in the wrecked house. Those who make a profession while failing to obey cannot stand the storm of temptation. One act of disobedience weakens the power to see the sinfulness of the second act. One little disregard of a \"Thus saith the Lord\" is sufficient to \n                                                                           369\nstop the promised blessing of the Holy Spirit. By disobedience the light once so precious becomes obscure. Satan takes of the mind and soul, and God is greatly dishonored.",
