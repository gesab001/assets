    "word": "God has been speaking in reproofs and warnings, but these have made very little impression. There has been no decided change with some, and the Lord has lifted up his hands to turn things into another channel. The Lord hates pretense and hypocrisy. The high-handed ruling, the domineering, the daily example that is contrary to the example of Christ, had been borne with long, and because sentence against an evil work has not been executed speedily, the hearts of the sons of men are fully set in them to do evil. God calls for a reformation in the men who occupy positions of responsibility in Battle Creek, the men who are continually misrepresenting Christ to their associates. Unless you repent, he will come near to you in judgment.",
