    "word": "These workers open their heart to receive the truth, and they are made wise in and through Christ. Their lives inhale and exhale the fragrance of godliness. Their words are thoughtfully considered before they are spoken. Their actions are patterned after the actions of their Leader. They strive to promote the well-being of their fellow men. They take relief and happiness to the sorrowful and distressed. They feel the necessity of remaining constantly under Christ's training, that they may work in accordance with the will of God. They study how they can best imitate the cross-bearing and self-denial of their Saviour. They are God's witnesses, following His example of compassion and love, ascribing all the glory to Him whom they love and serve.",
