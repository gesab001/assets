C. \n\n       Sanitarium, California, May 30, 1907. \n\n     I have a message to bear to our people throughout the field. There is a decided and thorough work to be done in Washington, D. C. The time is long past that should have seen this field faithfully worked. The last message of warning must be carried to those who need the truth. Men of God who have this message in their hearts should be chosen to carry it to the people of Washington and neighboring towns. One of authority was represented to me as standing before our people, and pleading that workers be sent to Washington; and I was instructed to urge this subject upon the minds of our laborers.",
