    "word": "Very many will get up some test that is not given in the word of God. We have our test in the Bible,--the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus.\" This is the true test, but many other tests will arise among the people. They will come in in multitudes, springing up from this one and that one. There will be a continual rising up of some foreign thing to call attention from the true test of God.",
