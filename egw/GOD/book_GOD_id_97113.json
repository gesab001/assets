    "word": "There are ministers who have not fed the flock of God. While their salaries have been paid, they are not men who are converted to God. There must be a weeding out of ministers; for they are not converted. We want to have the talent right in among us that has worked up to be used in our conference. But if there is no spirituality to discern where that talent is, \n\n\n                                    -170- \n\nor to train and discipline it for the work, what then? Why if there is talent in other fields, do not say, \"We are going to furnish our own talent here in Michigan, and we do not want anybody to work in Michigan unless they are Michigan men.\" Who told you to prescribe for God? Who told you to say what men should be over you? This is contrary to all the light that God has given me. You have no right to pick and choose according to your plans. No, indeed. Ask God to send out the very men who will help you most; to send you the very men that are qualified to take and elevate and carry the churches in your place to a higher standard. That is what you are to do. When you do this, God will work with you. When we do this, He will lift what we are trying to lift.",
