    "word": "We know not what is before us, and our only safety is in walking with Christ, our hand in His, our hearts filled with perfect trust. Has He not said, \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me\" (Isaiah 27:5)? Let us keep close to the Saviour. Let us walk humbly with Him, filled with His meekness. Let self be hid with Him in God. . . .",
