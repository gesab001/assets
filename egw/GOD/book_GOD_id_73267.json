    "word": "Visit Every Family and Know Their Spiritual Condition.--Wherever a church is established, all the members should engage actively in a missionary work. \n                                                                           72\nThey should visit every family in the neighborhood and know their spiritual condition. If professed Christians had engaged in this work from the time when their names were first placed on the church books, there would not now be such widespread unbelief, such depths of iniquity, such unparalleled wickedness, as is seen in the world at the present time. If every church member had sought to enlighten others, thousands upon thousands would today stand with God's commandment-keeping people.",
