    "word": "The student of the Sabbath-school should feel as thoroughly in earnest to become intelligent in the knowledge of the Scriptures as to excel in the study of the sciences. If either is neglected, it should be the lessons of the six days. The injunction of our Saviour should be religiously regarded by every man, woman, and child who \n108\nprofesses His name. Teachers in the Sabbath-school have a missionary field given them to teach the Scriptures, not parrot-like, to repeat over that which they have taken no pains to understand. \u201cThey are they which testify of Me,\u201d\u2014the Redeemer, Him in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered. If teachers are not imbued with the spirit of truth, and care not for the knowledge of what is revealed in the Word of God, how can they present the truth in an attractive light to those under their charge? . . .",
