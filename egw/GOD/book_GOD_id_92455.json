    "word": "To be talented is not to be applied to a favored class whose privilege it is to look down upon others as being deficient in tact and intellect. The whole family of God is entrusted with talents; they are responsible agents, and are to trade upon the Lord's goods, and learn to acquire more. God will bless all who will use the abilities which He has entrusted to them. If they are faithful and humble, realizing their dependence upon Him to whom they must render an account of their mental and physical endowments, they will receive wisdom from Him, as did Daniel, who looked to God for wisdom and then put into exercise every power that God had given him, until he became a trusted man in the kingdom of Babylon.",
