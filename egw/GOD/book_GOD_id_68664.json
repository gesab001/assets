    "word": "If a man in good physical health has property, and has no need of entering into employment for his own support, he should labor to acquire means that he may advance the cause and work of God. He is to be \"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord\" (Romans 12:11). God will bless all who will guard their influence in regard to others in this respect.-- Manuscript 93, July 13, 1899.",
