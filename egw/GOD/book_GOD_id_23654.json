    "word": "WICKED DESTROYED; EARTH DESOLATE.\u2014At the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the face of the whole earth\u2014consumed with the spirit of His mouth, and destroyed by the brightness of His glory. Christ takes His people to the city of God, and the earth is emptied of its inhabitants. \u201cBehold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.\u201d \u201cThe land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for the Lord hath spoken this word.\u201d \u201cBecause they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.",
