    "word": "How wide the contrast between these words of Paul and those that come from many of the pulpits of today. The people are taught that obedience to God\u2019s law is not necessary to salvation; that they have only to believe in Jesus, and they are safe. Without the law, human beings have no conviction of sin, and feel no need of repentance. Not seeing their lost condition as violators of God\u2019s law, they do not feel their need of the atoning blood of Christ as their only hope of salvation.",
