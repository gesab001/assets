    "word": "I saw that James and Bro. Waggoner erred in not freely talking their fears to you. You were deceived as to their feelings, and acted under a mistaken idea of things, and you and Harriet were wrong in moving in such haste, without first getting a thorough understanding of the matter. Your action in the matter displeased God. You made a wrong move in introducing the matter where it should not be mentioned, when your past experience was sufficient to teach you the effect, that a great fire is kindled by a little matter. I saw if you break away from that Office [your] happiness and peace end. But where you lack now it is supplied, God has not released James from the Office; he has the care, responsibility and burden, and God has not released you from your place. I saw, like two brothers, true yoke-fellows, should you labor together, your interest one. You have shut up too much the interest to yourself; together should you labor, unitedly together should your hearts be knit, so close that Satan cannot get a wedge between you, united together can your interest tell, both working together in union. Your interest should not be divided. God is not pleased with this. You have no separate interest in that Office in the sight of God, your work is one, your interest one, and here \n                                                                           27\nyou have been too close, not as united as you should be.",
