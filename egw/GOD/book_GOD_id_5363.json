    "word": "Cling close to your Bible, for its sacred truths can purify, ennoble and sanctify the soul.  You must hold the truth and teach it as it is in Jesus, else it is of no value to you.  Before the light of God's truth let human opinions and ideas and human wisdom appear as they are in the sight of God--as foolishness.  Let no man feel that his position as president either of the General Conference or of a state conference clothes him with a power over the consciences of others that is the least degree oppressive, for God will not sanction anything of this kind.  He must respect the rights of all, and all the more because he is in a position where others will pattern after him.",
