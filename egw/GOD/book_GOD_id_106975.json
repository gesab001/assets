    "word": "The enemies of truth are working with all their unconsecrated powers to hinder the advance of the message. The churches of the world are being drugged with the opiates of error. The great deceiver is making determined efforts to becloud the understanding of the people. Let not those be discouraged who would go forth to warn a perishing world. The cause of God needs the labors of men who have faith, men who can pray, and who can open the Scriptures in simplicity to the people. It is the simplicity of true godliness that will speak of the love of God for souls ready to perish.",
