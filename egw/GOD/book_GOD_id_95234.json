    "word": "God wants His children to be strong in His strength. There is no such thing as being strong in our own strength. Let our churches keep their souls low in the meekness and lowliness of Christ. When trial comes, do not think that some strange thing has happened unto you, but hear the voice of God saying in your test and trial, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. God desires you to hear His voice amid the cloud. It is a voice of peace and not of war, telling you to look to Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of your faith, a Saviour able and willing and longing to save to the uttermost all who come to God by Him. He declares, I am touched with the feeling of their infirmities. Those who put their trust in Him will never be confounded. The shepherd's crook, which stops you from turning into strange paths, is not an evil; it is a mercy. Thus God would draw you away from evil to good. The refining fire must purify the gold and silver from all dross, that those who claim to be Christians may offer to God an offering in righteousness.",
