He knew that his powerful enemies would take any measure to silence him. They cried for his blood as eagerly as the Jews clamored for the blood of the Son of God. Yet he trusted in that God who preserved the three worthies in the burning fiery furnace. His anxiety and care were not for himself. He sought not his own ease, but his great anxiety was, that the truth, to him so precious, be not exposed to the insults of the ungodly. He was ready to die, rather than allow his enemies to triumph.
