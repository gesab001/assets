    "word": "The Creator of man has arranged the living machinery of our bodies. Every function is wonderfully and wisely made. And God pledged Himself to keep this human machinery in healthful action if the human agent will obey His laws and co-operate with God. Every law governing the human machinery is to be considered just as truly divine in origin, in character and in importance as the Word of God. Every careless, inattentive action, any abuse \n\n198 \n\nput upon the Lord's wonderful mechanism, by disregarding His specified laws in the human habitation, is a violation of God's law. We may behold and admire the work of God in the natural world, but the human habitation is the most wonderful.",
