There can be with those who are connected with this institution a feeling of non-concern, just as though they were at work in a harvest field or at some business that has no special relation to the work and cause of God. Now, this is not the way that this institution should be regarded. It is an institution that should stand in its elevated position before the people, and all who are connected with it should correspond with its elevation with an entire sense that this is God's institution.",
