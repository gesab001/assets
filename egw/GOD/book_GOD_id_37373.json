    "word": "Maintenance\n \n\n     The house of worship should be scrupulously cared for--but not from tithe.--The Lord instructed Moses, for Israel: \"Thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.\" This was to be a continual offering, that the house of God might be properly supplied with that which was necessary for His service. His people today are to remember that the house of worship is the Lord's property and that it is to be scrupulously cared for. But the funds for this work are not to come from the tithe.--9T 248.",
