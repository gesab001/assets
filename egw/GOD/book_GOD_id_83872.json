    "word": "Scientists, Cannot Explain God's Ways.--The men most learned in science can not interpret or explain the ways and works of God. Those only who have been entirely divested of self and selfishness and have been made partakers of the divine nature, can understand, by the aid of their spiritual faculties, the ways and workings of God. To those who know Him not His ways are past finding out.--Ms 76, 1903.",
