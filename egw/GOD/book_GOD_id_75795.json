The exactness, skill, tact, wisdom, and perfection which He required in the building of the earthly tabernacle, He desires to have brought into everything that shall be done in His service. Every transaction entered into by His servants is to be as pure and precious in His sight as were the gold and frankincense and myrrh which is sincere, uncorrupted faith the wise men from the East brought to the infant Saviour.",
