    "word": "God pitied the Israelites in their slavery in Egypt and, breaking the yoke of their bondage, He placed Moses at their head to lead them through the wilderness to the promised land. God has placed in our midst a people who in one sense have been freed from slavery but who are still in the slavery of ignorance, because men and women more favored have not taken the pains to lift them from their degradation. He who pitied the Israelites in Egypt is not indifferent to the suffering of the colored people in America. He calls upon those who name His name to take up the work they have neglected.--Manuscript 55, 1901. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. December, 1983",
