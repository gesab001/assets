    "word": "If ministers would work intelligently in their ministry, they would have left a source of strength to be given to more personal efforts and to the work that is essential to be done for the perfection of the work in all its parts. Many of our workmen wear themselves out when God does not require it. Many of them cripple their energies, or become martyrs to their imprudence. Our workers need to become educated upon these points. There is a great work to be done in this cause, and the laborer can do much more work if he does not preach at one time so long as to weary himself and his hearers.",
