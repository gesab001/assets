    "word": "Christ said, \"They that be whole need not a \n                                                                           57\nphysician, but they that are sick.\" We cannot leave souls for whom Christ died, to be the prey of Satan's temptations. We cannot abandon this great flock to their ignorance, want, suffering, and corruption. This would not be doing the will of God. We cannot heap advantages upon ourselves and upon those who are not in need, and pass by those who are in utter want, and be approved of God. This neglect is charged against those who have had great light, who have had marvelous opportunities, and who yet leave so large a portion of God's moral vineyard unworked. For years Satan has been sowing his tares among the colored people, and the field cannot be worked as easily now as it could have been worked years ago. But there should be no delay now. Reproach is brought upon Jesus Christ when those who profess to be carrying the last message of mercy to the world pass this field by. Christ did not pass by the needy and suffering. He united works of mercy with the message of salvation He came to bear  to men. He engaged in a constant, untiring ministry, and worked for the perishing and sorrowful. He prefaced His message of love by deeds of ministry and beneficence, leaving us an example that we should follow in His steps. [REVIEW AND HERALD, DEC. 3, 1895.]",
