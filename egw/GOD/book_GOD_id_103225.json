    "word": "\"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, Australia, March 24, '99. Dear Sister Henry:- \n     . . . I am so glad, my sister, that you did not sever your connection with the Women's Christian Temperance Union. You may have to sever this connection, but not yet, not yet. Hold your place. Speak the words given you by God, and the Lord will certainly work with you. You may see many things you do not approve of, but do not fail nor be discouraged. I hope and pray that you may be clothed daily with the righteousness of Christ. \n\n                                               -",
