    "word": "C. T. & B. H.--41-42 \n     Only one lease of life is granted us; and the inquiry with every one should be, \"How can I invest my powers so that they may yield the greatest profit? How can I do most for the glory of God and the benefit of my fellow-men?\" For life is valuable only as it is used for the attainment of these ends. \n\n184  {TSDF 183.10}  \n     Our first duty toward God and our fellow-beings is that of self-development. Every faculty with which the Creator has endowed us should be cultivated to the highest degree of perfection, that we may be able to do the greatest amount of good of which we are capable. Hence that time is spent to good account which is used in the establishment and preservation of physical and mental health. We can not afford to dwarf or cripple any function of body or mind. As surely as we do this, we must suffer the consequences.",
