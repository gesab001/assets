    "word": "The youth especially should feel that they must train their minds, and take every opportunity to become intelligent, that they may render acceptable service to Him who has given His precious life for them. And let no one make the mistake of regarding himself as so well educated as to have no more need of studying books or nature. Let every one improve every opportunity with which in the providence of God he is favored, to acquire all that is possible in revelation or science.",
