Kellogg\n\n                                                             K-18-1892 \n\n                       Preston, Melbourne, Australia, April, 15, 1892. \n\nDr. J. H. Kellogg, \n     Battle Creek, \n          Michigan. \n\n\n     Dear Brother:- Your letter in reference to Elder Waggoner and Dr. Paquin, I am sorry to say is not before me. Willie is in New Zealand, and I sent the letter to him, and when the book came addressed to him I sent that. I have not read anything of Eld. Waggoner's articles in Review. But from the way the Lord has been leading my mind, I feel that you are in danger. I had so hoped and believed that the Lord in his love and mercy to you had given you a clearer insight into his character and that of Jesus Christ whom he has sent, so that by his grace your feet would be planted upon the solid rock, and that through an experimental knowledge of what Jesus is to you and you to him you would be able to work more decidedly in a religious line than you have heretofore. You are in a responsible position, and should have a daily experience in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ.",
