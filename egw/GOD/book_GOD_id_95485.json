    "word": "July 14, 1892. I was very nervous last night. The chills that I had on Monday and Tuesday resulted in lame, very painful shoulders and hips. I have done much earnest praying to the Lord for the presence of His Spirit. I must learn to live by faith. Then my dark and painful hours will be the brightest. Faith is not sight. It is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. I have no hope except in Christ. Salvation is of grace through faith; it is the gift of God.",
