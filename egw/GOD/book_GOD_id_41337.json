    "word": "Cleanse the Office of Selfishness.--God calls for pure, thoroughly consecrated men to manage the work of the Review and Herald office. He has no use for men who in their business transactions betray Christ into the hands of His enemies. Such men are a stigma to His cause, a reproach to the truth that they misrepresent. Unless they repent, and work in a Christlike manner, as Christ has given them an example in His life, God has no place for them in His service, for they bring in selfishness and every evil work.",
