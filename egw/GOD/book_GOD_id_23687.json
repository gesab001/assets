WHITE\u2019S VISION OF THE NEW EARTH.\u2014With Jesus at our head we all descended from the City down to this earth, on a great and mighty mountain, which could not bear Jesus up, and it parted asunder, and there was a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the great City, with twelve \n136\nfoundations, twelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate. We all cried out, \u201cThe City, the great City, it\u2019s coming! It\u2019s coming down from God out of heaven!\u201d And it came and settled on the place where we stood.",
