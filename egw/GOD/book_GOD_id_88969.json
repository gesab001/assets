    "word": "The words, \"Thou hast left thy first love,\" describe your condition. God calls upon you to repent, else He will come to you quickly, and will remove the candlestick out of its place. You need the ministry of the great Physician to cure you of the disease which, unless cured, will result in spiritual blindness. Let the Spirit of God come in and take possession of your heart, purifying the soul-temple. God wants you to let your heart break before Him. He wants you to confess and forsake your besetting sins. --Letter 180, 1903, pp. 2, 3. (To J. H. Kellogg, May 5, 1903).",
