    "word": "The Spirit of God has come upon me at different times, in different places, and under various circumstances. My husband has had no control of these manifestations of the Spirit of God. Many times he has been far away when I have had visions. When our plans have been laid according to our best judgment, I have frequently been shown that if we followed our pleasure in these things we should not follow the leadings of God's Spirit. We have been warned of dangers and been corrected of errors.",
