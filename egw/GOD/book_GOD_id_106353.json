    "word": "The Lord has graciously fitted Brother Shireman to do a certain work. Not all men can do the work that he by his Christian experience is able to do. He can do excellent work in opening new fields, beginning in a humble way, and meeting the people where they are, coarse and rough though they may be. Working with Christ, he can adapt himself to the situation, winning the hearts of many. He is able to reach after souls and to draw them into the field. In many places he can find opportunity to read and comment upon the Bible to children and to older people. He and his wife can labor together for the conversion of souls. The Lord desires Brother Shireman to present the important points of truth to the people, in object lessons, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. He is to remember that the Lord Jesus is the one who moves upon the heart. If he walks humbly with God, the Lord will continue to use him, giving him health and strength to do his appointed work.",
