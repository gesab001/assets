    "word": "One will come in and interrupt a workman just a few minutes. Frequently their few minutes lengthen to half an hour. That one passes out, another comes in and spends a longer or shorter period, and thus five to twenty-five calls are heedlessly made in a day, and every one passes out of the Office, nothing bettered themselves, and yet the laborers have been hindered, their interest diverted from the work, and the precious  \n                                                                           35\nminutes are used up, which are all needed to be devoted to the work. Sum up these minutes and it will be found hours of time are consumed, to no benefit to any one, but a decided injury to the Office. There are many business calls made which cannot be avoided. Those who have no special business, have no right to amuse themselves by diverting the attention of Brn. Aldrich, Walker, Amadon, Gage, Bacheller, Lane, or any one who is laboring in the Office. Let all remember that the Office is not a reception-room to entertain visitors. It is a place where most important business is being transacted in connection with the work and cause of God. The interest of the workmen should not be called off, for if it is, the work will be marred, and time will be stolen, which belongs to the Lord. All should labor to preserve order and quiet in the Office, and maintain the dignity and sacredness of the work. The Office is wading heavily. The world which has come in has shut the Lord out, and his prospering hand is not with the Office as it once was. Something must be done to redeem the past.",
