    "word": "I had been, and still was, bowed down with distress of body and of mind. It seemed to me that I must bear a message to our people at Battle Creek. The words were to be in earnest. \"Speak the words that I shall give thee, to prevent their doing things which would separate God from the publishing house and sacrifice pure and holy principles which must be maintained. The eyes of God were bent upon them in sorrow mingled with severe displeasure, and the words were spoken, \"I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\" Revelation 3:4, 5. There is no time to lose. God speaks. Men are serving the enemy and betraying sacred principles.",
