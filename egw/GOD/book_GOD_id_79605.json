    "word": "For lack of means, the work may at first move slowly, but by God's blessing it will advance. The medical missionary work must be firmly established in Nashville; for this work is the right hand of the gospel. The Nashville Sanitarium need not be a large building, but it should be larger than those established in smaller cities. A building already erected should be secured, if a suitable one can be found in a favorable locality. A well-equipped sanitarium, situated a few miles out of the city of Nashville, will exert great influence for good among the people. Let us ask the Lord to open the way for this work, and to lead us in its advancement. We have a God who hears and answers prayer. In His providence He will work on minds as He has \n                                                                           76\nworked in the past, leading men to favor our people by offering them property at low prices.",
