    "word": "Not One Word to Destroy Hope--This morning I received a letter from you. I would encourage you in the efforts that you are making to press into the light. We pray for you, that you will work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, knowing that it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure. I would not say one word to destroy hope. I know that the enemy will work diligently to dishearten right effort.--Letter 361, 1904, p. 1. (To J. H. Kellogg, August 25, 1904.)",
