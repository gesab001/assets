    "word": "Foot Washing \n     Dear Sister, I have much that I might write you, but have so much to write to different individuals. But I will give you a sketch of the vision I had at our last conference. At our last conference I was shown in vision the backwardness of some in our meetings. Some held back because they had nothing new to say and must repeat the same story. I saw that pride was at the bottom of this. That God and angels witnessed the testimonies that were borne and God was well pleased and glorified by the testimonies of all His humble children. I saw that God and His angels admired simplicity and humility. . . . Washing feet and the Lord's supper should be more frequently practiced among us. Jesus set us the example and told us to do as He had done \n\n\n                                        -23- \n\nto us.--Letter 9, 1853, pp. 1, 2. (To Sister Kellogg, December 5, 1853.) [Written before the quarterly plan was adopted.]",
