    "word": "I feel very grateful for the light God has given me on health reform. In several cases when the adoption of health reform has been carried to extremes, and life has been endangered because of the limited supply of nourishment taken, the Lord has shown to me the course to follow in order to save life. Through his instruction telling me what to do, several lives have been saved, when physicians and nurses were unable to bring relief. \n\n\n                                      -419- \n\nWhen they have come to me for counsel, light has been given in the visions of the night. The prescriptions given were carried out, and the persons were raised up and lived for many years. The lives of some of those who were thus saved have been of a character to bring honor to the name of the Lord.",
