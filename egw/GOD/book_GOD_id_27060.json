    "word": "\u201cBut Satan flatters some, through his chosen servants, as he flattered Eve in Eden, \u2018Thou shalt not surely die;\u2019 and tells them there will be a season for repentance, a time of probation when the filthy can be made pure. The co-workers with Satan and his angels carry the light into the future age, teaching probation after the advent of Christ, which deludes the sinner, and leads the cold-hearted professor to carnal security. They become careless and indifferent, and walk stumblingly over the hours of their probation. The light is made to reach far ahead, where all is total darkness. Michael stands up. Instead of mercy, the deluded sinner feels wrath unmixed with mercy, having awakened \n342\ntoo late to the fatal deception. This plan was studied by Satan, and is carried out by ministers who turn the truth of God into a lie.\u201d",
