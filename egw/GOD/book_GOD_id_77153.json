The blood of souls is upon the members of the church at Battle Creek.

A poison has been circulated through the body, which has come from Battle Creek. Souls have languished right in their midst, and given up the truth, and there has been no one of sufficient strength and godliness to guide their straying feet, or strengthen their feeble faith.",
