    "word": "Nebuchadnezzar did not heed the heaven-sent message. One year after he had been thus warned, as he walked in his palace, he said within himself, \"Is not this great Babylon, that I have built . . .?\" The God of heaven read the heart of the king, and heard its whisperings of self-congratulation. . . . \"There fell a voice from heaven, saying, . . . The kingdom is departed from thee. And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it  to whomsoever he will. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar.\"",
