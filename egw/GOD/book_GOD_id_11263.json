    "word": "To train the young to become true soldiers of the Lord Jesus Christ is the most noble work ever given to man. Only devout and consecrated men and women, who love children and can see in them souls to be saved for the Master, should be chosen as church-school teachers. Teachers who study the word of God as it should be studied will know something of the value of the souls under their care, and from them the children will receive a true Christian education.",
