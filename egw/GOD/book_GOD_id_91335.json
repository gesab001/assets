    "word": "[Colossians 1:14-23, quoted.] \n     We have been taught by God concerning the great plan of redemption. This should be to us a matter of earnest thanksgiving. God's promises will never fail if we constantly watch unto prayer. Having learned the excellent way, we are to be sanctified body, soul, and spirit. We are to be purified and cleansed through the washing of the Word. I am instructed to say that it is the privilege of everyone to be grounded and settled in the faith. No one who exercises that faith which works by love and purifies the soul will be moved away from the hope of the gospel.",
