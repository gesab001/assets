    "word": "The world has accepted a false rest day, and has dishonored the Creator of heaven and earth. The false is reverenced in the place of the true. God's Sabbath is trampled under the feet of men. What excuse can those who do this give for placing the first day of the week where the seventh should be, and for making laws compelling its observance? God's condemnation will rest upon all who have thus disregarded His commands.",
