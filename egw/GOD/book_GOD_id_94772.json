    "word": "Elder Haskell was rooted and grounded in the light given, coming from the Lord's messenger. I had an experience that I must cherish because it came from God, and the evidence was so very strong that the light was given of God. But fanatical ideas came up and were brought in by men claiming to have light from the Lord. The Lord presented to me the position taken by some as unreliable and unsafe, and this brought about truth in contrast with dangerous error. There were those who refused to see the light and chose their own ways and ideas. The light God had given was refused. It revealed that their own characters were unsafe to be trusted. The truth was pointed out in clear, distinct lines in the light given of God. There were men of great self- confidence \n\n\n                                     -225- \n\nwho refused the light God had given, and declared their position to be infallible. Notwithstanding [the fact that] the evidence was sufficient, they refused to receive the light given in the testimonies.",
