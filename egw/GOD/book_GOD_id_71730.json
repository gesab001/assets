    "word": "Let us seek the Lord. . . . Never forget that you are God's little children. Refuse to worry about what you cannot help. If you make mistakes, go to the compassionate Saviour and ask Him for forgiveness. Tell Him that you want to follow His will. Be polite to God. Remember that He cares for you, and that He will be a present help in every time of need. His \"tender mercies are over all his works.\"",
