    "word": "All are to strive for the fragrance of Christ's character; then they can act their part in the world as God designs they shall do. Let us thank God that all characters are to be fashioned not after man's pattern but after the Lord's ideal. Let us allow our fellow workers to grow up in religious experience under the molding and fashioning of the Holy Spirit. Let none feel at liberty to demerit and belittle God's workmanship, the men who do not bear their likeness. \n\n\n                                   -5- \n\nDavid could not wear Saul's armor, and, dropping it, he took the sling and the stone with which he was familiar, and slew the Philistine who defied Israel.",
