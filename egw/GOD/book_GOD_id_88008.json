    "word": "I am filled with sorrow because statements made under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and designed by God to be a great blessing to His people, to guard them against the seducing sentiments of Satan, are woven in with spiritualistic views, and are thus made to testify to falsehoods of Satan's own creating. How can I say to our people, Harmonize with those who advocate these wrong sentiments? How can I hold my peace, and say, Unify? God gives me the message, Beware of the leaven of those who have been destroying the faith of Seventh-day Adventists. There are those to whom I fear to write personally. God says, Beware of the leaven of those who have stepped off the platform of truth. Those who use my writings, given me by God, to build themselves up in sophistry and deceptive theories, steal that which was given to establish souls in the sanctification of the truth, and use it to testify to theories against which I am bidden to warn our people. Beware of the leaven that some who have lost their connection with God will introduce, declaring their theories to be in harmony with that which Sister White has written.",
