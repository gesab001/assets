    "word": "If a man does not show wisdom in the management of the church in his own house, how can he show wisdom in the management of the larger church outside? \n\n\n                                     -450- \n\nHow can he bear the responsibilities which mean so much, if he cannot govern his own children? Wise discrimination is not shown in this matter. God's blessing will not rest upon the minister who neglects the education and training of his children. He has a sacred trust, and he should in no case set before church members a defective example in the management of his home.--Manuscript 104, 1901. (\"The Need of Reform,\" October 8, 1901.)",
