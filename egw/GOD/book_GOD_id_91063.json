    "word": "I do not wish to speak one word to you that will discourage you or bring upon you one pang of anguish. I have a love for your soul, and I desire that you shall bear the banner of truth firmly until the close of this earth's history. But to say that you will do this, I cannot. I am compelled to say to you that you are in danger, and your only safety lies in walking humbly with your God. Be careful what steps you take in expressing your differences with your brethren. You cannot tell how it pains me to see some of our brethren taking a course that I know is not pleasing to God. They are full of jealousy \n\n\n                                   -83- \n\nand evil surmising, and are ever ready to show in just what way they differ with Elder Jones or Waggoner. The same spirit that was manifested in the past manifests itself at every opportunity; but this is not from the impulse of the Spirit of God.",
