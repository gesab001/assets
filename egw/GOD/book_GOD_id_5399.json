    "word": "I told him it was not God's plan to have it thus.  He had done this way and gathered upon himself a mass of burdens he had no strength to carry and he could not do justice to anything.  God had given to every man his work, according to each man's ability, and when one man entertained the idea that he must gather all the responsibilities \n44\nbecause he thought he could do it a little more perfectly than another, he sinned against himself and he sinned against his brethren.  He was educating the people to look to him, to expect everything must come through him, and they were not educated to look to God and to expect God to do great things for them.  They depended upon others and trusted in others rather than in the living God, therefore many have not the experience they ought to have which would make them efficient workers.--Letter 24, 1883, pp. 1, 2 (Aug. 23, 1883, to Willie and Mary White).",
