    "word": "When the poor, suffering paralytic was brought to the Saviour, the urgency of the case seemed to admit of not a moment's delay, for already dissolution was doing its work upon the body. Those who bore him upon his bed, when they saw that they could not come directly into the presence of Christ, at once tore open the roof, and let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay. Our Saviour saw and understood his condition perfectly. He also knew that this wretched man had a sickness of the soul far more aggravating than bodily suffering. He knew the greatest burden he had borne for months was on account of sins. The crowd of people were waiting with almost breathless silence, to see how Christ would treat this case, apparently so hopeless. They were all astonished to hear the words which fell from his lips, \"Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.\" These were the most precious words that could fall upon the ear of that sick sufferer, for the burden of sin had laid so heavily upon him that he could not find the least relief. Christ lifts the burden that so \n                                                                           14\nheavily oppressed him: \"Be of good cheer,\" I, your Saviour, came to forgive sins. How quickly the pallid countenance of the sufferer changes! Hope takes the place of dark despair, and peace and joy take the place of distressing doubt and stolid gloom. The mind being restored to peace and happiness, the suffering body can now be reached. Next comes from the divine lips, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee, arise, and walk.\" Those lifeless, bloodless arms, in the effort to obey the will, were quickened, the healthful current of blood flowed through the veins, the leaden color of his flesh disappeared, and the ruddy glow of health took its place. The limbs, that for long years had refused to obey the will, were now quickened to life, and the healed paralytic grasps his bed, and walks through the crowd to his home, glorifying God.",
