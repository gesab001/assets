    "word": "God never forces the will or the conscience; but Satan's constant resort\u2014to gain control of those whom he cannot otherwise seduce\u2014is compulsion by cruelty. Through fear or force he endeavors to rule the conscience, and to secure homage to himself. To accomplish this, he works through both religious and secular authorities, moving them to the enforcement of human laws in defiance of the law of God.",
