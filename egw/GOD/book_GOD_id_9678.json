    "word": "The Workers Needed [REVIEW AND HERALD, DEC. 30, 1909.] \n\n\n     We should be careful that we connect with all our sanitariums those who will give a right mold to the work. Characters are to be formed here after the divine similitude. It is not the expensive dress that will give us influence, but it is by true Christian humility that we shall exalt our Saviour. Our only hope for success in doing good to the people of the world who come to our sanitariums as guests, is for the workers, each and every one, to maintain a living connection with God. The dress of sanitarium helpers is to be modest and neat, but the dress is not so important as the deportment. The matter of greatest consequence is that the truth be lived out in our lives, that our words be in harmony with the faith we profess to hold. If the workers in our sanitariums will surrender to God, and take a high position as believers in the truth, the Lord will recognize this, and we shall see a great work done in these institutions.",
