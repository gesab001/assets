    "word": "Our only hope is in Christ. If we reject the Star of Light then He will reject us. Had he not made the sacrifice for us then there would have been no hope, and every child of Adam would have been left in bondage of sin. The golden chain that unites earth and heaven is to elevate man and bring him on a higher plane, and thus bring him in connection with the rays of light from heaven. Thus we can be made more precious in the sight of God than the golden wedge of Ophir.",
