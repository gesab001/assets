    "word": "Transformed Through Love \n\n     Truth, set home to the heart by the Spirit of God, will crowd out the love of riches. The love of Jesus and the love of money cannot dwell in the same heart. The love of God so far surpasses the love of money that the possessor breaks away from his riches and transfers his affections to God. Through love he is then led to minister to the wants of the needy and to assist the cause of God. It is his highest pleasure to make a right disposition of his Lord's goods. He holds all that he has as not his own, and faithfully discharges his duty as God's steward. Then he can keep both the great commandments of the law: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\" \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" \n                                                                           158",
