    "word": "\"And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes\" [ Exodus 19:10]. They were commanded to wash their clothes. Sanctification to God admits of no untidiness or uncleanliness of the body or of the clothing. Concerning those who are engaged in the service of God it is written, \"Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them \n\n\n                -181- \n\nthat come nigh Me, and before all the people I will be glorified\" [Leviticus 10:3]. [Exodus 19:11-13, quoted.]",
