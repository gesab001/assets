    "word": "As I consider the past history of our people in Battle Creek, I suffer intense agony of soul. It seems, if I could, that I would roll back the years that have been, and blot them out from their history. Very recent transactions tell us that those who have not yet learned their lesson, who have not had a depth of experience in the things of God, have come forward with their bold words. They are fluent in words but destitute of true understanding. True education would teach them to listen to the words of wisdom, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" Their words have been like a brawling brook; lacking depth, it makes the most noise.",
