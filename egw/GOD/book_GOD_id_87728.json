    "word": "Now brethren, we must lay aside our ways and take God's ways. . . . There is too much of the spirit of \"I am of Paul,\" and \"I am of Apollos.\" There is too much of the feeling that, \"I like such an one better.\" \"I would rather hear this one speak instead of him.\" Now these preferences are all unsanctified. Wherever we go we want to give the impression that we are one. We are working to fit men for immortality and we will study early and late to defend our brethren. Thus the work of God will move in harmony. There is a great deal more of self about us than we think. When God's mold is upon us we can go to the uttermost part of the world and God will be with us. But when men who want their way . . . go, as I have seen them in many places, and set a dead head against you, they may act as though they were on your side, but just let their will be crossed and they are against you. . . . \n\n\n                                    -255-",
