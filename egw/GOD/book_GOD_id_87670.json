    "word": "Sin is not to be perpetuated by practice by the one who is born of God. He must become just what God designed he should be--a free soul in Christ Jesus; not free to continue in sin, but free to practice virtue and holiness. \"Ye are free.\" Therefore use your liberty not to oppress or to speak bitterness, but as the servants of God, as under the rule of Christ.",
