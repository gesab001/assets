Many act as though they had a right to treat their own bodies as they please. They do not realize that God has claims upon them. They are required to glorify Him in their bodies and spirits, which are His. While they give themselves up to the gratification of unhealthy appetites, and thus bring disease upon themselves, they can not render to God acceptable service. None should remain in ignorance of God's claims. All His promises are on conditions of obedience. All should work for themselves. They should do that which God requires them to do, and not leave God to do for them that which He has left for them to do. It is a sacred duty which God has enjoined upon reasonable beings formed in His image, to keep that image in as perfect a state as possible. Those who bring disease upon themselves, by self-gratification, have not healthy bodies and minds. They can not weigh the evidences of truth, and comprehend the requirements of God. Our Saviour will not reach His arm low enough to raise such from their degraded state, while they persist in pursuing a course to sink themselves still lower.",
