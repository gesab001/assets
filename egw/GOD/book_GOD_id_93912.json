    "word": "Those who speak unadvisedly have not learned how to be faithful stewards of the grace of Christ. But whatever the attitude of others, I beseech of you to walk humbly before God, and keep His honor ever before you. If you expect much of men, you will be disappointed. For years many have been educating and training themselves to oppose everything that their own inclination leads them to view in an unfavorable light; and, in thus opposing, they think they are doing God service.",
