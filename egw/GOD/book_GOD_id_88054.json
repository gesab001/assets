    "word": "During the General Conference of 1901 the Lord warned me against sentiments that were then held by Brethren Prescott and Waggoner. These sentiments have been as leaven put into meal. Many minds have received them. The ideas of some regarding a great experience supposed to be sanctification have been the alpha of a train of deception. Because of some overdrawn expressions frequently used by Brother E. J. Waggoner at the conference, [IN HIS MESSAGE DELIVERED AT THE 1901 GENERAL CONFERENCE, ELDER E. J. WAGGONER ADVOCATED SEVERAL CONCEPTS WHICH WERE NOT ENTIRELY IN HARMONY WITH ADVENTIST TEACHINGS. THESE WERE (1) THAT EVERY CHRISTIAN COULD \"GET THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS\" OR SPIRIT OF PROPHECY, (2) THAT SANCTIFICATION INCLUDED BODILY HEALING, AS WELL AS HOLY LIVING, AND (3) THAT THE LIFE OF GOD COMES TO US THROUGH THE AIR AND OTHER NATURAL MEANS. NOTE THE FOLLOWING CITATIONS DRAWN FROM THREE OF HIS SERMONS: EXCERPTS ARE CITED ON PAGE 88 FROM THE 1901 GENERAL CONFERENCE BULLETIN, PP. 78, 79, 149, 222, AND 223.] I was led to speak words intended to counteract their influence.",
