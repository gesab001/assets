    "word": "There must be no idleness, Life is an important matter, a sacred trust; and every moment should be wisely improved, for its results will be seen in eternity. God requires each one to do all the good possible. The talents which he has entrusted to our keeping are to be made the most of. He has placed them in our hands to be used to his name's glory, and in the interests of our fellow men.",
