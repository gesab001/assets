    "word": "The apostles suffered extreme torture because of the painful position in which they were left, but they did not murmur. Instead, in the utter darkness and desolation of the dungeon, they encouraged each other by words of prayer, and sang praises to God because they were found worthy to suffer shame for His sake. . . . With astonishment the other prisoners heard the sound of prayer and singing issuing from the inner prison.\u2014AA 213, 214.",
