    "word": "\"Verily, verily, I say unto you,\" Christ declared, \"He that believeth on me hath everlasting life\" (John 6:47). Oh, how few there are who reveal in their lives the principles of this life! They profess to believe the most sacred truth ever given to mortals, but in their lives they dishonor God. He that \"eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him\" (verses 54-56) . . . It behooves us to live in the fear and love of God. God is supreme, and He cooperates with those who represent Christ in life and character, those who are kind, thoughtful, self-denying, and self-sacrificing. Christ says, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:14) (letter 63, 1903). \n                                                                           302",
