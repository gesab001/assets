    "word": "But if men occupy the time of the heavenly Guest in justifying themselves and finding fault with others, they lose the opportunity to be placed on vantage ground, and they encourage evil angels to abide with them, and to unite with them in warfare against God's people. Earnest pleading with God for the holy fragrance of the character of Christ is of value. But Christ is ashamed of those who exalt self, and bring accusations against others. To those who set themselves up as accusers of their brethren comes this reprimand from God, \"Who art thou that sittest as a judge? Get down from the judgment seat, and on your knees, with humility and contrition, confess your sins.\" If this course of humiliation and confession is followed, the sure result will come. Christ's intercession prevails with God, and at the same time is the almoner of infinite grace.",
