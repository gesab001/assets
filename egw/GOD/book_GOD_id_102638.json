    "word": "The Lord's work in new territories is to be carried forward to a successful accomplishment. In this work God's plan is to be followed, not the inclinations of those who would gather into the section over which they have supervision, every possible advantage, to give, as they say, character to the work, while the utter destitution of other parts of the Lord's vineyard is forgotten. Every work is tested of God. Every selfish thread drawn into it he will cut out.",
