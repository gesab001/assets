    "word": "Never was there a time when the Lord would manifest His great grace unto His chosen ones more fully than in these last days when His law is made void. \"The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the law, and make it honorable.\" What does God say in regard to His people? \"But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.\" (See also Isaiah 43.) These are prophecies that will be fulfilled.",
