Shall we put a great outlay of money into a building which will soon be consumed in the great conflagration? Our money means souls. We must use the Lord's money in various ways to bring a knowledge of the truth to souls, who, because of sin, are under the condemnation of God. Then let us bind about the edges and not in any way be improvident, lest the Lord's treasury become empty and the builders shall not have means to do their appointed work. The strength and joy of our benefiting humanity is not in an expensive building after the world's calculation. No; we must remember how many are starving for necessary food and clothing. If we will walk in the wisdom of this world, we shall divorce our souls from God. We will do our duty and leave the result with God who can give the success.\"",
