    "word": "There has been sadness and suffering in the church. Brother Howard has lost one child and two more have been at the point of death. They were living in an old wooden house which was decaying, and there was a disagreeable smell. The typhoid fever, it is thought, was in consequence of this unhealthful house. The family were taken out and put into the house Brother McGee had hired, and in that house they will escape the difficulties. I feel deep sympathy for Brother Howard. We are praying that the Lord will sustain our brother and that He will give him fresh courage and hope. God will not leave him if he will put his trust in Him.--Ms. 53, 1890, pp. 1-2 (Diary 16, pp. 410-411).",
