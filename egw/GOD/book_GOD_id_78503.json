    "word": "The apostle gives us the true definition of sin. \"Sin is the transgression of the law.\" The largest class of Christ's professed ambassadors are blind guides. They lead the people away from the path of safety by representing the requirements and prohibitions of the ancient law of Jehovah as arbitrary and severe. They give the sinner license to overstep the limits of God's law. In this they are like the great adversary of souls, opening before them a life of freedom in violation \n                                                                           77\nof God's commandments. With this lawless freedom the basis of moral responsibility is gone.",
