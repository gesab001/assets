    "word": "When Visitors Interrupt.--You should take time to talk and pray with your little ones, and you should allow nothing to interrupt that season of communion with God and with your children. You can say to your visitors, \"God has given me a work to do, and I have no time for gossiping.\" You should feel that you have a work to do \n                                                                           267\nfor time and for eternity. You owe your first duty to your children.",
