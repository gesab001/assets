    "word": "Letter C\n     Hanover Road \n     Victoria Park \n     Adelaide, S.A. \n     Nov. 7, 1892 \n\nDear Brother and Sister _____: \n     ...Sunday I visited Brother_____'s family. His wife once belonged to the church but she read what Elder Canright wrote about me and became disaffected and left the church. If she had received the watchful care of a faithful shepherd she would have been saved to the cause of God. I spent two hours with this brother and sister and talked to them and prayed with them. She was bathed in tears all the time I was talking. Oh how sorry I felt for this poor sheep who strayed from the fold and was left to perish because no shepherd's tender sympathy and loving care was exercised to bring her back to the fold! Our only hope is that the Lord will in His wisdom clear the doubts and fog from the mind of this sister.",
