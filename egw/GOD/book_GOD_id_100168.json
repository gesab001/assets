    "word": "Those who have educated themselves in skepticism and cherished unbelief, weaving questions and doubts into their experience, when under conviction of the Spirit of God they see it to be their personal duty to confess their unbelief and open their hearts to accept of the light sent them, stepping by faith over the line from wrong to right, from doubt to faith, and consecrate \n                                                                           671\nthemselves unreservedly to God, to follow His light in the place of the sparks of their own kindling. As they maintain their consecration they will see increased light, and the light will continue to grow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. The unbelief which is cherished in the soul has a bewitching power; the seed which it has been sowing will produce its harvest. But they must continue to dig up every root of unbelief, and these poisonous plants will cease to grow for want of nourishment in word and action, and the soul must have the precious plants of faith and love put in the soil of the heart and cultivated and cherished there.",
