    "word": "\"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?\" (verse 4). Their contentions did not reveal growth in grace, but a narrow, limited comprehension, a defective experience. \"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one\" (verses 5-8). He who is a partaker of the divine nature will not seek to stand at the head of a party. True workers for God will not attract men to themselves, but to Christ. They will preach the truth which makes all men one in Christ Jesus.",
