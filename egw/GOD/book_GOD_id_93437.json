    "word": "The erring ones who have their sins laid open before them--many of them, not all, thank God--will feel that they are misjudged. They will vindicate their own course, justifying themselves, and will become alienated from those who, in the fear of God, tried to do the very work the Lord had given them to do; namely, to reprove, to rebuke, to exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. The reproved ones, who do not humble their hearts before God, will not confess their sins, which are not all specified, but will cover them up and make light of their errors and grievous transgressions, which have been a stumbling block to saints and sinners, and have corrupted souls.",
