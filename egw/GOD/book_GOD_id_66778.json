    "word": "Those who labor with their hands, those who labor in word and doctrine, must have a care to sustain their physical powers; for Satan and his evil angels are warring against them, seeking to undermine their strength. When they can, they should take rest both in body and mind, and should eat of nourishing food; for they will be obliged to use all the power they have. I saw that it does not glorify God in the least for any of His people to make a time of trouble for themselves. There is a time of trouble just before us, but He will prepare us for that fearful conflict.",
