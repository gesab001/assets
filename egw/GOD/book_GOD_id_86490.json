    "word": "\"I never felt more sensibly the especial help from God. . . . \n     The hall was full. There were nearly as many outsiders as \n     believers. I never saw so many out before. Some came and looked at \n     first a little amused as if it was sport to hear a woman speak, and \n     as if they were to hear some rabble that would be amusing to them, \n     but they soon wore very serious faces and many shed tears. Most I \n     had never seen in the hall before. I do not speak smooth things to \n     the people.\"--Letter 18, 1876.",
