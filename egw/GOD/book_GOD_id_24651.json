    "word": "In the gracious blessings which our heavenly Father has bestowed upon us we may discern innumerable evidences of a love that is infinite, and a tender pity surpassing a mother's yearning sympathy for her wayward child. When we study the divine character in the light of the cross we see mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness blended with equity and justice. In the language of John we exclaim: \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God\" (1 John 3:1).",
