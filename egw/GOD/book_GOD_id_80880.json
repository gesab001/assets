    "word": "Bro. Aldrich, you are decidedly a worldly, business man. The life of Christ's followers is a warfare upon earth, and their daily business is to watch and pray always, lest they enter into temptation. God united you to his work, and designed that you should walk in the light as he is in the light. Satan is constantly watching those who are especially connected with the cause and work of God. He knows that he will gain a decided victory if he secures the least advantage over such. Your love of approbation is great. You love office, love promotion, love to be engaged in a large enterprise, which makes considerable show. You love to be considered a man of business, a \n                                                                           5\nmanager; and you have not maintained humility, but have got above the simplicity of the work. It is heart work that is needed. God designed you to become a spiritual worker. It should be your anxiety to possess true godliness, to be a pattern of good works. You fail in many respects. You shun the burden of reproving wrong and seeking to have these wrongs corrected and make right. Some have received the impression that you were a man of such fine feelings, possessing so sensitive an organism, that it would be exceedingly painful for you to do this. They do not rightly estimate you, but give you credit for excelling in those qualities in which you are deficient. Did you really possess these traits of character, you would manifest an interest for the very ones who need your sympathy. Your feelings would be enlisted for the widows, the orphans, and fatherless. Your heart would be drawn out in this direction. You would not need your sympathy called out in behalf of this class; for you could not be hindered from making their case your own.",
