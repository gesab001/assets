    "word": "Chap. 48 - The Divine Standard\n[THIS\nARTICLE APPEARED IN THE SIGNS OF\nTHE TIMES, DEC. 5, 1892.]\n\n     The commandments of God are comprehensive and far reaching; in a few words they unfold the whole duty of man. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. . . . Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\" (Mark 12:30, 31). In these words the length and breadth, the depth and height, of the law of God is comprehended; for Paul declares, \"Love is the fulfilling of the law\" (Romans 13:10). The only definition we find in the Bible for sin is that \"sin is the transgression of the law\" (1 John 3:4). The Word of God declares, \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). \"There is none that doeth good, no, not one\" (Romans 3:12). Many are deceived concerning the condition of their hearts. They do not realize that the natural heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. They wrap themselves about with their own righteousness, and are satisfied in reaching their own human standard of character; but how fatally they fail when they do not reach the divine standard, and of themselves they cannot meet the requirements of God. \n                                                                           321",
