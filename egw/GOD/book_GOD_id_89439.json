    "word": "MR No. 973 - Need for Unity Among Spiritual Shepherds\n\n     A vision the Lord gave me at Sutton, Vermont, September, 1850. I saw the loveliness of Jesus and the love that the angels have for one another. Said the angel, Can ye not behold their love? Follow it. Just so God's people must love one another. Rather let blame fall on thyself than on a brother. I was then pointed back to western New York and saw that Brother Bates did not give the message.--\"Sell that ye have and give alms\"--in its clear light. It caused some to follow for the loaves and fishes, and now they are ready to be purged out. Falsehoods have been in their mouths. I saw that Brother Bates's holding up \"sell that ye have\" in a wrong light had caused those who had been coveting others' property to take lenity from it and to rejoice and triumph, and had also caused those who had property to hold on to it. Those who had been coveting were zealous to attend conference \n\n\n                                      -247- \n\nwith their families, not to glorify God but for the loaves and the fishes. They had better have remained at home and worked with their hands to supply the wants of their families and to have something to give to sustain the cause of truth.",
