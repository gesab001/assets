    "word": "My son, do not become discouraged. Look to Jesus, and trust in Him. Keep the eye single to the glory of God. Hide self in God. Do not, I beseech of you, participate in this mania for illustrations. If you will depend upon God and walk humbly before Him, He will be your helper and your God. The Holy Spirit is freely bestowed upon every soul who will exercise faith in God. Edson and Emma, you are very precious to me, but you are even more precious to the One who gave His life for you. \"Walk before God, and be ye perfect\" [See Genesis 17:1].",
