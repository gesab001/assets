    "word": "Sometimes various ways and purposes, different modes of operation in connection with the work of God, are about evenly balanced in the mind; and it is at this very point that the nicest discrimination is necessary.  And if anything is accomplished to the purpose, it must be done at the golden moment.  The slightest inclination of the weight in the balance should be seen, and should determine the matter at once.  Long delays tire the angels.--Gospel Workers, pp. 133, 134.",
