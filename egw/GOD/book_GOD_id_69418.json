    "word": "But forgiveness has a broader meaning than many suppose. When God gives the promise that He \"will abundantly pardon,\" He adds, as if the meaning of that promise exceeded all that we could comprehend: \"My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.\" Isaiah 55:7-9. God's forgiveness is not merely a judicial act by which He sets us free from condemnation. It is not only forgiveness for sin, but reclaiming from sin. It is the outflow of redeeming love that transforms the heart. David had the true conception of forgiveness when he prayed, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\" Psalm 51:10. And again he says, \"As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.\" Psalm 103:12.",
