    "word": "Now do write and tell me if there is anything in your place that prevents your rising. God wants His people to rise and get the victory over the powers of darkness.

Let us not rest unless we know that our lives are hid with Christ in God. We must have daily the full assurance that we are accepted of Him. If we have [this], all is well. We then can come to the throne of grace with holy boldness and draw strength and glory from the sanctuary and be triumphant in God. I do long for the mind that was in Christ. Day after day I discover my unlikeness to the meek and lowly Jesus. I want His fashioning hand to be laid upon me, for I would reflect the lovely image of Jesus.",
