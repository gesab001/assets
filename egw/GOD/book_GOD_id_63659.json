    "word": "The Only Safe Course \n\n     Those who bear responsibilities in our institutions should daily seek the way of the Lord. They should not feel qualified to choose their own way, for in so doing they will walk in the light of the sparks of their own kindling. God alone is to be their guide. Those who seek a wider sphere, those who would have greater freedom than God appoints, those who fail to make Him their counselor, their wisdom, their sanctification, and their righteousness, will never win the crown of life. Day by day the soul needs the religion of Christ. Those who drink deeply of His Spirit will not be ambitious for themselves. They \n                                                                           141\nwill realize that they cannot go beyond the domain of God, for God reigns everywhere.",
