When we study this question in the fear of God we shall learn that it is best, for both our physical and our spiritual advancement, to observe simplicity in diet.  Let us patiently study this question.  We need knowledge and judgment in order to move wisely in this matter.  Nature's laws are not to be resisted, but obeyed.",
