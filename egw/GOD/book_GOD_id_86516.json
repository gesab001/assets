    "word": "The workers standing at the head of our sanitariums should be prepared to give needed spiritual help to the patients who come to the institution, that these souls may be converted from error to an understanding of the word of God as it is revealed for this time. They are to do faithful service for God, receiving from Him a sense of their sacred responsibilities. By prayer and earnest effort they are to be workers together with God for the conversion of souls. By the exercise of faith in God, they are to draw from the source of all power the ability to do the will of God in genuine missionary work. The blessing of the Lord will come in rich measure to the patients through the medium of the sanitarium when the workers in the institution realize their responsibility and act like converted men. The word of the Lord, if received and believed, will be accepted as yea and amen by every earnest seeker.",
