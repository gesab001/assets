    "word": "Let Us Fall Into the Hand of God. \n\n     When David was bidden to choose the punishment for his sin, he said, \"Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.\" He felt that God knew the struggle and anguish of the soul. When one is enabled to catch a glimpse of the character of God, he sees not in him the heartless, vindictive spirit manifested by human agents; he sees that affliction and trial are God's appointed means of disciplining his children, and teaching them his way, that they may lay hold of his grace. \"Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.\" As the poor backsliding one is led to the river of God's love, he exclaims, When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold purified. The suffering soul is made patient, trustful, triumphant in God under adverse circumstances.",
