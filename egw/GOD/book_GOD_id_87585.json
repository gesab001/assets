    "word": "Counsel from One of Authority \n     \"Your work is not the management of financial matters. It is not wise for you to undertake this. God has burdens for you to bear, but if you carry lines of work for which you are not adapted, your efforts in presenting the Word will prove unsuccessful. This will bring upon you discouragement that will disqualify you for the very work you should do--a work requiring careful discrimination and sound, unselfish judgment.\"",
