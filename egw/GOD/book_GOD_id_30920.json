    "word": "Assert Your Liberty \n\n     Make it the law of your life from which no temptation or side interest shall cause you to turn, to honor God, because He \"so loved the world, that He gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" As a redeemed, free moral agent, ransomed by an infinite price, God calls upon you to assert your liberty, and employ your God-given powers as a free subject of the kingdom of heaven. Be no longer under the thralldom of sin, but as a loyal subject to the King of kings, prove your loyalty to God. \n                                                                           30",
