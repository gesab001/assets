    "word": "Many are changed by every current. They wait to hear what someone else thinks, and his opinion is accepted as altogether true.

Their natural inclination is to allow another to be conscience for them; and they speak after he has spoken, saying what he says, and acting as he acts. When these persons are placed in circumstances where they must think and act for themselves, they dare not express any decided opinion. Yet often, like Aaron, they have much ability. God pity such weaklings. . . .",
