    "word": "The Hebrew captives had told Nebuchadnezzar of Christ, the Redeemer that was to come, and from the description thus given the king recognized the form of the fourth in the fiery furnace as the Son of God. Hastening to the furnace, Nebuchadnezzar cried, \u201cYe servants of the most high God, come forth.\u201d And they obeyed, before that vast multitude showing themselves unhurt, not even the smell of fire being on their garments.
