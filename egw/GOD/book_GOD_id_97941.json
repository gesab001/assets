    "word": "Chap. 15 - The Leaven of Truth\n\nManuscript 82,1898\n\n     The kingdom of heaven can be felt, but not seen. The inward working of the Spirit of God is compared to leaven. Said Christ, \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened\" [Matthew 13:33]. And again, \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven\" [Matthew 18:3].",
