    "word": "Let all students seek to take as broad a view as possible of their obligations to God. They are not to look forward to a time after the school term closes, when they will do some large, noted work. But they are to study earnestly how they can commence practicing working their student life by yoking up with Christ. Let every impulse be on the Lord's side. Do not pull down or discourage those who are your teachers. Do not burden their souls by manifesting a spirit of levity and a careless disregard for rules.",
