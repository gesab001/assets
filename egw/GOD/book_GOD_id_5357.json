    "word": "The man who because he is president of a conference dares to take the responsibility of telling his fellow-workers what their duty is, is working out a wrong experience.  The influence will be to destroy the God-given personality of men, and place them under human jurisdiction.  Such management is laying a foundation for unbelief.  The men who instruct their fellowmen to look to men for guidance, are really teaching them that when they go to the Lord for counsel and the direction of His Spirit regarding their duty, they must not follow that counsel without first going to certain men to know if this is what they must do.  Thus a species of slavery is developed that will bring only weakness and inefficiency to the church of God.",
