    "word": "Let an abiding Christ live in the soul, and we shall show far greater wisdom than we have done. We shall know more of God and of Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit which opens the door for us to advance. We need to manifest the Spirit of Christ. If we have not received all we should have had, shall we now say, \"Pay me that thou owest?\" It is the Lord's, and we will say, \"Return to God his own. As for me, I dare not now receive that which I might have had.\" Say, \"Take these means, which we ought to have received, and let them be used in helping in \n\n\n                      -20- \n\nforeign missionary work.\" The great doors of necessity stand wide open. I call upon each and all to appropriate all that you feel clear to restore to the great work which is in need of being done in our world. I would not receive an additional penny on any back royalties, and I ask my brethren and sisters to stand with me, and heal this wound by transferring the extra royalties they think they might have had to work in God in the place where the need is greatest. We are to make every effort to keep our principles of management correct. Let Jesus be seen, walking on the tempestuous billows, and saying, \"Peace, be still.\" \"It is I, be not afraid.\"",
