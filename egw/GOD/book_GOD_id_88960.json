    "word": "Dr. Kellogg, as you have dealt with others, so God will deal with you unless you repent and change your course of action. He cannot serve with injustice. There is not a vestige of justice in the position you so firmly maintained. Your wit and sarcasm were inspired by a spirit from beneath. Where you should have shown benevolence, kindness, love, and tenderness, as a representative man, you manifested traits exactly the opposite of these. I cannot find words to describe the way in which God regards such a course. --Letter 177, 1900, pp. 1,2,6,7. (To J. H. Kellogg, Jan. 21, 1900.)",
