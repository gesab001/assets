    "word": "I wished them to review the past and see if in one instance Edith had led their minds and affections heavenward, if they could think of any time she had talked of Jesus and heaven and the truth. I told them she had led their minds away from the truth, away from devotion of God, to human worship. They had an admiration society, seeking to be loved, praised, petted, and this had separated their affection from God so that not one of those who were so sympathetic, so loving, so devoted to Edith, was learning to wear Christ's yoke or to carry His burdens. They were backsliding from God, and in the place of giving Him the heart's best and loveliest affections they were placing confidence and love upon an earthly, erring creature. They did not love Edith because she was devotional, because she lived so near to Jesus, but because they thought her perfection. She pleased them but she did not please Jesus or really love Jesus. I talked to them very plainly and shall not see these young people deceived. I shall talk with Edwin and John Vuilleumier.",
