    "word": "Those who engage in this work should be consecrated to God, and not only have the object before them to treat the body merely to cure disease, thus working from the popular physician's standpoint, but be spiritual fathers, to administer to minds diseased, and point the sin-sick soul to the never-failing remedy, the Saviour who died for them. \n                                                                           13\nThose who are reduced by disease are sufferers in more than one sense. They can endure bodily pain far better than they can bear mental suffering. Many bear a violated conscience, and can be reached only by the principles of Bible religion.",
