    "word": "This is the guile that Paul used; this is the wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove. When we come to a community acquainted with our faith, this cautious course need not be pursued, but in every case special efforts should be made to come close to hearts by personal labor. Avoid running down the churches. Do not let the people receive the idea that your work is to tear down; it is to build up, and to present the truth as it is in Jesus. Dwell much upon the necessity of vital godliness.",
