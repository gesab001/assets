    "word": "MR No. 1513 - Accept God's Plans; Be Humble; Trust Fellow Workers\n\n     (Written June 30, 1902, from \"Elmshaven,\" Sanitarium, California, to E.J. Waggoner.) \n\n\n     I have read a copy of your letter to Professor Prescott in regard to connecting with the school at Berrien Springs as Bible teacher. I cannot approve; in all respects, of the proposition that you have made. I think that the terms upon which you consent to accept the invitation settle the matter. It is evident to me that these propositions are not prompted by the Holy Spirit. It is evident that you do not fully understand your own spirit nor the situation at Berrien Springs. Other letters have come to me showing plainly that some are placing a low estimate on the work of Brother Sutherland and his associates at Berrien Springs.",
