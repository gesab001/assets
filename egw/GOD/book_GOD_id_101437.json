    "word": "The working of matters in Battle Creek is in some things out of God's order, and if left to continue, will result in making all things spotted, stained, and unacceptable to God. The Lord said to Adam, If you eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, you bring death and woe into the world. If you are obedient to my word, you will be happy and live forever. If you disobey, you will die. God did not originate sin, but he permitted it. According to the beneficence of his own nature he made man as a free moral agent, to set forth the wisdom, the love and the holiness of God, and the justice of all his doings. God proposed to take man into partnership with himself. But if, like the inhabitants of the antediluvian world, men follow their own imagination and devising, as capable of all wisdom, they will receive the result, as did the king of Babylon. They have reckoned without God, and will reap the consequences of their folly. To place in positions of responsibility men who are of a masterly, arbitrary disposition, is always wrong; for their management brings the sure result.",
