    "word": "Chap. 29 - Dependence and Independence\n\n\n          (A) Dependence Upon God, Not Man \n\n     Dependence Upon God Is Absolute.--God would have every soul for whom Christ has died become a part of the vine, connected with the parent stock, drawing nourishment from it. Our dependence on God is absolute and should keep us very humble; and because of our dependence on Him, our knowledge of Him should be greatly increased. God would have us put away every species of selfishness and come to Him, not as the owner of ourselves, but as the Lord's purchased possession.--SpT Series A, No. 8, pp 8, 9, 1897. (TM 324, 325.)",
