    "word": "Ask our brethren in England who are brought together in church capacity, What are you doing for your neighbors? What are you doing for your friends and relations? You need to be in earnest communion with God. Every one should exercise self-denial to save something to invest in the work of saving souls. Oh, if all could see the shortness of time and the vigilant working of the relentless foe to secure all souls possible to himself, how earnestly and whole-heartedly would each one labor. They would feel an intensity of desire to win souls to Christ.",
