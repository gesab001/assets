    "word": "We have just closed an institute for Bible workers, which lasted a month. The attendance from the outside has been good, and the people are charmed with the truths they hear. They are starving for the bread of life, and they must be instructed and guided. We have strong hopes that those who are interested will receive the word of God and be renewed by His Spirit. If they could be planted in the faith, if they could become rooted and grounded in the truth, they would be temples for the Holy Spirit of God.",
