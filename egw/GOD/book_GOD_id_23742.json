    "word": "Chapter 18 -- Heaven Can Begin Now\n\nHEAVEN IN HEART AND HOME.\u2014[Our Saviour] wants us to trust in Him, believing His words so fully that we shall bring heaven into our lives here below. We can make heaven in heart and home as we pass along if our lives are hid with Christ in God. Thus we can bring joy and comfort into the lives of others. Christ\u2019s joy will remain in us, and our joy will be full.\u2014Ms 28, 1901 quoted in 2SAT 147.",
