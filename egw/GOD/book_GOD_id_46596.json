    "word": "13, 14 (1 Kings 11:4-8). Memorials of Apostasy.--Goodness alone is true greatness. Everyone will transmit a heritage of good or of evil. On the southern eminence of the Mount of Olives were the memorial stones of Solomon's apostasy. Huge idols, unshapely blocks of wood and stone, appeared above the groves of myrtle and olive. Josiah, the youthful reformer, in his religious zeal destroyed these images of Ashtoreth and Chemosh and Moloch, but the broken fragments and masses of ruins remained opposite Mount Moriah, where stood the temple of God. As strangers in after generations asked, \"What mean these ruins confronting the temple of the Lord?\" they were answered, \"There is Solomon's Mount of Offense, where he built altars for idol worship to please his heathen wives\" (Letter 8b, 1891).",
