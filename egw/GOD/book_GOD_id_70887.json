    "word": "The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah\n     Two of the heavenly messengers departed, leaving Abraham alone with Him whom he now knew to be the Son of God. . . . With deep reverence and humility he urged his plea: \u201cI have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.\u201d . . . He came close to the heavenly messenger, and fervently urged his petition. Though Lot had become a dweller in Sodom, he did not partake in the iniquity of its inhabitants. Abraham thought that in that populous city there must be other worshipers of the true God. And in view of this he pleaded, \u201cThat be far from thee, to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked; . . . that be far from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\u201d Abraham asked not once merely, but many times. Waxing bolder as his requests were granted, he continued until he gained the assurance that if even ten righteous persons could be found in it, the city would be spared.\u2014PP 139, 140.",
