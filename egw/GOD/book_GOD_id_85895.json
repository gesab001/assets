    "word": "Let not that class of work come into the office which is of a character to sow seeds of doubt in reference to the truth. All who touch this work are working on the side of the enemy of God, making of none effect the commandments of God by their traditions, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Better cut out all this kind of education, and take hold of that kind of literature which will strengthen the faith of those who already know the truth, and carry conviction to the hearts of those who have not as yet a knowledge of the truth. But let it never be said that the press is doing a work which is against the truth which should go everywhere speaking in positive tones. How much will this busy activity do for the office? Our work is to advance the truth. As we do this we should keep in touch with the world, that the truth may be as a light set on a candlestick to give light to all that are in the house.--Ms 43, 1900, p. 7.
