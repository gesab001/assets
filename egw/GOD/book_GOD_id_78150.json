    "word": "\"And when I violate the laws God has established in my being, I am to repent and reform, and place myself in the most favorable condition under the doctors God has provided, --pure air, pure water, and the healing, precious sunlight.

A cup of tea made from catnip herb will quiet the nerves.",
