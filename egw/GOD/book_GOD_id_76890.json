    "word": "Our lack of self-denial, our refusal to see the necessities of the cause for this time, and to respond to them, call for repentance and humiliation before God. It is a sin for one who knows the truth of God to fold his hands and leave his work for another to do. The gospel of Christ calls for entire consecration. Let our church-members now arise to their responsibilities and privileges. Let them spend less on self-indulgence and needless adorning. The money thus expended is the Lord's, and is needed to do a sacred work in His cause. Educate the children to do missionary work, and to bring their offerings to God. Let us awake to the spiritual character of the work in which we are engaged. This is no time for weakness to be woven into our experience.",
