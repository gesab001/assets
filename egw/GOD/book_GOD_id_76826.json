    "word": "Wherever there is life in the subjects of God's kingdom, there will be increase and growth; there is a constant interchange, taking and giving out, receiving and returning to the Lord his own. God works with every true believer, and the light and blessing received is given out again in the work \n                                                                           5\nwhich the believer does. As he thus gives of that which he has received, his capacity for receiving is increased. As he imparts of the heavenly gifts, he makes room for fresh currents of grace and truth to flow into the soul from the living fountain. Greater light, increased knowledge and blessing, are his. In this work, which devolves upon every church member, is the life and growth of the church. He whose life consists in ever receiving and never giving, soon loses the blessing. If truth does not flow forth from him to others, he loses his capacity to receive. We must impart the goods of heaven if we would have fresh blessings.",
