    "word": "All that was communicated to Him by His Father, Christ makes known to His followers. \"Henceforth I call you not servants;\" He says, \"for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you\" (John 15:15). How was this done? By words merely? No; by character; by the daily life. It was thus that Christ represented His Father. My brethren and sisters, let us make it known that we are branches of the living vine in that we represent the character of Christ. By a life of fruitbearing we are to make known the truth of the Word. You may profess a religion that is as high as the heavens; but unless you do the commandments of God, you are certainly not recommending the love of Christ to the world.",
