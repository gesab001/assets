    "word": "Those who are set to keep the rooms in a healthful condition, that the angel of God passing through may approve, must be sincere. There must be no haphazard work. Carry the Spirit of Christ in all your dealings. I would not, under any consideration, send a child of mine to learn the printer's trade under the present discipline and management of the several rooms. All are not managed in exactly the same objectionable manner; but all are much in need of the sanctifying grace of Jesus Christ. Are the men set over others, wise counsellors of youth? Are they sincere Christians, or make-believers? Is their submission to divine authority as perfect as that they require of the youth who are being educated under them? Overbearing, harsh words are unprofitable in professors of religion. A harsh, tyrannical spirit has come in, resulting in great and various evils. The temptations to sin come to every youth; and the overseers in every room need to be thoroughly converted men. What are the attributes most prized, and which bring greatest joy to the Saviour who died to save sinners? It is to have men and women cooperating with him to seek and to save the lost. Everyone who is self-denying, self-sacrificing, for the sake of helping poor souls that need help, will have his reward. If we are children of God, we should be, and will be, living channels of light.",
