Unity in the home, unity in the church reveals Christ's manner and grace more than sermons and arguments. The servants of God must not strive, but in meekness instruct those who oppose themselves against the truth that they may see the errors of their ways and be converted. But let your light shine in good works; in careful, patient, brotherly words speak to those with whom you associate in good works.",
