    "word": "The Lord has permitted Brethren G and W to take hold of the truth, and the truth has been carrying on its purifying process in the heart. It has affected the life, and unbelievers are looking on and are surprised with the change they see. The heavenly treasure has been increasing in value to them, and the earthly decreasing and losing its attraction. These brethren are often strongly beset by the enemy, and have a hard warfare to get their possessions upon the altar. Satan and his evil angels are holding the possessions of earth in an attractive light that they may love them and idolize them. Satan and his angels would rejoice at their downfall, but angels of God are watching over them, bearing them up, that they may be an example to others that it is possible for the love of riches to be overcome, and the love of truth [to] predominate.",
