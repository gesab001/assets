    "word": "Partakers of the Divine Nature.--It is our privilege to be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. God has plainly stated that He requires us to be perfect; and because He requires this, He has made provision that we may be partakers of the divine nature. Only thus can we gain success in our striving for eternal life. The power is given by Christ. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God\" (John 1:12).",
