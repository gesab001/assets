    "word": "The practical lesson we are all to learn in genuine Bible religion is that we are to be of one mind and one judgment, that the law of God is a law of love to God and to man. Even disappointment and suffering is made unto us a means of sanctification. It elevates and purifies the soul, helping us to work out the will of God.--Letter 54, 1901, p. 2 (To \"My Dear Son Edson White,\" June, 1901.)",
