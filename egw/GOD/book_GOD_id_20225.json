    "word": "We should not become loose and dilatory in our habits while we are engaged in God's work. All should be prompt, wide-awake business men in his cause. The Lord is not pleased with the present lack of order and accuracy among those who do business in connection with his work. Even in the business meetings of the Conference much time could be saved, and many mistakes avoided, by a little more study and punctuality. Everything that bears any relation to the work of God should be as near perfect as human brains and hands can make it. \u2014 MS.",
