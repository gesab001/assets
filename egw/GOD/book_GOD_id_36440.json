    "word": "More effective measures are needed to check the premeditated sin, but the apostle directs the treatment to be given to those who are overtaken or surprised or overcome by temptation.... Restore him in  meekness, \"considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\" Faith and reproofs will be needed, and kindly counsel and supplications to God, to bring them to see their danger and sin. The original word is, set in joint, as a dislocated bone; therefore the efforts should be made to set them in joint, and bring them to themselves by convincing them of their sin and error. . . . There should be no triumphing in a brother's fall. But in meekness, in the fear of God, in love for their soul's sake, seek to save them from sin.",
