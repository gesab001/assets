In some characters a prejudice is so strengthened by the first resistance of the truth that they take false positions, and hold to them, notwithstanding the most positive evidence from the word. With many there is an apparent desire to be much in prayer with God, and yet when the word comes from the Lord, they are startled into resistance, and they exclaim against it and the messenger as did the Jews, saying, \"He is tearing away the very pillars of our faith.\" In their blindness they do not comprehend what constitute the pillars of faith.",
