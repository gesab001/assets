    "word": "But Jesus alone is my dependence. In Him I trust. He loveth even me. He is at this moment standing at the altar of incense presenting before the Father my prayers, my heart-longing desires for His grace, His heavenly endowment, that I may through the grace given unto me reveal to others His great love and complete efficiency. I grasp the promises of Him who hath given His life for the world that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have eternal life. \"Then who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.\" Romans 8:34. This we can plead. This is an argument Satan cannot overcome. Then we will, in His name and through His grace, sanctify ourselves--soul and body and spirit--that our words and our works shall be wrought in God, and that we may have an influence over others that will win them to Jesus Christ.",
