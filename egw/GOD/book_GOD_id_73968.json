    "word": "\"The words that I speak unto you,\" said Christ, \"they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:63). Jeremiah testifies to the Word of God, saying, \"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.\" There is divine healing in God's Word, which the so-called wise and prudent cannot experience, but which is revealed to babes. \"The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple\" (Psalm 119:130). If this Word is enshrined in the heart, it becomes the treasure-house of the mind, from which we bring forth things new and old. We no longer find pleasure in thinking of the common things of earth, but say, \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path\" (verse 105).--Review and Herald, May 4, 1897.",
