    "word": "The natural habits need to be cleansed away; the precious must be separated from the vile. As Christians we must speak as Christ would have us speak. We may long to see reforms, but because we do not see that which we desire, an evil spirit casts drops of gall into our cup, and then others are poisoned. By our ill-advised words, their spirit is chafed, they are stirred up to rebellion. Eternal principles of truth, when advocated by pen or voice, need the holy oil emptied from the two olive branches into our hearts. This will flow forth in words that will reform but not exasperate. God will work with your spirit if you will cooperate with Him. It should be the purpose of our lives to render unto God the highest service.",
