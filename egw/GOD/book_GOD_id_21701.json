    "word": "At the opening of the seventeenth century the monarch who had just ascended the throne of England declared his determination to make the Puritans \u201cconform, or harry them out of the land, or else worse.\u201d Hunted, persecuted, and imprisoned, they could discern in the future no promise of better days, and many yielded to the conviction that for such as would serve God according to the dictates of their conscience, \u201cEngland had ceased forever to be a habitable spot.\u201d Some at last determined to seek refuge in Holland. Difficulties, losses, and imprisonment were encountered. Their purposes were thwarted, and they were betrayed into the hands of their enemies. But steadfast perseverance finally conquered, and they found shelter on the friendly shores of the Dutch Republic.",
