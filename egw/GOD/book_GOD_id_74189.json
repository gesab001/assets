    "word": "Christians are to be indeed the representatives of Jesus Christ; they are not to be pretenders. Shall the world form its conceptions of God by the course of those who only take the name of Christ, and do not His works? Shall they point to those who claim to be believers, but who are not believers at heart, who betray sacred trusts, and work the works of the enemy, and say, \"Oh, these are Christians, and they will cheat and lie, and they cannot be trusted\"? These are not the ones who truly represent God.",
