    "word": "The ministering angels are watching every line of the work. They are beholding either your unity and order, or your disunion and disorder. They feel very sad when they have to carry to heaven, as they have had to do in the past, a report that there is dissension, that criticism is studied as a fine art, that you weigh your brethren and neighbors in your finite scales, and pass your opinion upon them, treating them as though they were not God's purchased possession.",
