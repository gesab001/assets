    "word": "16 (1 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21; see EGW on John 17:17). Beyond Finite Comprehension.--There are some that may think they are fully capable with their finite judgment to take the Word of God, and to state what are the words of inspiration, and what are not the words of inspiration. I want to warn you off that ground, my brethren in the ministry. \"Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\" There is no finite man that lives, I care not who he is or whatever is his position, that God has authorized to pick and choose in His Word.",
