    "word": "How God Proves His Stewards \n\n     How inclined is man to set his affections on earthly things! His attention is absorbed in houses and lands, and his duty to his fellow man is neglected; his own salvation is treated as a matter of little consequence, and the claims of God upon him are forgotten. Men grasp the treasures of earth as tenaciously as if they could hold on to them forever. They seem to think that they have a right to do with their means just as it pleases them, no matter what the Lord has commanded, or what may be the need of their fellow men.",
