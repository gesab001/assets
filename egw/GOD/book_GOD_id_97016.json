    "word": "Brethren, do not let any of you be thrown off the track. \"Well,\" you say, \" What does Brother Smith's piece in the Review mean?\" He doesn't know what he is talking about; he sees trees as men walking. Everything depends upon our being obedient to God's commandments. Therefore he takes those that have been placed in false settings and he binds them in a bundle as though we were discarding the claims of God's law, when it is no such thing. It is impossible for us to exalt the law of Jehovah unless we take hold of the righteousness of Jesus Christ.",
