    "word": "Study the history of Nineveh. God sent a special message by Jonah to that wicked city. \"Arise,\" He bade Jonah, \"go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.\" Jonah was to \"cry against\" the city, but he was averse to bearing any such message. Instead of obeying, he \"rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord\" (Jonah 1:2, 3). Read the history.",
