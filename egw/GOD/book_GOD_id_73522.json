    "word": "Gem Thought \n\n     There is a work to be accomplished for many to whom it would not be of the least good for you to tell the truth, for they could not comprehend it. But you can reach them through disinterested acts of benevolence. There are outcasts, men who have lost the similitude of God, who must first be cared for, fed, washed, and decently clothed. Then they are not to hear anything but of Christ, His great love and His willingness to save them. Let these perishing souls feel that all you have done for them was done because of your love for their souls.",
