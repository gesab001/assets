    "word": "MINISTERS TO BE UNTIRING IN PRAYER.\u2014Ministers should seek a heart preparation before entering upon the work of helping others, for the people are far in advance of many of the ministers. They should untiringly wrestle in prayer until the Lord blesses\n\n62\nthem. When the love of God is burning on the altar of their hearts, they will not preach to exhibit their own smartness, but to present Christ who taketh away the sins of the world.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, 166.)",
