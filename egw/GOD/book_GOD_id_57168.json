    "word": "You neglect to keep your heart, and neglect to do good with the means which God has given you. Your influence could benefit did you feel that anything was required of you toward those who need help, who need encouraging and strengthening. But you have so long studied your pleasure that you are disqualified to benefit those around you. You need to discipline yourself in order that your affections and thoughts may be brought into subjection. Take time for self-examination, that you may bring all your powers in subjection to the mind and will of God. You are shut up to self. It is the privilege of every true Christian to exert an influence for good over everyone with whom he associates.",
