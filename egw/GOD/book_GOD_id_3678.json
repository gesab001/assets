    "word": "Herod and the wicked authorities killed the Just One, but Christ never killed anyone, and we may attribute the spirit of persecution\u2014because people want liberty of conscience\u2014to its origin, Satan. He is a deceiver, a liar, a murderer, and accuser of the brethren and sisters. He loves to see human misery. He exults in distress, and as we view the cruel persecutions of those who would obey God according to the dictates of their own consciences, we may know that this is the mystery of iniquity. The Lord said to Satan, that old serpent, \u201cIt [the Seed of the woman] shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel\u201d (Genesis 3:15). Christ in a special manner bruised the head of the serpent, but the prophecy is far-reaching. It is a declaration of an unwearied conflict between Christ and His followers, and Satan and his angels and human agencies on this earth, to the close of time.",
