    "word": "The next day the meeting commenced where it left off the night before. All who had been blessed at the previous meeting retained the blessing. They had not slept much, for the Spirit of God rested upon them through the night, and they came with it to the meeting. Confessions were made of their disunion of feeling with us, and their backslidden state. Others were prostrated by the power of God that day, among them Bro. A., who lay helpless for some time. He said he felt thankful that we had come, and believed that God had sent us. The meeting continued without intermission from ten o'clock in the forenoon till five in the evening.",
