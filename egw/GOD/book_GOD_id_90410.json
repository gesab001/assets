    "word": "This is a fascination that is wholly of the devil that binds you to influences that will ruin. Unless you show a determination to break these fetters, you will soon be unable to do so, and I know that adversity will come to you; and I love you and I love yours. I want you to see. I want you [to] break the fetters of darkness. I want you to stand free and whole in God. I want Satan to be disappointed. I write you this letter [that] you may be saved now from further deception if you will make one determined effort of resistance. I write you this letter although I know my enemies \n\n\n                                     -6- \n\nwould turn and twist and misconstrue and play upon words and misinterpret anything I may say or write. Yet I do not think you will do this, and I shall venture to send this letter.",
