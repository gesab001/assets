    "word": "The case of Frank Belden has been presented to me. The office of publication has treated him unjustly, as it has also Edson White. The plea which some are so ready to urge, \"the cause of God\", working in behalf of the cause of God, to justify themselves in presenting robbery \n                                                                           1427\nfor burnt offering, is an offense to God. He accepts no such transactions; prosperity will not attend these movements. The Lord of heaven does not accept the strange fire offered to him. Men connected with his work have been dealing unjustly, and it is time to call a halt. Let men deal with men upon the principles of the ten commandments, and not ignore these principles in business transactions. False propositions are assumed as truth and righteousness, and then everything is worked in such a way as to carry out these propositions, which are not in accordance with the will of God, but are a misrepresentation of his character.",
