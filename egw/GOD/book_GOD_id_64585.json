    "word": "It is impossible to do this work for time and eternity unless the teacher has a close connection with God. Jesus has said, \u201cSearch the Scriptures, \n21\nfor in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of Me.\u201d Do not encourage a superficial manner of investigating the truth. Make every point of truth clear and distinct to the minds of the children. Do not crowd upon their minds an accumulated amount of matter at one time. The precious Word of God is to be a lamp to their path, and a light to their feet. Impress upon their minds that it is their privilege to walk in the light. It is the path of peace, of purity, of holiness, cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in. Christ has led the way in this path; He is the true Shepherd; in following Him, they avoid the by-paths and dangerous pitfalls.",
