    "word": "From this [the experience of Philip and the Eunuch] God would teach His workers to be on watch and be ready to help every case that shall come to their notice. This man was converted through Philip's preaching the gospel of the Word to him. Through him the light of truth was shining to the higher classes. It is the plan and constant effort of Satan to entangle the work of God in a supposed beneficent and excellent work, so that doors cannot be opened to enter new fields and work with people who have an advanced acquaintance with temperance principles. To unite with them in their work would be to do a special work for this time, without taking on the responsibilities of a work which will enforce an expenditure of means that will embarrass the conferences, a work which will absorb and consume but not produce.--Ms 46, 1900, pp. 1-4, 5, 6.
