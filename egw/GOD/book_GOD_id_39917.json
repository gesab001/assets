    "word": "But before that coming, Jesus said, \u201cThis gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.\u201d Matthew 24:14. His kingdom will not come until the good tidings of His grace have been carried to all the earth. Hence, as we give ourselves to God, and win other souls to Him, we hasten the coming of His kingdom. Only those who devote themselves to His service, saying, \u201cHere am I; send me\u201d (Isaiah 6:8), to open blind eyes, to turn men \u201cfrom darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified\u201d (Acts 26:18)\u2014they alone pray in sincerity, \u201cThy kingdom come.\u201d",
