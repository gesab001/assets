    "word": "As a people, we need to reform, and especially do ministers and teachers of the Word need to reform. I am instructed to say to our ministers and to the presidents of our conferences: Your usefulness as laborers for God in the work of recovering perishing souls, depends much on your success in overcoming appetite. Overcome the desire to gratify appetite, and if you do this your passions will be easily controlled. Then your mental and moral powers will be stronger. \"And they overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.\" \n\n                                               -",
