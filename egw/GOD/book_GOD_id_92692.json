    "word": "God was working in His providence to bring in close relationship to Him young men that He could mold and fashion as clay is molded in the hands of the potter, that He would make them vessels unto honor. He had a work for them to do which others who were older could not do as well. He wanted their whole heart, their affections, and He claimed them as His right. With those who were older, habits were formed and ideas were not always such that God could use them; but He wanted young men to reach the highest standard of holiness, as did Daniel. I devoted more than one hour in conversation with this young man, who is a youth of great promise. I believe that the Lord has a special work for him to do, and after talking with him we could only commit the case to God for Him to impress the heart.--Ms. 28, 1885. \n\nEllen G.
