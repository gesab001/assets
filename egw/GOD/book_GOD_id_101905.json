    "word": "The youth will make mistakes, but these can and must be corrected without harshness or any manifestation of Satan. No one is to lord it over God's heritage. It is not right to try to lead human beings into right lines by manifesting the contemptible attributes of Satan. Those who have an indwelling Christ will not manage in these lines. None of the workers should be neglected, overburdened, or overlooked. If any discrimination made, it should be in favor of the youth. The chief interest should be to set them a correct example. Their future may be determined by their wise or unwise management.",
