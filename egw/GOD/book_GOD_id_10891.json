    "word": "\"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" This refers to those who labor with their hands as well as to those who have gifts to bestow. God has given you strength and skill, but you have not used them. Your strength is sufficient to abundantly support your family. Rise in the morning, even while the stars are shining, if need be. Lay your plans to do something, and then accomplish it. Redeem every pledge, unless sickness lays you prostrate. \n                                                                           254\nBetter deny yourself food and sleep than be guilty of keeping from others their just dues.--5T 179, 180.",
