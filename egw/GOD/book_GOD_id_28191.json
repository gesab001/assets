    "word": "Through the setting up of a false sabbath, the enemy thought to change times and laws. But has he really succeeded in changing God's law? The words of the thirty-first chapter of Exodus are the answer. He who is the same yesterday, today, and forever has declared of the seventh-day Sabbath: \"It is a sign between me and you throughout your generations.\" \"It is a sign . . . for ever\" (Exodus 31:13, 17). The changed signpost is pointing the wrong way, but God has not changed. He is still the mighty God of Israel. \"Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing\" (Isaiah 40:15). . . . And He is just as jealous for His law now as He was in the days of Ahab and Elijah.",
