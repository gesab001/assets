    "word": "Brethren, when you humble your hearts before God, you will see that there is danger of Pharisaism in every church, danger of thinking and praying as did the self-righteous Pharisee: \"I thank God that I am not as other men are.\" Oh, that there may be a breaking up of the fallow ground of the heart, that the seeds of truth may take deep root and spring up and bear much fruit to the glory of God! My brethren, when you would accuse one of the brethren, consider the words of Jesus, \"He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone\" (John 8:7). Your sin may not be the particular sin that is under consideration, but Jesus' words mean that when you are free from sin you may cast the first stone. When Jesus spoke these words to the accusers, their guilty consciences were aroused. They could not answer Him; they were convicted each in his own conscience, and they went out one by one, beginning at the oldest even to the youngest.",
