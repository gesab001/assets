    "word": "To a Physician Bearing Large \n                 Responsibility. \n\n\n           \"Elmshaven,\" Sanitarium, Cal., \n                                Aug. 6, 1902. \n\n\n     My Dear Brother: The Lord is our strength. Take hold of his strength, and make peace with him. In your human strength you are as liable as any other man to err in judgment. The Lord is merciful and gracious. He will give you wise counselors. If ever a man needed wise counselors, you need them,-- men who will not receive your propositions or representations if they discern that they are not in harmony with the will of God, men who will not make things appear as they are not, who will abide by principles that will stand God's test. The Lord wants you to make straight paths for your feet, for the sake of your own soul's salvation, and to save other souls from following in false ways.",
