    "word": "Brother Sutherland is a man who loves and fears God. For the last few years his and Brother Magan's work has been a work of wrestling, just the kind of work to fit young men to be wise, trustworthy stewards of the grace of Christ. At one time, when Brother Sutherland was making a mistake, advocating extreme ideas, the Lord corrected him, pointing out the right way. Brother Sutherland accepted the reproof, and the Lord has blessed him as he has tried to walk in the light. Brother Magan also has gained a valuable experience.",
