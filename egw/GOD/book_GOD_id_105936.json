    "word": "The Lord has been working to bring certain things around for his own name's glory. Had your brother done just as you think he should have done, he would have become discouraged by the way you would have handled his care. God would have you work with your fellow men with this idea in view, that they are human like yourself, subject to temptations; and you are to meet them on equal ground. Treat them respectfully as men who are chosen of God. They may not always have been wise or perfect in their judgment; but humanity must meet humanity just where it is, remembering that all are of value with God. Your brethren are as precious in God's sight as your individual selves. Under stress of circumstances, because you did not exercise faith, and reveal trust in God, you have made grave blunders. If men err in the same lines in which you have erred, if they move hastily by looking at appearances, do not do with them as you have done in the case of the one who has been laboring for the Master. You can not bind him to your heart or influence for good by the course of action you have pursued. Come into union and agreement without delay. Act your part nobly; for you have erred. You have dealt with him as no minister should deal with a fellow-laborer. The Lord will not sanction any such example for your fellow workers to follow.",
