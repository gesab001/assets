    "word": "Oh, how many times has your heart been touched with the beauty of the Saviour's countenance, charmed with the loveliness of His character, and subdued with the thought of His suffering. Now He wants you to lean your whole weight upon Him. I will give you a chapter to comfort you at all times. \"And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation\" (Isaiah 12:1-3).--Letter 14b, 1891.",
