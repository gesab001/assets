It was not the practice of pure and undefiled religion that has permeated the Office at Battle Creek, that has prevailed in many councils. It is not this that has caused sorrow and oppression, that has led men \n                                                                           1298\nto cry unto God for justice. God will not be deaf to the prayers of the oppressed. Every action which has caused sorrow to the purchased of His blood He will requite to the actors unless they shall accept the grace of God and repent. The Lord will not be a party to the least wrong. He will not sanction decisions made against his brethren. He will punish the wrong-doer for all these things. It is difficult for men who begin to walk in the sparks of their own kindling to discern that it is not a sacred but common fire, until they lie down in sorrow. Read Isaiah 50:10, 11.",
