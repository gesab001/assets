    "word": "A Call from a Mission Field \n\n                    Written from Australia \n\n\n     To those who are looking for a place where they may work in the Lord's vineyard, we way, Come over and help us. Come prepared to practice self-denial, determined that you will not fail nor be discouraged. We can not pay your passage to this country, nor can we give you large wages. We can not carry you financially or spiritually; but if you will come to do a work for the Master, if you are willing to visit and labor for souls where they are, come, and we will co-operate with you as long as you will co-operate with God. [THIS CRY NOW GOES UP FROM MANY FIELDS.]",
