    "word": "I have been shown that human beings desire too much power.  They desire to control, and the Lord God, the mighty worker is left out of their work.  The workmen feel qualified to hold the highest place.  Let no man attempt to manage that work which should be left in the hands of the great I AM, and who is in His own way planning how the work shall be done.  Know that God is the Instructor of His servants, and He will work through whom He will.--Manuscript 143, 1899.",
