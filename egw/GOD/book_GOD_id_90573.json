    "word": "The Lord would have all men walk humbly with God. If men will engage in His service and with much prayer persevere in well doing, the Lord will abundantly reward them. Their confidence in the wisdom of God's leading will increase. They will not be left in uncertainty, but, walking in the way of the Lord, they will become steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. God is well pleased with their obedience to all His requirements.",
