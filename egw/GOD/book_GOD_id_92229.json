    "word": "Brethren, bring Jesus into your work. Be one in Jesus, of one mind, of one judgment. God will bless you, and you will see of the salvation of Jesus. But let not one exalt himself over another. Work for the Master and do your work in such a manner as not to bring \"I\" prominent, but each esteem others better than himself. Let Jesus into your heart. Seek to glorify Jesus, not yourself. Oh, self, self, how hard to crucify self; nevertheless self must be crucified, and then Jesus will reveal Himself as a mighty Worker in your midst.--Letter 48, 1886. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Entire Letter.",
