    "word": "U. T.--May. 19, '97 (H. L. para. 13) \n     The obligation we owe to God in presenting to Him clean, pure, healthy bodies is not comprehended.  {TSDF 184.10}  \n                                U. T.--Aug. 30, '96 (H. L. para. 43) \n     God is greatly dishonored by the way in which man treats his organism, and He will not work a miracle to counteract a perverse violation of the laws of life and health.  {TSDF 184.11}  \n                                 U. T.--Aug. 30, '96 (H. L. para. 3) \n     The living organism is God's property. It belongs to Him by creation and by redemption; and by a misuse of any of our powers we rob God of the honor due Him.  {TSDF 184.12}  \n                              Sp. T. for Min. and Workers, No. 7, p. 40 \n                                                 (H.L. para. 109) \n     The Lord has given His people a message in regard to health reform. This light has been shining upon their pathway for thirty years, and the Lord can not sustain His servants in a course which will counteract it. . . . Can He be pleased when half the workers laboring in a place teach that the principles of health reform are as closely allied to the third angel's message as the arm is to the body, \n\n\n                                                                 185 \n\nto have their coworkers, by their practice, teach principles that are entirely opposite? . . . The light which God has given upon health reform can not be trifled with without injury to those who attempt it; and no man can hope to succeed in the work of God while, by precept and example, he acts in opposition to the light which God has sent.  {TSDF 184.13}  \n                            R. and H.--'83, No. 19 (H. L. para. 146) \n     One reason why we do not enjoy more of the blessing of the Lord is, we do not heed the light which He has been pleased to give us in regard to the laws of life and health.",
