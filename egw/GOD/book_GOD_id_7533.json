    "word": "At the head of one of the groups into which the apostles are divided stands the name of Philip. He was the first disciple to whom Jesus addressed the distinct command, \"Follow me.\" . . . He had listened to the teaching of John the Baptist, and had heard his announcement of Christ as the Lamb of God. Philip was a sincere seeker for truth, but he was slow of heart to believe. . . . Though Christ had been proclaimed by the voice from heaven as the Son of God, to Philip He was \"Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph\" (John 1:45). Again, when the five thousand were fed, Philip's lack of faith was shown. It was to test him that Jesus questioned, \"Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?\" . . . Again, in those last hours before the crucifixion, the words of Philip were such as to discourage faith. . . . So slow of heart, so weak in faith, was that disciple who for three years  had been with Jesus.",
