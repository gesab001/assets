    "word": "Envy has been cherished in the hearts of some in the church as well as in the College. God is displeased at your course. I entreat you, for Christ's sake, never treat another as you have treated Bro. Bell. A noble nature does not exult in causing others pain, or delight in discovering their deficiencies. A disciple of Christ will turn away with loathing from the feast of scandal. Some who have been active on this occasion, are repeating the course pursued toward one of the Lord's servants in affliction, one who had sacrificed health and strength in their service. The Lord vindicated the cause of the oppressed, and turned the light of his countenance upon his suffering servant. I then saw that God would prove these persons again, as he has now done, to reveal what was in their hearts.",
