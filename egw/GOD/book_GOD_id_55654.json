    "word": "Why the Temperance Message Is Vital.--The Christian will be temperate in all things,--in eating, in drinking, in dress, and in every phase of life. \"Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.\" We have no right to indulge in anything that will result in a condition of mind that hinders the Spirit of God from impressing us with the sense of our duty. It is a masterpiece of satanic skill to place men where they can with difficulty be reached with the gospel.--Review and Herald, Aug. 29, 1907.",
