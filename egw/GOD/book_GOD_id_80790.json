    "word": "Difficulties will arise in your path, and you may feel the deficiency of your character, the littleness of your ability, as a minister of the gospel, in comparison with the greatness of the work. But if you had the greatest intellect that was ever given to man, it would not be sufficient for your work. \"Without me ye can do nothing,\" says our Lord and Saviour. The result of all we do rests in the hands of God. You should look upon Christ, his self-denial, the reproach he endured, the abuse he bore for man, that you may be well balanced. When the blessing of God attends your labors you should become neither vain nor ambitious. When disaster comes you should not be depressed, and success should not elate you. The prosperity of the cause of God should always be kept in view. May the Lord \n\n\n                             [22] \n\nhelp you not to have a fluctuating faith, but a faith that will lay hold upon God, with steady, persevering confidence, whatever may betide.            Ellen G. White. \n\n                                               -",
