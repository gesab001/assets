    "word": "I was instructed to write out the truth as it was revealed to me, and point by point give it to the people. I have done this, and still there is much to present that the truth may be made simple and plain. The work God has given me to do is to stand firmly and intelligently for that which I know to be truth. That which I have given to the people was given in the purpose of God, to strengthen the believers, that they might not be led away by seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.",
