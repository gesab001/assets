    "word": "Sr. Drusilla Lamson has had many years of experience in the cause of God; and yet she has not put to the highest use the talents intrusted her by the Master. Her influence has been too much on the side of conformity to the world, rather than of maintaining the distinct and separate character of God's peculiar people. She has had, to some degree, an influence to indulge rather than deny the appetite and the inclination to dress according to the world's standard. This is all in opposition to the work which God and angels are seeking to do for us as a people, to bring out, to separate, to distinguish us from the world. We should sanctify ourselves as a people, and seek strength from God to meet the demands of this time. When iniquity prevails in the world, God's people should seek to be more closely connected with Heaven. The tide of moral evil comes upon us with such power that we shall lose our balance and be swept away with the current, unless our feet stand firmly upon the rock, Christ Jesus.",
