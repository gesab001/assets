    "word": "Peter, on the day of Pentecost, declared that the patriarch David \u201cis both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day.\u201d \u201cFor David is not ascended into the heavens.\u201d [Acts 2:29, 34.] The fact that David remains in the grave until the resurrection, proves that the righteous do not go to Heaven at death. It is only through the resurrection, and \n547\nby virtue of the fact that Christ has risen, that David can at last sit at the right hand of God.",
