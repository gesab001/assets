    "word": "Spirit of Union and Equality \n                    Among Laborers \n\n\n     I am urged by the Spirit of God to counsel my brethren to unite with one another in labor. Love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous, be true as steel to one another, but crush that feeling of superiority over your brother ministers which leads one to feel that he cannot link up with others in labor. No one man should feel that he must do the whole work. However experienced or well qualified he may be, there is need of other talents to unite with his. It is a mistake to think that one man's train of thought will accomplish the work for all hearts in a religious effort. Men of different minds are needed, men whose hearts are tenderly led out to win souls. Different methods of labor are really essential in sowing the seeds of truth and gathering in the harvest. It is often the case that men of the humblest ability will reach hearts that have been steeled against another man's labors. Much praying is essential. The soul's drawing nigh to God in communion means God's drawing nigh to the soul that is seeking Him. There needs to be greater devotion of heart and life in service to God. \n                                                                           252",
