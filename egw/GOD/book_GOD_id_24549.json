    "word": "In the evening we had a good, intelligent congregation. The Spirit of God helped me as I tried to present before them the reward of the faithful from the text, \u201cLet not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions,\u201d etc. At the close of the meeting, nearly all came forward and shook hands with me. One man who could speak English said, \u201cThe Lord has been present tonight and assisted \n238\nby the inspiration of his Spirit in speaking the word.\u201d Several expressed an earnest desire for us to remain longer. The interest to hear was certainly much greater than when we first came.",
