    "word": "Dear son, Edson, guard faithfully your thoughts. Keep every approach to your heart well fortified. You must put up the bars against the approach of Satan. Watchfulness at one point while others are neglected will not avail. The careless neglect of one sentinel will imperil the entire army. The neglect to guard one path to the fortress may prove the loss of the city. . . . There are perils before us which we must meet, and our only safety is in God.--Letter 32, June 14, 1876, to Edson and Emma White.",
