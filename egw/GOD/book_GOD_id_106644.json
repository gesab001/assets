    "word": "About the time of the General Conference in 1901, the way opened for the sale of the Battle Creek College property; and the understanding was that the buildings and grounds would be used for the American Medical Missionary College. Our brethren left Battle Creek, and established Emmanuel Missionary College at Berrien Springs. They secured a beautiful tract of land in the country, and began small. There they have labored untiringly for the upbuilding of an educational institution that would be an honor to God and his cause. They have striven to get things in order, so that they could receive and properly care for the students who came. Faithfully have they endeavored to train the youth to be laborers together with God, and to depend upon Him for wisdom and guidance. Through their efforts, many young men and young women have been imbued with a love for souls, and have been prepared to give to the world the message of warning that is to be proclaimed before Christ's second advent.",
