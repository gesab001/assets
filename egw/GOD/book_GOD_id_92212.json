    "word": "There are those who look upon themselves as the Lord's servants, but who, as shown by the way in which the Southern work has been handled, are working away from the light that God has for years been giving. I have pity for them, but I cannot be forever pointing out for them the way of righteousness. They are brought no nearer right actions by what I say than if the words were never spoken. So long as those in responsible positions see things through a false medium, they will put a wrong construction on my work.",
