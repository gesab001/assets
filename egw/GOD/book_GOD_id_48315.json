    "word": "I saw that the present test on the Sabbath could not come until the mediation of Jesus in the Holy Place was finished, and he had passed within the second vail; therefore, Christians who fell asleep before the door was opened in the Most Holy, when the midnight cry was finished, at the seventh month 1844, and had not kept the true Sabbath, now rest in hope, for they had not the light, and the test on the Sabbath, which we now have since that door was opened. I saw that Satan was tempting some of God's people on this point. Because so many good Christians have fallen asleep in the triumphs of faith, and have not kept the true Sabbath, they were doubting about it being a test for us now.",
