    "word": "Christ was crucified for fallen man. But to many who call themselves Christians this event is nothing. In practise they deny the cross of Christ. . . . They admit that Christ died on the cross, but because there is a crucifixion for them to experience, they will not receive the lessons that lead to self-denial and self-sacrifice. They are Christians in name only. The central point of their faith is not a crucified and risen Saviour, who brings to all that receive Him the privilege of being sons and daughters of God.",
