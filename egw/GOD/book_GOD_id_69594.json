    "word": "The test of a genuine Christian is given in the Word of God. Says Jesus, \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments\u201d (John 14:15). \u201cHe that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. . . . If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father\u2019s which sent me\u201d (verses 21-24).",
