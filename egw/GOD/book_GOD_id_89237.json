    "word": "My sister, you can and are in danger of giving a wrong example to Dr. Dowse, and both of you are in a fair way to backslide from God and become nominal religionists. In the position of responsibility that you are both in, you need the grace of Christ that you may lift the cross daily, and overcome many things. Every day let the pen of the recording angel trace the words in your behalf, \"Victory over the deceptive powers of Satan.\" Satan would have you both lose your hold upon the Lord Jesus Christ, but you must not allow him to do his will with you. Kindle your taper from the divine altar and shine as lights to the world.",
