    "word": "The disciples had gained confidence to enter where Jesus was, and witness his trial. They expected that he would manifest his divine power, and deliver himself from the hands of his enemies, and punish them for their cruelty towards him. Their hopes would rise and fall as the different scenes transpired. Sometimes they doubted, and feared they had been deceived. \n                                                                           52\nBut the voice heard at the mount of transfiguration, and the glory they there witnessed, strengthened them that he was the Son of God. They called to mind the exciting scenes which they had witnessed, the miracles they had seen Jesus do in healing the sick, opening the eyes of the blind, unstopping the deaf ears, rebuking and casting out devils, raising the dead to life, and even rebuking the wind, and it obeyed him. They could not believe that he would die. They hoped he would yet rise in power, and with his commanding voice disperse that blood-thirsty multitude, as when he entered the temple and drove out those who were making the house of God a place of merchandise; when they fled before him, as though a company of armed soldiers were pursuing them. The disciples hoped that Jesus would manifest his power, and convince all that he was the King of Israel.",
