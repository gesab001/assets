    "word": "The influence of the Holy Spirit has gone from ministers because there has been a spirit of contention. Let it forever cease. Come unto the Master and let Him breathe His sweet Spirit into your hearts. The tender plant of love must be cherished. If we should not have the privilege of meeting here again in conference, what a meeting will it be when we shall greet each other when Christ comes in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory! What a scene of glory that will be! If we can hear the \"Well done, good and faithful servant,\" the light and glory of God will beam upon us from the face of Jesus Christ. I will pray for you. How I have prayed for you in the night seasons, that you may save other souls!",
