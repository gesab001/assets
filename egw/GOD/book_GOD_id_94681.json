    "word": "Brother Ramsey sees where Brother Bell fails, but he makes still more serious mistakes. He does not carry the burdens Brother Bell has carried. He does not labor as Brother Bell has labored. He does not watch unto prayer. He fails again and again, being self-dignified, bringing himself to the front. He is overbearing, dictatorial, and self-important. He thinks more highly of himself than he ought. Nothing but the grace of God can give him correct views of his own self so that he will labor in humility and not disgust his pupils. He has made some improvements, but unless the Spirit of Christ \n\n\n                                     -184- \n\nis abiding in him, he will make, in his self-importance, serious blunders. He will not win the students, but repulse and disgust them. In a young man this spirit is very objectionable and highly displeasing to God.",
