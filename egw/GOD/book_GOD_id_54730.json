    "word": "Deliverance at the Red Sea\n \n\n     \"And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto Me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: but lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children\n123\nof Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.\" God would have Moses understand that He would work for His people--that their necessity would be His opportunity. When they should go as far as they could, he must bid them still go forward; that he should use the rod God had given him to divide the waters.",
