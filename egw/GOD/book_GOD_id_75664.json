    "word": "One and another come to me, asking me to explain the positions taken in \"Living Temple.\" I reply, \"They are unexplainable.\" The sentiments expressed do not give a true knowledge of God.

Erroneous theories are presented in so pleasing a way that unless care is taken, many will be misled.",
