    "word": "God calls for earnest, unselfish, disinterested laborers in His cause who will keep up the various branches of the work, such as obtaining subscribers for the periodicals, teaching them promptness in paying their dues, and encouraging brethren to keep up their systematic benevolence. Sacrifice, self-denial, toil, and disinterested benevolence characterized the life of Christ, who is our example in all things. The work and character of a true minister will be in accordance with the life of Christ. He laid aside His glory, His high command, His honor, and His riches, and humbled Himself to our necessities. We cannot equal the example, but we should copy it. Love for souls for whom Christ made this great sacrifice should stimulate His ministers to exertion, to self-denial and persevering effort, that they may be co-workers with Him in the salvation of souls. Then will the works of God's servants be fruitful, for they will indeed be His instruments. The power of God will be seen upon them in the gracious influences of His Spirit. God would have you arouse and possess strength to surmount obstacles; be not easily discouraged; if need be, labor, as did the apostle Paul, in weariness, in painfulness, in watching, forgetting infirmities in the deep interest felt for souls for whom Christ died.",
