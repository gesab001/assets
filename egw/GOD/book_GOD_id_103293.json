    "word": "\"Study the Word, which God in His wisdom and love and goodness has made so plain and simple. . . The Holy Spirit teaches the student of the Scriptures to judge all things by the standard of righteousness and truth and justice. The divine revelation supplies him with the knowledge that he needs. And the needed knowledge will be given to all who come to Christ, receiving and practicing His teachings, making His words a part of their lives. Those who place themselves under the instruction of the Great Medical Missionary to be workers together with Him, will have a knowledge that the world with all its traditionary lore cannot supply.",
