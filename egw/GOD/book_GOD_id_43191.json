    "word": "In the midst of the time of trouble--trouble such as has not been since there was a nation--His chosen ones will stand unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest of God's saints. Angels that excel in strength will protect them, and in their behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a \"God of gods,\" able to save to the uttermost those who have put their trust in Him.--Prophets and Kings, pp. 512, 513.",
