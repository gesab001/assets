    "word": "The question has been asked, Shall you have no study book but the Bible? I answer, Take the Bible as a study book, and see if you are not filled with the love of God. Your heart may be barren, your intellect feeble, but if you will prayerfully study the Word of God, light will flash into your mind. God works with every diligent student. Teachers who will learn from the great Teacher will realize the help of God as did Daniel and his fellows. The record states of these youth, \"As for these four children. \n\n\n                                  -264- \n\nGod gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. . . . And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm\" [Daniel 1:17, 19, 20].",
