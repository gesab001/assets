    "word": "Now, if God has touched your heart, as I sincerely hope He has, you will humble your heart, you will fall upon the Rock and be broken. You will confess your sins, and forever forsake them, and begin a new life. You will now have things brought to your remembrance in regard to your course of action toward a worn, burdened child of God-- Sister K. She has had her faults, but she has not despised reproof. She has ever been ready to bow to the light and will of God.",
