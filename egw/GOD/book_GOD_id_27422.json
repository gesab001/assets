    "word": "It is the privilege of every one connected with our denominational institutions to be connected in close relationship with God; and if they fail to do this, they show themselves unfitted for their work of trust. The provision made for us all through Christ was a full and perfect sacrifice,--a sinless offering. His blood can cleanse the foulest stain. Had He been but a man, we would be excusable for our lack of faith and obedience. He came to save that which was lost. We are not qualified for the great work for this time, except when we labor in God, when our prayers, earnest and fervent, are continually ascending to the throne of grace.",
