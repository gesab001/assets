    "word": "Do not seek to make with Elder Smith, Professor Bell, or any other brain-worker terms that are not perfectly just and fair. Do not urge nor compel them to accept terms dictated by those who do not know what it is to make books. They have a conscience and are accountable to God for the use and improvement of their entrusted talents; and they want the privilege of investing the means which they acquire by hard labor, when and where the Spirit of God shall indicate. My brethren must remember that the cause of God includes more than the publishing house, and other institutions established \n                                                                           376\nat Battle Creek. No one understands better than Brother Smith the difficulties through which the Publishing Association was brought into existence, for he has been connected with it from its earliest years when it was oppressed by poverty, and self-denial had to be carried into our practical life. The table was hardly supplied with sufficient food to sustain our lives; there was economy in dressing and in wages paid. This was positively necessary in order that the paper might live. Those who passed through these experiences would be ready, under similar circumstances, to undergo the same privations again. It does not show very good grace for those who have had no part in raising the work up to its present prosperous condition, to press and urge, and even try to force the early workers to submit to terms which they can see no justice in. Brother Smith loves the cause of God. He loves the truth, and will invest his means to advance it wherever he sees that it is necessary. But leave this burden upon those with whom God has entrusted talents and means; they are responsible to him, and the Publishing Association or its chief workers, are not to assume their stewardship.",
