    "word": "Ellen White's Voice Instruction From God-- I have words of caution to give you, which I am repeating to you in the night season. I was saying this: \"I have a message for you from the Lord. Cultivate your vocal organs. This is your privilege and duty. The voice is a most precious treasure. You often speak too hurriedly. Words are crowded too \n                                                                           261\nquickly upon words, and your utterance lacks the clear distinctness that it should have.\"",
