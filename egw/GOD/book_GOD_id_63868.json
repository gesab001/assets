    "word": "A Failure To Honor God \n\n     One who sees beneath the surface, who reads the hearts of all men, says of those who have had great light: \"They are not afflicted and astonished because of their moral and spiritual condition.\" Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before Mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.\" \"God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie,\" because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,\" \"but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\" Isaiah 66:3, 4; 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 10, 12.",
