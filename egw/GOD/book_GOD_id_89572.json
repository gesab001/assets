    "word": "Praise of men and flattery makes ministers hungry for more until they think, as did Elder [E. P.] Daniels, that the praise of man is of more value than the approval of God. We must, if saved, imbibe the Spirit and power of Christ. Self must be hidden in Christ, and Christ alone appear. Our work is to elevate, not by praising anyone, but by upholding Jesus. Bring the mind to Jesus; lift Him up, the Man of Calvary, before the people and He can do all things for the humble, trusting believer.",
