    "word": "Our sisters should cultivate true meekness. They may be courteous; but they should not be forward, talkative, and bold. To be kind, tender, pitiful, forgiving, and humble is well pleasing to God. If they occupy this position, they will not be burdened with undue attention from the other sex. There will be a sacred circle of purity around them, which will shield them from unwarrantable liberties.",
