    "word": "Our own land is to become a battlefield on which is to be carried on the struggle for religious liberty--to worship God according to the dictates of our own conscience. Then can we not discern the work of the enemy in keeping men asleep who ought to be awake, whose influence shall not be neutral, but wholly and entirely on the Lord's side? Shall men cry, Peace and safety, now, when sudden destruction is coming upon the world, when God's wrath shall be poured out?-- Manuscript 30, 1889.",
