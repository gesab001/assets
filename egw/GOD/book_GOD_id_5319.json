    "word": "14\n \n     Leaders Are Learners--Those who accept a position of responsibility in the cause of God should always remember that with the call to this work God has also called them to walk circumspectly before Him and before their fellow men.  Instead of considering it their duty to order and dictate and command, they should realize that they are to be learners themselves.  When a responsible worker fails to learn this lesson, the sooner he is released from his responsibilities the better it will be for him and for the work of God.  Position never will give holiness and excellence of character.  He who honors God and keeps His commandments is himself honored.",
