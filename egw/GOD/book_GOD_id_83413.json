    "word": "Nimes, Sabbath, Oct. 30, 1886. Brother Ings spoke in the forenoon. I spoke in the afternoon. An Evangelical minister associated with Mr. Gilly in the work came into meeting after I had finished my remarks. He was accompanied by the directors and his wife. They called upon us in Brother Bourdeau's hired house and we had a very pleasant interview. I spoke in the evening and the minister and the preceptress and the minister's wife and about fifty of his students came out to the meeting. We hope this acquaintance may be in the providence of God a blessing to them and to us.",
