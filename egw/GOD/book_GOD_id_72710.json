    "word": "Nothing Nonessential--Christ's words contain nothing that is nonessential. The Sermon on the Mount is a wonderful production, yet so simple that a child can study it without misunderstanding. The mount of beatitudes is a symbol of the spiritual elevation on which Christ ever stood. Every word He uttered came from God, and He spoke with the authority of heaven. \"The words that I speak unto \n                                                                           88\nyou,\" He said, \"they are spirit, and they are life.\" John 6:63.--CT 439.",
