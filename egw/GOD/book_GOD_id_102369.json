    "word": "The Lord has inspired men to write the very things that are essential for this time in regard to the special attention we must give to the care of the body. We are the Lord's property. Christ has paid a sum for the ransom of man that in no way can be computed. He gave Himself a living offering unto God. He bore the sins of the transgressor that God might be just, and yet be the justifier of the repenting, believing sinner. In the wilderness of temptation He overcame every temptation on the point of appetite. He fasted forty days and forty nights, and in His weak condition Satan assailed Him. But he answered not with His own words; for Satan was ready to enter into controversy if He had done this. And yet His answer was His own words, traced by human pen under the inspiration of the Spirit of God. He met Satan with \"It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" The insinuating temptation was presented, \"If thou be the Son of God, command that this stone, (in appearance exactly like bread) be made bread.\" But the \"If\" of unbelief was not accepted, and there was no ground left for controversy.",
