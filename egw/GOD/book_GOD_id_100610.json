    "word": "But the Lord communicated to Samuel, even giving him special directions as to what he should do in the case of Israel's defection. \"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.\" 1 Samuel 8:9. Samuel faithfully told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. 1 Samuel 8:11, 12. Did the solemn words spoken by Samuel under the direction of God change their purpose? No! Their minds were bent on following their own judgment and casting aside the wisdom of God. \n                                                                           922",
