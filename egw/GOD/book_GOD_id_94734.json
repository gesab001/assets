    "word": "In the mountains, Colorado, Sabbath, September 20, 1873. The sun shone out beautifully in the morning but it soon became cloudy and snowed very fast, covering the ground and lodging upon the trees. It looks like winter. All around us is white. Here we are just this side of the Range in our tent, while the earth is sheeted with snow. This day has been a day of perplexity and trial. We feel deeply our need of the grace of God. These small trials are worse to bear than heavy afflictions. Shall I ever learn to be perfectly patient under minor trials? I know that I shall be tempted and proved until self shall be hid in Jesus. My earnest prayer to God daily is for divine grace to do His will.",
