    "word": "519. Go with me to yonder sick-room. There lies a husband and father, a man who is a blessing to society and to the cause of God. He has been suddenly stricken down by disease. The fire of fever seems consuming him. He longs for pure water to moisten the parched lips, to quench the raging thirst, and cool the fevered brow. But no; the doctor has forbidden water. The stimulus of strong drink is given, which adds fuel to the fire. . . . For a time nature wrestles for her rights, but at last, overcome, she gives up the contest, and death sets the sufferer free.--T., No. 31, p. 191.",
