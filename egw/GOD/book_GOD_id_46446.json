    "word": "3-5. Hophni and Phinehas Presumptuously Enter Most Holy Place.-- The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, eagerly acceded to the proposal to bear the ark into the camp. Without the consent of the high priest, they ventured presumptuously into the holy of holies, and took from thence the ark of God. Filled with pride, and elated with the expectation of speedy victory, they bore it to the camp. And the people, beholding, as they thought, the token of Jehovah's presence, \"shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.\" (ST Dec. 22, 1881).",
