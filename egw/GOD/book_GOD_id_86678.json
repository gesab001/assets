    "word": "The Lord Jesus has an interest in every phase of His work. I express to you my grief that in some respects mistakes have been made in the distribution of means. When the wages of a missionary who is doing the work that God has appointed him, are cut down, it is because a mistake has been made by men who do not always have the mind of Christ. The Lord will make all these things work together for good, even though for the present His servants are inconvenienced and greatly disappointed by being hemmed in on every side.--Letter 127, 1903, pp. 2, 3. (To S. N. Haskell, July 1, 1903.)",
