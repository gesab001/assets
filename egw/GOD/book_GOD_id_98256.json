    "word": "Every one of God's professed followers needs a humble and contrite spirit; and those who are in high positions of responsibility need a double portion of the spirit of humility. Instead of being careless and indifferent, instead of thinking that they are the ones who receive the most wisdom from God and know best how to direct others, those to whom much responsibility has been entrusted should humble themselves in the dust, pleading with God as they have never pleaded before. God desires to see every man of influence in our ranks cherishing the principles of justice and equity.",
