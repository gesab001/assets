    "word": "Wherever the people of God are placed, in the crowded cities, in the villages, or among the country byways, there is a home mission field, for which a responsibility is laid upon them by their Lord's commission. In every city or settlement where Christians meet to worship God, there are men and women and children to be gathered into the fold. Many have never heard a discourse on God's word. God is calling believers to take upon themselves a burden for these souls, learning from the great Teacher that the best way to reach souls is by direct personal appeal. It is the privilege of the Christian worker to bid those who are dead in trespasses and sins to behold their crucified, uplifted Redeemer, and live. The Lord designs that men who have had great light should so appreciate Jesus Christ, the truth and the Light, that the sweetness of the breath of the soul will testify that they have eaten of the living bread.",
