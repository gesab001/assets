    "word": "Whatever we render to God is, through His mercy and generosity, placed to our account as faithful stewards. . . . Angels of God, whose perceptions are unclouded by sin, recognize the endowments of heaven as bestowed with the intention that they be returned in such a way as to add to the glory of the great Giver. With the sovereignty of God is bound up the well-being of man. The glory of God is the joy and the blessing of all created beings. When we seek to promote His glory we are seeking for ourselves the highest good which it is possible for us to receive. . . . God calls for the consecration to His service of every faculty, of every gift, you have received from Him. He wants you to say, with David: \"All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee\" (1 Chronicles 29:14).",
