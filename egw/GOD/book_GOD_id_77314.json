    "word": "I would bring to your attention the last prayer of Christ, as recorded in John 17. There are many subjects upon which we can speak,--sacred, testing truths, beautiful in their simplicity. On these you may dwell with intense earnestness. But let not \"the daily,\" or any other subject that will arouse controversy among brethren, be brought in at this time; for this will delay and hinder the work that the Lord would have the minds of our brethren centered upon just now. Let us not agitate questions that will reveal a marked difference of opinion, but rather let us bring from the Word the sacred truths regarding the binding claims of the law of God.",
