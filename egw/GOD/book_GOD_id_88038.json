But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

The cross of Calvary is to you a pledge of forgiveness, of righteousness, of peace, and of fullness of joy. It is a well of water to every believer, springing up into everlasting life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but should have everlasting life.\" \n\n\n                                  -78-",
