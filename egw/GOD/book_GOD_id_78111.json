    "word": "Will our young men and young women who believe the truth, become living missionaries? Take the promises of God, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" Ask blessings for today; hour by hour, moment by moment, live your prayers for today. You are not called upon to resist temptation for tomorrow; but we may consider the saying as significant, \"In today walks tomorrow.\" As you pray for strength to resist temptations today, watch unto prayer today. Ask the Holy Spirit's guidance, and abiding with Christ, watching and praying, and resisting temptation, you will become strong for the duties of tomorrow. This is the assurance that is given, \"Every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.\" God has made this promise, and He has illustrated His willingness to fulfill it, by presenting the willingness of earthly parents to give good gifts unto their children. He says, \"If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?\" \n                                                                           8",
