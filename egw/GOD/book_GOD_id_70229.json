    "word": "There is scarcely an operation of nature to which we may not find reference in the Word of God. The Word declares that \u201che maketh his sun to rise,\u201d and the rain to descend. He \u201cmaketh grass to grow upon the mountains. . . . He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels. . . . He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.\u201d \u201cHe maketh lightnings for the rain; and bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.\u201d",
