    "word": "God commands that all whom He has not especially called to labor in word and doctrine should labor with their hands the thing that is good and supply their own necessities and have wherewith to bestow upon others. And I saw that it was the will of God that they should eat wholesome food to strengthen the system or the temple of God. But in the time of trouble none will labor with their hands. Their sufferings will be mental, and God will provide food for them.",
