    "word": "\"Those who labor in the office should learn. \n\n                     -32- \n\nThey should study, and practise, and exercise their own brains. If the workmen make a failure, they should feel that it rests upon them to repair damages from their own purses, and not allow the office to suffer loss through their carelessness. They should not cease to bear responsibilities, but should try again, avoiding their former mistakes. In this way they would learn to take that care which the Word of God ever requires, and then they will do no more than their duty.\"--Pages 8, 9.",
