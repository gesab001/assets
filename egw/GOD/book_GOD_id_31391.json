    "word": "Treasures in Heaven \n\n     The cause of God should lie very near our hearts. The light of truth which has been a blessing to one family will, if communicated by parents and children, prove as great a blessing to other families also. But when God's bounties, so richly and abundantly given, are withheld from Him, and selfishly bestowed upon ourselves, God's curse, in the place of His blessing, will surely be experienced; \n                                                                           307\nfor this the Lord has declared. God's claim is to take the precedence of any other claim, and must be discharged first. Then the poor and the needy are to be cared for. These must not be neglected, at whatever cost or sacrifice to ourselves.",
