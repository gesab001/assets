This caused the king to be furious, and he ordered that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than it was wont to be made, and ordered those God-fearing children to be cast into it. But God did not forsake them, and those whom the king had called to execute his demands in order to set before them the penalty of disobedience were consumed by the fire. Here in full view of the king he saw in that furnace those whom he had cast in walking in the midst of the fire, and he also saw the fourth form like the Son of God. So you can see that the king was not ignorant of God and of His Son. These three Hebrew children had been a shining light in Babylon. This had its weight and influence, and when the king saw that the God they had worshiped was able to preserve them even in such a heated furnace, he called them forth and not a smell of fire was upon their garments. Then they told the king how their deliverance came.",
