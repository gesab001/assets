    "word": "Edson, . . . I hope that you and Emma will not live merely for yourselves but that you will consecrate yourselves to God and perfect holiness in His name.

Satan will oppose every step of advance that you \n\n\n                                  -296- \n\nmay make; therefore if you are overcome by the enemy, in humility humble yourself before God, confess your defeat and then distrust yourself, but more firmly trust in God.--Letter 8, 1869, pp. 2, 3. (To J. Edson White, July 6, 1869.)",
