    "word": "Years ago it was shown me that my husband and myself should not be dependent upon others, because there would be men connected with our institutions who have been educated and trained as business men of the world, and they would work, acting our their spirit to make us feel our dependence if they had the chance; for all men are not, in character, as God would have them, tender, compassionate, and Christlike. He would have us guard the means entrusted to us, and use it in different branches of his work; stimulating others by our example to invest in the different enterprises, We should not invest largely in any one institution, for our message is a worldwide one, and there are necessities continually arising that demand means. To every man he has given his work, and talents of means and influence, and those who have the cause of God at heart will understand the voice of God telling them what to do. They will have a burden to push the work where it needs pushing, but others will only see the needs of their own respective branches, and other branches will be left to suffer for want of far seeing judgment.",
