    "word": "But when a man in a position of responsibility grows in self-sufficiency, and lifts up his soul unto vanity, feeling the inclination to act as ruler toward any member of God's family, wait no longer, relieve him of his trust; for God is not with him. He will hurt souls. He is venturing a warfare at his own charges. He feels capable of doing a great work without Christ's help. He will exalt himself as a man of superior wisdom, who must be highly esteemed. He thinks that his brethren must do as he decides. God is given no \n\n\n                                 -204- \n\nchance to work; for he will tell what this one shall do with his talents and what place that man must occupy, as if he were God. He will take it upon him to lord it over God's heritage. It is not safe to keep any such one in the work in which eternal interests are involved; for he will mingle selfishness, injustice, and unrighteousness with his service. He is a backslider from right principles, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from iniquity.",
