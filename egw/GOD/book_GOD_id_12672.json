    "word": "The knowledge of the truth is connected with the possession of that faith that works by love and purifies the soul. If you continue to trust in God, you will realize the most precious blessings in every time of need. The Lord sees, the Lord knows, how much you need His grace. You may depend upon Him. His mediation is assured in His promise, His everlasting pledge. \"Them that honor me,\" He says, \"I will honor.\"  The Lord will reward your simple faith and trust in Him. You need not distrust the Word of God at any time. You have proved the promise of God. You have felt His hand upholding you. The Lord will hear your prayers.--Letter 82, 1898.",
