    "word": "In His great mercy God has spoken words of encouragement to the children of men. To all who repent and turn to Him, He offers abundant pardon. Repentance for sin is the first fruits of the working of the Holy Spirit in the life. It is the only process by which infinite purity reflects the image of Christ in His redeemed subjects. In Christ all fulness dwells. He teaches us to count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.",
