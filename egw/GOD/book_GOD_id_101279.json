    "word": "Brethren, there are things to be repented of, things to be undone as far as it is possible to undo them. You have made a man an offender for a word. When if God had taken you in hand, and treated you in as pitiless and merciless a manner as you have treated some who appealed to you, and who needed your help, you could not now find mercy or pardon. You have done a work which I will not call by its right name. It is a work that calls for thorough repentance. The persons wronged could expect no justice, for your likes and dislikes have been indulged with controlling power. Those who should have stood for justice and equity, but who have permitted your decisions to prevail in councils knew better than to let things go and raise no remonstrance. But they have done this time and again; conscience has been warped, the mind confused and beclouded, so that they do not feel the sin and danger of allowing unconverted, unsanctified men to control in deciding upon measures in God's work.",
