    "word": "God is not pleased with Sister Bailey's course in the management of her children. [She is] remiss in duty, weighed in the balance and found wanting. This is a serious defect in a mother--to be so tender of her children that she would allow sin upon them, allow them to be passionate, unthankful, disobedient, heady, high-minded--and yet excuse this and cover it from others' eyes and even from her own eyes. In this she is partaker of their wrongs and has been sustaining them in sin, and the blood of their souls will be in the skirts of her garments and their father's. They can now redeem the past by a reformation on their part, but they can never blot out the results of their great neglect as far as their children are concerned. God holds parents responsible for the conduct of their children in a great degree, for they have [responsibility for] the formation of their characters. . . .",
