    "word": "In a certain place, preparations were being made to clear the land for the erection of a sanitarium. Light was given that there is health in the fragrance of the pine, the cedar, and the fir. And there are several other kinds of trees that have medicinal properties \n\n\n                             -229- \n\nthat are health promoting. Let not such trees be ruthlessly cut down. Better change the site of the building than cut down these evergreen trees. There are lessons for us in these trees. God's Word declares, \"The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.\" David says, \"I am like a green olive tree in the house of the Lord; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.\"",
