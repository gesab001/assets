    "word": "The injunction of the Word of God is \u201cWork out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\u201d God and the human being are to cooperate. All are to work out that which God works in. Students of the Word of God are to use the knowledge they have gained. They are to improve the opportunities that are thrown in their way. With a settled conviction of duty, they are to use their knowledge and influence in any channel, to the end that they may gain more by their use. . . .",
