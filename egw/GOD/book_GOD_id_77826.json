    "word": "\"The Word of God is to stand as the highest educating book in our world, and is to be treated with reverential awe. It is our guide book; we shall receive from it the truth. We need to present the Bible as the great lesson book, to place it in the hands of our children and youth, that they may know Christ, whom to know aright is life eternal. It is the book to be studied by those of middle age and those who are aged.\"--Sp. T. on Ed., p. 233.",
