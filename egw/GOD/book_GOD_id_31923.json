    "word": "Faculties of Mind Not Half Used.--It is important that we should have intermediate schools and academies. . . . From home and abroad are coming many urgent calls for workers. Young men and women, the middle-aged, and in fact all who are able to engage in the Master's service, should be putting their minds to the stretch in an effort to prepare to meet these calls. From the light God has given me, I know that we do not use the faculties of the mind half as diligently as we should in an effort to fit ourselves for greater usefulness.--CT 209 (1903).",
