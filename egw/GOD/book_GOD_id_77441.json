    "word": "The truth of the Bible has no compelling power to lead such souls, against their will, away from sin. The heart temple is used for idols. Darling indulgences which keep them in harmony with the world's practices and maxims, have a controlling power. The love of Jesus is not a ruling principle in the heart, and exercises not a constraining power in the life. I tell you that which I have seen. There are ten thousand times ten thousand of professed Christians over whom the mind and will of Christ have but little controlling power. Multitudes of favors are bestowed by the God of Heaven without awakening one thought of gratitude or thankful return. Individuals of this class find their way into our ranks, and are connected with the institutions which God has established as his instrumentalities to honor his name upon the earth.",
