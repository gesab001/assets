    "word": "The names of all who profess the truth were  mentioned.... Upon one page of the ledger, under the head of \"Fidelity,\" was the name of my husband. His life, character, and all the incidents in our experience, seemed to be brought vividly before my mind. A very few items which impressed me, I will mention. I was shown that God had qualified my husband for a specific work, and in His providence had united us to carry forward this work. Through the Testimonies of His Spirit, He had imparted to him great light. He had cautioned, warned, reproved, and encouraged; \n                                                                           243\nand it was due to the power of His grace that we had been enabled to bear a part in the work from its very commencement. God had miraculously preserved his mental faculties, notwithstanding his physical powers had given out again and again.",
