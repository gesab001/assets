    "word": "Whenever persons are truly converted, their moral taste is changed. In all their expenditures they will have a single purpose: [to] keep the glory of God in view, to have a right influence in the church, and in all their actions to testify to worldlings that they are children of God, that through faith they have been made partakers of Christ's self-denial, of His great love for perishing souls. They will constantly be afraid that they will lift a worldly standard in the place of the banner of Jesus Christ.",
