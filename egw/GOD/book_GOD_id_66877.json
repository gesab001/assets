    "word": "H. R. (H. L. para. 90) \n     God has not changed, neither does He propose to change our physical organism, in order that we may violate a single law without feeling the effects of its violation. . . . By indulging their inclinations and appetites, men violate the laws of life and health; and if they obey conscience, they must be controlled by principle in their eating and dressing, rather than be led by inclination, fashion, and appetite.",
