    "word": "I never took so much comfort with my family as now. Our family has always been so large. But now we only number eight and I can enjoy the company of my children. They can be more under my own watchcare, and I can better train them in the right way. All of us are united for the blessing of God, and morning, noon, and night His sweet blessing distills upon us like the dew, making our hearts glad and strengthening us to fill our place and glorify our Redeemer.--Letter 2a, 1856, p. 2. (To Brother and Sister Loveland, January 24, 1856.)",
