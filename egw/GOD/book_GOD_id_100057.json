    "word": "The Lord casts down all who dare present themselves before Him on their own footing, according to their own ideas, and who behold Him and serve Him in their own way, and in their own strength or lift up their heads before Him in their own righteousness. But to the contrite and penitent and humble He says, Lift thyself up; stand before Me; behold My face with comfort and assurance and with joy; be not afraid. He who would lift himself up in His presence must first prostrate himself at the foot of the cross of Calvary. Then can men be reconciled to God in Christ Jesus, and be clothed with Christ's righteousness. What is it to stand before the Lord? It means to desire His way above all things, that the will of the Lord many be at all time plainly manifested to us, and that we may do nothing from moment to moment but what shall please him and promote His glory. Self is put out of sight; we are to watch for any tokens from the Lord, listen attentively with our mind and heart to hear His voice, His directions and His reproofs and commands, that we may know the way of His commandments. This is walking with God, and this is standing before the Lord. Let self die in you; have humble ideas of yourself; you are not fit to be a teacher, unless you are daily a learner in the cause and works of the Master.",
