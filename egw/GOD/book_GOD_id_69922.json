    "word": "The Jewish teachers prided themselves on their knowledge of the Scriptures, and in the Savior\u2019s answer there was an implied rebuke for their ignorance of the Sacred Writings. \u201cHave ye not read so much as this,\u201d He said, \u201cwhat David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; how he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread . . . ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?\u201d (Luke 6:3, 4). \u201cAnd he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath\u201d (Mark 2:27). \u201cHave ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple\u201d (Matthew 12:5, 6). \u201cThe Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath\u201d (Mark 2:28). . . .",
