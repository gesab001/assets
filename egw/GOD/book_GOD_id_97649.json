    "word": "God will let His blessing rest upon us if we will open our hearts \n\n\n                -18- \n\nto Him. Every step is by faith. We will have to know by experience what it is to fight the good fight of faith. But do not, for your soul's sake, for Christ's sake, express one word of mistrust or want of faith. When you get that word of thankfulness in your heart, there will not be one word of murmuring, but instead of that, praise. Whoso offereth praise glorifieth God. It is not only our privilege but our duty to sing and make melody in our hearts to God.",
