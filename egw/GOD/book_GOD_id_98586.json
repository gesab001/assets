    "word": "At the present time, but very little is being done in Portland. There are three aged ministers living there because the climate is favorable for their health, but they are unable to do much aggressive work. At the camp meeting held there last summer, there was a good attendance of unbelievers. Our brethren had to provide extra seats to accommodate those that came.
