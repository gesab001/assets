    "word": "Then who of us have entered the service to expect the conveniences of life, to be off duty when we please, laying aside the soldier's armor and putting on the civilian's dress, sleeping at the post of duty, and so exposing the cause of God to reproach?

God will not reward men and women in the next world for seeking to be comfortable in this.",
