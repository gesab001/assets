    "word": "Now for instance some one may tell you that Sister White don't eat meat. \"Now I want you not to eat it, because Sister White doesn't eat it.\" Well, I wouldn't care a farthing for anything like that.

Whosoever defileth the temple of God, him will God destroy. Now I want you to see these things, and not to make any human being your criterion.",
