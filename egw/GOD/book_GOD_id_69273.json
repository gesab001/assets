    "word": "\"Ye are the salt of the earth.\" \n Matthew 5:13. \n\n\n     Salt is valued for its preservative properties; and when God calls His children salt, He would teach them that His purpose in making them the subjects of His grace is that they may become agents in saving others. The object of God in choosing a people before all the world was not only that He might adopt them as His sons and daughters, but that through them the world might receive the grace that bringeth salvation. Titus 2:11. When the Lord chose Abraham, \n                                                                           36\nit was not simply to be the special friend of God, but to be a medium of the peculiar privileges the Lord desired to bestow upon the nations. Jesus, in that last prayer with His disciples before His crucifixion, said, \"For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.\" John 17:19. In like manner Christians who are purified through the truth will possess saving qualities that preserve the world from utter moral corruption.",
