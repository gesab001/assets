    "word": "No provision has been made for Christians to draw apart from each other. By our unity and love we are to reveal the character of Christ. \"Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour\" (Ephesians 5:1, 2). There is a class named in this chapter that we are not to associate with. If we cannot lift them up, they will pull us down. We know the will of God. Shall we not practice His word? Shall we not love each other as brethren? [Colossians 3:12-17 quoted.]",
