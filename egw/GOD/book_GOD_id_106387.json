    "word": "It is not the Lord's will that at this time, other men, whatever their age or experience, shall take the place of these brethren. It would not be pleasing to Him for us to set them aside by calling others to fill their places. He will continue to work out His will through them if they will walk humbly before him. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. As they labor in humility, they will have the assurance that growth in grace is sown by increased ability to grasp the great truths of the gospel, and to teach these truths. When men place themselves in a position where they can work out God's purposes, He stands at their right hand, to open ways of advance for them.",
