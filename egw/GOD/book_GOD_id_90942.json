    "word": "When one has such a breadth of intelligence that he has outgrown his simplicity and dependence upon God, then we cannot depend on him, for Christ says, \"Without Me, ye can do nothing.\" When by faith we have a right hold from above, we have an experience that we are walking with God as did Enoch. We have nothing to fear in an emergency. They that are for us are more than they that can be against us. If we are wholly consecrated to God, we shall be laborers together with Him.",
