    "word": "I was so sorry when I heard that Elder Reaser was undermining the confidence of the people in the testimonies God had been giving to His people for the past sixty years.

Then when his letter came, acknowledging his belief in the messages, I was filled with joy. The Lord would not now be dishonored; Brother Reaser would not now be so taken up with his own ideas that he could turn away from the testimonies.",
