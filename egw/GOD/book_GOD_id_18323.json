    "word": "Solomon was endowed with wonderful wisdom; but the world drew him away from God. We need to guard our souls with all diligence, lest the cares and the attractions of the world absorb the time that should be given to eternal things. God warned Solomon of his danger, and today He warns us not to imperil our souls by affinity with the world. \"Come out from among them,\" He pleads, \"and be ye separate, \n                                                                           503\n. . . and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord God Almighty.\"--Review and Herald, February 1, 1906.",
