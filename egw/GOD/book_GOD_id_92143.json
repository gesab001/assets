    "word": "From those who have rejected truth, the light of God has departed. They did not heed the message of the True Witness, \"I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see\" [Revelation 3:18]. But that message will do its work, and a people will be prepared to stand without fault before God.",
