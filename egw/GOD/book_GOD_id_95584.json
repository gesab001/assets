    "word": "The true happiness of the people of God depends upon righteousness of life and purity of character and true benevolence of heart. When their will harmonizes with the will of God; when they act as they know is right toward God and their fellow men, then they may claim peace and rest in Jesus Christ--peace, the peace of Christ, not the peace the world gives, that peace which is the happiness which comes as the result of obedience to God, and righteousness or right acting in this life. The heart is in harmony with God, they have the love of God in their heart and the love for their fellow men; perfect love united to a perfect life constitutes true happiness.",
