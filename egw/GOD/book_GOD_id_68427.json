    "word": "How strongly and brightly shines the mercy and lovingkindness of God in His dealings toward His heritage. . . . All heaven has the deepest interest in our welfare, that Satan shall not control us and conform us to his character. \"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall\" (Malachi 4:1, 2). . . .",
