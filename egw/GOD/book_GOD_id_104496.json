The drugging business has done more harm to our world and killed more than it has helped or cured. The light was first given to me why institutions should be established, that is, sanitariums were to reform the medical practices of physicians. This is God's method. The herbs that grow for the benefit of man, and the little handful of herbs kept and steeped for sudden ailments, have served tenfold, yes, one hundred-fold better purpose, than all the drugs hidden under mysterious names and dealt out to the sick. It is a delusion and farce, and the Lord has revealed to me that this practice would not preserve life, but would introduce into the system those things which should never be there, for they would do a deleterious work on the human organism.",
