    "word": "In the days of Christ there were many who incurred deep guilt because they denounced His teaching, without carefully investigating its claims to their attention. We are sorry to say that similar guilt is incurred today through a similar cause. There are many who hear the words of Christ, but they do not in moral independence go to the Word of God to search the Scriptures and see whether or not these things are so. Though they have souls to save or to lose, they dare to rely upon the interpretation and application that their religious teachers give. God has endowed men with reasoning powers, that they may compare Scripture with Scripture, and know for themselves what is truth, that they may be able to give a reason for the hope that is within them, with meekness and fear. When the Lord graciously sends to us the means of knowing the truth, and we turn from the precious privilege, and are indifferent to His message, we insult the spirit of God, and we shall walk in darkness and stumble in unbelief.",
