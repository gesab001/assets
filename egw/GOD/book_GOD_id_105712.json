    "word": "Now, brethren, I will tell you what to do, my brethren physicians: You just come right to the heart. Don\u2019t draw yourselves off and shut yourself right into a little groove. No. You expect everyone is going to sympathize with the work that you have, and then you just take right hold and receive counsel and give counsel, and work together. Now this is where there is going to be the danger\u2014that these doctors are going to overwork\u2014but you must not do it. The Lord does not want them to slay themselves in the work they are doing. He wants them to be sensible; God has given us sense to lay a portion of the load on those who are going to take it.",
