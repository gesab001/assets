    "word": "Will the message to the Laodicean church now be heeded? Christ represents Himself as being disgusted with the churches of today. He cannot endure their taste; but yet He offers for them a word of hope. \"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.\" Let every one heed the words that come to the people of God today, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" Shall we by confessing our sins, seek the Lord before the terrible spirit from beneath becomes the sole ruling power in our lives?--Ms 139, 1903. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Oct. 1, 1987. Entire Ms.",
