    "word": "I meant to have laid open before you plainly the things the Lord had been pleased to open before me in regard to the elements connected with the Health Retreat. I had a long, tedious, painful effort to set things in order there. It nearly killed me, for I carried the burden upon my soul day and night. I have in the fear of God related to the board and to Elder Rice and to all parties concerned, where they were deficient and where they must reform. We could no longer keep Elder Rice connected with the Health Retreat, not because he did wrong in his imprudence with his course of familiarity with Mrs. Heald, but his management in other things was so unsafe.",
