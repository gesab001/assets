    "word": "Will you not accept the invitation, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Christ's life, from beginning to end, was a life of meekness and humility. He was the Majesty of heaven, yet He came to our world to take His position at the head of the fallen race, and in human nature to reveal the character that all must form who are admitted into the city of God. He came to show the power of the sanctification of body, soul, and spirit that we must possess if we gain the life that measures with the life of God.",
