    "word": "We should never stir up strife by domineering words and actions. Put away everything like hard dealing, and seek for a closer walk with God. You used to be a more meek and humble man than you are now. You need the refining grace of God, the meekness of Christ. There is a work allotted to you that no one can do for you. \"Holding forth the word of life,\" you are to practically set forth a Christian example. \"Do all things without murmuring or disputing: That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world: Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain\" (Philippians 2:14-16).",
