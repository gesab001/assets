    "word": "If we would see light in God's light, we must abide in Christ. The soul must receive strength and nourishment from the living Vine. The apostle says, \"Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?\" But stubbornness effectually bars the way to the entrance of the Spirit of God. Stubbornness does not profit; it is the fruit of selfishness, and the only cure for it is to cut it up from the heart by the roots. Often the outward manifestation of selfishness is done away for a time, but its hateful fruit will again appear as do the leaves of a tree that has been cut down, but whose root remains. If a fiber of selfishness is left, it will spring forth again, and bear a harvest after its kind.",
