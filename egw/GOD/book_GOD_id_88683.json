    "word": "My dear boy [W. C. White], we trust you will yet be a blessing to others. Oh, Willie, I do want that you should glorify God in your life. This world, this life, is of but little account; the better life, the better world, live for this, my precious boy, and you will never regret it. No, never. I can never express the love I feel for you, my boy, yet I had rather bury you as much as I love you, rather than to have you forget God. Heaven, heaven, nothing is sure but heaven. Pray to your heavenly Father for strength and health of body and mind.--Letter 12, 1870, p. 2. (To W. C. White, September 6, 1870.)",
