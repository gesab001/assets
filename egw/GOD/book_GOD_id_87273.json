    "word": "Instead of bemoaning your weakness, and talking unbelief, and feeling that you are hardly used, begin to sing. Talk of the mercy and love of God. To all who labor and are heavy laden Christ gives the invitation, \"Come unto Me, . . . and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" This is the lesson that Christ desires you to learn, and in learning it you will find rest.",
