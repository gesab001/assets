    "word": "Humility. \n\n     When he who is a co-laborer with Christ, presses home the truth to the sinner's heart in humility and love, the voice of love speaks through the human instrumentality. Heavenly intelligences work with a consecrated, human agent, and the Spirit operates upon the soul of the unbeliever. Efficiency to believe comes from God to the heart, and the sinner accepts the evidence of God's word. Through the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit he is \n\n\n                           - 54 - \n\nchanged, and becomes one with Christ in spirit and purpose. His affection for God increases, he hungers after righteousness, and longs to be more like his master. By beholding Christ, he is changed from glory to glory, from character to character, and becomes more and more like Jesus. He is imbued with love for Christ and filled with a deep, unresting love for perishing souls, and Christ is formed within, the hope of glory. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\"",
