    "word": "When the child seeks to get nearest to his father, above every other person, he shows his love, his faith, his perfect trust.

The Lord bids us, \"Look unto Me, and be ye saved!\" \"Come unto Me, . . . and I will give you rest.\" \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"",
