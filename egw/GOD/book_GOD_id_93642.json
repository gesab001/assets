    "word": "When we are willing to have our own minds unsoldered, and resoldered by the melting influences of the Spirit of God, we shall understand with new enlightenment Christ's instruction to us as recorded in the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth chapters of John. Oh, how great are the possibilities that He has placed without our reach! He says, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you.\" He promises to come to us as a Comforter to bless us. Why do we not believe these promises? That which we lack in faith we make up by the use of drugs. Let us give up the drugs, believing that Jesus does not desire us to be sick, and that if we live according to the principles of health reform, He will keep us well.",
