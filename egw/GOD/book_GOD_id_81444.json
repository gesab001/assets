    "word": "God has furnished man with plentiful means for the gratification of natural appetite. He has spread before him a bountiful variety in the products of the earth that are palatable to the taste, and nutritious to the system. Of these, saith our benevolent Heavenly Father, \"ye may freely eat.\" We may enjoy the fruits, the vegetables, and grains, without doing violence to the laws of our being. Grains, fruits, and vegetables, prepared in the most simple and natural manner, will nourish the body, and preserve its natural vigor without the use of flesh-meats.",
