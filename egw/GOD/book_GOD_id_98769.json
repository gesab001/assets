    "word": "\"Some one has told her.\" This, then is the measure of your faith. But though you say this, you know better. I charge this upon you in the name of the Lord. But I will not argue about the matter. If you cavil over the instruction that God has given, refusing to accept it as truth, under the subterfuge that all unrepentant sinners have used and will continue to use, the guilt is your own. But so long as the Lord presents before me you case and your dangers, I shall not cease to warn you. If you will not take heed, if you refuse to change, I must then present the instruction given me to those in responsible positions, that the people of God may not be leavened by the influence of your erroneous position.",
