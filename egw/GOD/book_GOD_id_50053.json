    "word": "The Lord himself has spoken upon this subject of the care of the body. He says in his word, \"If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\" 1 Corinthians 3:17 (R. V.). This scripture enjoins a conscientious care of the body, and condemns all ignorant or careless neglect. And again: \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\" 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20; 10:31. \n                                                                           35",
