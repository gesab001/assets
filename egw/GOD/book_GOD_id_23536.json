    "word": "FAMILIES AND FRIENDS REUNITED.\u2014The living righteous are changed \u201cin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.\u201d At the voice of God they were glorified; now they are made immortal and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the air. Angels \u201cgather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\u201d Little\n46\nchildren are borne by holy angels to their mothers\u2019 arms. Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to part, and with songs of gladness ascend together to the City of God.",
