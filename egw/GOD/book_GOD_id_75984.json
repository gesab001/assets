    "word": "Carry the Light to Many Places.\" \n\n                      Sanitarium, Cal., Aug. 17, 1905. \n\n\n     God has not given us the work of erecting immense sanitariums to be used as health resorts for all who may come. Neither is it his purpose that medical missionary workers shall spend a long term of years in college before they enter the field. Let the young men and women who know the truth go to work, not in places where the truth has been proclaimed, but in places that have not heard the message, and let them work as canvassers and evangelists. Let the teachers of these youth take them away from the place where God has indicated by his judgments that they should not be.",
