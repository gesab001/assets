    "word": "Do not feel that you must seek for amusements. When your heart is brought into harmony with God, then you will have fullness of joy, and you will sing the praises of God out of a full heart. What we need is practical religion, not as an outside garment, but reaching to the very inmost part of our being. Then we can teach one another, and we can speak in the tenderness of Christ. Let us hide in Christ. Would that we all stood covered with humility as with a garment, that we were in active communion with Jesus Christ. Then no one would feel it to be his duty to tear down the work of any other workman. Then there would be a spirit of kindness and tenderness among all the laborers for God. God desires us to respect one another. Those who have learned to wear the yoke of Christ will know that it is a yoke of love and tenderness.",
