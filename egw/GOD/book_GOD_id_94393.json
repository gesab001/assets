    "word": "My sister, never, never yield to the temptation to sacrifice Christian principle in order to meet the world's criterion. Be firm; be faithful; for you are bought with a price. Your duty to your Saviour may not lead you in the smoothest paths, for your Redeemer never walked in paths of self-pleasing and self-indulgence. He lived not to please Himself. He went without the camp, bearing the reproach. Wherever providence has placed you, God will give you strength to stand firm in the faith. Let nothing interpose between your soul and God.",
