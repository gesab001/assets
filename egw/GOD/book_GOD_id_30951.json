    "word": "Chap. 9 - Partnership With God\n\n     You have within your reach more than finite possibilities. A man, as God applies the term, is a son of God. \"Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\" It is your privilege to turn away from that which is cheap and inferior, and rise to a high standard,--to be respected by men and beloved by God.",
