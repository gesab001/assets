    "word": "Those who audit the accounts of the workers should not settle with such workers as Brother _____ according to the precise time they have spent in preaching sermons. Their practical work is of more value than any number of sermons, for it is the gospel lived, the gospel acted. The manner in which Brother _____ has been treated needs correction. The time he has spent in establishing schools and building meetinghouses is not to be counted out. In his practical work he was preparing minds to understand the truth as it is in Jesus. It is such men as this that God has honored. But the work He has originated and blessed men have passed by with scarcely a word of encouragement. Workers He has sent out have been settled with by the auditing committee in a way not proportionate to the work they have done.",
