    "word": "Pray much; walk humbly with God; make personal efforts. If self is hidden with Christ in God, you will have scriptural, religious life and energy. We must keep asking earnestly. Make short prayers in meetings, and lengthy prayers when you talk and commune with God in your closet. We daily need to be imbued and sustained by His life-giving power. The requirement is \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself\" (Luke 10:27). Zeal, earnestness, and fervor belong to true worship, for God is a Spirit, and He seeketh such to worship Him who worship Him in Spirit and in truth.",
