    "word": "God is displeased when fellow laborers in His vineyard shut up their sympathy to themselves, esteem themselves highly, and cannot see the good purposes, the noble efforts, of their fellow laborers, but live as if they felt no pitying love or tender sympathy. I have been shown that love, tender love and consideration for our fellow mortals, needs to be cultivated, for it is very essential and is the most valuable trait of Christian character we can have. We must learn to place the best possible construction upon [the] doubtful conduct of others. We shall be very unhappy if we place ourselves in a position to question and criticize as an enemy every man who does not greet us with a smile.",
