    "word": "Baptism \n     By baptism you have taken upon you a solemn pledge. In the name and presence of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, you have solemnly covenanted to be the Lord's. \"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, \n\n\n                                           -26- \n\nlive any longer therein? Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.\" I think that if we all understood the sacred ceremony, we should see much more in it than we now discern.",
