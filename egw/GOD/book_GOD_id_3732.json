God and angels, and those united with them, have been inviting, urging people to repentance and holiness and heaven; while Satan and his angels, and human agents inspired by them, have been opposing every effort to benefit and save the fallen race.\u2014The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 4, pp. 218-220.",
