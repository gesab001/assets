    "word": "God will use consecrated ability in His service. As His servants impart to others that which they have received, He will entrust them with more to impart. And as they are enabled through His grace to accomplish good, they are to ascribe all the glory to Him who is the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last. Thus divinity and humanity work together. Men become laborers together with God, working out their own salvation with fear and trembling, realizing always that it is God who works in them, to will and to do of His good pleasure.",
