    "word": "Talk of Blessings, Less of Trials.--The Lord's merciful kindness is great toward us. He will never leave nor \n\n460 \n\nforsake those who trust in Him. If we would think and talk less of our trials and more of the mercy and goodness of God, we would find ourselves raised above much of our gloom and perplexity. My brethren and sisters, you who feel that you are entering upon a dark path, and like the captives in Babylon must hang your harps upon the willows, let us make trial of cheerful song.",
