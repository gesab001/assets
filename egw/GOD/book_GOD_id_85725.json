    "word": "MR No. 375 - Race Relations and Ecumenism\n\n     Those who work this field [the Southern States] must practice self-denial, and facilities must be provided wherewith they can work the field. Missionaries are wanted. God calls for them to take up their neglected duties. But the missionaries must not be sent to this field without the facilities to carry forward the work. Means are required. Let farmers, financiers, and builders come in and use their art and craft to improve lands, to build humble cottages, for this field can be made a fruitful field.--Letter 80a, 1895, pp. 4, 5. (To \"Dear Children,\" August 16, 1895.)",
