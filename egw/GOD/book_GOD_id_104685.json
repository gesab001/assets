    "word": "Brother Simpson's meetings were largely attended, and the people listened to his words with spellbound interest; the interest continued from first to last. With his Bible in his hand, and basing all his arguments on the word of God, Brother Simpson traced out before them the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. His own words were few; he made the Scriptures themselves explain the truth to the people. After giving them the truth, Elder Simpson would draw an expression of opinion from his congregation. \"Now,\" he would say, \"those who see the truth of what I am saying, raise your hands;\" and in response many hands would be raised. I can only poorly represent to you the interest his work has created.",
