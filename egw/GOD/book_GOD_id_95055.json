    "word": "My brother, unless you change square about, calling sin sin, and deception by its right name, you will continue to deny God, and the hindrance to right doing will become stronger and stronger. Yield no longer to the deceptive power of sin. Let your scientific researches be turned into a wholesome channel. Do not pretend to have fellowship with God while you are an alien from Him. Fellowship it is impossible for you to have while you yourself make it impossible to recognize what God is and what you are.",
