    "word": "God sent a message to Nineveh by his servant Jonah, saying, \"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.\" \"And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, saying, Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching I bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.\"",
