    "word": "We sent Brother A. . . . to the institute at St. Helena. . . . He is a great sufferer. I have appropriated three hundred dollars to this case, although there are many cases where every dollar is needed, but I feel perfectly clear in helping in this case. It is a case where those who love and fear God must show their sympathy in a tangible manner and bear in mind that Christ identified his interest with suffering humanity.--Letters 79 and 33, 1893.",
