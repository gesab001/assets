    "word": "A great and solemn work is before us \u2014 to reach the people where they are. Do not feel it your bounden duty the first thing to tell the people, \u201cWe are Seventh-day Adventists; we believe the seventh day is the Sabbath; we believe in the non-immortality of the soul,\u201d and thus erect most formidable barriers between you and those you wish to reach. But speak to them, as you may have \n18\nopportunity, upon points of doctrine wherein you can agree, and dwell on practical godliness. Give them evidence that you are a Christian, desiring peace, and that you love their souls. Let them see that you are conscientious. Thus you will gain their confidence, and then there will be time enough for the doctrines. Let the hard iron heart be subdued, the soil prepared, and then lead them along cautiously, presenting in love the truth as it is in Jesus Christ.",
