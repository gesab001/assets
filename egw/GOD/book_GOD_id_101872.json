    "word": "God has shown his people what is truth. He has opened to them the books of Daniel and Revelation, which set forth the truth for this time. Those who have closed their ears and their understanding to this truth, have imitated the people who in Christ's day would not receive the light. Evidence may be piled upon evidence, but men's hearts may be so hardened by the deceitfulness of sin that evidence, though greatly increased, will prove nothing to them, because it is not proof they want, but their own way.",
