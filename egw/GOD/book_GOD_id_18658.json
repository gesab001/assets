    "word": "By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave us an example of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey. . . . The Child of Bethlehem, the meek and lowly Saviour, is God \"manifest in the flesh\" (1 Timothy 3:16). . . . \"God with us\" is the surety of our deliverance from sin, the assurance of our power to obey the law of heaven. . . .",
