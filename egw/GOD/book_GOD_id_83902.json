    "word": "As I looked at this building, very large and roomy, constructed with logs and shingled upon the outside with tile-like shingles, I thought of the worshipers. They had been standing in positions generations back without making any advance. Old arbitrary laws made long ago, the most cruel and heartless, they had not life or light enough to change. They were retaining barbaric practices in their laws, not discerning the unreasonableness of their proceedings in this enlightened age. God had said to His people, \"Go forward\"; but this old State Church said, \"No, I will stand still; I will do as my fathers have done before me.\"  If they had only lived up to the light and been as conscientious as their fathers were, then they would have been better men. But they did not even have the piety their fathers had, and they will not walk in the increased light which shines from God's word upon their pathway. They do not do as their fathers would have done had they been in their place.",
