    "word": "The work of the Christian physician is to bear on its face the nature of self-denial, and not have even the appearance of fraud and extortion. It has become general among physicians who have not the fear of God before them, to hide that which is plain and simple in the guise of mystery. When dealing with humanity, Jesus made every dark thing plain to the understanding of men, and promised at His ascension to send the Comforter, whose office was to reveal truth.",
