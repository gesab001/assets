    "word": "Praying and seeking the Lord, the surrender of the man, J. H. Kellogg, to the guidance of God, would have prevented the creating of many things which have been born, not of the will of God, but of the will of men. You were given your appointed work, but you have neglected things of great importance to take up with your own impulsive spirit, unadvised by the Lord or your brethren, things of minor importance. The brethren could have given you counsel, but you despised any word that interfered with your schemes, which have placed you in an intricate position. Had you done your appointed work, God would have made you a laborer with Him.",
