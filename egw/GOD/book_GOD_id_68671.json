    "word": "I would say to my brethren and sisters, \"Keep close to the instruction found in the Word of God. Dwell upon the rich truths of the Scriptures. Thus only can you become one in Christ. You have no time to engage in controversy regarding the killing of insects. Jesus has not placed this burden upon you. \"What is the chaff to the wheat?\" (Jeremiah 23:28). The attributes of Christ are to be studied and earnestly sought for, that every believer may be complete in Him, revealing the beauty of His character. We have no time for empty, foolish talk. Let us dwell upon the solemn, sacred truths for this time. . . .",
