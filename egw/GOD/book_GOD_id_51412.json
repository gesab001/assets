    "word": "Jesus spoke these words with sadness and with singular power. The Roman officers were silenced and subdued. Their hearts, though strangers to divine influence, were moved as they had never been moved before; and a sudden hush fell upon the multitude.

Before them was a man of humble mien, but of Godlike bearing. They were more inclined to pay him homage than to arrest him for insurrection.",
