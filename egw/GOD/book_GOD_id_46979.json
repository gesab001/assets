This idolatrous nation was given a knowledge of the kingdom the Lord was to establish, and through His power maintain against all the power and craft of Satan. Daniel and his fellow-companions, Ezra and Nehemiah, and many others were witnesses for God in their captivity.

God's faithfulness in rescuing the three captives from the flames and vindicating their course of action showed His wonderful power.",
