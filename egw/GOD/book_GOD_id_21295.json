    "word": "Remission of Sins \n\n     \"Whosesoever sins ye remit,\" said Christ, \"they are remitted; . . . and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.\" [John 20:23.] Christ here gives no liberty for any man to pass judgment upon others. In the sermon on the mount He forbade this. It is the prerogative of God. But on the church in its organized capacity He places a responsibility for the individual members. Toward those who fall into sin, the church has a duty, to warn, to instruct, and if possible to restore. \"Reprove, rebuke, exhort,\" the Lord says, \"with all long-suffering and doctrine.\" [2 Timothy 4:2.]",
