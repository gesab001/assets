    "word": "To the older ones who are present, I wish to say, Set before the younger ones an example that will help them to press forward in the upward way. Remember that your words and acts have an influence upon them for good or for evil. It is unworthy [for] a Christian to neglect to make every effort in his power to help those for whom the Saviour gave His life. Christ died that we might live, and we want to be sure that we are trying to do His will. Then we shall be acceptable to Him. Angels of God will be near to help us, and we shall realize the aid of a power above ourselves.",
