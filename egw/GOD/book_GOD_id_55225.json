    "word": "The Lord has shown me the error of many in looking to those only who have property to support the publication of the paper and tracts. All should act their part. Those who have strength to labor with their hands, and earn means to help sustain the cause, are as accountable for it as others are for their property. Every child of God, who professes to believe the present truth, should be zealous to act his part in this cause. \n                                                                           14",
