    "word": "July 5, 1892. I am greatly distressed in mind. I see matters that need to be changed. Sister Daniells is greatly deceived in regard to her spiritual condition. She feels that she is far in advance of her husband and would instruct him. Whether with him or away from him, she assumes this attitude. She married him when his condition, as far as his health and usefulness were concerned, was not encouraging. Having done this, she feels that he is indebted to her for his advancement. But she should not cherish this thought, for it is not true. Elder Daniells is the Lord's child, and if Sister Daniells had not married him, God would still have led him onward and upward. But she did marry him, and therefore it was plainly her part to help him all she could.",
