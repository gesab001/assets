    "word": "The time of trouble is before us. The angels are, as it were, just loosening the four winds, but they cannot loose them yet. The church is too far behind her privileges. The people of God are too indolent. Many are unfaithful; many are unclean and polluted. We are not prepared for the crisis. The question is, How long will God wait for our tardy movements? Instead of lying before God in humility, man has exalted himself and has indulged in high ideas of his own importance and loftiness, and his eyes have been closed to the glory of Christ. When Christ beams forth upon the soul, all glory is rendered unto Him who is seen to be the only One full of grace and truth. His glory alone should fill the soul.",
