    "word": "God's truth is being revealed to men, but in this age there are many false teachers who turn away the ears of the people from the commandments of God. But we should enquire, What is truth? What does the Word say? And our anxiety should be, What can I do to save souls? There is great value attached to the souls of men for whom Christ died, and if we neglect to receive and impart the knowledge given we are doing it at the peril of our lives.",
