    "word": "All who study the word are represented as eating the word, feeding on Christ. . . . Even as the bodily necessities must be supplied daily, so the word of God must be daily studied--eaten and digested and practiced. This sustains the nourishment, to keep the soul in health.--Letter 4, 1902, p. 3. (To Dear Granddaughters, Ella and Mabel White,\" Jan. 1, 1902.)",
