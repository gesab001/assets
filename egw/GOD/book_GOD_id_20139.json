    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     The apostle Paul, in describing his manner of labor, says: \u201cThough I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are \n300\nunder the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; to them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.\u201d [1 Corinthians 9:19-22.]",
