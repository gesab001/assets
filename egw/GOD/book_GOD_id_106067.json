    "word": "Inquire, teachers, you who are doing your work not only for time but eternity. Does the love of Christ constrain your heart and your \n\n\n                                    -107- \n\nsoul, in dealing with the precious souls for whom Jesus has given his own life? Under his constraining discipline do old traits of character, that are not in conformity to the will of God, pass away and the opposite take their place? \"A new heart will I give thee.\" Have all things become new through your conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ? In words and by painstaking effort are you sowing such seed in these young hearts that you can ask the Lord to water it, that it shall, with his imputed righteousness, ripen into a rich harvest? Ask yourself, Am I by my own unsanctified words and impatience and want of that wisdom that is from above, confirming these youth in their perverse spirit because they see that their teacher has a spirit unlike Christ? If they should die in their sins, shall I not be accountable for their souls? The soul who loves Jesus, who appreciates the saving power of his grace will feel such a drawing near to Christ, that he will desire to work in his lines. He can not, dare not, let Satan control his spirit and a poisonous miasma surround his soul. Everything will be placed one side that will corrupt his influence, because it opposes the will of God and endangers the souls of the precious sheep and lambs, and he is required to watch for souls as they that must give an account. Wherever God has, in providence, placed us, he will keep us; as our day, our strength shall be.",
