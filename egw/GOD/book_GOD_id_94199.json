    "word": "Our physicians need a deeper insight into the evangelistic work that God expects them to do. Let them remember that if they do not work for the healing of the soul as well as for the healing of the body, they are not following the example of the great Medical Missionary. Let them study the Word of God diligently, that they may be familiar with its promises, and may be able, in tenderness and love, to point sinners to the Great Healer.",
