    "word": "The Lord sees every human being: He denotes every phase of character. In the great day of judgment He will execute the sentence against the sinner. It will then be seen that the sinner's conduct has never stopped with himself. Every departure from righteousness has a vital relation to His divine laws. Had we eyes as the eyes of God we would be able to see in the tiny seed the flower or shrub or tree therein enclosed. God made it thus. He searches the heart. He will look into our motives as He looks into the seed and He will reveal what we are and what we should have been.",
