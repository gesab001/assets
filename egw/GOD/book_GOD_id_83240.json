    "word": "Mountains contain God's blessings. I have seen men and women look upon the majesty of mountains as though they were really a deformity of nature. They would sigh and say, \"How needless! Let me have the level plain, the broad prairies, and I should be happy.\" The mountains contain treasures of blessings which the Creator bestows upon the inhabitants of the earth. It is the diversity in the surface of the earth, in mountains, plains, and valleys, which reveals the wisdom and the power of the great Master Worker. And those who would banish from our earth the rocks and mountains, the wild gorges and the noisy, rushing streams, and the precipices, as unsightly deformities in nature, and would have a smooth level--their senses are too limited to comprehend the majesty of God. Their minds are bound about with narrow ideas.",
