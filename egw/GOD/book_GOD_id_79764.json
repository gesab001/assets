Their unsanctified dispositions will work contrary to God, and their principles have nearly ruined the cause of God, and have brought in a condition of things that the General Conference is laboring hard to undo. If those men who, by their course of action, by working at cross purposes with God, have done the cause of God an injury, will lay down their supposed wise reasonings and listen to the messages of mercy sent them, they will find pardon. But if they continue to hinder the work of God as they have done, the Lord will say, He is joined to his idols, let him alone.",
