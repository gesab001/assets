    "word": "John was deprived of the society of his brethren and of the pleasure of association. But no man could deprive him of the light and revelation of Christ. A great light was to shine from Christ to His servant. Richly favored was this beloved disciple. With the other disciples he had traveled with Jesus, learning of Him and feasting on His word. His head had often rested on his Saviour's bosom. But he must see Him also in Patmos. On the holy Sabbath day, the risen Saviour made His presence known to John; and the testimony then given him is given also to us. God would have us search the Scriptures, that we may know what will be in the last days of this earth's history.",
