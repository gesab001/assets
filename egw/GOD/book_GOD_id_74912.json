    "word": "Enoch in his day sounded the proclamation of the coming of Christ, and the execution of judgment upon the unrighteous; and we now see the fulfilment of Enoch's prophecy concerning the great wickedness that should abound. But these who have the light are \n\n\n                          - 3 - \n\nthe very ones commissioned of God to make constantly aggressive warfare. As the inquiry shall be made, \"Watchman, what of the night?\" the faithful message is to be heard in response, \"The morning cometh, and also the night.\" The influence of truth is too much restricted. Let men who know the truth be urged to communicate truth to those who are in darkness. Many are satisfied with a view of truth, but they have not yet stepped into their place to communicate that which they have received. God has let men feel the power of truth, but they are not all doing their appointed work in seeking to save that which was lost. Every one is to have the armor on, prepared to win others to obedience to the law of God. I see so much given to those who already have; these wonderful meetings for those who wish to get more strength, are depriving the world of the very work that should be done. Our ministers should now be working for the saving of the lost. The weeks spent in gatherings to fit men for work might better, far better, be spent in going to the highways and hedges with the proclamation, \"Come, for all things are now ready.\"",
