    "word": "\"I Daniel alone saw the vision. . . . And there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption\" (Daniel 10:7, 8). . . . All who are truly sanctified will have a similar experience. The clearer their views of the greatness, glory, and perfection of Christ, the more vividly will they see their own weakness and imperfection. They will have no disposition to claim a sinless character; that which has appeared right and comely in themselves will, in contrast with Christ's purity and glory, appear only as unworthy and corruptible. It is when men are separated from God, when they have very indistinct views of Christ, that they say, \"I am sinless; I am sanctified.\"",
