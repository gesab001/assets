    "word": "Modern Israel have murmured and become jealous of my husband because he has plead for the cause of God. He has encouraged liberality, he has rebuked those who loved this world, and has censured selfishness. He has plead for donations to the cause of God, and has led off by liberal donations himself, to encourage liberality with his brethren; but by many murmurers and jealous ones, even this has been interpreted that he wished to be personally benefited with the means of his brethren, and that he had enriched himself at the expense of the cause of God, when \n                                                                           105\nthe facts in the case are, that God has entrusted means in his hands to raise him above want so that he need not be dependent upon the mercies of a changeable, murmuring, and jealous people. Because we have not selfishly studied our own interest, but have cared for the widow and the fatherless, God has in his providence worked in our behalf, and blessed us with prosperity and an abundance.",
