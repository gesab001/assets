    "word": "The people of God are called to be the light of the world, a city that is set upon a bill, not to be hidden; and if the church is ever to fulfill its divine mission, we must be filled with the love of Jesus. Our hearts must be so full of his matchless grace that when we meet each other, we shall take our brethren by the hand, and say, \"Hear what the Lord hath done for my soul.\" Our minds must be stayed upon God until, by beholding, we shall become changed into the same image. Then we shall talk of the power of God, of the goodness and mercy and love of our heavenly Father; and as we talk of the matchless charms of our divine Redeemer, our hearts will be melted and subdued by the Holy Spirit, and those around us will behold us, and know that we have been with Jesus and learned of him.",
