    "word": "The Lord enters into every house, into every office, into every room, where his work is done. Angels of God are passing and repassing through these offices, and there is a record kept of everything that is done in these places. By this record the workers are to be judged. \"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned;\" every word and action. God is watching, and every one will be rewarded according as his works have been.",
