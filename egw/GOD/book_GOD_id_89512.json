    "word": "Cultivate kindness, gentleness, and love in your heart and in the hearts of your families, at home and in the church of God. The channels of thought, desire, and action must be refined, purified, and ennobled. Rich blessings are in store for the church if they will come into a position to receive them. Look to Jesus constantly, not at the faults of your brethren. Purify the soul temple that has become defiled. Heaven is rich in blessings. Our heavenly Father is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, than parents to give good gifts to their children.",
