    "word": "Christ compares those who hear and obey His Word to a man who builds his house upon a rock. Through their obedience to God, they abide in safety amidst the storm and tempest of temptation. The man who disregards the words which Christ has spoken is building on the sand. When the storm comes, the structure that he has reared will fall, and great will be the fall of it.",
