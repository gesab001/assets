    "word": "Chapter 17 \u2014Prayer in the Home Circle\n\nFAMILIES SHOULD PRAY TOGETHER EVERY MORNING AND EVENING.\u2014Family worship should not be governed by circumstances. You are not to pray occasionally and, when you have a large day\u2019s work to do, neglect it. In thus doing you lead your children to look upon prayer as of no special consequence. Prayer means very much to the children of God, and thank offerings should come up before God morning and evening. Says the psalmist, \u201cO come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.\u201d",
