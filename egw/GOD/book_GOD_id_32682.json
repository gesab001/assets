    "word": "Wearing Nerves on the Outside.--Those who criticize and condemn one another are breaking God's commandments and are an offense to Him. They neither love God \n\n638 \n\nnor their fellow beings. Brethren and sisters, let us clear away the rubbish of criticism and suspicion and complaint, and do not wear your nerves on the outside. Some are so sensitive that they cannot be reasoned with. Be very sensitive in regard to what it means to keep the law of God and in regard to whether you are keeping or breaking the law. It is this that God wants us to be sensitive about.--GCB, Apr 1, 1903 (7BC 937.)",
