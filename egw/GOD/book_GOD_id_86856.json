    "word": "Ellen White Depicts Educational Goals \n\n     The light which has been given me regarding the work of the Avondale school is that we must not pattern after the similitude of any school which has already been established. We must study the word of God critically as our great lesson book, in order to know what the school may become under the guidance of the word of God, if we receive and do that word. Unless we are watchful and guarded, we shall experience the same hindrances to the spiritual education, that have retarded the work of our older schools. This we shall do by a misconception with respect to what is the most essential work to be done by students, and by the teachers for them.",
