    "word": "All Capabilities to Be Developed.--All the varied capabilities that men possess--of mind and soul and body-- are given them by God to be so employed as to reach the \n\n360 \n\nhighest possible degree of excellence. But this cannot be a selfish and exclusive culture; for the character of God, whose likeness we are to receive, is benevolence and love. Every faculty, every attribute, with which the Creator has endowed us is to be employed for His glory and for the uplifting of our fellowmen. And in this employment is found its purest, noblest, and happiest exercise.-- PP 595 (1890).",
