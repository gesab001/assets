    "word": "Chap. Sixty-Five - Provision for the Future\n\n\n     Home Ownership and Savings Versus Spendthrift Habits.--Brother and Sister B have not learned the lesson of economy. . . . They would use all as they pass along, were it ever so much. They would enjoy as they go and then, when affliction draws upon them, would be wholly unprepared. . . . Had Brother and Sister B been economical managers, denying themselves, they could ere this have had a home of their own and besides this have had means to draw upon in case of adversity. But they will not economize as others have done, upon whom they have sometimes been dependent. If they neglect to learn these lessons, their characters will not be found perfect in the day of God.",
