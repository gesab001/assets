    "word": "This is the covering that all who have transgressed the law of God have used since the days of Adam and Eve's disobedience. They have sewn together fig leaves to cover their nakedness caused by transgression and sin. The fig leaves represent the arguments used to cover disobedience. When the Lord calls the attention of men and women to the truth, the making of fig leaves into aprons will commence in order to hide the nakedness of the soul of every transgressor.",
