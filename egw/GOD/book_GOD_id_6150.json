    "word": "In his lessons of instruction to his disciples, Jesus taught them that his kingdom is not a worldly kingdom, where all are striving for the highest position; but he gave them lessons in humility and self-sacrifice for the good of others. His humility did not consist in a low estimate of his own character and qualifications, but in adapting himself to fallen humanity, in order to raise them up with him to a higher life. Yet how few see anything attractive in the humility of Christ! Worldlings are constantly striving to exalt themselves one above another; but Jesus, the Son of God, humbled himself in order to uplift man. The true disciple of Christ will follow his example.",
