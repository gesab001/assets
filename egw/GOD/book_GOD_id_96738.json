    "word": "Lynn, Massachusetts, Sabbath, December 6, 1890 \n\n     I spoke to the people assembled on the Sabbath from John 14. The Lord gave me freedom in speaking to the people. Many had just come into the faith. One family, all at home--father, mother, and three children--embraced the truth. The father is cousin to Edwin Burnham, a First-day Adventist. He was considered one of the most eloquent preachers among the First-day Adventists. He opposed the Sabbath of the fourth commandment with great vigor. He made most extravagant expressions. He stated that the law of God was an old thunder and lightning law, a bloody law; that it was not possible for man to keep that law--that they never could keep it; it was dead and buried and did not deserve a gravestone. He said he always felt better after he had given the law a good run. And now here is a relative by the name of Burnham who has, with nearly all his family, taken hold of the Sabbath!--Ms. 50, 1890, pp. 2-3 (Diary 16, pp. 363-364).",
