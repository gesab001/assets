    "word": "What we want is to be Bible Christians. God has opened to me what stands in the way of the conversion of youth and children--their parents do not treat them aright. There is too much indulgence and too much passion. Now, when they come into the schools, shall they have the same kind of treatment by those who think that what they don't know is not worth knowing? They know it all, when they have scarcely learned the first lessons in the alphabet of self-control, and how to deal with human minds. There is something to learn. God help us to come right to the cross, to see the royal Sufferer upon the cross, and why He suffers. It is to save souls, to bring sons and daughters to God. He gave Himself to save the world. He says, \"Love one another, as I have loved you\" (John 15:12).",
