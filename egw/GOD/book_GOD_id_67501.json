    "word": "Jesus alone is to be exalted. Whatever may be the ability or the success of any one of us, it is not because we have manufactured these powers ourselves; they are the sacred trust given us of God, to be wisely employed in His service to His glory.

What we do possess in talent and wisdom is received from the Source of wisdom, that we may glorify God. . . .",
