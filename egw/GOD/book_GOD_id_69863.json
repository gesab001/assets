    "word": "The test of a genuine Christian is given in the Word of God. Says Jesus, \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments.\u201d . . . Here are the conditions upon which every soul will be elected to eternal life. Your obedience to God\u2019s commandments will prove your right to an inheritance with the saints in light. God has elected a certain excellence of character; and everyone who, through the grace of Christ, shall reach the standard of His requirement will have an abundant entrance into the kingdom of glory. All who would reach this standard of character will have to employ the means that God has provided to this end.",
