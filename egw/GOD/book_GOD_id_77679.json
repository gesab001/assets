You need to feel that in your ministry to the sick you are representing Jesus. \"Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.\" Bear in mind that God is your Guide, your Comforter. What a vineyard you have in which to work! What a field for action! The Lord guides and cheers the humble, meek, and lowly workers as he cheered Moses in his work. In the commonest duties of life we may ask God for wisdom for the work to be done. If the worker receives his commission from God, he will be strengthened and blessed. Dangerous temptations will assail you on every side, but ask of God, as did Moses, for his presence and guidance. The Lord said to Moses, \"Certainly I will be with thee.\" This same assurance is given to every humble, consecrated worker. Let every student, every helper, bear in mind that he is to be daily a living epistle of truth and righteousness.
