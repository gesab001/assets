    "word": "My dear brethren and sisters\u2014Let the commandments of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ be in your minds continually, and let them crowd worldly \n47\nthoughts and cares from the mind. When you lie down and when you rise up let them be your meditation. Live and act wholly in reference to the coming of the Son of man. The sealing time is very short, and soon will be over. Now is the time to make our calling and election sure, while the four angels are holding the four winds.",
