    "word": "How disgraceful are the disclosures that are being made regarding men who have occupied high places in the world. Shall the intrigues practised by these men be practised by the members of the church of God? Shall we  not obey the injunction, \"Honor the Lord with thy substance?\" My brethren and sisters, it was the favor of God that enabled you to gather together your substance. All that you have belongs to him, and cheerfully and gladly yor are to lay your means and talents upon the altar of service, that they may be used in saving perishing souls.",
