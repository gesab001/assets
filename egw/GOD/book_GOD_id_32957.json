    "word": "Aim to Reach a State of Unity.--It is the will of God that union and brotherly love should exist among His people. The prayer of Christ just before His crucifixion was that His disciples might be one as He is one with the Father, that the world might believe that God had sent Him. This most touching and wonderful prayer reaches down the ages, even to our day; for His words were, \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word\" (John 17:20). \n\n798",
