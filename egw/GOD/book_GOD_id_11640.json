    "word": "The authors of these books, which have sown the seeds of doubt and infidelity broadcast over the world, have been under the training of the great enemy of God and man, the acknowledged head of principalities and powers, the ruler of the darkness of this world. The word that God has spoken concerning them is, \"They . . . became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools;\" \"because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful.\" Romans 1:21, 22. They rejected divine truth in its simplicity and purity for the wisdom of this world.",
