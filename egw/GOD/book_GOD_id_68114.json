    "word": "Why do we turn from divine wisdom to human wisdom? God sees the dishonor we do Him. He knows that in humanity we shall find no solace for our woe, and He pities us because we are so needy, yet so unwilling to make Him our confidant, our burden-bearer. He sees human beings slighting the love and mercy provided for them, and He says sadly, \"Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life\" (John 5:40).",
