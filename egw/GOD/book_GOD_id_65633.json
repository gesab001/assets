    "word": "More Light to Those Who Use It \n\n     To those who obey the light they have, illumination will come from on high; for the heavenly messengers are waiting to cooperate with men in warning a deceived, sinful world. When the people of God engage in this work with real travail of soul there will be manifest a decided change in cities and villages. This hovering about churches to keep them propped up makes them more dependent on human effort. They learn to lean on the experience of their fellowmen and do not make God their dependence and their efficiency. It is time that cities and villages everywhere were hearing the solemn note of warning, \"Behold, \n                                                                           232\nHe cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him.\" Get ready that you may be found of Him in peace.",
