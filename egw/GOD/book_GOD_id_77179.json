    "word": "Some of these children profess to be Christians, and parents sleep on, feeling no danger while the minds and bodies of their children are becoming wrecked. Some parents do not even take care to keep their children with them when in the house of God. Young girls have attended meetings and taken their seat, it may be, with their parents, but more frequently back in the congregation. They have been in the habit of making an excuse to leave the house. Boys understand this, and go out before or after the exit of the girls, and then, as the meeting closes, they accompany these girls home. Parents are none the wiser for this. Again, excuses are made to walk, and boys and girls assemble in some out-of-the-way place, resort to the fair grounds, or some other secluded place, and there play, and have a regular, high time, with no experienced eye upon them to caution them. They imitate men and women of advanced age.",
