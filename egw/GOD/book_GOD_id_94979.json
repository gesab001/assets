    "word": "Christ clothed His divinity with humanity and came to our world that He might touch humanity. He came to win man back to his allegiance to God, to teach him to respect himself for the sake of the One who paid an infinite price for his redemption. He has enlisted man in His service to cooperate with Him in the saving of souls. This man may be by being obedient to God's requirements. By precept and example he may win souls to Christ.",
