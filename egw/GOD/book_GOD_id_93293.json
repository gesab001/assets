    "word": "All this spirit of picking flaws in a person's words or deportment, setting one and another on their track to think evil and to communicate evil, is of Satan. Dr. Burke accuses me of having the spirit of the evil one. Dr. Burke, the Lord be judge between thee and me. I present this charge before the Lord. When Ahab met Elijah after he had been doing wicked actions, and when his apostasy affected all Israel, he said to the man whom God had given a message to the king, \"Art thou he that troubleth Israel?\" Elijah answered, \"I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Balaam.\" God has given me my \n\n\n                                     -245- \n\nwork, and that message He gives me I shall bear whatever the consequences may be.",
