    "word": "Safeguard Your Brother's Influence \n     Our religious experience is to be in strict conformity to the word, in which are defined the principles of mercy and the love of God. God calls upon His people to unify as the burdens of the work press upon them. They should engage often in earnest, humble prayer, for the Lord's guidance, and then they should follow His guidance to the letter.",
