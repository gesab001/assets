    "word": "We shall want to hear all about these victories, and shall hear when the Captain of our salvation, our glorious King of kings, opens it before those of whom John writes, \"These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes\" [Revelation 7:14-17].",
