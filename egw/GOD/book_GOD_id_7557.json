    "word": "In every age God's chosen messengers have been reviled and persecuted, yet through their affliction the knowledge of God has been spread abroad. . . . When the noble and eloquent Stephen was stoned to death . . . there was no loss to the cause of the gospel. The light of heaven that glorified his face, the divine compassion breathed in his dying prayer, were as a sharp arrow of conviction to the bigoted Sanhedrist who stood by, and Saul, the persecuting Pharisee, became a chosen vessel to bear the name of Christ before Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.",
