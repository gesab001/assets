    "word": "God will move upon men of humble position in society, men who have not become insensible to the bright rays of light through so long contemplating the light of truth, and refusing to make any improvement or advancement therein.

The truth, the word of God, is as a fire in their bones, filling them with a burning desire to enlighten those who sit in darkness.",
