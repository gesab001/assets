    "word": "There will be those who will accept their misrepresentations, who will drink in of their spirit, who will not only imperil the souls of those to whom God has in mercy sent messages of warning, but by representing them as innocent, abused, mistreated, they will make naught of the counsels of God, giving unsanctifying sympathy to those who were wholly undeserving of it, all because they put confidence in erring mortals more than in God and the working of His Spirit through His appointed agencies who correct wrongs and errors in His people. They put out their own eyes, and cannot discern the workings of the enemy any more than they could discern the workings of the Spirit of God to set things in order. They make impressions upon other minds that have not a knowledge of the real workings of evil or the positive workings of the Spirit of God. Therefore, they call good evil, and evil good.",
