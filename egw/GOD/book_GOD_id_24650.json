    "word": "In all the sufferings and afflictions of man there is an Eye to pity, a Heart to love. \"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him\" (Psalm 103:13). God's tenderest care is exercised over us. He pities us in our weakness and in our sorrow. We may be despondent, even despairing; the heavy clouds of affliction may be over us; but there is light ahead. Beyond the gloom is a sympathetic, compassionate Friend, One who does not willingly grieve or afflict the children of men.",
