    "word": "MR No. 1318 - Blessed Peace, But Not Healing, Received Through Season of Prayer\n\n        (Diary entry January 1, 1902, written in Nashville, Tennessee.) \n\n     I thank my heavenly Father the first day of this New Year that in His merciful kindness He has graciously spared my life that has been in apparent peril. Many prayers have ascended to God in my behalf. There have been several periods of such severe affliction that I thought I could not live through the day. I have been gaining in strength for several days. I have not dared to tax my strength, fearing the result. If the Lord gives me His grace I may be able to communicate some things I greatly desire to those who shall assemble at this gathering of the Southern Union Conference. But I am afraid to move unadvisedly. I have had such strong intimations of sudden death I will not be presumptuous.",
