    "word": "Before entering the city of God, the Saviour bestows upon his followers the emblems of victory, and invests them with the insignia of their royal state. The glittering ranks are \n646\ndrawn up, in the form of a hollow square, about their King, whose form rises in majesty high above saint and angel, whose countenance beams upon them full of benignant love. Throughout the unnumbered host of the redeemed, every glance is fixed upon him, every eye beholds His glory whose \u201cvisage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.\u201d Upon the heads of the overcomers, Jesus with his own right hand places the crown of glory. For each there is a crown, bearing his own \u201cnew name,\u201d [Revelation 2:17.] and the inscription, \u201cHoliness to the Lord.\u201d In every hand are placed the victor's palm and the shining harp. Then, as the commanding angels strike the note, every hand sweeps the harp strings with skillful touch, awaking sweet music in rich, melodious strains. Rapture unutterable thrills every heart, and each voice is raised in grateful praise: \u201cUnto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever.\u201d [Revelation 1:5, 6.]",
