There is but a small number of genuine health reformers in the State. Light and spiritual understanding have been given to the brethren in New York. The truth that has reached the understanding, the light that has shone on the soul, that has not been appreciated and cherished, will witness against them in the day of God. Truth has been given to save those who would believe and obey. Their condemnation is not because they did not have the light, but because they had the light and did not walk in it.",
