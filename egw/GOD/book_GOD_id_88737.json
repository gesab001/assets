    "word": "Dangers of Worldly Higher Education--I am intensely in earnest that our people shall realize that the only true education lies in walking humbly \n\n\n                                     -175- \n\nwith God. The teachings of the Word of God are opposed to the ideas of those who think that our students must receive the mold of an education that is according to human ideas. Some are departing from the faith as a result of receiving from the world what they regard as a \"higher education.\" The Word of God just as it reads contains the very essence of truth. The highest education is the keeping of the law of God.--Letter 132, 1909, p. 4. (To J. A. Burden, October 11, 1909.)",
