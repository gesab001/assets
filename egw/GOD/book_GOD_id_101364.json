    "word": "My brother, the rebuke of God is upon you; for you have discarded the truth. Light has come to you again and again since the Minneapolis meeting, but in rejecting the message God has sent, you have rejected Him. Infidelity is taking your soul captive because you are not yoked up with Christ. You have thought that you were increased in wisdom, but shame and confusion of face will be the portion of all who are not sanctified through the truth. While covering yourself with infidel ideas and theories, you can not wear the garment of Christ's righteousness, and without this garment you can not enter into the marriage supper of the Lamb. God has given you great light, and you will be held accountable for all the privileges you have had to become acquainted with God and His truth.",
