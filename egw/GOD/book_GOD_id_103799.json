    "word": "I am thankful to see so many of my brethren here today--brethren whom I have not seen for a long time. The Lord will surely reveal Himself to His people in this place, that they may communicate the precious truth to all parts of the world. Let us bear in mind that it is faith that leads to perfection of character. I want to be in that position where I can hear the words of my Saviour to me. Let us each endeavor to keep our minds (994) stayed upon God, and prove the Lord whether He will not give us wisdom and guidance at every step.",
