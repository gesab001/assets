    "word": "Facing the New Year \n\n     What of your stewardship? Have you during the past year robbed God in tithes and offerings? Look \n                                                                           98\nat your well-filled barns, at your cellars stored with the good things the Lord has given you, and ask yourselves whether you have returned to the Giver that which belongs to Him. If you have robbed the Lord, make restitution. As far as possible, make the past right, and then ask the Saviour to pardon you. Will you not return to the Lord His own, before this year, with its burden of record, has passed into eternity?-- R. & H., Dec. 23, 1902.",
