    "word": "Jesus assures us that His coming to our world was to save those that were lost, those that were dead in trespasses and sins, those that were strangers and enemies to God. Then will the very men to whom Christ has shown mercy and forgiveness neglect or despise those whom Jesus is seeking to take home to His heart of infinite love? Christ's work is to ransom those who have strayed from God; and He requires every member of the church to work together with Him in bringing them back.",
