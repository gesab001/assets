    "word": "\"I am trying to help my husband bear his burdens. I do most of his copying. The work was not pleasant to me at first, but I have overcome my dislike for it. I no longer feel that sentimentalism must be brought into our experience in our married life. As God's workmen, we should be seeking to do him service, to honor his name, keeping the eye fixed upon Jesus, and encouraging each other to work for Christ. My husband says he can rest and I can encourage him now, because we are so interested to save souls for Christ. I had for a time to study hard and pray much to overcome my weakness of character, and become in some degree, what a woman should be, a true helpmeet. I desire not to lead into sin as did Eve, but with a firm hold upon Jesus. I would lead away from sin, and pride, and love of show, into the quiet parts of meekness and lowliness of heart.\" \n\n\n                                   -46-",
