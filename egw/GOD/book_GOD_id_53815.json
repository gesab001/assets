    "word": "I saw that we should not put off the coming of the Lord. Said the angel, \"Prepare, prepare, for what is coming upon the earth. Let your works correspond with your faith.\" I saw that the mind must be staid upon God, and our influence should tell for God and his truth. (We cannot honor God when we are careless and indifferent. We cannot glorify him when we are desponding). We must be in earnest and secure our soul's salvation, and try to save others. All importance should be attached to this, and everything besides should come in secondarily.",
