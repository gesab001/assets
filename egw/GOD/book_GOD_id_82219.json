    "word": "Present no Bribes or Flattering Inducements \n\n\n     It is required in those who labor in the cause that the heart be enlisted in the enterprise, that they may give their services not merely for wages, not for honor, but for the glory of God, the salvation of lost man. If it is evident that the heart of man is not enlisted, present no bribe, offer no flattering inducement, to obtain the service of any physician; offer that which is reasonable, that which corresponds with the principles the Lord has unfolded in the establishment of our institutions and no more.",
