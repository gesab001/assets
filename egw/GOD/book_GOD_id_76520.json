    "word": "There will be temptations on every side, and plausible excuses to have favorites. . . In the present state of society, with the lax morals of not only the youth but those of age and experience, there is great danger of becoming careless and giving special attention to favorites, thus creating envy, jealousy, and evil surmisings. . . But few realize that they grieve away the Spirit of God by their thoughts and feelings, their nonsense; trifling conversation, and when admonished they say, \"O, I mean no harm.\" What do these frivolous ones mean? Do they forget that that which they sow they shall also reap? This silly, nonsensical conversation reveals a weak character and is an offense to God. If the grace of Christ were planted in their hearts, and striking roots down deep into good soil, they would bear fruit of an altogether different kind. They would be acquiring moral stamina--that strength of purpose and solidity of character which is essential for the great and good work that ought to be done in this institution. Others would feel their influence, and would take knowledge of them that they were led and taught by Jesus.",
