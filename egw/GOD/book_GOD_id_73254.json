    "word": "To His servants Christ commits \"His goods,\"--something to be put to use for Him. He gives \"to every man his work.\" Each has his place in the eternal plan of heaven. Each is to work in cooperation with Christ for the salvation of souls. Not more surely is the place prepared for us in the heavenly mansions than is the special place designated on earth where we are to work for God.--Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 326, 327.",
