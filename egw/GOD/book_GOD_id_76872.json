    "word": "Birthday and Holiday Gifts. \n\n     On birthday anniversaries and at the holiday season people are accustomed to make gifts to one another. The thoughts, the interest and devotion are directed to human beings, while God is forgotten. On birthday occasions the children are taught to expect gifts and attentions for themselves. Too often self-gratification is the lesson given. The mind is turned away from God to self. This is as Satan would have it; but Christ desires to teach us a different lesson. On these occasions he desires that our thoughts shall be turned to God's great goodness in the work of salvation, and he invites us to unite with him in his mission of sacrifice. For our sake Christ gave himself to a life of self-denial and poverty. He was without \n                                                                           26\nluxuries, without adornment, without houses or lands. He said, \"Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\" He gave himself as a sinless offering, that men might have opportunity to return to God. Today the heavenly Watcher waits to see who will appreciate this inestimable gift. He is waiting to see who will show their gratitude to him by self-sacrifice for those he died to save.",
