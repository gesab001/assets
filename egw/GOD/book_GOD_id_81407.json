    "word": "Bro. Gage's education has not been such as to strengthen the high moral qualities that would enable him to stand alone in the strength of God in defense of truth, amid the severest opposition, firm as a rock to principle, true to his moral character, unmoved by censure, or human praise, or rewards, preferring death rather than a violated conscience. Such integrity is needed in the Office of publication, where solemn, sacred truths are going forth, upon which the world are to be tested.",
