    "word": "\"Parents, correct your children. Begin while they are young, when impressions can be more easily made, and their evil tempers subdued before they grow with their growth and strengthen with their strength. . . . You should correct your children in love. Do not let them have their own way until you get angry, and \n                                                                           20\nthen punish them. Such correction only helps on the evil, instead of remedying it. After you have done your duty faithfully to your children then carry them to God, and ask him to help you. . . . Ask him to temper their dispositions, to make them mild and gentle by his Holy Spirit. He will hear you pray. He will love to answer your prayers. Through his Word he has enjoined it upon you to correct your children, to \"spare not for crying,\" and his word is to be heeded in these things. . .",
