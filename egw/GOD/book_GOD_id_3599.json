    "word": "But Satan\u2019s hypocrisy has been unmasked by Christ\u2019s life, trial, and death. Christ took upon Himself human nature, and by His perfect life demonstrated the falsity of the claims of him who constantly accuses those who are trying to obey God\u2019s law. And the blood of Christ shed on the cross is the everlasting, incontrovertible testimony that God\u2019s law is as immutable as is His own character. The crucifixion of Christ was a murder instigated by Satan and carried out by people who had separated themselves from God. In the day of judgment, when the death of Christ upon the cross is seen in all its reality, every voice will be hushed. Everyone will see that Satan is a rebel.\u2014Manuscript 1, 1902.",
