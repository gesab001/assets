    "word": "We inquire, as Christ inquired of the Jews, The preaching of this message, is it of heaven or is it from beneath? Jesus rejoiced in spirit as He saw men who had not had the continuous opportunity and privileges the Jews had had, convicted and converted to the truth. He said, \"I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes\" (Matthew 11:25). The Lord rejoiced that the plan of salvation was so plain that a child in its simplicity could understand it, while those who were not spiritual and humble and willing to learn, who were puffed up in their own self-conceit, could not see the beauty of the gospel, because it is spiritually discerned. \n\n\n                                   -232- \n\nBut all who are honest, teachable, childlike, who desire to know the truth, will see the power of God when it is revealed, and will acknowledge it.",
