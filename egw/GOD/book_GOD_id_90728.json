    "word": "MR No. 1110 - Study God's Word: Be Slow To Follow Self-Styled Prophets, Including Anna Phillips\n\n     (Written December 23, 1893, from Sydney, Australia, to \"Dear Brethren and Sisters.\") \n\n\n     I have a message to you from the Lord. Brother Rice is not engaged in the work which the Lord would have him do. God has given to every man his work, and Brother Rice is stepping out of the lines to which the Lord has appointed him. He cannot see the outcome of this work which he has taken up. Anna Phillips is being injured; she is led on, encouraged in a work which will not bear the test of God.",
