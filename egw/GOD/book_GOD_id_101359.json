Lindsay\n\n                                                             L-51a-1895 \n\n                          Tasmania, May 1, 1895. \n\nDear Brother Harmon Lindsay:--- \n\n\n     I hoped I should never be compelled to write you a testimony of reproof. For years your case has been presented before me on different occasions. I have been shown that since you were converted, you have been in continual peril. You run well, apparently, for a time, but when your course is questioned or your path crossed, your course of action reveals that the wrong traits of your character have not been brought wholly under the influence of the Spirit of God. When speaking to others, I have been given a message for you, but was not constrained by the Spirit of God to say, Harmon Lindsay, you are the man. I have never ceased to pity you and to feel deep sorrow of heart on your account, but at no time have I felt in full unity of spirit with you.",
