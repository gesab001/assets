    "word": "We each need to arouse and be a benefit to the world in which we live. We are to act a part in the saving of souls. The spirit we reveal in words and character will live again in those for whom we labor as their ideal of what a Christian believer should be. When the will and desires are held subservient to the will and plans of the Lord, the soul will be as the garden of God, filled with all manner of pleasant flowers and fruits.",
