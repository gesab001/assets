    "word": "Have these brethren in Ohio unselfishly looked to God for light and for wisdom how to invest, as wise stewards, the Lord's money for the upbuilding of His cause and the advancement of His kingdom? Have they decided that the Lord's means was in their hands? Or have they followed their own inclination, and in the place of selling and giving alms, or, in short, investing in the very work that is most essential to open the Word of God to all nations, tongues, and peoples, have they invested their means where they will be sure to get either honor or returns? The Judgment will reveal the matter as it is. Every man's work will be tested and proved by the Lord.",
