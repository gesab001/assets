    "word": "[John 17:14-22, quoted.] \n     Here are truths deep, broad, and eternal to govern every church in our land that accepts the truth of heavenly origin. \"I in them, and thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me\" [John 17:23]. Here are the principles to be acted upon in the church and in all our institutions. To take any other course of action is not to keep the way of the Lord but to walk in the sparks of one's own kindling, and bringing in principles after the fashion and order of the world, which will take the strength and vital Godliness from the church, however much they may claim to be the followers of Christ.",
