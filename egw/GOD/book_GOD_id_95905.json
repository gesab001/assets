    "word": "One week ago I spoke in Brighton with earnest, pointed words upon the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. An excellent class of people were present and a good impression was made. The Lord is moving upon minds. About twelve are now keeping the Sabbath in Brighton, and a large number are convinced but have not courage as yet to come out on the Lord's side. Last Sunday I spoke at Williamstown, twelve miles from Melbourne, where Brethren Baker and Israel are working with the tent. I had chosen John 3:16 for my text, but I could not dwell upon the great love which God has expressed to men without presenting in clear lines the fallacy of claiming that the commandments are abolished, when we have not in the Scriptures one single word or intimation of such a monstrous idea.",
