    "word": "I have a message from the Lord. The churches must awaken from their torpor, and think of these things. \"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Are we as families appropriating the Lord's silver and gold to selfish purposes, and doing nothing to lighten the debt on His house? The churches are burdened with debt, not because it is impossible for them to be freed, but because of selfish indulgence on the part of the members. By this neglect God is dishonored, and if He binds about your resources, be not blind as to the cause.",
