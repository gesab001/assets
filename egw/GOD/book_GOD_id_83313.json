City of Rome, Atlantic Ocean \n                                       August 6, 1887 \n\nDear Brethren in Europe: \n     We have been connected with you in labor for two years. We have realized much of the blessing of God as we have labored in Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Italy, Germany, and England. We have seen that the work is advancing slowly. France and Italy have been the most unpromising fields. England has not had much labor. There has been something done, but to a very limited degree, and as we have seen the large cities in which no labor has been put forth, we have known that a much greater work is to be accomplished than has yet been accomplished for the cities of England. As yet the light seems to have been kept under a bushel; it has not been placed on a candlestick where it could give light to all that are in the house.",
