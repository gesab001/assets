    "word": "I am very glad that our workers have the privilege of attending these meetings. I hope that as a result of the labors put forth here, some who have not been keeping the commandments of God will be led to feel that it is high time to take hold of the divine nature of Jesus Christ, in order that they may be overcomers. Do not allow these opportunities to pass by without seeking the Lord with all the heart. Let everyone repent and be converted. If you will do this, you will see of the salvation of God. We may be misunderstood by the world, for spiritual things are spiritually discerned; but we are to go straight forward, following in the footsteps of our Lord. We are to trust Him who is spirit and life to the believer.",
