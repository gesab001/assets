    "word": "Pray, Maria, earnestly, that God will reveal to you yourself the sin and corruption of your own heart. Let this desire be ever with you, for it is important for you to see yourself as a sinner in order for you to feel the necessity of pardon through the blood of Christ. Let your second prayer be, \"Lord, reveal to me Thyself, Thy mercy, and the value of Thy blood.\"  Lay hold on everlasting life. You have proved the worthlessness of earthly things, and it has been perfectly astonishing to me that you yet seemed to manifest so little interest in becoming a Christian. But I can understand it now. Your personal appearance is your idol. God cannot dwell in your heart or thoughts where self rules supreme. Your good appearance Satan means to use to your own destruction and, if he succeeds, it will prove to be the greatest curse that ever came upon you.",
