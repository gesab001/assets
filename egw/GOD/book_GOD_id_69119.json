    "word": "Notice the commendation given to Cornelius: \"Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God\" (verse 4). His faithfulness was recognized in heaven. God saw that he was a man fit to be entrusted with greater light and larger responsibilities, because he had made a right use of the talents lent to him. We are to regard our stewardship as a sacred responsibility. We are to trade diligently upon the talents entrusted to us. As we do this, God will recognize our faithful endeavor, and will give us increased ability for service.",
