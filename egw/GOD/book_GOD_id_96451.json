    "word": "We are not all required to do exactly alike in the work. Each has his individual work to do. Spiritual life will lead to unity. We are in the world for work, earnest spiritual work.

The manner of accomplishing the work may not be precisely the way in which another would do it, but if the labor is conscientiously performed, God accepts the effort. God asks for the performance of good works, and the results of the efforts made will testify to the virtue of the worker. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" . . . \n                                                                           40",
