    "word": "The one to whom God has entrusted a large capital will not, if he loves and fears God, find it a burden to meet the demands of an enlightened conscience according to the claims of God. The rich will be tempted to indulge in selfishness and avarice, and to withhold from the Lord His own. But he who is true to God will, when tempted, answer to Satan, \"It is written,\" \"Will a man rob God?\" \"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\"-- R. & H., May 16, 1893.",
