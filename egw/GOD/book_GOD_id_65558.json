    "word": "God gives knowledge to His workmen; and He has left on record for us the rich, full promise: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.\" Is it not best to obtain wisdom individually by going to God, and not to man? What saith the Great Teacher? \"I have manifested Thy name unto the men which Thou gavest Me out of the world.\"",
