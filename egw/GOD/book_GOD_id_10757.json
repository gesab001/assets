    "word": "The father who has died in the faith, resting upon the eternal promise of God, left his loved ones in full trust that the Lord would care for them. And how does the Lord provide for these bereaved ones? He does not work a miracle in sending manna from heaven, He does not send ravens to bring them food; but He works a miracle upon human hearts, He expels selfishness from the soul, He unseals the fountain of benevolence.

These are in a special sense the little ones whom Christ looks \n                                                                           164\nupon, whom it is an offense to Him to neglect. Those who do neglect them are neglecting Christ in the person of His afflicted ones.",
