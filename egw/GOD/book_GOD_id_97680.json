    "word": "The question is asked, How shall we hear without a preacher? But when God has given His message to us through the instrumentality of men, then we are accountable for how we teach that message. It is a great and solemn truth that God has given us, and we should not confine this truth to ourselves; but we should be seeking in every way possible to present it to others, that the Lord is coming. The end of this earth's history is to take place in a short time. Are we indifferent and careless in regard to the matter? Why, we must be in that position that we will feel that we are accountable for the souls around us.",
