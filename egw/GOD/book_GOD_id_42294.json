    "word": "It is the spirituality of the children of God that is their glory in His eyes. This is the distinguishing mark that separates them from the world. . . . We are to hunger and thirst after righteousness, that we may represent Christ to the world. If His love abides in our hearts, it will be distinctly revealed. We shall be lights in the world. Christ calls upon every follower of His to reveal His virtues of character, to represent Him in word and deed, to make known His love.--Manuscript 84, 1905.",
