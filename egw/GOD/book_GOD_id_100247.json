    "word": "There are those who have prided themselves on their great caution in receiving \"new light\", as they term it; but they are blinded by the enemy, and can not discern the work and ways of God. Light, precious light, comes from heaven, and they array themselves against it. What next? These very ones will accept messages that God has not sent, and thus will become even dangerous to the cause of God because they set up false standards. Men who might be of great use if they would learn of Christ and go on from light to greater light, are in some things positive hindrances, forever on the point of questioning, wasting much precious time, and contributing nothing to the spiritual elevation of the church. They excite doubt and fear. They misdirect minds, leading them to accept of suggestions that are not safe. They can not see afar off, \n                                                                           723\nthey can not discern the conclusion of the matter. Their moral force is squandered upon trifles; they view an atom as a world and a world as an atom.",
