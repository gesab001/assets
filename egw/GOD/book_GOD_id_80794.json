    "word": "Your expectations in a business line have always been large and flattering. You are a man who talks things out just as they appear to you; and when you are engaged in financial enterprises, you present them in such glowing colors that you injure those with whom you associate. Your conversation has savored of covetousness. It is not your business to lead men and women to invest means in worldly enterprises. Your eager hopes and pursuits in worldly matters have proved a curse to you spiritually; and you really mar the work of God that is in your hands. You have not only been reproved, but faithfully warned in the word of God and by direct testimony, in regard to your individual errors. \n\n\n                          [26] \n\n\"If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\" \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\"",
