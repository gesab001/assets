    "word": "Cultivate Humble Dependence--Men whom the Lord calls to important positions in His work are to cultivate a humble dependence upon Him.  They are not to seek to embrace too much authority; for God has not called them to a work of ruling, but to plan and counsel with their fellow laborers.  Every worker alike is to hold himself amenable to the requirements and instructions of God.-Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 270.",
