    "word": "Christ rejoices when the thoughts of the young are occupied by the grand and ennobling themes of salvation. He enters the hearts of all such as an abiding guest, filling them with joy and peace. And the love of Christ in the soul is as \"a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.\" . . . Those who possess this love will delight to talk of the things that God has prepared for them that love Him.",
