    "word": "I tell you, fellow-laborers in the Sanitarium, your standard of Christianity bears too much the worldly stamp. Religion, Bible religion, takes away the gross, the sensual, dishonesty, selfishness, unholy ambition, from the man. Then comes joy and peace. There are too many laborers who keep themselves away from God, and in a state of condemnation. They feel the rebuke of God upon them. There is joy in obedience, joy in the favor of God. The Lord, who holds the life of man in his \n\n\n                          -43- \n\nhands, can impart true nobility of soul and restore in  him the image of God. Who can give peace and rest to the soul but the Prince of Peace? Oh, why will men keep apart from God, and regard obedience and truth as bondage? Why will they ask, What will my fellow-mortals approve? Why not inquire, What has God said? What standard has he set up, and how can I meet it?",
