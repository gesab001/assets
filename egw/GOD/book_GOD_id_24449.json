    "word": "I spoke five times in Copenhagen. While I was glad to present the truth to the few who could be accommodated in our small meeting-rooms, I would have been pleased to honor my Master by bearing his message to a large number. I am far from being convinced that these small and obscure halls were the best places that could be secured, or that in this great city of three hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants, the message should be given in a basement room that will accommodate but two hundred, and this but half seated, so that a large part of the congregation have to stand. When God sends our brethren help, they should make earnest effort, even at some expense, to bring the light before the people. This message is to be given to the world; but unless our brethren have broad ideas and plans, they will not see much accomplished. While we should labor earnestly for the poorer classes, we are not to confine our efforts to them, nor should our plans be so laid that we shall have only this class of hearers. Men of ability are needed. The more intellectual ability is brought into the work, so long as the talent is consecrated to God and sanctified by his Spirit, the more perfect the work will be, and the higher it will stand before the world. The people generally will refuse the message of warning; yet efforts must be made to bring the truth before those of position and education as well as the poor and illiterate.",
