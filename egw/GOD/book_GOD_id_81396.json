    "word": "\"I saw that my husband's mind should not be crowded and overtaxed. His mind must have rest, and he be left free to write and attend to matters which others cannot do. Those engaged in the Office can lift from him a great weight of care if they would dedicate themselves to God, and feel a deep interest in the work. No selfish feelings should exist among those who labor in the Office. It is the work of God in which they are engaged, and they are accountable to God for the motives and manner in which this branch of his work is performed. They are required to discipline their minds, and to bring their minds to task. Forgetfulness is sin. Many feel that no blame should be attached to forgetfulness. \n                                                                           15\nThere is a great mistake here; and this leads to many blunders, and much disorder, and many wrongs. The mind must be tasked. Things that should be done should not be forgotten. The mind must be disciplined until it will remember.",
