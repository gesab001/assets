    "word": "The true Christian will not refuse to practice self-denial for Christ's sake. Those who are children of God are earnest workers; they are not slothful servants. There are no drones in the household of God. Every member of the household of faith has his work appointed to him. . . . If he is a learner in the school of Christ, he will learn how to give a testimony, how to pray, how to be a living witness for the Master. . . .",
