    "word": "He who does not seek each day to be more like Christ cannot know the character of God. Living a pure life through faith in Christ as a personal Saviour brings the believer into a clearer, higher conception of God. No man whose character is not noble and Christlike can set forth God in a correct light. He may preach Christ but he does not show his hearers that Christ is an abiding guest in his heart.",
