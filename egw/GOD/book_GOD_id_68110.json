    "word": "Never allow Satan to discourage you. Trust yourself not in the hands of M_____, but in the hands of God. Practice prayer; cultivate humility and meekness; but commit the keeping of your soul to God. Depend in all that you do on the Holy Spirit, for He is our strength, our efficiency. The Lord is ever training us through difficulties. Pray, pray; be instant in prayer. Commit everything to God in prayer--your business cares, your disappointments, your joys, your fears.",
