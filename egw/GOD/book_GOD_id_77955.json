    "word": "God would have had my husband exert a power of influence from the first, in molding the work as it progressed, after the divine pattern. The donation of means, the taxing of his strength in wearing labor, have been an easier work than to bring himself to task, and discipline and control his own spirit, ever having the spirit of Christ, and keeping self out of sight. The lesson of self-government is the most important lesson that man ever learned. My husband has been acknowledged as the acting head in this work. Wherever the head moves, the body follows. The speeches he has felt free to make to his brother ministers up to the present time have displeased God. He has been tempted to question and find fault with any move of importance that he did not suggest or originate. He must see that this is not pleasing to God, and must change his course, or else he will mar the work. God is fitting up men to bear burdens, to plan and execute, and my husband must not stand in the way.",
