    "word": "Your property is a talent lent you by God to test you, to see if you will accept the character of Christ and be a subject of the kingdom of God. Thus you may come into possession of eternal riches. Your profession of Christianity is true if you follow Christ; worthless if you do not follow Him. Self-indulgence will not secure for any soul a citizenship in the better, even the heavenly, country. Those who will not be good and do good, as did their Master, those who covetously spend their all upon themselves, will lose the eternal riches. They will find no place for their selfish souls in the mansions Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him.",
