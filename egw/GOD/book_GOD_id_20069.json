    "word": "I have been shown the homes of ministers, presidents of Conferences, which are not all they should be. If the wife is not a humble, God-fearing, devoted woman, she will exert a wrong influence over her husband. If she is an unrestrained talker, she may lead him to acts that will do much harm. He may be influenced in his labor by a wisdom that is not from above. If he has not a steadfast purpose, an eye single to the glory of God, his wife's likes and dislikes, her preferences and opinions, will mould his work. Thus her want of self-denial and consecration to God will be felt all through the Conference.",
