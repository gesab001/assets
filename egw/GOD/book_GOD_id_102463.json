    "word": "I have thought it a hopeless undertaking to right matters at the Retreat. Then I have thought notwithstanding your ideas and feelings, and impressions, it must be done. Your influence, your appetite, has moulded the Institute, but it can be so no longer. You must change your manner of living. You may think you cannot work without meat: I thought so once, but I know that in His original plan, God did not provide for the flesh of dead animals to compose the diet for man. It is a gross, perverted taste that will accept such food. To think of dead flesh rotting in the stomach is revolting. Then the fact that meat is largely diseased, should lead us to make strenuous efforts to discontinue its use entirely. My position now is to let meat altogether alone. It will be hard for some to do this, as hard as for the rum drinker to forsake his dram; but they will be better for the change.",
