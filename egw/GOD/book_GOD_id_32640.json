    "word": "Truth Applied Improves Health.--When men who have indulged in wrong habits and sinful practices yield to the power of divine truth, the application of that truth to the heart revives the moral powers, which had seemed to be paralyzed. The receiver possesses stronger, clearer understanding than before he riveted his soul to the Eternal Rock Even his physical health improves by the realization of his security in Christ. The special blessing of God resting upon the receiver is of itself health and strength.-- CTBH 13, 1890. (Te 108.)",
