    "word": "I ask you, my brother, not to act like a child in understanding. Act like a child who is practicing the Word of God. Christ says, \"Why call ye Me \n\n\n                                    -214- \n\nMaster and Lord, and do not the things which I say?\" The consistency of our conduct in words, in patience, in meekness, will reveal the Christ in the heart. Take yourself seriously in hand, my brother, and move steadily onward, step by step, to be an overcomer. . . .",
