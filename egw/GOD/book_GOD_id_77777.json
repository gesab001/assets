    "word": "\"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off. And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go, show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There are not found, that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.\" Here is a lesson for us all.

Their limits had been prescribed by the authorities. Jesus came within their sight, and they in their great suffering cry unto him who alone had power to relieve them. Jesus bade them show themselves to the priests. They had faith to start on their way, believing in the power of Christ to heal them. As they go on their way, they realize that the horrible disease has left them. But only one feels gratitude, and his deep indebtedness to Christ for this great work wrought for him. He returned, praising God on the way, and in the greatest humiliation falls at the feet of Christ, acknowledging with thankfulness the work wrought for him. And this man was a stranger. The other nine were Jews.",
