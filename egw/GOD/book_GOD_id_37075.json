    "word": "Make no compromise with those who have apostatized, but treat them kindly.--We are not to throw our arms about the men who are Satan's masterpieces for working out his will, as were the opposers on the campground at Adelaide. Truth is to be proclaimed in warnings that will make hearts tremble in contrition before God. The sharp, clean-cut testimony must be borne. . . . Make no compromise with those who have apostatized, but treat them kindly, giving no occasion for your good to be evil spoken of.--9MR 363.",
