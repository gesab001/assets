The Israelites who manifested so much zeal against the men of Gad and Reuben remembered how, in Achan's case, God had rebuked the lack of vigilance to discover the sins existing among them.

Instead of meeting their brethren with censure, they should first have made courteous inquiry to learn all the facts in the case.",
