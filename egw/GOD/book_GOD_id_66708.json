    "word": "When the importance of the restaurant work has been presented to me, it has not been outlined that hygienic restaurants would be the means of making large sums of money. They are to be places where the truth will be presented by word of mouth, and by the distribution of literature treating upon the coming of Christ, and of the message for this time. The restaurant work should be a means in the purpose of God to prepare a people to stand in the day of judgment. The work of satisfying the hunger of the body is to be made only a means to this end. Evangelistic work is to be done, and literature should be sold and given away. Let the subject of temperance be made prominent. The patrons of our restaurants should be warned that the great day of God's wrath is near, that if hasteth greatly. As the judgments of God fall upon the cities, let this be sounded as a note of warning.",
