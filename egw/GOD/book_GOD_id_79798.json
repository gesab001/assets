    "word": "Those who have not received Christ as their personal Saviour, should never be placed as directors of the youth. If they cannot submit themselves to the control of God, they are not qualified to manage and teach order and law to those brought under them. Those who claim to be Christ's disciples, if themselves under discipline to God, will make tender, loving, wise guides and instructors of the youth; for Christ says, \"I will manifest myself unto them.\"",
