    "word": "The prophet John impressed upon the people the necessity of their profession's being accompanied with good works. Their words and actions would be their fruit, and would determine the character of the tree. If their works were evil, the truth of God testified against them. God would in no wise excuse sin in a people who had been enlightened, even if he had, in the days of their faithfulness and purity, loved them, and given them especial promises. These promises and blessings were always upon conditions of obedience upon their part.",
