    "word": "Young men, you who think of entering the ministry, take up this work. The handling of the book placed in your hand by the Lord is to be your educator. Improving this opportunity, you will certainly advance in a knowledge of God and of the best methods for reaching the people. Ask the people to purchase these books, telling them they need the truth, and you need the money. They might as well know what you are trying to do. Tell them of the effort that is being made to free our school from debt. Everything that can be done must be done to advance the work of God.",
