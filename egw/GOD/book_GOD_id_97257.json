    "word": "Who dares to say that Christ is a Sabbath-breaker? He made the Sabbath Himself. He is the one that spoke the law from Sinai. He is the one who was enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, and therefore He said, \"Ye are ignorant of the Scriptures and of the power of God.\" Why? Because they covered it all up with their maxims and traditions which had been handed down from rabbi to rabbi, and repeated and enlarged till the specifications of the law of God were buried in a mass of rubbish, and till the people were not certain that they were keeping the law, for the law is the transcript of the Father's character.",
