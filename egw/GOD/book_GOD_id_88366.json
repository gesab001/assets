    "word": "We Are to Be Ever Ready for Christ's Coming--We want to understand our proper relation to God: we want to know how we stand in the presence of God. I want you to see that it is not in the providence of God that any finite man shall, by any device or reckoning that he may make of figures, or of symbols, or of types, know with any definiteness in regard to the very period of the Lord's coming. What shall we know? We are to study the signs which show that He is at the door. You may say, \"I have expected it, and I have waited a long time, and the Master has not come yet: and this long time of waiting makes me think that He is not coming.\" Just so those foolish virgins began to think. They did not have any supply of grace to enable them to stand the test or trial.",
