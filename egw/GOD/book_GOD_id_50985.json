    "word": "The Lord, by his prophet, sent a reproof to Eli: \"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; \n                                                                           401\nand honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel, my people? Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me forever; but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.\"",
