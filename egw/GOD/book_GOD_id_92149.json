    "word": "There is a lesson for us in those words of Christ spoken after the feeding of the five thousand. He said, \"Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost.\" These words meant more than that the disciples should gather the broken pieces of bread into baskets. Jesus meant that they should mark His words, should study the Scriptures, and treasure every ray of light. Instead of searching for a knowledge of something that God had not revealed, they were carefully to gather up what He had given them.",
