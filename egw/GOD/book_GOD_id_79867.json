    "word": "The lesson given to Nicodemus is of the greatest importance to every soul that lives, for the terms of salvation are here laid out in distinct lines; if one had no other text in the Bible, this alone would be a guide to the soul. Especially to every man who accepts responsibilities as a counselor, every one who is dealing with human minds, is this grand, beautiful truth to be a bright and shining light. It is no credit to the one who has the word of God in his possession, to say, \"I have no experience. I do not understand these things.\" He never will be wiser until he becomes of much less consequence in his own estimation, and diligently searches the Word to obtain knowledge.",
