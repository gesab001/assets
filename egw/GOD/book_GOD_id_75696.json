    "word": "Tacoma Park, Washington, D. C., April 27, 1904.\nElders Santee and Owen-- \n     There is a special work to be done just now. A sanitarium should be established near Los Angeles. My brethren, will you not remember that it is the expressed will of God that this shall be done? Why this work should be delayed from year to year is a great mystery. This is a matter that has long been kept before you, my brethren. Again and again sanitarium work has been pointed out as an important means of reaching the people with the truth. Had the light given by God been followed, this institution might now be in running order, exerting a strong influence for good. Arrangements \n                                                                           15\ncould have been made to utilize for sanitarium work buildings already erected.",
