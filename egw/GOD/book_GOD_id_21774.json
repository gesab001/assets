    "word": "Ministers and people declared that the prophecies of \n341\nDaniel and the Revelation were incomprehensible mysteries. But Christ directed his disciples to the words of the prophet Daniel concerning events to take place in their time, and said, \u201cWhoso readeth, let him understand.\u201d [Matthew 24:15.] And the assertion that the Revelation is a mystery, not to be understood, is contradicted by the very title of the book: \u201cThe Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. . . . Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein; for the time is at hand.\u201d [Revelation 1:1-3.]",
