    "word": "I leave this matter with you; for I have been troubled in regard to the dangers that assail the church in Battle Creek, lest they shall move indiscreetly, and give the enemy advantage. This need not be, for if we walk humbly with God, we shall walk safely, and bear in mind the words of Jesus Christ, \"Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\" \"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.\" \"And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one,\" \"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and [mark these words] that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.\" Blessed, blessed utterance! Will we believe the words of Jesus? Will we practice his words? If we do, we shall see far greater results than we have hitherto seen. O, we shall be filled with all the fullness of God! We shall possess a power that shall resist every device of the enemy.",
