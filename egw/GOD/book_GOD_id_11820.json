    "word": "Chap. 73 - \"According that a Man Hath\"\n\n     God can and will use those who have not had a thorough education in the schools of men. A doubt of His power to do this is manifest unbelief. Our Saviour did not ignore learning or despise education, yet He chose unlearned fishermen for the work of the gospel because they had not been schooled in the false customs and traditions of the world. They were men of good natural ability and of a humble, teachable spirit, men whom He could educate for His great work.",
