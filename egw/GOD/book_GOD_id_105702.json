    "word": "Why, if I had been on that ground, and notwithstanding our writing, I would have gone to our people from place to place, and I would have written to them.

Now, God has been dishonored, terribly dishonored, and yet the men that have done this don\u2019t realize where their mistake has been-how they have stood in the way, how they have kept their foot on the brake, how they have drifted back, by some words of objection to one person or another person, or something like that, and let the thing drift right on year after year, and nothing done to build up the work.",
