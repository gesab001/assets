    "word": "What could induce the pure, sinless Son of God to tabernacle with men in a world filled with crime and strife and wickedness? He did this that He might better reach the lost and perishing. He suffered, being tempted. Proportionate to the perfection of His holiness, was the strength of the temptation. Because of the depravity so revolting to His purity, His residence in the world was a perpetual sorrow. On every hand He saw men and women destroying themselves by yielding to perverted appetite and passion.",
