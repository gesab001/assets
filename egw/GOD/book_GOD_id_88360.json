    "word": "Delay of Christ's Coming Will Seem Short in Eternity--Dear brethren and sisters, Christ is soon to come. Will He find you ready and waiting? The bridal lamps must be kept trimmed and burning. His chariot wheels have been delayed because of His long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance and have eternal life. When we shall stand with the redeemed upon the sea of glass, with harps of God and crowns of glory, and before us the unmeasured eternity, we shall then see how short was the waiting period of probation. \"Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching\" (Luke 12:37).--Letter 21, 1886, p. 5. (To Brethren and Sisters in Healdsburg, July 9, 1886.)",
