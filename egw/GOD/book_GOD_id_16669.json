    "word": "By nature we are alienated from God. The Holy Spirit describes our condition in such words as these: \"Dead in trespasses and sins;\" \"the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint\"; \"no soundness in it.\" We are held fast in the snare of Satan; \"taken captive by him at his will.\" Ephesians 2:1; Isaiah 1:5, 6; 2 Timothy 2:26. God desires to heal us, to set us free. But since this requires an entire transformation, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him.",
