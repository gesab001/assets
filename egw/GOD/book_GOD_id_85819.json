    "word": "The Lord move upon the churches! May the voice from the living oracles of God, the startling movings of providence, speak in clear language to the church, \"separate unto me Paul and Barnabas.\" Holy and devout men are wanted now to cultivate their mental and physical powers and their piety to the uttermost, and to be ordained to go forth as medical missionaries, both men and women. Every effort should be made to send forth intelligent workers. The same grace that came from Jesus Christ to Paul and Apollos, that distinguished them for spiritual excellencies can be reproduced and brought into working order in many devoted missionaries. Let not a large number fold their hands and say O yes, let such and such an one go to untried fields, while themselves put forth no interested devoted self-denying labor and expect their work that the Lord has committed to them to be done by proxy.",
