    "word": "Said the angel. \"Ye have been picking at straws--dwelling upon little trials--and sinners must be lost as a consequence.\" God is willing to work for us in our meetings, and it is His pleasure to work. But Satan says, \"I will hinder the work.\" His agents say, \"Amen.\" Professed believers in the truth dwell upon their petty trials and difficulties which Satan has magnified before them. Time is wasted that can never be recalled. The enemies of the truth have seen our weakness, God has been grieved, Christ wounded. Satan's object is accomplished, his plans have succeeded, and he triumphs. \n\n                                               -",
