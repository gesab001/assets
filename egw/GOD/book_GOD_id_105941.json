    "word": "From the light which has been given me in the past and at the present, I do not see the spirit which Christ possessed in his life, revealed in your dealings with Brother Hickox. If I were where I could see him, I should urge him to respect all in positions of trust and not to make flesh his arm, but always in everything to make Christ his strength and efficiency. I would converse with him as one who, if he had sinned, had not sinned willfully. If he has sinned, there is a God of pity, who is forbearing and tender and longsuffering, ready to pardon and forgive.",
