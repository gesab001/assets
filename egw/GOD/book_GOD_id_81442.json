    "word": "If the ministers do not discourage them to death by their indolence, and inefficiency, and lack of spirituality, they will generally respond to any appeal that may be made that will commend itself to their judgment and consciences. But they want to see fruit. And it is right that the brethren \n                                                                           65\nin New York should demand fruits of their ministers. What have they done? What are they doing? Ministers in New York should have been far in advance of what they are. But they have not engaged in that kind of labor which called forth earnest effort, and strong opposition which would drive them to their Bibles, and to prayer, that they could answer opponents, and, in the exercise of their talents, doubled them. There are ministers in New York who have been preaching for years who cannot be depended upon to give a course of lectures. They are dwarfed. They have not exercised their minds in the study of the word, and in meeting opposition, so that they might be strong men in God. Had they gone forth \"without the camp,\" like faithful soldiers of the cross of Christ, and depended upon God and their own energies, rather than leaning so heavily upon their brethren, they would have obtained an experience, that now they would be qualified to engage in the work anywhere their help is most needed.",
