    "word": "Our faith is to be expressed in thanksgiving. \"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth God.\" \"In everything give thanks.\" \"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name.\" Let expressions of praise flow forth from human lips. We are to rejoice in the Lord more than we have done. Let not the heart remain cold and dull and unimpressive.",
