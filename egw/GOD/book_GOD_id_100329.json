    "word": "In the evening I walked to the place of meeting and spoke in a large hall to about one hundred people. Oh, how my heart yearns to see the people of God coming up to their high calling! I greatly desire that we should have an increase of faith and stand as valiant soldiers of Jesus Christ. I spoke from John 14:1-4: \"Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I do ye know, and the way ye know.\" This is the promise of His second coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. Thus we are second Adventists.",
