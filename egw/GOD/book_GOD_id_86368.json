    "word": "MR No. 455 - Letter to the Crew of the \"Pitcairn\"\n\n     Dear Friends: The great controversy going on in the world, is waging more sharply today than at any period of this world's history between the prince of life and the prince of darkness. Bear the fact in mind that wherever there are plans set in operation to advance the cause of God in the world, Satan will be on hand to counteract, if possible, the workings of our merciful heavenly Father. He will come with his temptations on board the missionary ship, Pitcairn. He will use every possible advantage you give him to control minds. I have a word from the Lord to speak to you.",
