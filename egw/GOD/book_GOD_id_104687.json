    "word": "The work is still being carried forward in San Francisco and Oakland; for souls must be warned. Now is our time and opportunity, while these revelations of dishonesty and fraudulent transactions are being made. While these people have these things brought daily before their notice, the reasonable arguments of the word of God, its predictions that just such practices will be carried on in every city, will appeal to their minds and consciences better than would any language we could use to represent the existing evil and point out their meaning. Elder Simpson will take up his work again in about two weeks' time, and after that he will labor in San Francisco. The truth is being proclaimed in these cities as it has never been before. We feel that now is our time to work, just now. We must unite, be united in the work, and press together.",
