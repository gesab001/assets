    "word": "The Home A Mission Field \n\n     Let not parents forget the great mission field that lies before them in the home. In the children committed to her every mother has a sacred charge from God. \"Take this son, this daughter,\" God says, \"and train it for Me. Give it a character polished after the similitude of a palace, that it may shine in the courts of the Lord forever.\" The light and glory that shine from the throne of God rest upon the faithful mother as she tries to educate her children to resist the influence of evil.",
