    "word": "The following Sunday I spoke again to a good congregation. The power of God was manifested in our midst. Many hearts were deeply moved, and tears were shed. I knew this was not because of any power that was in me, \n\n\n                                -346- \n\nbut that the Lord Himself was in the assembly. It was the Holy Spirit's power upon human hearts, and I praise the Lord for His mercy, His compassion to the children of men. When speaking to others of the love and compassion of God, my own soul is comforted and refreshed. When I see the glow of intelligence upon countenances, my own soul glows with love to God.",
