    "word": "\"God loveth a cheerful giver;\" and if we with grateful hearts bring our gifts and offerings to Him, \"not grudgingly or of necessity,\" His blessing will attend us; for He has promised, \"I will open the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing.\" He will accept not only the gift, but the giver. And although it may have cost self-denial on our part, the approval of conscience and the blessing of heaven will fill our hearts with happiness.",
