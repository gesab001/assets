    "word": "We are living in perilous times. The Lord has given light, but there are influences at work to lead men to mock at the light. Those who set themselves to oppose the plans of God's appointment will be dealt with according to their works. In times of religious declension such as has been in Battle Creek, the judgment of God will come upon those who have been living in a state of rebellion, heaping up wrath against the day of wrath. My heart aches for those who have not heeded the messages that God has sent in mercy to ennoble and to save. I am filled with sorrow for those who have despised and insulted the world's Redeemer by cherishing bitterness and wrath and hatred and evil in their hearts. The light which God sent to sanctify them, they have despised, and their eyes have become blinded, their spiritual discernment perverted.",
