    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., Monday, January 12, 1891 \n\n     I wrote several letters today. I learn that on Sabbath Elder Smith made quite full confessions and Brother Rupert also confessed. They went back in their confessions to the meeting at Minneapolis, and confessed their mistakes, in their blindness, and that their spirit and actions on that occasion were wrong. The Lord had precious truth to unfold to His people which they, being filled with unbelief and prejudice, could not appreciate, and they worked counter to the Spirit of God. In their boarding places in Minneapolis, they made light of the truth and of those who advocated the truth.",
