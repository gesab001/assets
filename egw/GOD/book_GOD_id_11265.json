    "word": "We cannot afford to separate spiritual from intellectual training. Well may parents dread intellectual greatness for their children, unless it is balanced by a knowledge of God and His ways. This lies at the foundation of all true knowledge. In the place of unsanctified, rivalry for earthly honor, let it be the highest ambition of our students to go forth from their school life as missionaries for God, educators who will teach what they have learned. Students who leave school with this purpose will draw to Christ not only men and women, but children and youth. They will do a work in the world that not all the powers of evil can counteract.",
