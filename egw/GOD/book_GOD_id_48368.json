    "word": "I saw if any held on to their property, and did not inquire duty of the Lord, he would not make duty known, and they would be permitted to keep their property, and then in the time of trouble it would come up before them like a mountain to crush them, and they would try to dispose of it, but would not be able. I heard some mourn like this: \u201cThe cause was languishing, God's people were starving for the truth, and we made no effort to supply the lack, and now our property is useless. Oh! that we had let it go, and laid up treasure in heaven.\u201d I saw a sacrifice did not increase, but decrease, and was consumed. I also saw that God had not required all of his people to dispose of their property at the same time, but in a time of need he would teach them, if they desired to be taught, when to sell and how much to sell, and that some had been required to dispose of their property in time past to sustain the Advent cause, while he permitted others to keep theirs until a time of need. Then as the cause needs it, their duty is to sell.",
