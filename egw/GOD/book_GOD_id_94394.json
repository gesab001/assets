    "word": "We will press close to Jesus. Hear His voice to His disciples, \"He that will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.\" God requires of us our life service.

He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world. \"Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.\"",
