    "word": "Let those who profess to believe the truth seek most earnestly to follow in the footsteps of the Master, ministering to all who need a Saviour. Christ has plainly laid down the conditions upon which salvation depends. \"If any man will come after me,\" He says, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:24). Yes, follow Christ. Let every dear soul who desires to obey God walk in the footsteps of the Redeemer. We must be meek and lowly in heart. We are to bring forth fruits of righteousness according to the capabilities God has given us.",
