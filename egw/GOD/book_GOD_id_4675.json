    "word": "Jesus knew that whatever was presented that was out of harmony with what he came to earth to unfold, was false and delusive. But he said, \"Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.\" [John 18:37.] Having stood in the counsels of God, having dwelt in the everlasting heights of the sanctuary, all elements of truth were in him, and of him; for he was one with God. \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak what we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\" [John 3:11-13.] \"Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.\" [Proverbs 30:5, 6.]--Review and Herald, Dec. 1, 1891. \n\n                                               -",
