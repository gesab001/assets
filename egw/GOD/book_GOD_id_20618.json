    "word": "In this his last letter to Timothy, Paul held up before the younger worker a high ideal, pointing out the duties devolving on him as a minister of Christ. \n                                                                           109\n\"Study to show thyself approved unto God,\" the apostle wrote, \"a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" \"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.\" [2 Timothy 2:15, 22-25.] --\"The Acts of the Apostles,\" pages 499-502.",
