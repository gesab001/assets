    "word": "You and others have seen the church struggling under the heaviest difficulties. Brother Stratton has from the first stood as a soul-trying case of hindrance to the church, and then other cases of difficulty have been continually arising. C.H.H. has been a very trying burden to the church. God's frown has been upon him and upon M.B.S. Both have been an offense to God, and His frown has been upon those who have sympathized with them and reflected upon the mother of Chapin. There are other cases I cannot mention now, which have brought the displeasure of God upon the church.",
