    "word": "April 8, half-past ten a.m. We had a most precious meeting at half-past five this morning, and it would have done your soul good to have heard the heartfelt testimonies that were borne. Brother John Sisley bore a good free, heartfelt testimony. Brother Ballenger proclaimed himself a converted man, and there is a right ring to his testimony. He says he can take hold of the work now as he never could take hold of it before, because he simply did not know how to exercise faith and cling to the righteousness of Christ. I wish you could see and hear Elder Kilgore. He talks things right out. He weeps and rejoices. He says he has had a new conversion, that his eyes are opened, that he no longer sees men as trees walking in his religious experience, but that he sees clearly that it is Christ's righteousness that he must rely upon or he is a lost man. Brother Tait is also out into the clear light, and his testimony rings out in decided tones. He has found Jesus and is so happy. He says that there are young men at this meeting who have been brought into the truth through his labors, and we can judge how glad he feels \n                                                                           290\nto hear them express their joy and gratitude for the light that has shown upon us, and to see the deep movings of the Spirit of God on their hearts.",
