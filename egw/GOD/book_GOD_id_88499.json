    "word": "Book Committee in Need of Converting Power of God--The book committee has been following in the tread of the paths of Rome. When Prof. Prescott's matter was condensed, and refused publication, I said to myself, \"This committee needs the converting power of God upon their own hearts, that they may comprehend their duty.\" They do not know themselves. Their ideas are not to control the ideas of another. From the light which the Lord has given for the managers of the book committee, they do not know what they should condemn or what approve. They know not the workings of God. It is not such men as these who are to work the minds of God's heritage. The Holy Spirit must do this work. It is because of their separation from God that men have misunderstood and failed to comprehend the fact that they are not to rule their fellow men. It is not for these men to condemn or control the productions of those whom God is using as His light-bearers to the world. By their course of action they have so narrowed their range of vision that they are far from being proper judges. They must fall on the Rock Christ Jesus and be broken.--Ms. 148, 1898, pp. 1, 2. (\"The Book Committee,\" Oct. 26, 1898.)",
