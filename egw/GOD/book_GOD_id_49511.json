    "word": "The apostle writes, \"Ye are not your own.\" Even when we were under the control of a cruel master, even when the prince of darkness ruled our spirits, the Lord Jesus Christ paid the ransom price of His own blood for us. . . . Render to Him willing heart service, and no longer rob God of that which is His own. \"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" . . .",
