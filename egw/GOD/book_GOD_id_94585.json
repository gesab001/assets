    "word": "Jesus saw Satan tempting you and magnifying your trials before you. You were distrustful. If in pain, you thought it the precursor of your speedy dissolution. This is the enemy's work, but you can resist him; you can be a conqueror. God wants you to be cheerful, free, happy, and trustful, ready to say with Paul, \"Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.\" Your trials are God's workmen; and \n\n\n                                     -135- \n\nif borne with patience, they will prepare you for a recompense of reward. Therefore you should be of good courage under them.",
