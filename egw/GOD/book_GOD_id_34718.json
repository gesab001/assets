    "word": "None need be deceived. The law of God is as sacred as His throne, and by it every man who cometh into the world is to be judged. There is no other standard by which to test character. \"If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" Now shall the case be decided according to the Word of God, or shall man's pretensions be credited? Christ says, \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" [SELECTED MESSAGES, BOOK 2, P. 50.]",
