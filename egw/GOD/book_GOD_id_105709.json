    "word": "If you have any critics, for Christ\u2019s sake keep them away, off of your Board. There are critics enough. We don\u2019t want critics on the Board. We don\u2019t want to waste the precious time that God has given us, to hasten the day when the truth shall go, because the Board breaks up and nothing is done because they don\u2019t agree. Brethren, let us be agreed, if we do not see every item and jot and tittle worth mentioning, it is not worth mentioning half the time.",
