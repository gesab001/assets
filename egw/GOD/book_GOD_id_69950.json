Those who cast His Word behind them, and seek by their own blind philosophy to penetrate the mysteries of Jehovah, will stumble in darkness.

Inspiration, in giving us the history of the Flood, has explained wonderful mysteries that geology alone could never fathom.\u2014Signs of the Times, March 20, 1879.",
