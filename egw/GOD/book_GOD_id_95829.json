    "word": "Mary, you must die to Rochester. It will only be to the injury of yourself and others in your present state to visit Rochester. God has been reaching down His hand to save you. It was God's will that you should not go to Rochester last fall; it would have proved your ruin. John would have been driven from the field to laboring with his hands. God would not have it so. He laid out the work for John to save you both.",
