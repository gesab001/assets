    "word": "John the Baptist was pronounced by our Saviour the greatest of prophets. Yet what a contrast between the language of this man of God and that of many who profess to be ministers of the cross. When asked if he was the Christ, John declares himself unworthy even to unloose his Master's sandals. When his disciples came with the complaint that the attention of the people was turned to the new Teacher, John reminded them that he himself had claimed to be only the forerunner of the Promised One. To Christ, as the bridegroom, belongs the first place in the affections of his people. \"The friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth because of the bridegroom's  voice. This my joy, therefore, is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease. He that cometh from above is above all.\" \"He that hath received His testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.\"",
