    "word": "I speak to you in the name of the Lord. I know you do not see things clearly. When you were receiving large wages from the office you did not give their equivalent in faithful influence and work. You were not faithful to keep the charge of the Lord. You have ever valued your labors far more highly than their worth. By exaggerating the value of your own work, you have received the credit of the knowledge and experience which others have brought into the publishing work. I must tell you the truth: I cannot see how you can ever be connected with such important interests again when the principles interwoven into the work have been so entirely contrary to the light God has given in regard to how His work in business and religious lines should be conducted.--Lt. 28, 1896. (See also 2SM 196, 197.)",
