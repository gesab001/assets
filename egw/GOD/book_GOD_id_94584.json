    "word": "Jesus will work with your efforts if you take counsel of Him. He looks upon you with the tenderest compassion. He loves you, and wants you to be happy. He knows your every weakness, and He pities you and wants to help you. The work is great, and you may act a part in it, if you will take hold of the strength of almighty power. You have precious ability, and if you employ it wisely, and stay your soul upon God, Jesus will recognize you as a co-laborer with Him. Look up, my brother; in the name of Jesus I bid you look up. Do not look at yourself; do not express doubts; but talk faith, hope and courage, and Jesus will bring you off more than conqueror.",
