    "word": "The Lord has given me messages of warning for his people, which I have, with much burden and pain of soul, communicated to you. I have been awakened at midnight, and in the small hours of the morning, to write you things which your blind eyes could not discern. \"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?\" The message God has given has affected some zealously, but not all well. You do not see, you do not realize, the necessity of seeking the Lord earnestly, and fervently, and perseveringly, until you know that Christ is formed within you, the hope of glory.",
