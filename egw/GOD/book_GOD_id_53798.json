    "word": "I saw that the spirit of sacrifice was almost gone from the church. Self-denial has almost failed; self and self-interest come first, and then if they can as well as not they will do what they think they can for the cause. Such a sacrifice I saw was lame and not accepted of God. All should be interested to do their utmost to advance the cause. I saw that those who have no possessions here, but have strength of body, were accountable to God for their strength. They should be diligent in business and fervent in spirit; they should not leave those that have possessions to do all the sacrificing. I saw that they could sacrifice, and that it was their duty to do so as well as those that have property. But often those individuals that have no possessions do not realize that they can deny themselves in many ways; can lay out less upon their bodies and to gratify their appetite, and find much to spare the cause and lay up in Heaven a treasure.",
