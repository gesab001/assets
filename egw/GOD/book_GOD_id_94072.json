    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 21, 1892. The mail from America came last evening, and Willie and I had a feast indeed in reading our letters. During the past night I slept but little. My heart longs for more of the presence of Jesus. My constant prayer is that I may be uplifted into a purer, holier atmosphere. I am pleading with God to remove my suffering. And although I \n\n\n                                    -296- \n\ncontinue to suffer, I am comforted by the thought that Jesus knows, and that He will help me. I shall see light in His light. My right arm is free from pain, and for this blessing I thank the Lord. The dear Saviour will not leave nor forsake us. I will praise Him because in all our afflictions He encourages and enables me to rejoice in His great mercies.",
