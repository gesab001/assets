    "word": "The Lord will manifest Himself to all who seek Him with humble hearts. The end of all things is at hand. Our eyes must be fixed upon Christ. As the called and chosen of God, we must represent the truth in its purity. Our lives are to be such that the world will take knowledge of us that we have been with Christ, and that the truth may seem to them more desirable than error.",
