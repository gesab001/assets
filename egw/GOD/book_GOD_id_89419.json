    "word": "Christ would teach this lesson to all who will follow Him. As our substitute and surety, standing at the head of humanity, He is our example. He was obedient to all of God's requirements. He, the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, laid aside His royalty, His position as commander in the heavenly courts, and came to our world as a man, and became subject to the law. And all this, that man might become like his Master, obedient, not to the enemy of God, but obedient to his Father in heaven; then man might engage in the service that God requires of each of His obedient children.",
