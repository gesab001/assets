    "word": "Opposition is the lot of all whom God employs to present truths specially applicable to their time. There was a present truth,--a truth at that time of special importance,--in the days of Luther; there is a present truth for the church today. But truth is no more desired by the majority today than it was by the papists who opposed Luther. There is the same disposition to accept the theories and traditions of men for the word of God as in former ages. Those who present truth for this time should not expect to be received with greater favor than were earlier reformers. The great controversy between truth and error, between Christ and Satan, is to increase in intensity to the close of this world's history.",
