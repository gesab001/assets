    "word": "Elijah was a type of the saints who will be living on the earth at the time of the second advent of Christ and who will be \u201cchanged, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump,\u201d without tasting of death. 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52. It was as a representative of those who shall be thus translated that Elijah, near the close of Christ\u2019s earthly ministry, was permitted to stand with Moses by the side of the Saviour on the mount of transfiguration. In these glorified ones, the disciples saw in miniature a representation of the kingdom of the redeemed. They beheld Jesus clothed with the light of heaven; they heard the \u201cvoice out of the cloud\u201d (Luke 9:35), acknowledging Him as the Son of God; \n103\nthey saw Moses, representing those who will be raised from the dead at the time of the second advent; and there also stood Elijah, representing those who at the close of earth\u2019s history will be changed from mortal to immortal and be translated to heaven without seeing death.",
