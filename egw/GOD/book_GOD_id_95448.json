    "word": "April 22, 1892. This morning I awoke with increased hope and confidence in God. During the night I had many wakeful hours, and I called most earnestly upon the Lord. He has given me the assurance that I shall see in my body and spirit the salvation of God. During the past four months of pain and infirmity, I have constantly importuned God for help. He has said that those who come to Him He will in no wise cast out, and I believe His word. I believe that I shall be restored to health and enabled to bear my testimony in Australia. The Lord is good and greatly to be praised. I shall live to speak His praise in the congregation. I do not understand why I am lying here, unable to labor for the Lord; but God understands, and that is enough for me.",
