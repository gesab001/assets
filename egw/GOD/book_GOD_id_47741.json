    "word": "I know something of the glory of the future life. Once a sister wrote to me and asked if I would not tell her something about the city of our God, further than we have in the Word. She asked me if I could not draw something of its plans. I wrote her that I would have to say to her, \"Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\" \"No,\" said I, \"you cannot paint, you cannot picture, and the martyr tongue cannot begin to give any description of the glory of the future life; but I will tell you what you can do: you can 'press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.' You can die to self; you can seek to grow up to the perfection of Christian character in Christ Jesus.\" That is our work; but when men begin to meddle with God's Word, I want to tell them to take their hands off, for they do not know what they are doing (MS 13, 1888).",
