    "word": "Gifts to Be Blended--The Lord has given gifts differing according to the grace that is given. Let no one suppose that his special gift is above all other gifts. These gifts are to be made helpful by connecting them with the gifts of others. Each is to fill his place with the gift appointed of God. They are to be appreciated as essential for the advancement of the cause of God.--Letter 57, 1898, p. 3. (To W. W. Prescott, June 19, 1898.)",
