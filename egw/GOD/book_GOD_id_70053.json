    "word": "In the Christian world today fraud is practiced to a fearful extent. God\u2019s commandment-keeping people should show that they are above all these things. The dishonest practices which mar the dealing of men and women with their fellow human beings should never be practiced by one who professes to be a believer in present truth. God\u2019s people do great harm to the truth by the least departure from integrity.",
