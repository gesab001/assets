    "word": "You do some good; but if you were a Christian in every sense of the word, what a power you would take with you in your ministerial labors! You profess to love the truth; I believe you do love it, but you do not reach the Bible standard. God wants all there is of you and yours. Your children are the Lord's property, the younger members of the Lord's family, to be brought up, not in the ways and customs of the world, but in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. It is your place to learn what the Lord approves and what he disapproves, and not to follow the wishes and pleasures of your children. You should ask, \"What is God's will concerning me and my children? Has he not \n\n\n                           [27] \n\nadmonished my children in the course they are now taking?\"",
