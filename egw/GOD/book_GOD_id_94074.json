    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 23, 1892. The nights are long and painful, but Jesus is my Comforter and my Hope. Today I have been able to sit up very little. I receive no encouragement from my neighbors, who are unbelievers. They say that I will certainly be a cripple for life; but I know that they do not know. They do not realize that the truth obeyed binds our hearts up with God. We have a Saviour who can heal. David was one who made the Most High his habitation. And although David was rebuked and punished by God for his departing from righteousness, yet the Lord, seeing him penitent and humble, forgave his sins and took him into covenant relation with Himself.",
