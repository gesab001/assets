    "word": "A Guard to Virtue.--Cherish the precious, priceless gem of modesty. This will guard virtue. . . . I feel impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to urge my sisters who profess godliness to cherish modesty of deportment and a becoming reserve. . . . I have inquired, When will the youthful sisters act with propriety?  I know there will be no decided change for the better until parents feel the importance of greater carefulness in educating their children correctly. Teach them  to act with reserve and modesty.--2T 458, 459 (1870).",
