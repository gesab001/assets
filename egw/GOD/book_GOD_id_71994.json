    "word": "The Word of God is to be brought into the very life. \"I am that bread of life,\" Christ declares. \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\" \"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:48, 53, 54, 63). Study the whole of the sixth chapter of John. Strive for your soul's sake to understand it.--Letter 253, July 18, 1904, to a longtime Adventist in business in Battle Creek, Michigan.",
