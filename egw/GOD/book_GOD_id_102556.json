    "word": "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I ask, Who in this school is on the Lord's side? Who will stand as faithful soldiers of Jesus Christ, refusing to allow Jesus to be denied and lightly regarded in their company? Because you are in the company of some who do not cultivate the superior qualities of character that constitute Christian gentlemen, but jest and joke, do not follow their example. Some use strange words, that are unbecoming for any who attend the school. Who will maintain their Christian principles? Who will frown down this lawless, riotous, godless spirit, which has been tolerated, but which has greatly displeased God, and which has effaced the impression made upon human hearts by the Spirit of God?",
