    "word": "Not All Will Accept Truth.--After the most earnest efforts have been made to bring the truth before those whom God has entrusted with large responsibilities, be not discouraged if they reject the truth. They did the same in the days of Christ. Be sure to keep up the dignity of the work by well-ordered plans and a godly conversation. Do not think you have elevated the standard too high.--Letter 12, 1887.",
