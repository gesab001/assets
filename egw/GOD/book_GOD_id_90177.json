    "word": "I would that the curtain might be rolled back and that every man, woman, and youth could see himself or herself just as they appear to God. Those who see themselves in their true light have nothing of which to boast. Could those who accuse others see themselves as they really are, they would understand what were the feelings of the Pharisees who brought in one who was verily guilty, and declared that she was worthy of a most cruel death. Christ heard all their vehement accusations, but instead of justifying their condemnation He stooped down and traced words in the sand as though He heard them not. One after another they drew near to Him, urging Him to give them an answer, and they caught sight of the words He had written, and they comprehended their meaning. First one and then another with confusion of face turned to leave the crowd.",
