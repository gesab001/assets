    "word": "The home is to be a school where the children will be educated and fitted for the higher grade--the school above. Ever keep this object in view. Teach your children to obey you, and to obey God. If parents or children are ever welcomed into the mansions above, it will be because they have in this world learned to obey the commands of God.",
