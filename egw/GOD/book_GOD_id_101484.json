    "word": "Sept. 24. Everything in our world is in agitation. \"Coming events cast their shadows before.\" The signs of the time are ominous \n                                                                           1432\nindeed. There is assurance in nothing that is human or earthly. The winds are held by the four angels, a moment of respite has been graciously given us of God. Every power lent us of God, whether physical, mental, or moral, is to be sacredly cherished to do the work assigned us for our fellow-men who are perishing in their ignorance. The warning is to go forth to all parts of the world. There must be no delay. Rapidly are men ranging themselves under the banner they have chosen, restlessly waiting and watching the movements of their leaders. There are those who are watching and waiting and working for our Lord's appearing, while the other party are rapidly falling into line under the generalship of the first great apostate. They look for a god in humanity, and Satan personifies the one they seek. Multitudes will be so deluded through their rejection of truth, that they will accept the counterfeit. Humanity is hailed as God.",
