Common sins, however insignificant they may be \n\n\n                                                      669 \n\nregarded, will impair your moral sense and extinguish the inward impression of the Spirit of God. The character of the thoughts leaves its imprint upon the soul, and all low conversation pollutes the mind. All evil works ruin to those who commit it. God may and will forgive the repenting sinner, but though forgiven, the soul is marred; the power of the elevated thought, possible to the unimpaired mind, is destroyed. Through all time the soul bears the scars. Then let us seek for that faith which works by love and purifies the heart that we may represent the character of Christ to the world.--RH. Dec 8, 1891. (FE 195.)",
