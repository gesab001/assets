    "word": "My son, do not attempt to do great things in your own strength. Counsel with your brethren. If you do not do this, it will often be said of you, He is determined to have his own way. You will be misunderstood. Leave with God the wrongs which you think exist. Be easily entreated, and be not easily provoked. Do not speak angry words because of something you have heard. This hurts your influence. May the grace of God help you to have patience.",
