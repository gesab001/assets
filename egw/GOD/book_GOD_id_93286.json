    "word": "The institutions for health should not be a school where surface work is done and the heart uninstructed, but where there shall be education after the Divine mind and will; for, in order for our medical institutions to be what God would have them [be], there must come into them a regenerating power, a spiritual life, that each worker must strive to live by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God. Not one of the workers are to receive their inspiration from those who are bitter against the truth, to institute a criticizing judging against their own brethren and sisters, whom they are taught by Christ to respect, to love, to esteem better than themselves. The workers at the Health Retreat need to unlearn many things. Those who are in positions as teachers need indeed that one teach them the first principles of Christianity, which is to love one another as Christ has loved them.",
