    "word": "Jesus came to our world, and took upon Him our nature, and He was assailed with all the temptations wherewith men will be beset, but He yielded not. He maintained the full perfection of heaven's character. It is such a character, builded after the Pattern, that constitutes our fitness to see God. Without Christ we can do nothing. We must come into close relation to Jesus; our life must be hid with Christ in God. Like Moses, we must be hidden in the cleft of the Rock, and then we shall behold the glory of God. God designs that the divine shall be united with the human. Man, though fallen, need not ever remain enfeebled and degraded through sin. We are to become partakers of the pure and celestial element, beholding Jesus, and becoming changed into His likeness.",
