    "word": "Brother [T. J.] Butler did not understand this change, and Satan has been troubling him with it ever since; and Brother Butler, being naturally stubborn and feeling the injustice of his brethren, became more and more tempted until he yielded the Sabbath and withdrew his interest from Sabbathkeepers. He felt bitter, very bitter. But I saw that God still pitied him and angels were seeking to win him to God and the truth again. I saw that those who have injured Brother Butler should confess where they had suffered him to suffer their wrongs, and they should take everything out of his way.--Ms 8, 1863. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Ms.",
