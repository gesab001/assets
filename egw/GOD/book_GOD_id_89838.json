    "word": "Children are to be taught to respect their father and mother, and this education is to be given them by example as well as precept. When the father gives kind attention to the mother, and the mother shows reverence for the father, the children will be educated to love and reverence their parents. They will be enabled to keep the fifth commandment. [Ephesians 6:13, quoted.] When unbelieving parents give commands that contradict the requirements of Christ, then, though it may be painful, the children must obey the Lord. But God has expressly enjoined upon children the duty of honoring the person and authority of father and mother. They are to treat their parents respectfully, to kindly care for them when they have ability and opportunity. The fifth commandments stands at the head of the precepts showing the duty of man to his fellow-men.",
