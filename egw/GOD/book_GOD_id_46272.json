    "word": "4-6. Second Commandment and Pictures.--A few condemned pictures, urging that they are prohibited by the second commandment, and that everything of this kind should be destroyed. . . . The second commandment prohibits image worship; but God himself employed pictures and symbols to represent to His prophets lessons which He would have them give to the people, and which could thus be better understood than if given in any other way. He appealed to the understanding through the sense of sight. Prophetic history was presented to Daniel and John in symbols, and these were to be represented plainly upon tables, that he who read might understand (HS 212).",
