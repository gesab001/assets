    "word": "\"The Lord would have every human intelligence in His service withhold all severe accusations and railings. We are instructed to walk with wisdom toward them that are without. Leave with God the work of condemning and judging. Christ invites us, 'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.' Every one who heeds this invitation will yoke up with Christ. We are to manifest at all times and in all places the meekness and lowliness of Christ. Then the Lord will stand by His messengers, and will make them His mouthpieces, and he who is a mouthpiece for God will never put into the lips of human beings words which the Majesty of heaven would not utter when contending with the devil.",
