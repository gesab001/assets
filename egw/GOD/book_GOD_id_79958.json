    "word": "26. Lift up Jesus to the world. Present his life and character before men. Dwell upon his humiliation and self-denial. Meditate upon the incarnation of the Son of God, who, though equal with the Father, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich. Jesus calls for volunteers for his service, but he states the condition upon which they will be accepted as his followers. He says, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\" This is required of every one who has united himself with Jesus. The Lord Jesus descended lower and lower till he touched the depths of humiliation, in order that his grace might be multiplied unto us, and the streams of salvation might be poured out to those who were perishing, who know not God and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. \n                                                                           43",
