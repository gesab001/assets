    "word": "God calls for physicians who will make reforms in the methods of treating the sick. He calls for physicians who will cooperate with Him. He calls for righteous judgment among medical practitioners, who are acting in His stead. The physician who loves his brother as he loves himself will not charge exorbitant prices. A change must take place. It is just as essential that there be reform in medical lines as in other business lines. \n\n\n                                  -35- \n\nThere is grave overreaching in the charges made by lawyers and doctors. The Lord views all these things.",
