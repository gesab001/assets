    "word": "Our time, our strength, and our energies belong to God; and if they are consecrated to His service, our light will shine. It will affect first and most strongly those in our own homes, who are most intimately associated with us; but it will extend beyond the home, even to \"the world.\" To many it will be a savor of life unto life; but there are some who will refuse to see the light, or to walk in it. They are of that class spoken of by our Saviour, when He said: \"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.\" Such are in a very dangerous position; but their course does not excuse any of us from letting our light shine.",
