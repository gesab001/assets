    "word": "God wants as perfect work as it is possible for human beings to do. To do His work in a cheap, imperfect style is a dishonor to the sacred truth and its Author. We should feel that it is necessary for those who are to connect with the work to receive an education for it. Bookkeeping is a subject that needs to be studied in order that it may be done with correctness and dispatch, and without worry and taxation.",
