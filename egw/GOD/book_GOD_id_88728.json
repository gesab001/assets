    "word": "Students and teachers are to regard themselves as being in partnership. It will be of no benefit or blessing to the school for any of those who act as teachers to draw themselves apart. Work in Christ's lines. Talk to each other and pray with each other as Christians. Stand under the yoke of Christ. \"Learn of Me,\" said the great Teacher, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" (Matthew 11:29, 30). I am instructed to speak to our teachers, urging them to become elevated, sanctified, ennobled, by heeding the invitation, \"Come unto me. Take upon you My yoke of restraint and obedience.\". . . A study of God's Word will make all students wise unto salvation.--Ms. 55, 1898, pp. 2-4, 7, 9, 10. (\"Union With Christ and With Each Other,\" May 4, 1898.)",
