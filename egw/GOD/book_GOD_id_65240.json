    "word": "No Condemnation of Others. By earnest, Christlike efforts, men will be convicted and converted, and God will speak pardon to them. Let no one turn away a soul who leaves the service of Satan and asks Jesus for pardon. \"Of some have compassion, making a difference.\" When they give evidence that the Spirit of God is striving with them, present to them every encouragement for entering the Lord's service. Do not discourage them by indifference, by drawing away from them with an air of, \"I am holier than thou\" [Isaiah 65:5].",
