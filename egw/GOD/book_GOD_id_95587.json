    "word": "The happiness of every soul depends upon the righteousness of Christ, and true goodness is above true greatness. Every teacher, working in the name of Christ, who is really sent from God, will discern these principles and will respond to them both by precept and example. The light shining from God's Word in reproofs, warnings, entreaties, and encouragements is ordained of God and designed and adapted to accomplish the sanctification of the entire man. But when reproofs come close and cutting, then the human, unsanctified, unsubdued will begins to find some excuse, some refuge, into which they can hide and conceal their deformity of character.",
