    "word": "Though I am brain weary, yet I see so much to be done. Our warfare will soon be ended, but the Lord is good and merciful. When our warfare is ended, we shall rest in hope until the morning of the resurrection. Then the last trump shall sound, and we shall see the King in His beauty, and behold His matchless charms. My dear sister, we have a precious hope; let our hearts rely constantly upon God. Truth will triumph and bear away the victory. . . .",
