    "word": "Study for Time and Eternity \n\n     The school located in Avondale is to be conducted in accordance with the mind and will of God. Every student should work from principle, his motto being, I study for time and for eternity. I use my muscles to do the very things that some one must do. Students should perform physical labor in the early morning and in the cool of the day, using the hours during the heat of the day for study. The limbs and muscles are God's gift just as verily as are riches and intellect. Every part of the human machinery must be used proportionately, or else some parts will be clogged and enfeebled. . .",
