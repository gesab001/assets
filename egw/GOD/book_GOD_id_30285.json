    "word": "In word and deed the physicians and nurses in our medical institutions are to say, so plainly that it cannot be misunderstood, \"God is in this place,\" to save, not to destroy. Christ \n                                                                           41\ninvites our physicians to become acquainted with Him. When they respond to His invitation, they will know that they receive the things they ask for. Their minds will be enlightened by wisdom from above. Constantly beholding the Saviour, they will become more and more like Him, till at last it can be said of them in the heavenly courts, \"Ye are complete in Him.\" Christ has pledged Himself to give His disciples what they ask for in His name. As they labor in harmony with Him, they can ask Him to aid them in every time of need.--MS. 14, 1904.",
