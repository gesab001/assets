    "word": "Imitate God's Perfect Ways \n\n     Build for eternity. Christ's lessons are before us. We are to do carefully, neatly, and with exactitude whatever is to be done. We are to study economy in every line of work. Builders, gather up the fragments. Let nothing be lost. In all that there is to be done, in planting and building, imitate God's perfect ways.",
