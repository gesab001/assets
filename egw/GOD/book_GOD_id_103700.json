    "word": "\"Dear Brethren and Sisters:- \n     As we returned from the General Conference, we stopped ten days in southern California, and between the council meetings at Los Angeles, we made a short visit to San Diego, and spent four days at the Paradise Valley Sanitarium. I am much pleased to see the sanitarium fully furnished and in running order. . . My heart rejoices as I review the way in which the providences of God worked to help us to secure this property. . .",
