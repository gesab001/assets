    "word": "Do not make a low standard your aim; aim high. Never be found at any time working on the side of the great adversary of souls, who is seeking to counteract the workings of the Spirit of God.

You are the property of Christ both by creation and redemption, and the glory of God is involved in your individual success. . . .",
