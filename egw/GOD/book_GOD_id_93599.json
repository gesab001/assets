    "word": "A man's success in the ministry does not rest upon his excluding himself from useful labor, nor upon his popularity or indolence, but upon his willingness to labor in any position that seems to be duty. Those who are the most willing to toil and show industry in business lines, and who, themselves, plan and devise to be a help to others in branches of common toil, are the men who will be chosen by God to do Him service wherever their lot may be cast. They may be called upon with the help of others to build their own homes, or to build a church, or to do this alone, if they have a knowledge of how to handle tools.",
