    "word": "Has not God spoken in His word concerning the solemn events which must shortly take place? As you read these things, do you believe what He says? Or have you, through listening to specious philosophy, given up your faith in God? Can any power avert the punishment that must come upon you unless you humble your hearts before God and confess your sins? How is it, my brethren in the medical missionary work? Does not the living God speak to you from His word concerning the events that are taking place in fulfilment of that word? Soon the last great reckoning with man will take place. Have your lives been such that you can then be weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, and not be found wanting? Or has your faith been molded and restricted until it has become unbelief? Has your obedience to men become rebellion against God? \"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.\"",
