    "word": "I do not know but all present have infirmities of some kind upon them. If so, do not gratify the enemy by standing in the desk and telling of those infirmities; but talk of the mighty power of Christ to bless all who come unto him. Jesus lives. Move out by faith, and claim the promises of God. Do you not remember the woman that came behind Jesus and touched the hem of his garment and was made whole? Hers is the kind of faith that you need. Many have the casual touch, but there are few who are closely connected with Christ by living faith.",
