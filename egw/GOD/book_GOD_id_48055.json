    "word": "(Psalm 119:126, 127; Malachi 3:18.) It Is Time to Fight!--Let no one yield to temptation and become less fervent in his attachment to God's law because of the contempt placed upon it; for that is the very thing that should make us pray with all our heart and soul and voice, \"It is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law.\" Therefore, because of the universal contempt, I will not turn traitor when God will be most glorified and most honored by my loyalty.  {7BC 981.10} \n     What! shall Seventh-day Adventists relax their devotedness when all their capabilities and powers should be placed on the Lord's side; when an unflinching testimony, noble and uplifting, should come from their lips? \"Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.\"  {7BC 981.11}  \n     When the law of God is most derided and brought into the most contempt, then it is time for every true follower of Christ, for those whose hearts have been given to \n                                                                           982\nGod, and who are fixed to obey God, to stand unflinchingly for the faith once delivered to the saints. \"Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.\" It is time to fight when champions are most needed (RH June 8, 1897).  {7BC 981.12}  \n     13 (2 Timothy 4:7, 8). God Honors the Faithful Aged.--There are living upon our earth men who have passed the age of fourscore and ten. The natural results of old age are seen in their feebleness. But they believe God, and God loves them. The seal of God is upon them, and they will be among the number of whom the Lord has said, \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.\" With Paul they can say, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished by course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also which love his appearing.\" There are many whose grey hairs God honors because they have fought a good fight and kept the faith (Letter 207, 1899).",
