    "word": "Round eight: Love\n     The love of Christ must control our hearts, and the peace of God will abide in our homes. Seek God with a broken and contrite spirit, and you will be melted with compassion toward your brethren. You will be prepared to add to brotherly kindness, charity, or love. Without charity we will become \u201cas sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\u201d Our highest professions are hollow and insincere; but \u201clove is the fulfilling of the law.\u201d We shall be found wanting, if we do not add charity that suffereth long and is kind, that vaunteth not itself, that seeketh not her own.",
