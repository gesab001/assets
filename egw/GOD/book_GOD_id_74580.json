    "word": "Praise the Lord in the congregation of His people. When the word of the Lord was spoken to the Hebrews anciently, the command was: \"And let all the people say, Amen\" (Psalm 106:48). When the ark of the covenant was brought into the city of David, and a psalm of joy and triumph was chanted, \"all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord\" (1 Chronicles 16:36). This fervent response was an evidence that they understood the word spoken and joined in the worship of God.",
