    "word": "If you see something in a brother that needs to be corrected, go to him and say, \"Let us pray about this; let us talk with God about it.\" If you should weep, this will not hurt you. If you were to break your heart before God, He can bind it up and give you that grace which is unto eternal life. But God has not set you as dictators. He has not committed to you the work of punishing sinners. He desires you to search your own heart and put away your sins, to work away from every defect of character.--MS 73, 1906. \n\n\n                                                     137",
