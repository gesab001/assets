    "word": "PRAYER NO SUBSTITUTE FOR OBEDIENCE.\u2014Men and women, in the face of the most positive commands of God, will follow their own inclination, and then dare to pray over the matter, to prevail upon God to consent to allow them to go contrary to His expressed will. God is not pleased with such prayers. Satan comes to their side, as he did to Eve in Eden, and impresses them, and they have an exercise of mind, and this they relate as a most wonderful experience which the Lord has given them.\u2014(Review and Herald, July 27, 1886.)",
