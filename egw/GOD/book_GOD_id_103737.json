    "word": "Some of our medical missionaries have supposed that a medical training according to the plans of worldly schools is essential to their success. To those who have thought that the only way to success is by being taught by worldly men, I would now say, Put away such ideas. This is a mistake that should be corrected. It is a dangerous thing to catch the spirit of the world the popularity which such a course invites, will bring into the work a spirit which the word of God cannot sanction. The medical missionary who would become efficient, if he will search his own heart and consecrate himself to Christ, may by diligent study and faithful service, learn how to grasp the mysteries of his sacred calling.",
