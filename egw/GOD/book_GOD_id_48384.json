    "word": "Then I saw that the seven last plagues were soon to be poured out upon those who have no shelter, yet the world regard them no more than they would so many drops of water that were about to fall. Then I was made capable to endure the awful sight of the seven last plagues, the wrath of God. I saw that his anger was dreadful and terrible, and if he should stretch forth his hand, or lift it in anger, the inhabitants of the world would be as though they never had been, or would suffer the incurable sores and withering plagues that would come upon them, and they would find no deliverance, but be destroyed by them.",
