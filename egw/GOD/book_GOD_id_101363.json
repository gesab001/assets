    "word": "Christ calls upon all who claim to be sons and daughters of God to consider His words in the supplication to the Father just before His betrayal and death: \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom He hath sent.\" These words open before us a field of study which we have strangely neglected. Through their lack of interest in the word of God, men and women absent themselves from the school of Christ, choosing to serve themselves; as a sure result they remain in the darkness of error, fighting against error, fighting against God, and closing their eyes to the truth. Shall we in these last days, place ourselves in the ranks of those who deplore the absence of God's Spirit, and yet who do not seek God that they may find it? At times some are convicted and aroused, but they serve God with a divided heart, and soon fall back into error, serving the world under the pretext of serving God. God recognizes all such, not as His servants, but as servants of sin. \n                                                                           1348",
