    "word": "If the buildings erected correspond to the truth that we are proclaiming, a telling influence will be exerted on minds. Actions speak louder than words. Say frankly, \"God has charged us not to invest a large amount of means in one place, and He has charged us also not to invest means in gratifying the desire for display.\" The principles that we are to follow in our work are exemplified in the life of Christ. He was the Majesty of heaven, and yet He worked at a carpenter's bench. And however lowly His task, it was done with the utmost exactitude.--Letter 83, 1904, pp. 1, 2. (To A. G. Daniells, W. W. Prescott, and Dr. Hare, February 15, 1904.) \n\nReleased December 2, 1974.",
