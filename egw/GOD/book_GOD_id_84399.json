    "word": "MR No. 231 - Material on Sanctification\n\n     Pray for me. I have trials that none but God knows of, but I have started for eternal life and I cannot stop this side. I must see the inside of glory, stagger not at the promises, but believe. Faith, simple faith, is what we want, a firm reliance and trust in God. Faith will drive back the powers of darkness; only have faith and you will have a clear, sweet atmosphere to live and breathe in.--Letter 1, 1848, p. 3. (To Brother and Sister Hastings, May 29, 1848.)",
