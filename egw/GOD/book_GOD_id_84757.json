    "word": "We may consider, as Jesus bade us, the lilies of the valley, and the beautiful flowers growing up around us should awaken in our hearts not only reverence but love to God. We need greater natural simplicity, and far more spirituality than we now possess in order to read aright the pages of the book of nature that God has opened before us. We want to grasp through faith the eternal, which He has set before us in earthly forms and semblances that the depths of our souls may be reached, that we may magnify and reverence the God of nature.",
