    "word": "My brother, how can I hope to labor in harmony with you when Minneapolis with its experiences is so plainly before me? My ministering brethren came to that conference with a spirit that was not the Spirit of God. They were under a deception in regard to me. If the Spirit of God had impressed and controlled their hearts they would not have taken a position so wide of the mark in judging me, my position and work. After plainly stating my position I said that as long as my brethren thought that I was influenced in my judgment and work by W.C. White, A. T. Jones, or Dr. Waggoner, they need not send for me to attend their camp-meetings or conferences for I could do them no good if I did come.",
