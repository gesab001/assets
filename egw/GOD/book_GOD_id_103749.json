    "word": "Brother and Sister Burden, I am very anxious that you should work with the best of courage. Notwithstanding that there are those who do not speak to you the encouraging words that for their own souls' good the Lord would have them speak, yet I have this word for you: You are to press on; still bearing the Lord's message for this time. There is a great work that with the help of the Lord you can both do. I wish that all those \n\n\n                              -559- \n\nconnected with you were united heart and mind in assisting you in the right way by speaking words of encouragement. But so long as you keep the eye of faith fixed on your Leader, you are safe. Rest in his hands. I am bidden to charge you not to fail or become discouraged. Keep (922) your hearts filled with courage. Talk faith. Some are ready to speak words of discouragement. The Lord says to you, Be of good courage. Walk humbly, and work out the will of God. I am to say to you, There are many words of an objectionable character spoken by some who suppose that thus they can bring in improvements. But go straight ahead, following the instruction of Christ. \n\n                                               -",
