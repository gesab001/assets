    "word": "Chapter XXXVII. - Deliverance of the Saints.\n\n     It was at midnight that God chose to deliver his people. As the wicked were mocking around them, suddenly the sun appeared, shining in his strength, and the moon stood still. The wicked beheld the scene with amazement. Signs and wonders followed in quick succession. Every thing seemed turned out of its natural course. The saints beheld the tokens of their deliverance with solemn joy.",
