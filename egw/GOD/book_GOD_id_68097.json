    "word": "A religious experience that is not founded in Christ and Him alone is worthless. . . . Men of intellectual powers need a clear, scriptural presentation of the plan of salvation. Let the truth in its simplicity and power be presented to them. If this does not hold the attention and arouse the interest, they never can be interested in heavenly and divine things. In every congregation there are souls who are unsatisfied. Every Sabbath they want to hear something definite explaining how they can be saved, how they are to become Christians. The important thing for them to know is, How can a sinner be justified before God?--Letter 23a, Jan. 10, 1893, to Brother E. H. Gates.",
