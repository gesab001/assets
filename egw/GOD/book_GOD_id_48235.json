    "word": "Thank God that He who spilled His blood for us, lives to plead it, lives to make intercession for every soul who receives Him. \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. It speaketh better things \n\n\n                                                                 (479) \n\nthan the blood of Abel, for Christ ever liveth to make intercession for us. We need to keep ever before us the efficacy of the blood of Jesus.--Letter 87, 1894.",
