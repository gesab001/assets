    "word": "MR No. 1339 - All Gifts of the Spirit to be Utilized; Christians not to be Controlled by Feelings; Look to Jesus as Example\n\n                  (Written in 1851 to \"Dear Brother Pierce.\") \n\n     Duty compels me to write a few lines. In vision the Lord has shown me some things of late which I feel duty to write you. I saw that all was not right with you, that you are in a place where your influence can tell but little; you are in too narrow a compass. I saw that Brethren Pierce and Phillips can be of use in the cause of God. Both their gifts are needed where they have not yet been, where their gifts are new and can affect more. The King's business is important, and requires haste. Jesus is coming, and there is no time to dally. With energy and zeal souls must be pulled out of the fire.",
