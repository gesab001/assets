    "word": "We thank God for every token of His love and of His grace. We will praise God and take courage. We will not sit as criticizers. We will not turn from the heavenly benefits, neither will we sit in judgment to condemn God's ways and God's manner of working because others feel like doing it. They have no reason for saying the things that they do, no reason to resist the Spirit of God.",
