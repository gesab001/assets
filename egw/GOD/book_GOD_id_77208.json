    "word": "Every day that you disregard the claims of God, every opportunity of offered mercy you slight, is charged to your account, and will swell the list of sins against you in the day when the accounts of every soul will be investigated. I address you, young men and women, professor or unprofessor. God calls for your affections, your devotion, your willing, cheerful obedience to him. You have now a short time of probation, and you may now improve this opportunity to make an unconditional surrender to God.",
