    "word": "MR No. 381 - Items for Notes and Papers\n\n     Those who at the last General Conference listened to the testimonies borne, but did not humble themselves before God, and change square about, have done despite to the spirit of grace and have placed themselves in a fortress of unbelief. Great light has shone upon them, but they have opposed the message borne to them, and have thus placed themselves in opposition to the Lord Jesus Christ.--Ms 18, 1903 p. 1. (\"A Call to Repentance,\" November 10, 1902.)",
