    "word": "The Saviour's own brothers did not believe on Him. They were zealous and impatient to have a temporal kingdom, in which they hoped to obtain special honor. Even Christ's own disciples were slow to learn and to understand. Notwithstanding their love for Him and their reverence of His character, their faith in His being the Son of God wavered. Their frequent reference to the traditions of the fathers, and their continual misunderstanding of His discourses, show how difficult it was for them to free themselves from superstition.",
