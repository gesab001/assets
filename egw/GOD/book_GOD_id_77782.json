    "word": "The spirit that sister Palmer manifested at the Health Institute was not the spirit of Christ. Her influence was not good. The influence of Bro. Palmer was generally good. But in some things he showed a narrow mind, and a selfish spirit, which displeased God, who has intrusted to him means, and the good things of this life, to use to his glory. Little acts of kindness make up the sum of life-happiness, and the selfish withholding of them makes up the sum of life's miseries.",
