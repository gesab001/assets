He is not a perfect man, but I know how God regards him--as a man of erring, impulsive disposition, but one who loves and fears Him, and one who will reach hearts if he has those in whom he can have confidence as counselors to help him.--Letter 10, 1885, pp. 1, 2. (To J. H. Waggoner, November 4, 1885.)",
