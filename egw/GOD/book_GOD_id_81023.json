    "word": "Eld. Smith, I was more grieved than I can express to find you again working on the side of the enemy. You will find quite a number who will strengthen you in your position; the leaven is working. You pronounce my work human, not actuated by the Spirit of God. On this point you have had great light; for this you are responsible. If God has ever wrought by me--unworthy and weak as I am at all times--he has wrought by me and through me for the last few months. In this long letter I spoke of many facts which I distinctly stated that I had been shown. I wrote to you, saying that I had seen what course you would pursue, to what lengths you would go, unless you heeded the light which God sent you in reproofs, in counsel, and warnings. Will you do despite to the Spirit of grace?",
