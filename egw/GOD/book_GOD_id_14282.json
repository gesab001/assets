    "word": "The apostles boldly declared that they ought to obey God rather than men. Said Peter, \"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance \n                                                                           196\nto Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are His witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey Him.\" At these fearless words those murderers were enraged, and determined to imbrue their hands again in blood by slaying the apostles. They were planning to do this, when an angel from God moved upon the heart of Gamaliel to counsel the priests and rulers: \"Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\" Evil angels were moving upon the priests and elders to put the apostles to death; but God sent His angel to prevent it by raising up among the Jewish leaders themselves a voice in favor of His servants. The work of the apostles was not finished. They were to be brought before kings to witness to the name of Jesus and to testify of the things which they had seen and heard.",
