    "word": "In the experience of Nebuchadnezzar is contained a lesson to which we should give heed, lest we fall into temptation. The perils of the last days are upon us, and we should watch and pray, read and heed the lessons that are given us in the books of Daniel and Revelation. In mercy the Lord has wrought in behalf of the Sanitarium, the College, and the Review and Herald office. Just as long as those in connection with these institutions walk humbly with God, heavenly intelligences will cooperate with them; but let all bear in mind the fact that God has said, \"Them that honor me I will honor\" [1 Samuel 2:30]. The Lord manifested Himself to the four Hebrew youth in the courts of Babylon. They were surrounded with temptations on every hand, yet God set a hedge about them in order that they should not be corrupted, because they preserved their simplicity of faith.",
