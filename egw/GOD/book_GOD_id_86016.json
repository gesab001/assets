    "word": "The mother, as she goes around, is not to fret and to scold, and to say, \"You are in my way, and I wish you would get away, I wish you would go out doors,\" or any such thing. She is to treat her children just as God should treat His older children. He calls us children in His family. He wants us educated and trained according to the principles of the Word of God. He wants this education to commence with the little ones. If the mother has not the tact, the ingenuity, if she does not know how to treat human minds, she must put them under somebody that will discipline them and mold and fashion their minds.",
