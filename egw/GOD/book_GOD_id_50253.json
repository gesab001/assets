    "word": "When teachers are willing to sit in the school of Christ and learn of the Great Teacher, they will know far less in their own estimation than they do now. When God becomes the teacher, he will be acknowledged, his name will be magnified; the students will be as were the young men in the schools of the prophets, who caught the Spirit of God, and prophesied. But the great adversary of souls is seeking to bring a dead, lifeless spiritual atmosphere into all our institutions. He works to turn and twist every circumstance to his own advantage, to the exclusion of Jesus Christ. Today, as in the days of Christ, God cannot do many mighty works because of the unbelief of those who stand in responsible positions. The converting power of God is needed before they will understand the word of God, and before they will be willing to humble themselves before God as learners.",
