    "word": "Neglect a Cause for Review and Herald Fire.--Since the last General Conference held in Battle Creek [in 1901], I have carried a very heavy burden, because I have keenly realized the great lack in the publishing plant there. For weeks I did not sleep past twelve o'clock. This was before the plant was burned. Light was given me that the spiritual blindness manifested by those connected with this institution was caused by their neglect to do a thorough work of confession and repentance, with contrition of soul seeking the Lord most earnestly. I was instructed that there was so manifest a disregard of the Word of God, given in the testimonies of His Holy Spirit, that the Lord would turn and overturn, visiting Battle Creek with His judgments.-- \n\n\n                                                      173 \n\nLt 37, 1903.
