    "word": "In the days of Noah, the wickedness of the world became so great that God could no longer bear with it. . . . But He pitied the race, and in His love provided a refuge for all who would accept it. He gave the message to Noah to be given to the people: \"My spirit shall not always strive with man.\" . . . The Spirit of God continued to strive with rebellious man until the time specified had nearly expired, when Noah and his family entered the ark, and the hand of God closed its door. Mercy had stepped from the golden throne, no longer to intercede for the guilty sinner.",
