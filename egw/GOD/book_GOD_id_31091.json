    "word": "God desires us to choose the heavenly in place of the earthly. He opens before us the possibilities of a heavenly investment. He would give encouragement to our loftiest aims, security to our choicest treasure. He declares, \"I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\" When the riches that moth devours and rust corrupts shall be swept away, Christ's followers can rejoice in their heavenly treasure, the riches that are imperishable.--\"Christ's Object Lessons,\" p. 374.",
