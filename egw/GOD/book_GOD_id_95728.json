    "word": "Men are finite; God is infinite. The Heavens do rule. We may not now be able to reconcile this fact with circumstances, but God works in a mysterious way His wonders to perform. God is working, we will not doubt, to bring light before many who otherwise would never have received knowledge of it. He works to diffuse blessings to His people scattered throughout our world. Do not for a moment think that God's hand is against you. Keep up good courage and remember that the Lord is Supreme Ruler. God suffers sin to develop itself in crimes and cruelties, yet He will not leave to confusion those who love Him.",
