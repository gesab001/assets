    "word": "\"There is an evidence that is open to all--the most highly educated, the most illiterate--the evidence of experience. God invites us to prove for ourselves the reality of His Word, the truth of His promises. He bids us 'taste and see that the Lord is good' (Psalm 34:8). Instead of depending upon the word of another, we are to taste for ourselves. He declares, 'Ask, \n\n\n                                -204- \n\nand ye shall receive' (John 16:24). His promises will be fulfilled. They have never failed; they never can fail. And as we draw near to Jesus, and rejoice in the fullness of His love, our doubt and darkness will disappear in the light of His presence.\"--Steps to Christ, pp. 105-107, 111-112.",
