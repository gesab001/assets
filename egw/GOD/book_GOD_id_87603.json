    "word": "Those who are acting a part in God's great firm are to prepare for emergencies. They are to be sure to talk with God before they talk with those who have erred or are going astray. There are many things to be corrected, but let us always remember that Mercy is the twin sister of Justice. Let our work be such that of it can be spoken the words, \"Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other\" (Psalm 85:10).-- Letter 98, 1901, pp. 5,6.",
