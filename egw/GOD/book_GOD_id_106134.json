    "word": "If the brain is overtaxed by taking too many studies, the student is robbed of physical health. This can only be secured to him by the exercise of the muscles. The human machine must be taxed proportionately, or health and vigor can not be maintained. When brain and muscle work proportionately, the youth can bring to the study of the Word of God healthy perceptions and well-balanced nerves. They can have wholesome, healthful thought and can retain the precious things \n\n\n                              -136- \n\nthat are brought from the Word. They will digest its truths, and as a result will have brain power to discern what is truth. Then, as occasion demands, they can give to every man that asketh a reason of the hope that is in them with meekness and fear.",
