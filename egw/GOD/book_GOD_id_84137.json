    "word": "MR No. 221 - Materials on the Work in the Inner City\n\n     In your letter of April 18 you speak of the work that is being done in Chicago. I am in full sympathy with the work that is being done there. I believe in helping along every line in which it is possible to help, following the steps of Christ. Those who take hold of this Christian-help work who will consecrate themselves to God, will find that He will be a present help to them in every hour of need. I know that the Lord will use those who will submit themselves to Him, and through the power of the Holy Spirit, they will be enabled to do the work that needs to be done.--Letter 43, 1895, p. 2. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, June 14, 1895.)",
