    "word": "At this time, just before the close of this earth's history, we need in the cause of God spiritual-minded men, men who are earnest in principle, and who have a clear understanding of what is truth. Immortality is obtained only by eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God. \"Verily\", verily I say unto you,\" Christ declared, \"He that believeth on me hath everlasting life....I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. . . Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him. . . It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" \n\n\n                                     -330-",
