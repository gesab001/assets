    "word": "There is a matchless loveliness in Jesus Christ. I love Him because He first loved me. We want the purity that there is in Jesus Christ, and He will save to the utmost all who come to Him. Then you see what Christ suffered for us. Are we willing to be partakers of His sufferings? He says if we are we will be partakers of His glory. How much have you suffered for Christ's sake? Are you willing to be partakers with Him in His suffering? If you are, He will cooperate with you and you can cooperate with the heavenly intelligences to bring the lost sheep back to the fold. There are souls that are perishing out of Christ, and what we want is to bring God's lost sheep back to Christ. May God help us to know what we must do. Christ loves us because we are helpless and dependent.",
