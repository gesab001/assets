    "word": "He who has an obedient heart, that is ready to do the will of God, will not only gladly receive truth, but will earnestly seek for truth as for hidden treasure. He will come to the Scriptures with a humble and teachable spirit, seeking to understand how he may walk in the light, and saying, \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" (Acts 9:6). He is ready to sacrifice anything and everything, if required, in order that he may be in harmony with the will of God.",
