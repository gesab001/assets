    "word": "Parents, inaction is the greatest curse that ever came upon youth. Your daughters should not be allowed to lie in bed late in the morning, sleeping away the precious hours lent them of God to be used for the best purpose, and for which they will have to give an account to Him. That mother does her daughters great injury who bears the burdens that, for their own present and future good, they should share with her. . . .",
