    "word": "That men should keep alive the spirit that ran riot at our General Conference in Minneapolis, is an offense to God. All heaven is indignant at the spirit that for years has been revealed in our publishing institution at Battle Creek. Unrighteousness is practised that God will not tolerate. He will visit for these things. A voice has been heard pointing out the errors, and, in the name of the Lord, pleading for a decided change. But who have followed the instruction given? Who have humbled their hearts, to put from them every vestige of their wicked, oppressive spirit? I have been greatly burdened to set these matters before the people as they are. I know they will see them. I know that those who read this matter will be convicted. \n\n                                               -",
