    "word": "Oh, how sad it is that men allow themselves to be so wrought upon by the enemy that they dare venture to exalt their finite judgment in opposition to God's plans and purposes. Man's authority bears the signature of man. We are not to permit the rank and file of our people to come under the generalship of the weak, confused sentiments of man. God's authority is to stand supreme. And I must call upon His people to recognize His authority, which bears the evidence of its divine origin. Every believer is called upon to unite inseparably with God's authority.",
