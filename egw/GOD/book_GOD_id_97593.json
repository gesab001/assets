    "word": "There are conditions to meet if we would be blessed and honored and exalted by God. It is separation from the world, a refusal to touch those things which would separate our affections from God. God has the first and highest claim upon you. Set your affections upon Him and heavenly things. Your tendrils must be severed from everything earthly. You are exhorted to touch not the unclean thing, for in doing this you will yourself become unclean. It is impossible for you to unite with those who are corrupt and still remain pure. \"What fellowship hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial?\" God and Christ and the heavenly host would have man know that if he unites with the corrupt, he will become corrupt. If we are found mingling with the world, we shall share the fate of the world.",
