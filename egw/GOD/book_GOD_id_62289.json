    "word": "The human family is suffering because of transgression of the laws of God. The Lord desires that men shall be led to understand the cause of their suffering and the only way to find relief. He desires them to see that their well-being--physical, mental, and moral--depends upon their obedience to His law. It is His purpose that our institutions shall be as object lessons showing the results of obedience to right principles.",
