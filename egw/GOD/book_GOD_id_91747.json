    "word": "I was shown years ago that there will be dissension and a lack of harmony and unity of action among the workers in our institutions unless all are subject to the authority of God. He will stand as Commander, if each will obey His directions; but there must also be a visible head who fears God. The Lord will never accept a careless, disorderly company of workers; neither will He undertake to lead forward and upward to noble heights and certain victories those who are self-willed and disobedient. The soul's progress means the Saviour's rule. The heart through which He diffuses His peace and joy and the blessed fruits of His love, is the heart which becomes His temple and His throne. \"Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\"",
