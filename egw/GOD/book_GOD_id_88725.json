    "word": "The Lord Jesus would have men connected with His work who appreciate that work as sacred; then they can cooperate with God. They will be unobstructed channels through which His grace can flow. The attributes of the character of Christ can be imparted to those only who distrust themselves. The highest scientific education cannot in itself develop a Christlike character. The fruits of true wisdom come from Christ alone.--Ms. 14, 1896, p. 1. (\"Qualifications Essential for the Work of God,\" April 28, 1896.)",
