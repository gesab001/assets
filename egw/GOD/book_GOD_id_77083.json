    "word": "\"The Lord has a great work to be done in the Southern States of America,-- the most neglected and the most sinful part of his vineyard. It was in accordance with God's purpose that the publishing work was started in Nashville. In his providence he has brought together in this place a company of workers who are to act their respective parts in the Publishing House, standing as representatives of Christianity. This institution is to give character to our work in the South. It will be instrumental in establishing the faith of many in Bible truth.\"--From \"Nashville as a Center,\" written May 20, 1902.",
