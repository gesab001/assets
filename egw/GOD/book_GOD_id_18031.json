    "word": "When students come to Battle Creek from long distances at great expense, expecting to receive instruction as to how to become successful missionaries, that idea is not to be sunk out of sight in a variety of studies. Consider Moses; the one great burden of his soul was that the presence of God might be with him, and that he might behold His glory. But if the students are given more studies than are absolutely necessary, it is calculated to cause them to forget the real object of their coming to Battle Creek. Now is the time when it is essential that only such work as is necessary should be done. Long years of preparation are not a positive necessity. The preparation of the students has been managed on the same principle as have the building operations. Building has been added to building, simply to make things a little more convenient and thorough. God is calling, and has been calling for years, for a reform on these lines. He desires that there shall be no unnecessary outlay of means. The Lord is not in favor of having so much time and money expended upon a few persons who come to Battle Creek to get a better preparation for the work. In all cases there should be a most careful consideration as to the best manner of expending money in the education of the students. While so much is spent to put a few through an exhaustive course of study, there are many who are thirsting for the knowledge they could get in a few months; one or two years would be considered a great blessing. \n                                                                           338\nIf all the means are used in putting a few through several years of study, many just as worthy young men and young women cannot be assisted at all.",
