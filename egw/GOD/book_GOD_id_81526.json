    "word": "If things had been left to more fully develop before they were touched, there would have been a separation of the disorderly, unconsecrated ones, and there would not have been an opposition party.

Those who really loved the truth for the truth's sake, should have pursued their course with the glory of God in view, and let the light of truth shine out before all.",
