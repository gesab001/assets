    "word": "nudity\n \n\n     Men and women, supposed to be guided by the Holy Spirit, held meetings in a state of nudity. They talked about\n51\nholy flesh. They said they were beyond the power of temptation, and they sang, and shouted, and made all manner of noisy demonstrations. These men and women were not bad, but they were deceived and deluded. . . . Satan was moulding the work, and sensuality was the result. The cause of God was dishonored. Truth, sacred truth, was leveled in the dust by human agencies.",
