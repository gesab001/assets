    "word": "The following is from a view given me at Jackson, Mich., June 2d, 1853. It related mostly to the brethren in that place. \"I saw that the brethren commenced to sacrifice their property, and handed it out without having the true object set before them--the suffering cause--and they handed out too freely, too much and too often. I saw that the teachers should have stood in a place to correct this error, and exert a good influence in the church. Money was made to be of little or no consequence; the sooner disposed of, the better. A bad example has been set by some in accepting large donations, and not giving the least caution to those who had means not to use it too freely and carelessly. And by accepting so large an amount of means, without questioning whether God had made it their duty to bestow so largely, they sanctioned the brethren's giving too bountifully.",
