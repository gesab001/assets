    "word": "God sees every transaction; nothing is hid from him. There is too much responsibility assumed by men who have not cultivated the love and compassion and sympathy and tenderness that characterized the life of Christ. In dealing with some of their brethren who have not followed their counsel or who may have questioned their course of action or who may have had dealings with them that did not please them, they manifest no love, although these souls are the purchase of the blood of Christ, and may be more precious in the sight of God because of their simplicity and their integrity in maintaining the right at any cost. When the brethren who for some reason dislike these persons have a chance, they will give encouragement to the spirit in harmony with the attributes of Satan rather than the Spirit of the living God.
