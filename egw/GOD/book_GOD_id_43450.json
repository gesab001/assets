    "word": "Giving an account of the last days of Sir Davis Brewster, his daughter writes: \"He thanked God that the way of salvation was so simple.  No labored argument, no hard attainment, was required.  To believe in the Lord Jesus Christ was to live.  He trusted in Him, and enjoyed His peace.\"  The last words of this great man of science were: \"Life has been very bright to me, and now there is the brightness beyond.  I shall see Jesus, who created all things, who made the worlds.  I shall see Him as He is.  Yes, I have had the Light for many years.  Oh, how bright it is!  I feel so safe, so satisfied.\"",
