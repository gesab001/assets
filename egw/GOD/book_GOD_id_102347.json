    "word": "The physician needs to have a very close connection with God. Never is he to lose his hold of God's helpful, strengthening power. The fact, that the physician acts so important a part in bringing relief from suffering, will naturally place him where he will be regarded with feelings of love and gratitude by those whom he has helped. Let him not take the praise and glory to himself. Let him hide self in the Saviour, pointing to Christ as the One who is to receive all the praise.",
