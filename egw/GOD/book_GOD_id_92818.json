    "word": "The thirteenth chapter of Revelation presents a power that is to be made prominent in these last days. Let all understand that it is Christ, the Captain of the Lord's host, who gave these visions to John. Christ came in person to the lonely isle of Patmos, and showed John the things that must be, [things] that were of the highest importance to His people. ([?] Through the person of His highest angels. He had veiled His own glory.) This message is to come to God's people, straight, sharp, and clean from all mixture of human wisdom and tradition.",
