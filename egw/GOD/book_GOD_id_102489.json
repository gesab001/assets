    "word": "\"I hate robbery for burnt offering.\" A plea that it is to do good will not justify a man for working on wrong principles. God will bring those who deprive their fellow-workers of their rightful advantage to a strict account. There are those who think they can do this work if they choose. Men often do themselves that which they condemn in others, without asking themselves, \"Am I advancing the Lord's work in right lines? Am I doing that which I would condemn if done by others? What would Christ do under such circumstances? Will the Lord be pleased if I bind about the work my brethren are doing in order to advance my own interests? Would this not be weaving into the web threads of selfishness which would spoil the pattern?\"",
