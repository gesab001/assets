    "word": "\"Go to God and tell Him as did Moses, 'I cannot lead this people unless Thy presence shall go with me.' And then ask still more; pray with Moses, 'Show me Thy glory.' What is this glory?--the character of God. That is what He proclaimed to Moses. Let the soul, in living faith, fasten upon God. Let the tongue speak His praise. When you associate together, let the mind be reverently turned to the contemplation of eternal realities. Thus you will be helping one another to be spiritually minded. When your will is in harmony with the divine will, you will be in harmony with one another; you will have Christ by your side as a counselor.\"-- Gospel Workers, old edition, pages 235-237.",
