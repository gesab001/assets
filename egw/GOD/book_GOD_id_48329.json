    "word": "To the \u201cLittle Flock\u201d\n     Dear Brethren.\u2014The Lord gave me a view, January 26, 1850, which I will relate. I saw that some of the people of God were stupid and dormant, and were but half awake, and did not realize the time \n30\nwe were now living in; and that the \u201cman\u201d with the \u201cdirt-brush\u201d [see Bro. Miller's dream,] had entered, and that some were in danger of being swept away. I begged of Jesus to save them, to spare them a little longer, and let them see their awful danger, that they might get ready before it should be forever too late. The angel said, \u201cDestruction is coming like a mighty whirlwind.\u201d I begged of the angel to pity, and to save those who loved this world, and were attached to their possessions, and were not willing to cut loose from them, and sacrifice to speed the messengers on their way to feed the hungry sheep, who were perishing for want of spiritual food.",
