    "word": "The necessities of the Madison School call for immediate help. Brethren, work while the day lasts; for the night cometh, when no man can work. We hope that no means will be drawn from you to help those who have gone out from us because they are not of us. There are many needy missionary fields that call for our help. The message of present truth must be carried to those who have never heard it. We pray that the Lord will give you wisdom to place your means where it will build up the cause of God in the earth.",
