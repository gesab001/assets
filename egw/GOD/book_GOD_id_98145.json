    "word": "We do not begin to reach the high standard that God has set before us. We may be \"partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\" It is our privilege to stand on vantage ground with God, to be full of hope, praise, cheerfulness, joy, thanksgiving. Let us educate ourselves to praise Him and to glorify His name. Let us by feeding upon His Word bring more spirituality into our hearts.",
