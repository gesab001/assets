    "word": "I saw that if the chosen messengers of the Lord waited for every obstacle to be moved out of their way, many never would go to search for the scattered sheep. Satan will present many objections in their way, to keep them from duty. But they will have to go out by faith, trusting in Him who has called them to his work, and the Lord will open their way before them, as far as it will be for their good and his glory. Jesus, the great teacher and pattern, had not where to lay his head. His life was one of \n52\ntoil, sorrow, and suffering; he then gave himself for us. Those who, in Christ's stead, beseech souls to be reconciled to God, and who hope to reign with Christ in glory, must expect to be partakers of his sufferings here. \u201cThey that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d Psalm 126:5, 6.",
