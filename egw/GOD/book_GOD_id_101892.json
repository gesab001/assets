    "word": "Our Redeemer has opened a fountain for the healing of the nations, and it is at infinite cost to ourselves that we forsake this fountain of living water for cisterns hewn out by human endeavor. These cisterns may contain a little of the water of life, but they are shallow. Our work calls for aggressive warfare. It is not money or position or expensive buildings that are essential in the work of God, neither is it achievements that win applause from men and administer to vanity. All these are human cisterns, which in a time of drought can hold no water.",
