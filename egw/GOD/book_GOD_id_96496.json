    "word": "I walk with trembling before God. I know not how to speak or trace with pen the large subject of the atoning sacrifice. I know not how to present subjects in the living power in which they stand before me. I tremble for fear lest I shall belittle the great plan of salvation by cheap words. I bow my soul in awe and reverence before God and say, \"Who is sufficient for these things?\"--Letter 40, 1892, p. 4. \n\n\n                                -25-",
