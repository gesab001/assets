    "word": "As Jesus hung upon the cross, some who passed by reviled Him, wagging their heads as if bowing to a king, and said to Him, \"Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save Thyself. If Thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.\" Satan used the same words to Christ in the wilderness-- \"If Thou be the Son of God.\" The chief priests, elders, and scribes mockingly said, \"He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.\" The angels who hovered over the scene of Christ's crucifixion were moved to indignation as the rulers derided Him and said, \"If He be the Son God, let Him deliver Himself\". They wished there to come to the rescue of Jesus and deliver Him, but they were not suffered to do so. The object of His mission was not yet accomplished.",
