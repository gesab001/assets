    "word": "Christ is our example, and everyone placed in a position of trust, needs the subduing influence of the Spirit of God upon the heart day by day. Christ wept with those that wept. In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and was touched with the feeling of their infirmities. He is a tender and faithful High Priest. He considers the cases of the tried and tempted ones as verily his own, and he ministers unto them. These weak ones of the flock are to be carefully nourished with the manna Christ has supplied. They are to be educated not to look to men and trust in men, whatever may be their calling.",
