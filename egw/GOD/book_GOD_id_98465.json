    "word": "There is a joy and a cross set before each one of you. You may think the cross is hard to bear, but remember that there is a joy before you. You need not feel, if a little cloud passes before your mind, that God has forsaken you. Take your Bible, turn right to the Psalms, and read of how we are to praise the Lord at all times. \"I will bless the Lord at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth\" [Psalms 34:1]. God is full of mercy. All He wants for you is that you will open the door of your heart and let Him come in and sanctify your heart and your mind.",
