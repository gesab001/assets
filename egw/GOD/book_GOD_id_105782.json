    "word": "The converting power of God must work a transformation of character in many who claim to believe the present truth, or they cannot fulfill the purpose of God. They are hearers but not doers of the word. Pure, unworldly benevolence will be developed in all who make Christ their personal Saviour. There needs to be far less of self and more of Jesus. The church of Christ is ordained of God that its members shall be representatives of Christ\u2019s character. He says, \u201cYou have given yourselves to Me, and I give you to the world. I am the light of the world; I present you to the world as My representatives.\u201d As Christ in the fullest sense represents the Father, so we are to represent Christ. Let none of those who name the name of Christ be cowards in His cause. For Christ\u2019s sake stand as if looking within the open portals of the city of God.",
