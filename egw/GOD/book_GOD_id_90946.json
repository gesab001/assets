    "word": "If we as believers enjoy the truth because we practice it, we shall give the impression that the truth is not a yoke of bondage, but that it has given us our emancipation papers, and we are free in Christ Jesus our Lord. The Lord Himself will make impressions on the people, and they will say, \"Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.\" A foretaste of Christ's mercy, His abundant love and compassion, will be felt by his people.",
