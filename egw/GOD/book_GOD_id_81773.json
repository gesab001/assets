    "word": "\"Let all who believe the truth begin to work. Do the work that lies nearest you. ...If the lay members of the church will arouse to do the work that they can do,... each seeing how much he can accomplish in winning souls to Jesus, we shall see many leaving the ranks of Satan to stand under the banner of Christ. If our people will act upon the light that is given in these few words of instruction, we shall surely see of the salvation of God. Wonderful revivals will follow. Sinners will be converted, and many souls will be added to the church. When we bring our hearts into unity with Christ, and our lives into harmony with His work, the Spirit that fell on the disciples on the day of Pentecost will fall on us.\"--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VIII, page 246.",
