    "word": "I saw you looking anxiously forward to a field of labor. You are absent from your country and cannot expect to labor in your favorite sphere. Your following the light which God has given you while in foreign countries, has cost you much suffering, much persecution and your views now differ so widely from theirs, your liberty and life would be in danger of falling a sacrifice to a superstitious people. Do all you can where you are, Hold yourself ready \n\n\n                                    -418- \n\nto follow the opening Providence of God, but you should not mark out a course for yourself.",
