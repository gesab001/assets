Cottrell.) \n\n     I have words to write to you, Elder Cottrell. As my eyes pain me I can scarcely tell your dangers as fully as I would be glad to do. Your idea that the positions you assert are infallible is very dangerous. Your fallibility is shown in claiming that position. The word of God is Yea and Amen.",
