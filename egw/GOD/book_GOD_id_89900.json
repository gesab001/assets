    "word": "How few realize that the Bible is the great instrument of God's government through probationary time. This Word is the direct unveiling of truth. It is spoken of as \"the mystery which hath been hid from ages\" [Colossians 1:26]. We need a far greater knowledge of the Word of God than we now have. A man may go through every grade for acquiring scholastic knowledge; he may devote all his capabilities to book learning; but unless he has the knowledge of God, unless he understands and practices the laws which govern his being, he will destroy himself by erroneous habits, by using tobacco, tea, coffee, and strong drink. Thus he thinks to brace himself up, but instead he loses his power of self-appreciation. He uses his brain too much. He loses his self-control. He cannot reason acutely upon the matters that concern him most. He is reckless and irrational in his treatment of his body.",
