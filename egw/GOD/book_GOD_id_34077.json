    "word": "Let every word we utter, every line we write, be fraught with encouragement and unwavering faith. . . . Think not that Jesus is the Saviour of your brother only. He is your personal Saviour. If you entertain this precious thought, you will . . . make melody to God in your soul. It is our privilege to triumph in God. It is our privilege to lead others to see that their only hope is in God, and to flee to Him for refuge.",
