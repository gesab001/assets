    "word": "Christ declared, \"I and My Father are one.\" All the workers in our sanitariums should seek to labor in a similar unity with their brethren. This should be true of the physicians who stand in responsible positions. They should exercise a God-given tact, to show that in dealing with the sick and the suffering, they are carrying on the very same work as are their brethren who are laboring in the ministry of the Word. Christ has given us an example. \n\n\n                                   -104- \n\nHe taught from the Scriptures the gospel truths, and He also healed the afflicted ones who came to Him for relief. He was the greatest Physician the world ever knew, and yet He combined with His healing work the imparting of soul-saving truth.",
