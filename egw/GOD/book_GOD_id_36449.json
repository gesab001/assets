    "word": "Let your conversation be of such a nature that you will have no need to repent of it. . . . If a word is dropped that is detrimental to the character of a friend or brother, never encourage this evilspeaking; for it is the work of the enemy. Remind the speaker that God's Word forbids this kind of conversation. . . . The Redeemer has told us how we may reveal Him to the world. If we cherish His spirit, if we manifest His love toward others, if we guard one another's interests, if we are kind, patient, forbearing, the fruits we bear will give evidence to the world that we are God's children. . . . To build up one another in the most holy faith is a blessed work; to tear down is a work full of bitterness and sorrow. . . .",
