    "word": "Chapter 20 \u2014Praying In The Name of Jesus\n\nJESUS\u2019 NAME IS THE CONNECTING LINK IN PRAYER BETWEEN HUMANITY AND GOD.\u2014In Christ\u2019s name our petitions ascend to the Father. He intercedes in our behalf, and the Father lays open all the treasures of His grace for our appropriation, for us to enjoy and impart to others. \u201cAsk in My name,\u201d Christ says. \u201cI do not say that I will pray the Father for you; for the Father Himself loveth you. Make use of My name. This will give your prayers efficiency, and the Father will give you the riches of His grace. Wherefore ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.\u201d",
