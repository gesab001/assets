    "word": "Let all connected with this sanitarium keep in mind the purpose for which this property has been secured. The institution is to act a special part in bringing souls to Christ, leading them to love God and keep His commandments. Unless the workers have a living connection with God, unless there is seen in the institution a spirit of kindness and compassion, establishment of the sanitarium will have been in vain. Spiritual as well as physical healing is to be brought to those who come for healing.",
