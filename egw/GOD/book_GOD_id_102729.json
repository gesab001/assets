I KNOW THAT MOTHER IS WEARY, AND YET I TRUST THAT THE LORD WILL BLESS US WITH INSTRUCTION THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO HER. HERE ARE BRETHREN FULTON AND HAYNES, FROM SAN FRANCISCO; BRETHREN CADY, MCCLURE, AND LASHIER, FROM HEALDSBURG; BROTHER LOPER FROM THE SANITARIUM; AND BRETHREN BOEKER, BOWEN, AND OTHERS FROM THE FOOD COMPANY.

IT IS CERTAINLY OUR PRIVILEGE TO ASK AND RECEIVE COUNSEL AND ENLIGHTENMENT FROM GOD.",
