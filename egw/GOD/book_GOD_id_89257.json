    "word": "MR No. 950 - Counsels to Students\n\n     Students to Make Christ Their All--You refer to some letter that I wrote some time ago in reference to the danger of sending young men to the medical college at Ann Arbor, and say that you are more and more impressed with the danger as students return from their year's work at the medical college, and you can see that some have been affected by the influences with which they have been surrounded. You also say that some of them are standing up nobly against these contaminating influences. Thank the Lord for this. If our youth understood their own weakness, they would go to God for strength, but if they give their minds up almost wholly to study, and do not make Christ their all in all, even while pursuing a course of education, they will lose all that enriches life. The first chapter of Second Peter is full of instruction, and strikes the keynote of victory. The truth is impressively forced upon the mind by the way it is presented in this chapter. Let us more abundantly recommend the study of these words, and the practicing of these precepts.--Letter 43, 1895, p. 8. (To J. H. Kellogg, June 14, 1895.)",
