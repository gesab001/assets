    "word": "Angels Are Amazed \n\n     Angels are amazed that men regard so lightly and indifferently the vital truths which mean so much to the sinner, and continue willing subjects under the captivity of Satan and sin, when so much has been endured in the divine person of the Son of God. O that we may cultivate habits of contemplation, of the self-denial and self-sacrifice of the life of Christ, until we shall have a deep sense of the aggravating character of sin; and hate it as the vile thing it is.",
