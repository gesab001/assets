    "word": "The apostle continues \"I keep under my body and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast away\" [1 Corinthians 9:27]. Everything in regard to his appetite, his words, his practices, and his passions, all his members were brought under the controlling influence of the Spirit of God and sanctified intellect. He shows to those who are around him the advantages of the knowledge that he has gained through the Scriptures and the living oracles of God. By living in connection with God, he shows the advantages he has gained by having right principles and by practicing them in his daily life. He will deny himself; he will not indulge himself.",
