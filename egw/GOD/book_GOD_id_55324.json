    "word": "His Manhood Is Gone.--Look at the drunkard. See what liquor has done for him. His eyes are bleared and bloodshot. \n                                                                           32\nHis countenance is bloated and besotted. His gait is staggering. The sign of Satan's working is written all over him. Nature herself protests that she knows him not; for he has perverted his God-given powers, and prostituted his manhood by indulgence in drink.--Review and Herald, May 8, 1894.",
