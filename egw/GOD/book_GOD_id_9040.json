    "word": "(1892) G.W. 236 (old edition)\n     303. It is in the order of God that those who bear responsibilities should often meet together to counsel with one another and to pray earnestly for that wisdom which He alone can impart.

Let brethren unite in fasting and prayer for the wisdom that God has promised to supply liberally.",
