    "word": "The Lord Jesus has given man an example in His own life. For the selfish heart of sin, He gives the new heart of love. He changes the heart, and produces an entire revolution in the soul. He brings light out of darkness, love out of enmity, and holiness out of impurity, that those who believe in Christ may represent Christ's life and character to the world. Says the Apostle, \u201cWe are labourers together with God; ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\u201d \u2014 Letter 28, 1892.",
