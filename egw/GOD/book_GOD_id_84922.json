    "word": "MR No. 290 - Billiards and the Billiard Hall\n\n     Teach your families that the angels of God are coming in and going out of your house and guarding and watching over the children of men. He wants you to tell them how they appeared to Peter, how they appeared to John, how they appeared to those who suffered in prison for the truth's sake; how the Lord wrought in behalf of John; how He wrought in behalf of Paul, and of Peter; how the angels of God from heaven came right into the prison house and took their prey out of the hands of the enemy. God is constantly working in behalf of His people, and what credit do you give Him for it?",
