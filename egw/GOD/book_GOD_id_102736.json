    "word": "There is one thing that our brethren have done, which has wrought great injury to the work. God has given us knowledge in the manufacture of foods, as a means of helping to sustain the cause; yet there are some who have been so indiscreet as to disclose to worldly men secrets in regard to the preparation of health foods. Thus they have abused their God-given trust. They ought to have kept their own counsel, and allowed the Lord to lead.",
