    "word": "If you have not yet escaped form the snare that Satan laid for your soul, I have nothing on which to build hope in regard to your case. You have been led and controlled by satanic agencies, and you do not break with the enemy. He holds his power over you firmly. At one time you make statements that are not true, and then at another time you say something that means exactly the opposite. \"How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him.\" It is time that you made the move which you have not yet made. Separate yourself from the evil influences that have controlled you. You have brought yourself into hard places. You have come to the point of breaking, but have drawn back. Will you not now make a decided break with the enemy? This is your only hope.",
