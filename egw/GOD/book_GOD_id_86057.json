    "word": "What can we say to make the wicked, the transgressors of the law of God, understand that they are at enmity to the forbearance of God? How shall we make them hear that they are surely presuming on His mercy, and that to exhaust it. The Psalmist marks the time in which he lived as that of great depravity, but what has it reached now? Centuries have been ripening up the harvest of the world for the sickle. \"They have made void Thy law.\" They refuse to respect God's law, while they make human laws supreme. A more than common contempt is placed upon the holy law of Jehovah.",
