    "word": "And then the picture--praise God!--the shepherd returns with the sheep, carrying it in his arms, and rejoicing at every step. \"Rejoice with me,\" he says, \"for I have found my sheep which was lost.\" Luke 15:6. I am so thankful that we have the picture of the sheep found. There is no picture presented before our imagination of a sorrowful shepherd returning without the sheep. This is the lesson that the undershepherds are to learn--success in bringing the sheep and lambs back to the fold.",
