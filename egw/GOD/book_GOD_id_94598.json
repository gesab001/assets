    "word": "God is not pleased to have His representatives worry, and wear themselves out, so that they cannot diffuse the sweet fragrance of heaven in their lives. We have but one life to \n\n\n                                     -139- \n\nlive in this world. Jesus came to teach us how to live that life, that we may represent the character of heaven. We must never grow faint-hearted; for it would be far worse for ourselves and others within the sphere of our influence than if we bore our trials with courage and fortitude. God requires us to behave with dignity under trials and temptations. The Man of Sorrows, who was acquainted with grief, is before us, as our example. \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\" Let us ever preserve the love of Jesus, presenting the truth as it is in Him.--Letter 39, 1887. \n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. April 13, 1989. Entire Letter.",
