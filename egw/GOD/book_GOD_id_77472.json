    "word": "These precautions may be regarded as unnecessary. But those who will plead for greater liberty are not worthy to be connected with these institutions. Mild license is termed liberty and freedom. But those who are professedly sons and daughters of God should elevate the standard, and have no fellowship with the unruly who would have rules and regulations made to meet the cases of the disobedient. The Sanitarium, unless hedged about with vigilant rules and regulations, would soon become a hot-bed of iniquity. There are those who would entrap and mislead souls; they have a spirit to revile, instead of showing respect for those who carry the burden and seek to keep up the standard. The less of such persons employed, the safer and purer will be the moral atmosphere of the Sanitarium. There always will be persons who will find entrance to such an institution, whose influence will be for evil. They are of that class who are continually  putting bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. There are professed Christians who will warp the conscience and becloud the mind, under the pretense of godliness; and those who do not see nor sense the danger are already the dupes or victims of Satan.",
