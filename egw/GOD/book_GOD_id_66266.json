    "word": "A way has been opened through Jesus Christ by which wisdom and grace and power may be obtained. He is an example in all things. The very first lesson for those who embrace the message of truth to learn, is to be in union with Christ and to have the power of His grace in the soul, melting away all dross of character, bringing into subjection even the thoughts. This must be done through the subduing of the heart, that Christ may impress and write His law upon it. This is the work to be accomplished for every soul, that all who love the truth will reveal its sanctifying, refining, ennobling power upon the character, in the spirit, in the words, and in the actions. Each will be a channel of light through which Christ will communicate. This is what the apostle meant when he said, \u201cWe are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\u201d",
