    "word": "This is all wrong. Satan is at the bottom of it; and unless you are alarmed, and stop just where you are, he will lead you to ruin. You cannot observe too great caution, and encourage too much reserve in this matter. If you have tender, loving words and kindly attentions to bestow, let it be given him you have promised before God and angels to love, honor, and respect, while you both shall live. Oh! how many lives are made bitter by the walls' being broken down which inclose every family, calculated to preserve its purity and sanctity. A third person is frequently taken into the confidence of the wife, and her private family matters are laid open before the special friend. This is the device of Satan to estrange the hearts of the husband and wife. Oh! that this would cease. What a world of trouble would be saved! Lock the faults of one another within your own hearts. Tell your troubles alone to God. He can give you right counsel and sure consolation, which will be pure, having no bitterness in it. \n                                                                           35",
