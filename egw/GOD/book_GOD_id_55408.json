    "word": "Our institutions are established that the sick may be treated by hygienic methods, discarding almost entirely the use of drugs. . . . There is a terrible account to be rendered to God by men who have so little regard for human life as to treat the body so ruthlessly in dealing out their drugs. . . . We are not excusable if through ignorance we destroy God's building by taking into our stomachs poisonous drugs under a variety of names we do not understand. It is our duty to refuse all such prescriptions. We wish to build a sanitarium where maladies may be cured by nature's own provisions, and where the people may be taught how to treat themselves when sick; where they will learn to eat temperately of wholesome food, and be educated to refuse all narcotics,--tea, coffee, \n                                                                           89\nfermented wines, and stimulants of all kinds,--and to discard the flesh of dead animals.--Manuscript 44, 1896.",
