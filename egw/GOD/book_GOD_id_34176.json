    "word": "The work specified in these words is the work God requires His people to do. It is a work of God's own appointment. With the work of advocating the commandments of God and repairing the breach that has been made in the law of God, we are to mingle compassion for suffering humanity. We are to show supreme love to God; we are to exalt His memorial, which has been trodden down by unholy feet; and with this, we are to manifest mercy, benevolence, and the tenderest pity for the fallen race. \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" As a people we must take hold of this work. Love revealed for suffering humanity gives significance and power to the truth.",
