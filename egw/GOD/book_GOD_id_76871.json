But if the conferences were doing the work that God desires them to do, there would be many more laborers, and the demand for funds would be greatly increased. And these conferences should feel a burden for the regions beyond their own borders. There are missions to be sustained in fields where there are no churches and no tithes, and also where the believers are few and the tithe limited. If you have means that is not needed after settling with your ministers in a liberal manner, send the Lord's money to these destitute places. Special light on this point has been given. I was listening to the voice of the heavenly Messenger, and the directions given were that the churches that had buildings and facilities should in this way assist the missions in foreign countries.",
