    "word": "I ask the impenitent, What greater evidence do you want that God is a God of justice?

Can those for whom this great sacrifice was made escape the wrath of God if they are indifferent to this great salvation? Those who choose to continue in sin will be without a shadow of excuse. Calvary is the only argument that will be used against them. \n\n\n                                   -337-",
