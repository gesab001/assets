    "word": "It is the duty of every Christian to be sanctified. The church must take up her individual responsibility; it cannot be vested in any minister. They may help you, but they can never do your work. The church of God is the great depository of truth. They must have skill, efficiency, and ability as home missionaries.--Letter 38, 1890, pp. 6, 7. (To Brethren Church and Bell, and all the church in Fresno, Feb. 21, 1890.) \n\nReleased January 26, 1971.",
