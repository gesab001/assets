If it be your lot to educate students that they may impart to others the heavenly intelligence, I shall be pleased. I have always loved and respected you, and I have not been disappointed in you. The form of sound words is to be prized above every earthly thing. God is glorified by every word that leads to right action. I respect you highly, and desire you to have every advantage possible that you may make continual progression in the service of God. \n\n\n                           In love, \n\nD.R.
