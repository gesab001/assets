    "word": "But let all remember the words, \"First cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye.\" Let us not be so ready to accuse. God will make His people perfect if they will be molded and fashioned after the divine similitude. If they err, and then repent, He forgives them. His reproofs and corrections are sent to make His people perfect. Then let us accept reproof, and acknowledge our errors, and seek to avoid them.",
