    "word": "Some who occupy responsible positions in this institution are in danger of being affected and misled by outside influences. They should watch every point carefully, that the attitude of their relatives may not warp their judgment, or control them in any manner. The only safety for these men is to look to God, and be guided by him, allowing no unsanctified influence to sway them a hair's breadth from the path of right.",
