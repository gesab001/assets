    "word": "In the warfare, the enemy takes advantage of the weakest points in the defence of those he is attacking. Here he makes his fiercest assaults. The Christian should have no weak points in his defence. He should be barricaded by the support that the Scriptures give to the one who is doing God's will. The tempted soul will bear away the victory, if he follows the example of Him who met the tempter with the word, \"It is written.\" He can stand securely in the protection of a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" . . .",
