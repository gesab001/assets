    "word": "Sabbath, March 25, 1876, Oakland, California, Ellen White to James White \n\n\n     Dear Husband: . . . Mary Clough [MARY CLOUGH (RHYMES WITH \"HOW\") WAS THE DAUGHTER OF ELLEN WHITE'S SISTER CAROLINE.] and I will do all we can to forward the work of my writings. I cannot see any light shining to Michigan for me. This year I feel that my work is writing. I must be secluded, stay right here, and I must not let inclination or persuasion of others shake my resolution to keep closely to my work until it is done. God will help me if I trust in Him.--Letter 63, 1876.",
