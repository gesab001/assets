    "word": "\"Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord's side?\" The trumpeters caught up the words, and sounded them through the trumpet, Who is on the Lord's side? \"let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.\" All who were repentant had the privilege of taking their stand beside Moses. \"And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\" There was no partiality, no hypocrisy, no confederating to shield the guilty. \n\n\n                     -48- \n\nFor the terror of the Lord was upon the people.",
