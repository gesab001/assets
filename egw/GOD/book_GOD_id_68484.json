    "word": "Your character building is by no means finished. Every day a good or a bad brick is placed in the structure. You are either building crookedly, or with exactness and correctness that will make a beautiful temple for God. Therefore, look not for great opportunities, and neglect the present little opportunities of doing little acts of kindness. In words, in tones, in gestures, in looks, you can represent the spirit of Jesus. He who neglects these little things, and yet flatters himself that he is ready to do wonderful things for the Master, will be in danger of failing altogether.",
