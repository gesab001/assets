    "word": "Women to Treat Women; Men to Treat Men\n     Women to Be Thoroughly Trained as Physicians.--Women physicians  should utterly refuse to look upon the secret parts of men.  Women should be throughly educated to work for women, and men to work for men.  Let men know that they must go to their own sex and not apply to lady physicians.  It is an insult to women, and God looks upon these things of commonness with abhorrence.--SpT-B15 14 (1911).",
