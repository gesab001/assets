    "word": "God is very merciful. He has hedged up the way for Dr. Russell, time and again, for his good.

When he sees professed Christians walk inconsistent with their profession of faith, unbelief strengthens, and faith becomes very dim. But God is unchangeable; and all his promises are upon conditions of obedience. When his children fulfill the conditions, there is no delay on the part of God. Faith has not lost its power, nor humble obedience its reward. God has honored his children whenever they have forsaken their sins, and believed in him, and walked in the truth. Christ could not do many mighty works in Nazareth, because of their unbelief. God will not compel Dr. Russell to believe. He will give a reasonable amount of light, and if he neglects to follow the light, if he finds more pleasure in infidel doubts, and in talking these doubts, he throws wide open the door of his heart, and bids Satan welcome. He is in this, an enemy to Christ.",
