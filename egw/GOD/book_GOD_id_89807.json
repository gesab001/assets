    "word": "Daniel was esteemed by the king because of his unswerving integrity, for he was faithful in honoring God at all times and in all places. His \n\n\n                                   -64- \n\nwisdom was unexcelled, and neither he nor his fellows would make any compromise to secure positions in the court, or even to preserve life itself, when the honor of God was involved.
