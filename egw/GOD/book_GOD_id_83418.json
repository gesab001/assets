    "word": "We should also keep in mind that we have a wily foe to contend with, one that is constantly seeking to draw us away from God, but we should be determined that we will be the Lord's.

We cannot expect instantaneous sanctification, but we must grow like the grain, as represented by Christ--first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain--and thus perfect a Christian character. We must become intelligent and earnest to know what our duty is and then walk in obedience to God's holy will.",
