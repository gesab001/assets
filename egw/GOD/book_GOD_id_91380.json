    "word": "What effect did this report upon the congregation? \"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would God we had died in this wilderness. And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? Were it not better for us to return into Egypt? And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt\" [Numbers 14:1-4]. Let all read carefully the fourteenth chapter of Numbers, and let them understand that men can make false reports as did these who had been sent on an errand which concerned the movements of more than a million people.",
