    "word": "That Sister_____, I believe, will come to the front if wise management is exercised in her case. Such ones must not be left indifferently, but efforts should be made to bring them into the noble truth. We want that woman as a worker. . . . It is a nice work to hunt up the sheep and to make every exertion to bring them in. It will take time to rid them of all their strange ideas and erratic views, but we must be patient and not drive them from us. God is working with them, and as I look over the past I see discouragements just as great that we have had to master and still have to contend with as in old England.--Letter 50, 1887.",
