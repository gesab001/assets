    "word": "\"Whenever I look at the buildings, the fields, and the orchards here at Loma Linda, I am thankful that we have this beautiful place, thankful for every foot of ground we control. By and by you will see, if you do not understand it now, that the securing of the land was essential. It may not appear to you now that it was necessary for us to secure so large a tract, but I am instructed that our work here must be carried forward on broad lines and in solid unity. That the will of the Lord may be done in this place, we must be in a position \n                                                                           22\nwhere we can understand His pleasure in regard to our words and actions, where we may be always helping forward that work which is most essential. During the night it was again impressed upon my mind that it was through the providence of God that we obtained this place when we did. Also that the branching out and enlargement that we have done, and the development of the work as it stands today, is what the Lord would have us do.",
