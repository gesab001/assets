    "word": "Children, God has seen fit to entrust you to the care of your parents, for them to instruct, discipline, and act their part in forming your character for heaven. And yet it rests with you to say whether you will develop a good Christian character by making the best of the advantages you have had from godly, faithful, praying parents. Notwithstanding all the anxiety and faithfulness of parents in behalf of their children, they alone cannot save them. There is a work for the children to do. Every child will have an individual case of his or her own to attend to. Believing parents have a responsible work before them, to guide the footsteps of their children, even in their religious experience. When your children truly love God, they will bless and reverence their parents for the care which they have manifested for them, and their faithfulness in restraining their desires and subduing their wills.",
