    "word": "We are looking beyond time; we are looking to eternity. We are trying to live in such a way that Christ can say, Well done, good and faithful servant. Let us live, every one of us, in that way. We may make mistakes; we may err; but God will not leave us in error. \"If we sin we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" There is hope for us; we are prisoners of hope. Let us grasp the rich promises of God. The garden of God is full of rich promises. Oh, let us gather them; let us take them home; let us show \n\n\n                                    -344- \n\nthat we believe in God. Let us take Him at His word; let not one of us be found distrusting God or doubting Him.",
