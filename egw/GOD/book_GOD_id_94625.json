    "word": "We are to look through nature to nature's God. Let us open our hearts to understand the lessons of these teachers. To those who are in touch with God, the works of His hands speak of the kingdom that is eternal in the heavens. Let us enter by faith the holy of holies, and hold communion with our heavenly Father and with our Redeemer, the Saviour of sinners, who will wash us and make us white in His blood.",
