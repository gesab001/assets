    "word": "Human philosophy declares that an indefinite period of time was taken in the creation of the world. Does God state the matter thus? No; He says, \u201cIt is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever; for in six days [not six indefinite periods of time, for then there would be no possible way for us to observe the day specified in the fourth commandment] the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.\u201d Please read carefully the fifth chapter of Deuteronomy. God says again, \u201cRemember [do not forget] the sabbath day, to keep it holy. . . . For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\u201d",
