I was in vision taken to heaven, and the angel said to me, \u201cLook!\u201d I looked to the world as it was in dense darkness. The agony that came over me was indescribable as I saw this darkness. Again the word came, \u201cLook ye.\u201d And again I looked intensely over the world, and I began to see jets of light like stars dotted all through this darkness; and then I saw another and another added light, and so all through this moral darkness the star-like lights were increasing. And the angel said, \u201cThese are they that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and are obeying the words of Christ. These are the light of the world; and if it were not for  these lights, the judgments of God would immediately fall upon the transgressors of God's law.\u201d I saw then these little jets of light growing brighter, \n379\nshining forth from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and lighting the whole world. Occasionally one of these lights would begin to grow dim, and others would go out, and every time this occurred there was sadness and weeping in heaven. And some of the lights would grow brighter and brighter, and their brightness was far-reaching, and many more lights were added to it. Then there was rejoicing in heaven. I saw that the rays of light came directly from Jesus, to form these precious jets of light in the world.",
