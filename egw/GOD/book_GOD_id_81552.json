    "word": "These young men should choose for their associates those who love the purity of truth, whose morals are untainted, and whose habits are pure. They must comply with the conditions laid down in the word of God if they would indeed become sons of God, members of the royal family, children of the Heavenly King. Come out from among them, and be separate, and touch not the unclean, and I will receive you. God loves these young men, and if they will follow the leadings of his Spirit and walk in his counsel, he will be their strength.",
