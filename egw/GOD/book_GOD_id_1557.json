    "word": "The inhabitants of Heaven are perfect, because the will of God is their joy, and supreme \n27\ndelight. Many here destroy their own comfort, injure their health, and violate a good conscience, because they will not cease to do wrong. The injunctions to mortify the deeds of the body, with its affections and lusts, has no effect upon them. They profess Christ, but are not his followers, and never can be, until they cease their wrong-doing, and work the work of righteousness.",
