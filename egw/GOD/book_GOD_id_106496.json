    "word": "Should our dear Brethren Palmer and Daniells follow their own judgment and carry out the ideas they now hold in regard to the cause in the Southern field, they would do a work that bears not the approbation of God. Seeming success would be short-lived. Brethren, the Lord does not bid you to encourage your brethren to cultivate a spirit of accusation and condemnation by listening to their distorted reports. Listen not to those who are annoyed because they can not manage everything in accordance with their own will and way.",
