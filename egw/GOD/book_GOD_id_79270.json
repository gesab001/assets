    "word": "This history was recorded for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Here is seen a determination to disregard the will of God. In their unbelief the people refused to go up to take the land. When they found that because of unbelief they must wander in the wilderness for another forty years, they said, We will go up now. But Moses told them that they had no permission to go up. If they had gone when the Lord said Go, the armies of the Lord's host would have gone with them; but because of their rebellion and delay, the Lord refused to give them victory. But the people said, We will go up; we will not wander in this wilderness any longer. And Moses said, \"Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten among your enemies. For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye are turned away from the Lord, therefore the Lord will now be with you. But they presumed to go up unto the hill top; nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. Then the Amalekites came down and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.\"",
