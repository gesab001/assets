    "word": "What can I say to arouse our people? I tell you not a few ministers who stand before the people to explain the Scriptures are defiled. Their hearts are corrupt, their hands unclean. Yet many are crying, Peace, peace; and the workers of iniquity are not alarmed. The Lord's hand is not shortened that he cannot save, nor his ear heavy that he cannot hear; but it is our sins that have separated us from God. The church is corrupt because of her members who defile their bodies, and pollute their souls.",
