    "word": "From all countries the Macedonian cry is sounding: \"Come over, . . . and help us.\" God has opened fields before us, and if human agencies would but co-operate with divine agencies, many, many souls would be won to the truth.

But to the call, \"Whom shall I send?\" there have been few to respond, \"Here am I; send me.\" Isaiah 6:8.",
