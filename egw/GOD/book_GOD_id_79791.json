    "word": "Three thousand years ago, David asked the question, \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy word.\" Souls already impure need to be cleansed, purified, and sanctified. Then the testimony can be borne, \"God who commanded \n\n\n                      -21- \n\nthe light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\" In this world we are to shine in good works. The Lord requires his people who handle sacred things to be alone with God, to reflect the principles of heaven in every business transaction, to reflect the light of God's character, God's love, as Christ reflected it. Looking unto Jesus, all our lives will be aglow with that wondrous light. Every part of us is to be light; then whichever way we turn, light will be reflected from us to others. Christ is the way, the truth, the life. In him is no darkness at all; therefore, if we are in Christ, there will be no darkness in us.",
