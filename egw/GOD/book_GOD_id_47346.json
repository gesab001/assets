    "word": "20, 21 (Matthew 25:14, 15; Mark 13:34). Unity in Diversity.--[John 17:20, 21 quoted.] What kind of unity is spoken of in these words?--Unity in diversity. Our minds do not all run in the same channel, and we have not all been given the same work. God has given to every man his work according to his several ability. There are different kinds of work to be done, and workers of varied capabilities are needed. If our hearts are humble, if we have learned in the school of Christ to be meek and lowly, we may all press together in the narrow path marked out for us (MS 52, 1904).",
