    "word": "Why do some of our ministering brethren manifest so little interest in health reform?--It is because instruction on temperance in all things is opposed to their practice of self-indulgence. In some places this has been the great stumbling-block in the way of our bringing the people to investigate and practice and teach health reform. No man should be set apart as a teacher of the people while his own teaching or example contradicts the testimony God has given His servants to bear in regard to diet, for this will bring confusion. His disregard of health reform unfits him to stand as the Lord's messenger.",
