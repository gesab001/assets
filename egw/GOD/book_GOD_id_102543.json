    "word": "The Lord has not laid upon you the Burdens you have been carrying. The result of your carrying these burdens is felt all through the vineyard of the Lord. God has not called His people to ignore present truth for these last days, and take up a work that so absorbs workers and means that the Lord is not represented as He would otherwise be. Never would a rival sanitarium have been, through Satan's devising, planted close to the Lord's institution, if you had kept at your work for the class of people whom the Lord desires to become through the Sanitarium acquainted with present truth, with the message God has given to those who follow Him, to be communicated to the world. The sanitarium in Battle Creek was to bring the chosen people of God before men of high standing, to represent the ways, works, and power of God. It was to be His witness in behalf of truth, elevated, sanctifying truth. The Lord made you, my brother, His honored instrument. He has never required from you one task that would crowd out your work in connection with the institution that was to stand for the truth, to do a certain work for God, flashing light upon the pathway of thousands.",
