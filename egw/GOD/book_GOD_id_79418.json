    "word": "There are many transactions in the business world that the worldling regards as just and honest, but which God condemns. Men lay plans which they regard as right plans, but which do not accord with the true, unselfish principles that Christ has laid down in His Word. And this conformity to the world's standard is coming more and more to be accepted by professing Christians. But the approval of the world will never make an unjust action just, and wrong will stand as wrong before the heavenly universe until it is repented of and put away.",
