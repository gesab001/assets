    "word": "Let us show Christ formed within, the hope of glory, by the fruit that we bear, and thus we can evidence to the world a living Saviour. . . . He arose. He broke the fetters of the tomb. In triumph He rejoices over the rent sepulchre of Joseph. \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" Glory to God. I praise Him, the resurrection and the life. You have . . . a living Saviour.",
