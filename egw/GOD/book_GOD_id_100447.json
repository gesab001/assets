The sayings and dogmas of finite men were constantly put in front, as essential to their salvation. Ceremonies and display were put in the place of inward piety. The Lord had instituted rites and ceremonies as the means of making eternal realities understood and impressive. But this did not satisfy the minds of those who had witnessed the idolatrous, superstitious, revolting festivities of the Egyptians in their religious worship. They were constantly approaching idolatry by placing the commandments of men where God and His requirements alone should be. The chastisement of the Lord was upon the people because they were idolizing things, sentiments, and ideas of their own creating.",
