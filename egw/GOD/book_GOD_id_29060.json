    "word": "In the day of Judgment many will be found wanting; they have been tested and proved by God and have been found unworthy of eternal life. God could not trust them in heaven. The decision will be made for eternity; he who is not faithful in that which is least can not be trusted with greater responsibilities. All will be judged by their works; for these have determined their character. Is it a paying business to be dishonest? \u2014Never; for even should there be no detection in probationary time, everything will be laid open in the day of final reckoning.",
