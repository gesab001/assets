    "word": "I will say to Brethren Sutherland and Magan if they are here, There is a field that is open before you. God has looked with pleasure upon the manner in which you have borne the irritation that has been kept up, and that you have had so much difficulty with. Now the work has come to a point where you can go and enter upon a work elsewhere. We have been looking and looking to see who could go into the Southern field, and now God will open the way so that you can go in there and have the sympathy and tenderness of the brethren and sisters.",
