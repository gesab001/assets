    "word": "Churches Organized by the Prophets\nThe organization of the church at Jerusalem was to serve as a model for the organization of churches in every other place where messengers of truth should win converts to the gospel. Those to whom was given the responsibility of the general oversight of the church were not to lord it over God's heritage, but, as wise shepherds, were to \"feed the flock of God, . . . being ensamples to the flock\" 1 Peter 5:2, 3; and the deacons were to be \"men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.\" These men were to take their position unitedly on the side of right and to maintain it with firmness and decision. Thus they would have a uniting influence upon the entire flock.  AA 91440",
