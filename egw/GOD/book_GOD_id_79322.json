    "word": "The love expressed on Calvary should be revived, strengthened, and diffused among our churches. Shall we not do all we can to give power to the principles which Christ brought to this world? Shall we not strive to establish and give efficiency to the benevolent enterprises which are now called for without delay? Christ's believing people are to perpetuate His love. This love is to draw them together round the cross. It is to divest them of all selfishness, and bind them to God and to one another.",
