    "word": "Teachers of truth need always to remember that the church militant is not the church triumphant. The servants of God must not strive for the mastery, [nor] seek to be recognized as great men, but as good men. Envy \n\n\n                                   -298- \n\nand jealousy have corrupted many souls to their ruin. God's servants must learn to lean upon no human support. They are not to be dependent on human praise or deference, or [to be] depressed by human censure. Neither are they to look for human recompence. Their record is not kept by human figures, but kept by One on high.",
