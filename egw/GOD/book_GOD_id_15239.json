They are to give the people the warning, calling upon them to repair the breach that has been made by the Papacy in the law of God. The Sabbath has been made a nonentity, an unessential requirement, which human authority can set aside. The holy day of the Lord has been changed to a common working day. Men have torn down God's memorial, placing a false rest day in its stead.--Manuscript 35, 1900.",
