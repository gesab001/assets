    "word": "Love Not Passion.--Love is a plant of heavenly origin. It is not unreasonable; it is not blind. It is pure and holy. \n\n\n                                                  213 \n\nBut the passion of the natural heart is another thing altogether. While pure love will take God into all its plans and will be in perfect harmony with the Spirit of God, passion will be headstrong, rash, unreasonable, defiant of all restraint, and will make the object of its choice an idol.",
