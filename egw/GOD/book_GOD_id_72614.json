    "word": "The Lord Jesus Christ has prepared a covering--the robe of His own righteousness--that He will put on every repenting, believing soul who by faith will receive it. Said John, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). Sin is the transgression of the law. Christ died to make it possible for every man to have his sins taken away.",
