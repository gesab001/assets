    "word": "Converting Power in Ellen G. White Books.--Several precious experiences were related by the canvassers in regard to the way in which they had searched their hearts while canvassing for Great Controversy and Patriarchs and Prophets. They said that as they read these books their minds were enlightened, and they felt that angels of God were very near.... The canvassers stated that they had found that where these books had been sold, everyone spoke highly of them, and that from reading them, some had embraced the truth who had never heard a discourse in their lives given by a Seventh-day Adventist minister.-- MS 23, 1890.",
