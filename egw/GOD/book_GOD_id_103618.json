    "word": "Especially should those who are studying medicine in the schools of the world, guard against contamination from the evil influences with which they are constantly surrounded.

Nevertheless, some have gone through the medical course, and have remained true to principle. They would not continue their studies on the Sabbath; and they have proved that men may become qualified for the duties of a physician, and not disappoint the expectations of those who have encouraged them to obtain an education.",
