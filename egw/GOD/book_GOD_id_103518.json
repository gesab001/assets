    "word": "There have been teachers in our schools who could pass well in a worldly institution of learning, but were unfitted for the training of our youth because they were ignorant of the truths of the gospel of Christ. They were unable to bring the simplicity of Christ into their labors. It should be the work of every teacher to present those truths that have called us out to stand as a peculiar people before the world, and which are able to keep us in harmony with heaven's laws. In the messages that have been sent to us from time to time, we have truths that will accomplish a wonderful work of reform in our characters, if we will give them a place. They will prepare us for entrance into the holy city of God. It is our privilege to make continual advancement to a higher grade of Christian living.",
