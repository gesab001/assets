    "word": "I understand that you have desired to have my judgment in regard to matters that trouble you in reference to marriage with Brother _____'s daughter. I understand that the father of the one upon whom you have placed your affection is not willing that his daughter should connect with you in marriage. While I would feel due sympathy for you because of your disappointment, I would say that who should feel interested in his own child more than her own father, and also her mother? The very fact of your urgency of this matter against the wishes of the parents is evidence that the Spirit of God has not the first place in your heart and a controlling power upon your life. You have a strong will, a firm, persistent determination to carry out anything you have entered upon.",
