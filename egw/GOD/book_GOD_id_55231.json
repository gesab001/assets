God's eye was upon his jewels, and he would direct his called and chosen messengers to them; men that would move understandingly, and the light of truth would shine and discover to these souls their true position, and they would receive the truth understandingly, and be satisfied with its beauty and clearness. And as they feel the effects and power of the truth, will be strong and shed a holy influence.",
