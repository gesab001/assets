    "word": "In so important a place as B.C., there should be picked men to keep the fort, who have stood in responsible positions, and have walked with God and learned their duty of him. There are many who are without root. They will be swayed by unsanctified influences and be led from devotion and from God. It is natural to follow the inclinations of the carnal heart. B. C. is filled up with just such persons as these. All such will have abundant opportunity to manifest that they are not the children of God. There \n                                                                           84\nare but few who have the genuine work of grace wrought in the heart, and who have obtained an experience for themselves. How few can God employ and use in his service!",
