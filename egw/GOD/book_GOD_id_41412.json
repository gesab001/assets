    "word": "My Instructor slowly and solemnly spoke the following words: \"Form a confederacy; to whom they shall say, 'Form a confederacy, and they shall be broken in pieces.\" Three times were these words spoken. \"Associate yourselves, O ye \n\n\n                                                    151 \n\npeople, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.\"",
