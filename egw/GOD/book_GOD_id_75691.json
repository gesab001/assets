    "word": "Moses continued: \"Ye shall not add unto the word which \n                                                                           11\nI command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.\" There was a tendency to add to the law by making human restrictions; and the Lord guarded against the adding of man-made tests, which would bring in confusion. And He guarded, too, against the taking away of any of His precepts. Never are we to put our words in the place of God's words; for thus we would be taking away from His law.",
