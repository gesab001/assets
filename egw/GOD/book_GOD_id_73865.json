    "word": "The history of Daniel and his youthful companions has been recorded on the pages of the Inspired Word, for the benefit of the youth of all succeeding ages. Through the record of their fidelity to the principles of temperance, God is speaking today to young men and young women, bidding them gather up the precious rays of light He has given on the subject of Christian temperance, and place themselves in right relation to the laws of health.--Youth's Instructor, July 9, 1903.",
