    "word": "Satan uses human agents to bring the soul under the power of temptation, but the angels of God are searching for human agents through whom they may cooperate to save the tempted ones. Angels are looking for those who will work in Christ's lines, who will be moved by the realization that they belong to Christ. They are looking for those who will feel that those who fall under temptation, whether high or low, are the ones who need their special labors, and that Christ looks on those who are passed by, neglected, wounded and bruised by the enemy, and ready to die, and is grieved at the hardness of men, who refuse to exercise the faith that works by love, which will purify the soul. Angels of God will work with, and through, and by those who will cooperate with the heavenly agencies for the saving of a soul from death, and the hiding of a multitude of sins. That will lead them to consider themselves, lest they also be tempted. It is the sick that need a physician, not those who are whole. When you expend labor on those who do not need it, and take no notice of the very ones that your words and actions could bless, you are forming a character that is not after the likeness of Christ. Christ says, \"I come not to call the righteous but sinner to repentance.\" Let none dream that these obligations do \n                                                                           393\nnot belong to this time; for they do rest upon all. \"Moreover it is required of stewards that a man be found faithful.\" Those who are making it manifest that they are not faithful in doing the very work that God has enjoined upon them, are working in an exactly opposite direction to Christ. \"First cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the moat of thy brother's eye.\" Be careful yourselves not to become tempters in evil things.",
