    "word": "MR No. 163 - Fanaticism and Side Issues\n\n     The Lord is soon to work among us in greater power, but there is danger of allowing our impulses to carry us where He does not want us to go. We must not take one step that we shall have to retrace. We must move solemnly, prudently, and not make use of extravagant expressions, or allow our feelings to become overwrought. We must think calmly, and work without excitement; for there will be those who become easily wrought up, who will catch up unguarded expressions, and make use of extreme utterances to create excitement, and thus counteract the very work that God desires us to do.",
