    "word": "I was shown the Waldenses, and what they suffered for their religion. They conscientiously studied the word of God, and lived up to the light which shone upon them. They were persecuted and driven from their homes. Their possessions, obtained by hard labor, were taken from them, and their houses were burned. They fled to the mountains and suffered incredible hardships. They endured hunger, fatigue, cold, and nakedness. The only clothing many of them could obtain, was the skins of animals. And yet the scattered and homeless ones would get together to unite their voices in singing and praising God, that they were accounted worthy to suffer for Christ's name. They encouraged and cheered each other, and were grateful for even their miserable retreat. Many of their children sickened and died through exposure to cold, and the sufferings of hunger; yet the parents did not for a moment think of yielding their religion. They prized the love and favor of God far higher than earthly ease, or worldly riches. They received consolation from God, and with pleasing anticipations looked forward to the recompense of reward.",
