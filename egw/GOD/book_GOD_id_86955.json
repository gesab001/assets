    "word": "\"Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.\" (1 Peter 3:15.) The fear here spoken of does not mean distrust or indecision, but with due caution, guarding every point, lest an unwise word be spoken, or excitement of feeling get the advantage, and thus leave unfavorable impressions upon minds, and balance them in the wrong direction. Godly fear, humility, and meekness are greatly needed by all, in order to represent correctly the truth for this time.",
