    "word": "Many are God's promises to those who minister to His afflicted ones.  He says: \"Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and Thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: Thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.\" \"Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.\" [Psalm 41:1-3; 37:3.] \"Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.\" \"There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\" \"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will He pay him again.\" \"The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.\" [Proverbs 3:9, 10; 11:24; 19:17; 11:25.]",
