    "word": "Come when it may, the advent of Christ will surprise the false teachers, who are saying, Peace and safety; all things continue as they were from the beginning. Thus saith the Word of Inspiration, \"Sudden destruction cometh upon them.\" The day of God shall come as a snare upon all who dwell upon the face of the whole earth. It comes to them as a prowling thief. \"If the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.\" Habitual watching is our only safety. We must be ever ready, that that day may not overtake us as a thief.",
