    "word": "God knows all about the goods He wishes us to handle in His service. He can see beneath the surface and can read the motives which lead men to restrict those who are workers together with God. Men place restrictions on their fellow-workers in order that they may reach certain ends; but by making it necessary for others to come exactly to their terms, they may bind about a work which God has declared must advance. They desire to gain a certain object, and they use for themselves the tact and talent given them by God. -Letter 51, 1900. Written March 29, 1900.",
