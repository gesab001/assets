    "word": "469\n     Brethren, your aims are altogether too low. You have not used the great moral faculties of the soul,\u2014 faith, hope, and love. These powers are not given us to lie dormant, but that through their exercise the soul may be brought into harmony with heaven. With many of you they are paralyzed through inaction, and, as a consequence, you are weak and helpless; but do not let your great need discourage you. The Saviour of sinners, the Friend of the friendless, with compassion infinitely greater than that of a tender mother for a loved and afflicted child, is inviting, \u201cLook unto me, and be ye saved.\u201d \u201cHe was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\u201d [Isaiah 45:22; 53:5.] We may take hold of his strength, and make peace with God. Jesus will quicken all the faculties of the soul, and implant new life and energy.",
