    "word": "The curse of God rests upon many of the ill-timed, inappropriate connections that are made in this age of the world. If the Bible left these questions in a vague, uncertain light, then the course that many of the youth of today are pursuing in their attachments for one another would be more excusable. But the requirements of the Bible are not half-way injunctions. They demand perfect purity of thought, of word, and of deed. We are grateful to God that His Word is a light to the feet, and none need mistake the path of duty. The young should make it a business to consult its pages and to heed its counsels, for sad mistakes are always made when its precepts are departed from.",
