    "word": "To him who has but one talent I would say, Do you know that one talent, rightly used and improved, will bring to the Lord one hundred talents? How? you ask. Use your gift in the conversion of one man of intellect, who sees what God is to him, and what he should be to God. Let him place himself on the side of the Lord, and as he imparts the light to others, he will be the means of bringing many souls to the Saviour. Through the right use of one talent one hundred souls may receive the truth. It is not to those who have the greatest number of talents to whom the \u201cWell done\u201d is spoken, but to those who in sincerity and faithfulness have used their gifts for the Master. . . .",
