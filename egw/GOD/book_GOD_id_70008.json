    "word": "In the Holy Scriptures fearful denunciations are pronounced against the sin of covetousness. \u201cNo . . . covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.\u201d The psalmist says, \u201cThe wicked boasteth of his heart\u2019s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.\u201d Paul ranks covetous people with idolaters, adulterers, thieves, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners, none of whom shall inherit the kingdom of God. These are the fruits of a corrupt tree, and God is dishonored by them. We are not to make the customs and maxims of the world our criterion. Reforms must take place; all injustice must be put away.",
