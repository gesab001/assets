    "word": "When those to whom God has entrusted responsibilities as leaders, fear and tremble before Him because of the responsibility of the work, when they feel their own unworthiness, and seek the Lord in humility, when they purify themselves from all that is displeasing to Him, when they plead with Him until they know that they have forgiveness and peace, then God will manifest Himself through them. Then the work will go forward with power.",
