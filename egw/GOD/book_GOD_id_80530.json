    "word": "We must put away all slothfulness in the work, and strive to run the Christian race, that we may win the prize--the immortal crown of glory. We must come to the Lord in faith, that he may fulfil his promises to us; for the clean heart, the unselfish spirit, are the gracious gifts of God: it is his Spirit that makes us new creatures in Christ Jesus. The word of God leaves the responsibility of our ruin at our own door; everything depends upon our obedience or disobedience.",
