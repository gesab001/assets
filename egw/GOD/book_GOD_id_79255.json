    "word": "A Work Which All Must Do. \n\n                  St. Helena, Cal., October, 1900. \n     I can not at this time write much. I do not feel it my duty to write all that I could write in truth, for it would not be the best thing to do. I must wait and watch and pray. I feel that the Holy Spirit is working you who are on the other side of the Rocky Mountains. But I have not light now that I should visit Battle Creek, and I shall not do this without a plain Thus saith the Lord. When God sees that the work he has given me will not be refused, and rejected, and his instruction misstated and misappropriated, then I shall have a work to do in connection with those who will co-operate with me in the last great work before us. Calamities, earthquakes, floods, disasters by land and by sea, will increase. God is looking upon the world today as he looked upon it in Noah's time. He is sending his messages to people today as he sent them in the days of Noah. There is in this age of the world a repetition of the wickedness of the world before the flood. Many helped Noah build the ark who did not believe the startling message, who did not cleanse themselves from all wrong principles, who did not overcome the temptation to do and say things which were entirely contrary to the mind and will of God.",
