    "word": "He who would have all from Christ must give all to Christ. Where there is a complete surrender of the being to God, there will be a far deeper meaning in the words of John, chapter one. They speak, \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.\" When these words are understood, there will be a knowledge of God and his will that will have a controlling power over the whole man. When the talent is considered as a gift from God, to be doubled by use, and returned to the Giver in consecrated service, there will be a sacred regard for every human instrumentality. Masterly overbearing and a dishonest use of the talents God has given to any of his heritage will be seen in all their cruelty. Only when every human agent realizes that he helps to compose the web of humanity, and must act his part for God; when he understands that it is not only his privilege, but his duty to trade with his talents, to improve his capabilities, to acquire means and souls, will he be \n\n\n                       -18- \n\nblessed by God. Men are to regard their talents as a trust. God rewards every man according to his work. Then let all stand in a right position. Let them use every jot of ability. Let them acquire spiritual and temporal talents, that they may invest them for God. God has entrusted talents to human beings, that they may co-operate with him in the use of their powers. All their money, all their influence, is to be regarded as the Lord's, who graciously condescends to use them in carrying forward his work.",
