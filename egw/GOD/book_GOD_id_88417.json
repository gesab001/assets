    "word": "Need to Become Renewed in Knowledge and Grace--Were it not for Christ's atoning sacrifice, there is nothing in us in which God can delight. All the natural goodness of man is worthless with God. He will not take pleasure in any man who retains his old nature, and is not so renewed in knowledge and grace that he is a new man in Christ Jesus. Our education, our talents, our means, are gifts entrusted to us by God, that He may see how we will use them. If we use them to glorify self, if we live for self, the Lord says, \"I cannot delight in them; for Christ has died for them in vain.\" One word which exalts self causes the light of God's countenance to be withdrawn.",
