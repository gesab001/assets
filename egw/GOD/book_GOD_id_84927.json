    "word": "Reveal the living charm of the Saviour's life. Represent Christ by revealing faith and hope and love. In short, copy the Pattern. Let your light shine out in good works. Christians have no need of desire for the billiard table, the theater, the dancing hall, or the many other forms of worldly diversion. A Christian does nothing which he cannot do to the glory of God, upon which he cannot ask the blessing of God.",
