    "word": "These words God has been and is still addressing to those who are standing in high places of trust. Many have been corrupted, some more and some less, by your deceptive reasoning. You have thought that whatever your councils decided, would stand as the voice of God; but this supposition must no longer exist. You have the Word of God; you have the message which God has given; but you have turned away from obeying this Word.",
