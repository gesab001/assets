    "word": "In Loma Linda we have an advantageous center for the carrying on of various missionary enterprises. We can see that it was in the providence of God that this sanitarium was placed in the possession of our people. We should appreciate Loma Linda as a place which the Lord foresaw we would need and which He gave us. There is a very precious work to be done in connection with the interests of the sanitarium and school at Loma Linda, and this will be done when we all work to that end, moving unitedly in God's order.",
