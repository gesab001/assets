    "word": "There is room in the work of God for all who are filled with the spirit of self-sacrifice. God is calling for men and women who are willing to deny self for the sake of others, willing to consecrate all they have and are to His work.

Men are needed who will strengthen and build up the work that others are trying to do.--Review and Herald, April 28, 1904. \n\n                                               -",
