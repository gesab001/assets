    "word": "The Lord requires that we honor Him more fully in the management of the work than we \n\n\n              -307- \n\nhave done in the past, but He cannot be honored by a course that hinders the advancement of the message of truth. He is dishonored when men set themselves to watch their fellow workers and to criticize them for seeking to obtain means from those who are willing to give for the needs of the advancing work. Such a work as this destroys the confidence of brother in brother. The advance work which we might have seen done, and which would have glorified God, has been hindered, and the message of truth has been retarded. If faithful and willing workers had been encouraged to do individual, personal work for souls in the highways and the byways, many would have been brought into the fold of Christ; but instead of this, some who desired to labor have become discouraged and disheartened and have lost their convictions of duty.",
