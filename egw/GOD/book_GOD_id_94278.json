    "word": "We must ourselves suffer the ills of violated laws. If we die, we die for ourselves. Is it not best to live for the future eternal life, and die in Christ?

We cannot do as we please with our bodies, for they are God's property. \"Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" [1 Corinthians 6:20].--Ms 86, 1897. \n\nEllen G.
