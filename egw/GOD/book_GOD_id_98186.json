    "word": "\"He that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death\" (Exodus 21:17). Thus God expressed His mind in regard to rebellious children. He made it a capital crime for children to curse or to smite their parents. And He will punish the parents, if they do not govern and control their children. How many children are lost to all virtue! How many are abandoned to vice and iniquity! How many abuse their own parents!",
