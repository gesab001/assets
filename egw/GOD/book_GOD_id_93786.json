    "word": "The ark was built upon dry land. Noah walked by faith, and when the time came and they saw the beasts two by two going into the ark, and the heavens darkened by the fowls that were going two by two into the ark, these were they that were obedient to God; but man was not obedient, but the beasts and fowls were finding a place of refuge. Yet notwithstanding this wonderful sight, still the people were unbelieving.",
