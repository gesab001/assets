    "word": "The wisdom of so-called intellectual men cannot be relied upon, unless they have learned and are daily learning lessons in the school of Christ. Men, in their supposed wisdom, may plan and devise theories and systems of philosophy, but the Lord calls them vain and foolish. The Lord says, \"The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men\" (1 Corinthians 1:25).--Review and Herald, May 12, 1896.",
