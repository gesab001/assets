    "word": "An Appeal for Help\n     To those who are looking for a place where they may work in the Lord's vineyard, we say, \"Come over and help us. Come prepared to practice self-denial, determined that you will not fail nor be discouraged. [See Acts 10:9; Isaiah 42:4.] We cannot pay your passage to this country, nor can we give you large wages. We cannot carry you financially or spiritually, but if you will come to do a work for the Master, if you are willing to visit and labor for souls where they are, come, and we will cooperate with you as long as you will cooperate with God.\"",
