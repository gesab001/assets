    "word": "I beseech Thee, Lord, to arouse the church as they never have been aroused before. Oh, stir up their hearts, Lord. Many of them are now in a paralyzed condition, because they have done so little; but when they begin to use their capabilities for Thee, we know that Thou wilt give them Thy reviving power. Oh, my heavenly Father, I ask Thee that for the sake of Jesus of Nazareth, Thou wouldst bless this entire congregation. Let the sinners in Zion feel the convicting power of God upon them. Let them tremble before Thee, lest they neglect to seek thee until it is too late. I ask Thee, Lord, to open their hearts to receive the Saviour, who has been knocking, knocking, knocking for entrance, until the hairs of His head are wet with the dew of night. Oh, my Father, my Father, wilt Thou, for the sake of Christ, move upon every heart in this congregation!",
