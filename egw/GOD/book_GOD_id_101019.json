    "word": "We must learn meekness and humility from Jesus if we ever enter the portals of bliss. His whole life, from the manger to Calvary, is to be our example in self-denial and sacrifice. He who came to lay down his life for the world, did not disdain to give his disciples a lesson in economy. After he had fed the multitudes by a miracle of his power, he said to the disciples, \" Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\" Though he had all the resources of heaven at his command, he would not suffer even a morsel of bread to be wasted. We might have much more to give to the cause of God, if we would learn to \"Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\"",
