    "word": "October 23, Sabbath. Elder Ings spoke to those assembled, with profit. In the afternoon I talked to the people, and then we had a social meeting, and many good testimonies were borne which were translated to me. There was one converted from Catholicism, some from the Methodist and Baptist [churches], and one from a life of dissipation. The testimonies had the true ring. Here were the few who had separated themselves from the many to obey God and serve Him, refusing to worship the prince of this world, for he is the prince of darkness. To be singular for singularity's sake is positively detestable, below the dignity of a Christian, but to be singular because it is necessary to be so as the result of worshiping God and Him only, places Heaven's dignity upon man. We must not be afraid of being singular when duty requires us to be thus to exalt and honor God; and we must bear in mind that the work of Christ is specified. \"Who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works\" (Titus 2:14).",
