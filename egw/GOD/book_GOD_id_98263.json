    "word": "Walking In the Light. If it were not for the light that is given us from above, we could not follow step by step in God's footsteps. Christ came to this world in order that we might have this light. He is \"the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" He, the Majesty of heaven, the Son of the living God, the One equal with the Father, came to our world to stand by the side of fallen beings, through His sacrifice giving value to humanity. Lower and still lower He stepped in humiliation, until it was impossible for Him to descend any lower. For our sake He suffered and died. While hanging upon the cross, He exclaimed, \"It is finished.\" He had accomplished His work for us; He had become the propitiation for our sins; He had made it possible for us to become clean through faith in Him.",
