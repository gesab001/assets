    "word": "The World Asleep \n\n     The time has come when a large work should be done by our canvassers. The world is asleep, and as watchmen they are to give the warning note, to awake the sleepers to a sense of their danger. The churches know not the time of their visitation. How can they best learn the truth?--Through the efforts of the canvasser. All who consecrate themselves to God to work as canvassers, are assisting to give the last message of warning to the world. They are the Lord's messengers, giving to multitudes in darkness and error the glad tidings of salvation.",
