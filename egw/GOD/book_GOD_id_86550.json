    "word": "Be sure to help the souls that are ready to perish. Oh, it does me good to hear that sinners are being made to understand how they can be saved! Do not forget that a worker must not take upon himself so many burdens that his soul will become weary. His first and greatest care should be to keep fresh and fragrant in spirit. In the unfolding of God's plan we are to be restored to a state corresponding to the perfection of divinity. This is accomplished through the death of Christ and through His mediatorial work in our behalf. As we move forward in the fulfillment of God's plan, our character is established in holiness, and we gain more and more knowledge of God and of Christ. We are ever to remember that we are chosen of God and precious, and that the saving of souls is to be our one great aim in all that we do.-- Letter 100, 1903, pp. 3, 4. (To Brother and Sister Kress, May 25, 1903.)",
