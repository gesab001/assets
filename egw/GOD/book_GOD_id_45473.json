    "word": "I have had much freedom in prayer and sweet communion with God in my waking hours at night and early in the morning. I am gaining some strength, but find that any taxation affects me seriously, so that it takes time to recover from it. My trust [is] in God. I have confidence that He will help me in my efforts to get out the truth and light He has given me to [give to] His  people.--Letter 3, 1876.",
