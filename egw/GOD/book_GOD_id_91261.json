    "word": "God will give His presence and His grace to those who hearken to His voice and obey His commands. He will delight in all who reverence truth as a peculiar treasure. We must approach God feeling that we are sinners, and that His eyes are too pure to behold iniquity. We are to abhor everything that is opposed to God, putting away all unChristlike practices. We are to accept the yoke of Christ, asking him to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and to help us perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord.",
