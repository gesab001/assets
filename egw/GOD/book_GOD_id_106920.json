    "word": "God permitted the flesh of dead animals to be eaten by the ancients, although he knew by so doing the lives of men would be shortened. But when he brought his chosen people from the land of Egypt, he did not give them flesh to eat, but fed them with the bread of heaven. When they murmured against their heaven-appointed food and asked for flesh, God sent them quails; but the consequence of their rebellion were speedily felt. They ate to excess of the meat thus provided, and while the flesh was yet between their teeth many of them died. Our people would do well to study this experience of the children of Israel, and learn the lesson that it teaches.",
