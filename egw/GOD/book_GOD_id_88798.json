    "word": "MR No. 893 - Christ Our Example in Soul-Winning\n\n     No teacher ever placed such signal honor upon man as did our Lord Jesus Christ. He was known as \"the friend of publicans and sinners.\" He mingled with all classes and sowed the world with truth. In the market place and in the synagogue He proclaimed His message. He relieved every species of suffering, both physical and spiritual. Beside all waters He sowed the seeds of truth. His one desire was that all might have spiritual and physical soundness. He was the friend of every human being. Was He not pledged to bring life and light to all who would receive Him? Was He not pledged to give them power to become the Sons of God? He gave Himself wholly and entirely to the work of soul saving.",
