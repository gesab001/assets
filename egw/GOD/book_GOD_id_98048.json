    "word": "Moses asked to see God's face, but the Lord told him that he could not see His face and live. He told him that He would hide him in the cleft of the rock, and cover him with His hand, and would then pass by before him and proclaim His name. And He passed by and proclaimed, \"The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.\" This is God's character. And those who see His face must be like Him in character.",
