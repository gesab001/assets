    "word": "My brethren, lose no time in giving the message in the Southern field. Dwell upon the Word of God. Let every statement be in harmony with a plain \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Exalt Bible truth. Show forth its beauty and holiness. None who work in the South can proclaim the truth as boldly and fearlessly as in the North. Men are to labor with watchfulness and much prayer. Be guarded in what you say regarding the work of other denominations, for there are some who would be quick to retaliate. Let no words be spoken against the white people.",
