    "word": "My brother and sister, let us seek for an increase of faith. There should be more glorifying of God. The Lord would have your faith shine forth with the light that Christ imparts. Do not, I entreat of you, be unbelieving. Talk faith; talk hope and courage. As you talk faith, your faith and confidence in the Lord will be increased. His Word is full of encouragement.",
