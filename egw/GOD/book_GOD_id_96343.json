    "word": "This was plainly revealed to me to show to the people. I have no words to speak to these men privately. My words must be given to the people as a whole. It is not to be left to some to repeat my words and transmit them to others. I wish to present the matter as God has presented it to me. \n\n\n                                     -454- \n\nHow long shall blindness be upon the men who have had evidence piled upon evidence in regard to the testimony of God's Spirit to His people? They do not discern where or how God is working. Eyes have they, but they see not; ears have they, but they hear not; understanding have they, but they understand not the things of God. \"Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: for He maketh sore, and bindeth up: He woundeth, and His hands make whole\" [Job 5:17, 18].",
