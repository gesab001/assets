    "word": "The Office of Misfortune and Adversity \n\n     The Lord has permitted misfortunes to come to men, poverty to press upon them, adversity to try them, that He may thus test those whom He has placed in more favored circumstances; and if those to whom He has entrusted His goods are faithful, He declares them to be worthy to walk with Him in white, to become kings and priests unto God. \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\"",
