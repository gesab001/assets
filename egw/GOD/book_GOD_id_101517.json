    "word": "\"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" O, who can measure such love as this? It is not that God loved us because Christ died for us, but while we were yet sinners, rebels against his law, he gave up Jesus to bear our sins, that pardon may come to all who believe on him. The only hope of the world was for One who knew no sin, One equal with God, to come to our earth, and live the law, testifying that in his humanity he could keep the law, and that sinners might become partakers of the divine nature, and thus be obedient children of God. This is the great work that God has done for the fallen race. He was not willing that any should perish, but that whosoever will, should come to him through Christ, and live.",
