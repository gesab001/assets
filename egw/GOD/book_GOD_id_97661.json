    "word": "We should every one seek to build one another up in the most holy faith, and individually we should look to Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Then you can lead others to the Saviour. Christ has said, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat.\" We must urge our way through the crowd that is making their way in the broad road. We must be firm to obey God. We must purify our souls by obeying the truth. The nearer we get to Jesus, the more we reflect upon His lovely character, the more we will reflect His divine image upon those around us.",
