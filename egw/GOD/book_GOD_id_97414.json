    "word": "When Christ came to John for baptism, John refused to baptize Him, saying, \"I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?\" \"Suffer it to be so now,\" Christ said, \"for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.\" (See Matthew 3:14, 15). Provision has been made that when man repents and takes the steps requisite in conversion, he shall be forgiven. When he is baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, these three great powers are pledged to work in his behalf. And man on his part, as he goes down into the water, to be buried in the likeness of Christ's death and raised in the likeness of His resurrection, pledges himself to worship the true and living God, to come out from the world and be separate, to keep the law of Jehovah.",
