    "word": "There is no uncertainty about our privilege to be washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb; it is a precious, divine reality. The fragrance of the blood of Christ is the odor of our perfection. Our reliance is to be upon God. The name of Christ is\n121\nexalted in excellence, and in Him fallen man is also exalted. We are identified with Christ, bound up in Him. All who are thus favored will share His glory, sitting with Him upon His throne.",
