    "word": "\"I am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.\" This is what needs to be brought into . . . all our churches.

He wants all to have the gold of faith and love, so that they can draw from the treasure to impart to others who need it. \n                                                                           260",
