    "word": "Nehemiah was chosen by God because he was willing to cooperate with the Lord as a restorer. . . . When he saw wrong principles being acted upon, he did not stand by as an onlooker, and by his silence give consent. He did not leave the people to conclude that he was standing on the wrong side. He took a firm, unyielding stand for the right.",
