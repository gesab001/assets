    "word": "What Jesus Has Done For Us--Say to the youth, If you have not given your heart to Jesus, make Him the offering ere the year 1892 shall close. What has Jesus done for you? He has given His precious life for you. If God had not loved you He would have retained Jesus in heaven. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). Do not allow \n\n\n                                     -364- \n\nthe enemy to crowd this out of your mind. It is the most important theme for your meditation. What have I done to show that I appreciate this great love? What have I given to Jesus? The gift that will be a precious and fragrant offering to Him will be yourself. You that have not made your decision to be sons and daughters of God, I beg of you to do this without any delay. Place your will on the side of God's will. He delights in mercy. \"Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His anger forever, because He delighteth in mercy\" (Micah 7:18). Have you decided to become a part of the heritage of the Lord? \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). Come to Jesus just as you are, weak and sinful, ignorant and unworthy and He will receive you. He says, \"A new heart also will I give you\" (Ezekiel 36:26).",
