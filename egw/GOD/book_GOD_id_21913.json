    "word": "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that he is the Creator, and that to him all other beings owe their existence. And wherever, in the Bible, his claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited the evidence of his creative power. \u201cAll the \n437\ngods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the heavens.\u201d [Psalm 96:5.] \u201cTo whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things.\u201d \u201cThus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; . . . I am Jehovah; and there is none else.\u201d [Isaiah 40:25, 26; 45:18.] Says the psalmist, \u201cKnow ye that Jehovah, he is God; it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves.\u201d \u201cO come, let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\u201d [Psalm 100:3; 95:6.] And the holy beings who worship God in Heaven state, as the reason why their homage is due to him, \u201cThou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things.\u201d [Revelation 4:11.]",
