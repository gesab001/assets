    "word": "[Proverbs 2:10-13, quoted.] This has been the condition of things all along the line in the going out from the center, Battle Creek. The great difficulty is that confidence is placed in men. The ideas of those whose lives have not been clean and upright have been seized and acted upon. Selfishness and self-serving characterize these men, and in any important crisis they make trouble, drawing under their influence those who ought to have learned by experience to cut away from them. The light of the Sun of Righteousness has not been shining upon them. They hear a rumor, and they run without any message from God. This is the trouble with many in Battle Creek. They are unsettled. They have not a firm grip upon the Lord. They need to be thoroughly converted.",
