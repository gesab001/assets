    "word": "Dear Brother, you make too many calculations that you can never carry out. If you should attempt to follow your own plans, you would make a failure which would drive you to discouragement and instead of censuring your self, you would be tempted by the enemy to blame and censure your brethren because they did not engage with you in your enterprise. You have many temptations in regard to your brethren. You must resist them or the enemy will make you weak and overthrow you. It is your duty to do what good you can as God opens the way before you. You are constantly trying to open some way for yourself. If \n\n\n                                    -417- \n\nyou continue to plan and follow your judgment, you will burden your brethren and exhaust their patience.",
