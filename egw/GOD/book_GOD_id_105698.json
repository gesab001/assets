    "word": "It is not merely one man, but it is other men. They come into the Board, and they think it is showing sharpness to kind of quiz and quiz, and hold a thing, and make a world of a mote just in that way. All these things, I will tell you, the angels of God are present, hearing what I say today. Here is every one that comes into these Board meetings where there is some little thing that just doesn\u2019t meet their mind, but they will hang on and hang on, until it wears the persons all out. God is not glorified by any such things. But when you find a person whose special trait of character is to do that way, to do that way whether it is one, two, three, or four men, it is as wrong for that Board that has been appointed to appoint those men again and carry them through. They should go to those men in the name of the Lord and ask them, Is that your education? Is that your training? Do you think in such a training as that, that you are glorifying God?",
