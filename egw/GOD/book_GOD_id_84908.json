    "word": "God now calls upon every believer in this center to act his individual part in helping to build up the work that must be done.

As the result of laboring earnestly to provide facilities for the salvation of unbelievers, and for the training of many of our own people for soul-saving service, you will find that your souls are refreshed with heaven's richest blessings.",
