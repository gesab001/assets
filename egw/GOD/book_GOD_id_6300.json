    "word": "I beg those bearing responsibilities in God's cause to let no commercial enterprises interpose between them and the work of soul saving. Let\n32\nno business be allowed to absorb the time and talents of workers who ought to be engaged in preparing a people for the coming of the Lord. The truth is to go forth as a lamp that burneth. Time is short; the enemy will make every effort to magnify in our minds matters of lesser consequence, and to lead us to regard lightly the very work that most needs to be done.",
