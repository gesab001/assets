    "word": "[To S. N. Haskell]--I write a few lines to you this morning by lamplight. Before receiving this, you will have met Professor Prescott. We would gladly have retained him in this country, but we dared not do this, for it would have savoured of selfishness. We hope he will do the brethren much good in South Africa, and that he will be received cordially, in brotherly love. He has the truth in the heart, as well as on the lips. God is with him, and will work by him if our brethren will receive him as one who bears to them a message from God. May it not be true of them, as of the people of Nazareth, that Jesus could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief. There is no virtue in refusing to receive the light which God shall send, and we need every ray of light from heaven. We should appreciate the love of God, who sends the light, and should accept the light joyfully. \n\n\n                                   -34-",
