    "word": "Throughout His life on earth, Christ was a divine missionary, and His love for souls was not quenched by hunger, thirst, or weariness. He was the world's greatest Teacher. He came to seek and to save that which was lost. We will rejoice in that we can be labourers together with God, that we can be humble instruments for His use. He flashes the light of His own pure, heavenly truth into the chambers of the mind, and into the soul-temple of the needy souls who long for that light and truth that He alone can impart.",
