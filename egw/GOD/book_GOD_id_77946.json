    "word": "Human weakness is apparent in the strongest of men. The best are but erring mortals, and one should not feel at liberty to sit in judgment upon the motives or actions of his brethren. Charity, which is so much lacking, is yet very essential in this age of the world. God would have his ministers, and every soul connected with his work in these sacred institutions, show marked respect and love for one another; in honor, preferring one another.",
