    "word": "When Moses asked the Lord to show him His glory, the Lord said, \"I will make all My goodness pass before thee.\" \"And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty. . . . And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.\" Exodus 33:19;  34:6-8. When we are able to comprehend the character of God, as did Moses, we, too, shall make haste to bow in adoration and praise.",
