    "word": "God said to Jeremiah, \"Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee\" (Jeremiah 1:7, 8). Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched His servant's mouth, saying, \"Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth\" (verse 9). And He bids us go forth to speak the words He gives us, feeling His holy touch upon our lips.",
