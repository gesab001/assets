    "word": "In the fifty-eight chapter of Isaiah, the work of those who worship God, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, is specified: \"They that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations\" [Isaiah 58:12]. God's memorial, His seventh-day Sabbath, will be uplifted. \"Thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath [no longer trample it under your feet], from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour Him, . . . I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it\" [Isaiah 58:12-14].",
