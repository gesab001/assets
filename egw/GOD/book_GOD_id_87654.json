    "word": "Those who have passed through a struggle to rise above the realm of doubt and conjecture, realize that \"while God has given ample evidence for faith, He will never remove all excuse for unbelief. All who look for hooks to hang their doubts upon, will find them. And those who refuse to accept and obey God's Word until every objection has been removed, and there is no longer an opportunity for doubt, will never come to the light.\"--Great Controversy, p. 527.
