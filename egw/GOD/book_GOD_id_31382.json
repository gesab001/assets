    "word": "Those who claim to be followers of the Master Worker, and who engage in His service as co-laborers with God, are to bring into their work the exactitude and skill, the tact and wisdom, that the God of perfection required in the building of the earthly tabernacle. And now, as in that time and as in the days of Christ's earthly ministry, devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice should be regarded as the first requisites of acceptable service. God designs that not one thread of selfishness shall be woven into His work.--Review and Herald, January 4, 1906. \n\n                                               -",
