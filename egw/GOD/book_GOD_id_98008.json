    "word": "Students, do not disappoint your Creator. Do not think that you have come to school to do very much as you please. Do not allow your mind to be filled with lightness and trifling. Keep yourselves in the channel of light. Consecrate yourselves to God. He will accept all who put away the evil of their doings. Your parents are watching your progress with intense interest. Do not disappoint them. Make them happy by following a right course. Make a covenant with God by sacrifice. He will accept your offering, and make you vessels unto honor. \n\n                                                                ----------",
