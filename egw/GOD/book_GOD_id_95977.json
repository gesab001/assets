    "word": "I feel a deep interest in the work all over the field. I have no special interest in one place above another, only that I am doing the will of God. We expect our party will arrive here sometime this week, and may the Lord give us wisdom from above to know just how to decide everything in a manner to glorify His holy name. I have been expecting a letter of response from Elder Loughborough in regard to Brother Church and his pledges, but none has come yet. It may come soon. I do hope that you will not work up to the last thread of strength you have. And I should be glad if your wife could have your company more than she has had, poor woman! She has to be away from you so much, but the Lord will not leave or forsake her. I hope she will be constantly blessed of the Lord.",
