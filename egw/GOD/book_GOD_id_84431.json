    "word": "Closing Our Restaurants on the Sabbath \n\n     Before leaving Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to talk with Mrs. Moran in regard to some of these matters. She asked me about the advisability of keeping the restaurant open on the Sabbath for a limited number. I told her that there was danger of breaking the law of God by serving a few on the Sabbath as well as by serving many. To serve either a few or many on this day will give the impression that we are lax in principle, and thus a wrong influence will be exerted on both patrons and helpers.",
