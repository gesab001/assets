    "word": "Immortality, promised to man on condition of obedience, had been forfeited by transgression. Adam could not transmit to his posterity that which he did not possess; and there could have been no hope for the fallen race, had not God, by the sacrifice of his Son, brought immortality within their reach. While \u201cdeath passed upon all men, for that all have sinned,\u201d Christ \u201chath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.\u201d [Romans 5:12; 2 Timothy 1:10.] And only through Christ can immortality be obtained. Said Jesus, \u201cHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life.\u201d [John 3:36.] Every man may come in possession of this priceless blessing if he will comply with the conditions. All \u201cwho by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality,\u201d will receive eternal life. [Romans 2:7.]",
