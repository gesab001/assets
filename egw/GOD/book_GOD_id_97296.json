    "word": "\"Ye are my witnesses,\" says God, and God wants us by precept and example to represent Christ in our world. He represented the Father, and He left the work in our hands to attend to the needy and the distressed, and to have something to help them that they may have the blessing of relief, the necessities of suffering humanity. But if we use it up unwisely, imprudently, He will say, \"Thou wicked and slothful servant, why did not you take My talent, why did you not put it out to the exchangers? Why did not you use My gift that you could double it for My service?\" God wants us to win souls for Him; and then what? You are to begin to work with the talent which God has lent you, and then [use] every gift there is to the praise of heaven. \n\n\n                                     -261-",
