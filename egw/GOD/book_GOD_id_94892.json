    "word": "Children are to be taught to be respectful to their parents and to one another. Thus they learn to be respectful to God. They are to be taught to appreciate the abilities that God has given them, to remember that Christ's love for them calls for the surrender of all to Him. They are to be taught to do right because it is right, to control self, to be kind, loving, gentle, to forget self in the effort to help one another.",
