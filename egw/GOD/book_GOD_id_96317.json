    "word": "November 21. During the night season I was specially moved upon by Spirit of God. My soul had been drawn out in earnest supplication to God. I was distressed on account of the backsliding of His people. While lying in bed, unable to sleep because of the burden resting upon me, I was pleading with the Lord. I fell asleep, and in the night season I was taught of God. My guide said, \"I have a work for you to do. You must speak the words given you by the Lord. After these words have been spoken, your duty here is done.",
