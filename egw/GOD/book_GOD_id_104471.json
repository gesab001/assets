    "word": "God must show us every step of the way. Every hour we must have the new impulses of His Spirit. Love for Him should be the mainspring of our actions. Every hour has its duties, and every moment its cares. Let a controlling power from above check the hasty speech. Let your heart be filled with the kindest, most tender compassion. Never allow yourself to be ruled by impulse. Never get out of patience. New scenes are opening before us, and we need to hear a voice from heaven, directing us to the right or to the left, saying, \"This is the way; walk ye in it.\" God's will, not ours, is to control. \"A man's heart deviseth his way; but the Lord directeth his steps.\" \n\n                                               -",
