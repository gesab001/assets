    "word": "More Thinking and Planning--If the officers of a conference would bear successfully the burdens laid upon them, they must pray, they must believe, they must trust God to use them as His agents in keeping the churches of the conference in good working order.  This is their part of the vineyard to cultivate.  There must be far more personal responsibility, far more thinking and planning, far more mental power brought into the labor put forth for the Master.  This would enlarge the capacity of the mind, and give keener perceptions as to what to do and how.--Gospel Workers, p. 416.",
