    "word": "Prayer Seasons Bring Encouragement.--As workers, let us seek the Lord together. Of our own selves we can do nothing; but through Christ we can do all things. God intends that we shall be a help and blessing to one another, and that we shall be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. . . . God lives and reigns; and He will give us all the help we need. It is our privilege at all times to draw strength and encouragement from His blessed promise, \"My grace is sufficient for you.\"--Historical Sketches, p. 129. (1886)",
