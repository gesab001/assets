    "word": "Do the Work and Accept Wages Offered \n\n     Every man is required to do the work assigned him of God. We should be willing to render small services, doing the things that are to be done, which someone must do, improving the little opportunities. If these are the only opportunities we should still work faithfully. He who wastes hours, days, and weeks, because he is unwilling to do the work that offers, humble though it may be, will be called to render an account to God for his misspent time. If he feels that he can afford to do nothing, because he cannot obtain the desired wages, let him stop and think that that day, that one day, is the Lord's. He is the Lord's servant. He is not to waste his time. Let him think, \"I will spend that time in doing something, and will give all I earn to advance the work of God. I will not be counted a do-nothing.\"",
