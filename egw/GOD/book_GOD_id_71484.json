    "word": "Remember that Christ is our only hope, our only refuge. He \"bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness\" (1 Peter 2:24). \"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance\" (Hebrews 9:13-15).--Manuscript 3, March 1, 1903, \"To Every Man His Work.\"",
