    "word": "Now God wants us to work as Christ worked, because there is but little money among us. Our brethren in America have been drawn upon for thousands and thousands of dollars. It is now the duty of the workers to make use of the very best of their ability and talent to build up the cause in these various fields so that it shall be self-sustaining. If you enter a new field and work at a very great expense to get out a few of the poorer classes who cannot possibly stand alone themselves, your labor will amount to very little. Those who need props on every side to hold them up are an additional care rather than a blessing.",
