Remember, when the good man returns, those who are ready will go in to the feast and the door will be shut, and there will be no further entrance, for we read that when \"the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door\" (Luke 13:25), then those who would find admittance will hear the answer, \"I know you not. . . ; depart from Me.\"",
