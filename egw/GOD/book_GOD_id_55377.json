    "word": "These may be assured that the mighty God of Israel is still a God of cleanliness. They profess to be serving God while they are committing idolatry, by making a god of their appetite. Tobacco is their cherished idol. To it every high and sacred consideration must bow. They profess to be worshiping God, while at the same time they are violating the first commandment. They have other gods before the Lord. \"Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"--Spiritual Gifts, vol. 4, pp. 127, 128.",
