    "word": "Let us keep in remembrance that we each have a work to do. No one can afford to use tobacco; no one can afford to drink liquor. We must keep the senses clear; we must keep the mind free from all obstruction. We have a work to do for the Master, and we cannot afford to be content with crippled ideas. We do not want our sensibilities to be so perverted that we shall do iniquity. We do not want to spoil the fragrance that through the Spirit and blessing of God we might be the means of bringing into the life of some other person. We want individually to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God.",
