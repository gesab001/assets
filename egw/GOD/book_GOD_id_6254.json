    "word": "The time of trouble is just before us, and then stern necessity will require the people of God to deny self, and eat merely enough to sustain life; but God will prepare them for that time. In that fearful hour, their necessity will be God's opportunity to impart strength, and sustain his people. But now God requires them to labor with their hands, the thing that is good, and lay by them in store as he has prospered them, and to do their part in sustaining the cause of truth. This is a duty enjoined upon all who are not especially called to labor in word and doctrine, to devote their time to proclaiming to others the way of life and salvation.",
