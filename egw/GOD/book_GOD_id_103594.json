    "word": "E. G. White: If we follow on to know the Lord, we shall know that His going forth is prepared as the morning. There are some who may not be able to see that here is a test as to whether we shall put our dependence on man, or depend upon God. Shall we by our course seem to acknowledge that there is a stronger power with the unbelievers than there is with God's own people. When we take hold upon God, and trust in Him, He will work in our behalf. But we are to stand distinct and separate from the world.",
