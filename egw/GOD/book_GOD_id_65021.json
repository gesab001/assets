THE OCCASIONAL BLANKS ARE \n       REPRODUCED AS THEY APPEAR IN THE FILE COPIES \n        OF THE LETTERS IN THE WHITE ESTATE VAULT.] \n\n\n     Equal Guilt of Two Persons. In the night season I saw you in the company of the matron of the institution. As far as your attentions to each other were concerned, you might have been man and wife. Your conduct toward each other was wrong in the sight of God, and my heart was grieved by the condition of things. I asked, \"Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth?\"  God is displeased. You have grieved His Holy Spirit. Sister N will never again be what she once was. Both of you are guilty before God.-- Letter 30, 1887 (written June 11, 1887).",
