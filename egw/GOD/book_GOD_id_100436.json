    "word": "This has been the mistake of a large number of our preaching brethren. They have not been close Bible students, and many of their discourses have been repeated. The old, stereotyped discourses will be repeated with scarcely a variation, because they will not open the door to receive light, increased light, but go on in the same line, repeating almost the same words. For years, scarcely a new ray of light has flashed forth from them. They have not had advanced light, and some have educated themselves as debaters and God has not been glorified in this. They have used great sharpness with opponents and have educated themselves to overcome an opponent if possible, not always by fair means. This is not at all after Christ's order.",
