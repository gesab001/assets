    "word": "To those in charge of our schools I would say, Are you making God and His law your delight? Are the principles that you follow sound and pure and unadulterated? Are you keeping yourselves, in the life-practice, under the control of God? Do you see the necessity of obeying Him in every particular? If you are tempted to appropriate the money coming into the school, in ways that bring no special benefit to the school, your standard of principle needs to be carefully criticized, that the time may not come when you will have to be criticized and found wanting.",
