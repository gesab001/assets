    "word": "[The Lord] has workers whom He will call forth from poverty and obscurity. Engaged in the common duties of life, and clothed with coarse raiment, they are looked upon by men as of little value. But Christ sees in them infinite possibilities, and in His hands they will become precious jewels, to shine brightly in the kingdom of God. \u201cThey shall be mine, saith the Lord of Host, in that day when I make up my jewels.\u201d (Malachi 3:17).",
