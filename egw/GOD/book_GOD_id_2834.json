    "word": "\u201cIf therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\u201d The conscience is the regulative faculty, and if people allow their conscience to become perverted, they cannot serve God aright. Their object in life shows to the world whether they are Christians or in rebellion against God. Their whole life is a failure. It is distorted and double, and all the faculties are misdirected. The profession may be all right, but the faith is perverted, and this is revealed by the practice, which misleads others. \u201cNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\u201dLetter 128, 1897 (Manuscript Releases, vol. 13, pp. 154, 155).",
