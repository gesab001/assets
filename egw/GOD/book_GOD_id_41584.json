    "word": "The action in this matter instituted in Battle Creek robbed the cause of God of money which He would have \n\n244 \n\nemployed in advancing the work where the banner of truth has not been uplifted. The payment of such large wages was entirely contrary to the plan of God in any line of His work; it was contrary to the example of Christ in His life. The greatest Teacher the world ever knew gave every institution in our world a pattern of self-denying, self-sacrificing principle.--Lt 31a, 1894.",
