    "word": "The open book of nature is to be the student's study. Schools should be established away from the cities. I have more invested in this land than any other person. I am carrying students through school, paying their expenses that they may get a start. This gives me an influence with teachers and learners. The land was laid out in lots. Houses were to be built, as in a village. But I tell them that buildings are not to be crowded upon the land around the school buildings. This is God's farm, and it is sacred ground. Here the students are to learn the lesson, \"Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.\" The work that is done in the land is to be done in a particular, thorough, wise manner. From the cultivation of the soil and the planting of seed, lessons in spiritual lines may be learned.",
