    "word": "Parents, do not fail to train your children for God. But this work need not debar you from doing missionary work outside the home. Teach your children to help other children. With proper instruction, they can do much real missionary work. If you have trained your child aright, you will find him a help to you in working for others. Parents who neglect their children in order to do missionary work, make a sad mistake. The course of their untrained, undisciplined children robs them of all influence for good.",
