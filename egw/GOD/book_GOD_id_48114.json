    "word": "But while God's Word speaks of the humanity of Christ when upon this earth, it also speaks decidedly regarding his preexistence. The Word existed as a divine being, even as the eternal Son of God, in union and oneness with his Father. From everlasting he was the Mediator of the covenant, the one in whom all nations of the earth, both Jews and Gentiles, if they accepted him, were to be blessed. \"The Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" Before men or angels were created, the Word was with God, and was God.--The Review and Herald, April 5, 1906.",
