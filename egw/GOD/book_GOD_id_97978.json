    "word": "We read in 2 Peter 1 that you are to be divine partakers of Jesus Christ, and there is not one of the very simplest in the institution but that he can take hold of the divine nature through the knowledge of Jesus Christ who gave His life to buy us. Then we must consider we are bought with a price--even the precious blood of the Son of God. God is not going to let us drift this way and that way with Satan's temptations, but if you will stand in Christ and if you will be determined that you will make of yourself all that God intended you should make, you can become as precious in the sight of God as Daniel was--beloved of God.",
