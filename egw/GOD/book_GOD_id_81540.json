I was shown the inconsistency of those who profess to believe the truth withholding their means from the cause of God, that they may leave it for their children. Many fathers and mothers are poor in the midst of abundance. They abridge, in a degree, their own personal comforts, and frequently deny themselves those things necessary for the enjoyment of life and health, while they have ample means at their command. They feel, as it were, forbidden to appropriate their means for their own comfort or for charitable purposes. They have one object before them, which is to save property to leave for their children. This idea is so prominent, so interwoven with all their actions, that children learn to look forward to this property finally to be theirs. They depend on it. And this prospect has an important, but not a favorable, influence upon their characters. Some become spendthrifts, others, selfish and avaricious. Some are indolent and reckless. Many do not cultivate habits of economy. They do not seek to become self-reliant. They are aimless, and have but little stability of character. The impressions received in childhood \n                                                                           154\nand youth are wrought in the texture of character and become the principle of action in mature life.",
