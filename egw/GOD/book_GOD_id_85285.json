    "word": "New Light \n     The Message, Not the Messenger. When a new view is presented, the question is often asked, \"Who are its advocates? What is the position or influence of the one who would teach us, who have been students of the Bible for many years?\" God will send His words of warning by whom He will send. And the question to be settled is not what person is it who brings the message; this does not in any way affect the word spoken. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"--Letter 19d, 1892, pp. 7, 8. (To Elder O. A. Olsen, September 1, 1892.)",
