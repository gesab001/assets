    "word": "The children of God, the world over, are one great brotherhood. Our Saviour has clearly defined the spirit and principles which should govern the actions of those who, by their consistent, holy lives, distinguish themselves from the world. Love for one another, and supreme love to their Heavenly Father, should be exemplified in their conversation and works. The present condition of many of the children of God is like a family of ungrateful, quarrelsome children.",
