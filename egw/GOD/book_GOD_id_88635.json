    "word": "MR No. 872 - The Need for Decentralization\n\n     A New Order Urged for the General Conference in 1901--God forbid, brethren, that this Conference [1901 General Conference session] should close as our conferences have closed in the past, with the same management, the same tone, the same order. The Lord wants those who have a knowledge of the truth to come to their senses. He wants them to arouse. It is time for us to arise and shine because our light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon us. . . .",
