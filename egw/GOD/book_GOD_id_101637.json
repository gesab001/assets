    "word": "Men have come to Battle Creek who have been accompanied by the Holy Spirit; but unless they fought every inch of ground over and over again, in seeking to maintain correct methods, they were at last over borne. Right at the point where our work centres, they have seen corruption, and some have gone away with less confidence in their brethren and in their Protestant principles, and with the divine light in their souls well nigh extinguished. God would have his temple no longer a den of thieves and moneychangers. He desires his servants to be men of piety and holy endeavour.",
