    "word": "I feel a deep interest that careful study shall be given to the needs of our institutions at Loma Linda and that right moves shall be made. In the carrying forward of the work at this place, men of talent and decided spirituality are needed. The best teachers are to be employed in the educational work, men and women who will walk circumspectly, depending wholly upon the Lord. If the teachers in medical lines will stand in their place in the fear of God, we shall see a good work done. With Christ as our educator we may reach a high standard in the knowledge of the true science of healing.",
