    "word": "Says Paul, \"Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God\" (2 Corinthians 7:1). He presents for our encouragement the freedom enjoyed by the truly sanctified: \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit\" (Romans 8:1). He charges the Galatians, \"Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh\" (Galatians 5:16). He names some of the forms of fleshly lust --\"idolatry, . . . drunkenness, . . . and such like\" (verses 20, 21). And after mentioning the fruits of the Spirit, among which is temperance, he adds, \"And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts\" (verse 24).",
