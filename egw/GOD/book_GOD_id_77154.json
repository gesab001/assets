    "word": "There are needed faithful and picked men at Battle Creek. Those who have not had an experience in bearing burdens, and do not wish to have that experience, should not, on any account, live there. Men are wanted who will watch for souls as they that must give an account. Fathers and mothers in Israel are wanted at this important post.

The more isolated such ones are, the better for the cause of God. \n                                                                           45",
