    "word": "Courage \n\n     God's servants are not to be easily discouraged by difficulties or opposition. Those who proclaim the third angel's message must stand bravely at their post, in the face of detraction and falsehood, fighting the good fight of faith, and resisting the enemy with the weapon that Christ used, \"It is written.\" In the great crisis through which they are soon to pass, the servants of God will encounter the same hardness of heart, the same cruel determination, the same unyielding hatred, encountered by Christ and the apostles.",
