    "word": "Chapter 5 \n\n     2, 3 (Acts 20:28). A Wide Field for Church Leaders.--God is not glorified by leaders in the church who seek to drive the sheep. No, no. \"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.\" There is a wide field for the elders and the helpers in every church. They are to feed the flock of God with pure provender, thoroughly winnowed from the chaff, the poisonous mixture of error. You who have any part to act in the church of God, be sure that you act wisely in feeding the flock of God; for its prosperity much depends upon the quality of this food (MS 59, 1900).",
