    "word": "Bible Truth Must Be Woven Into Everyday Life \n\n     The truth of the Bible may be no truth to us if these words of God are not brought into actual contact with the soul. It is not enough that we have a knowledge of the truth. Our faith must grasp its deep principles. We must perceive the truth and weave it into our practical everyday life.--Manuscript 48, 1897, p. 2. (\"To One Verging on Apostasy,\" May, 1897.)",
