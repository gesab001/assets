    "word": "The Word is full of warnings, of the most merciful invitations, and also of words in decided condemnation of evil. Not one who will study the Word of God and apply its teachings will miss the way. By the love of God, by the fear of God, by the reverence and honor we feel for the Author of truth and righteousness, we are instructed, admonished, and profited. All such revealings as come from the human agent, as in the case of Sister Phillips, turn the mind away from the words of inspiration to the words of inexperienced humanity.",
