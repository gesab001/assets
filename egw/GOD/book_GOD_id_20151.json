    "word": "305\n     When laborers are associated together who decidedly vary, both in natural disposition and character, and in their manner of labor, each will need to keep a careful watch over his own strong traits of character, and to exercise the meekness of Christ, or he will be in danger of drawing apart from the others. Such a separation would retard the work and dishonor God. Brethren, you should make no move independently or in opposition to one another. Pray together; counsel together in humility, willing to be instructed. This will bring you where God will be your counselor. By indulging a stubborn, self-confident spirit, workers can easily place themselves where divine wisdom and power cannot aid them in their labors, where they cannot have help in counsel, in difficulties, and trials.",
