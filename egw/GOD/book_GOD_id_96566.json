    "word": "I have much to be thankful for in the health and strength that the Lord gives me. We must keep up our courage in the Lord. I am praying that the Lord's people shall have special power just now and that they will not think or talk discouragement. We need to strengthen our belief in the past experience that we have had in the cause of God. We need to pray much and speak words of encouragement to others.",
