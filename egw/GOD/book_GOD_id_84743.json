    "word": "We cannot expect that everything will move along smoothly; for everything is to be shaken that can be shaken. God is testing and proving His people. Angels of God, intelligences of heaven, are watching the development of character, and weighing the moral worth of the professed followers of Christ. Look up, look above the whirl of daily occurrences, and fix your eyes upon Him who never changes and you will endure as seeing Him who is invisible. You may look forward with joy to the finishing of the mystery.",
