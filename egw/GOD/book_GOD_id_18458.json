    "word": "Jesus, while He dwelt on earth, dignified life in all its details by keeping before men the glory of God, and by subordinating everything to the will of His Father. If we follow His example, His assurance to us is that all things needful in this life \"shall be added.\" Poverty or wealth, sickness or health, simplicity or wisdom--all are provided for in the promise of His grace.",
