    "word": "Chapter XII. - The Disciples of Christ.\n\n     With mighty power the disciples preached a crucified and risen Saviour. They healed the sick, even one who had always been lame was restored to perfect soundness, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God in the sight of all the people. The news spread, and the people began to press around the disciples. Many ran together, greatly astonished and amazed at the cure that had been wrought.",
