    "word": "17 (Ephesians 6:12). Stern Conflicts in the Christian Life.--The life of the Christian is not all smooth. He has stern conflicts to meet. Severe temptations assail him. \"The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.\" The nearer we come to the close of this earth's history, the more delusive and ensnaring will be the attacks of the enemy. His attacks will grow fiercer and more frequent. Those who resist light and truth will become more hardened and unimpressible, and more bitter against those who love God and keep His commandments (MS 33, 1911). \n                                                                           1112",
