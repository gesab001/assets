    "word": "In Acts we read the story of Philip and the nobleman--how, as an Ethiopian was journeying homeward from Jerusalem, and studying the Scriptures, Philip appeared before him, and inquired, \"Understandest thou what thou readest?\" The record informs us that he did not; and so Philip ascended into the chariot, and sat down by the side of the eunuch, and opened the Scriptures to his understanding, and delighted him with the truth. With enlightened heart and mind, the Ethiopian believed the message that he heard. As they journeyed on, they came to a stream of water; \"and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?\" Philip replied, \"If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.\" The nobleman answered, \"I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\" Upon hearing this declaration, Philip immediately went down with the eunuch into the water, and there baptized him. Philip immediately afterward departed, as he had received a message to go to another place. The nobleman \"went on his way rejoicing,\" a believer in the truths of God's Word.",
