    "word": "Brother [M.E.] Cornell and wife visited Ohio, and Brother Cornell did a strange and sad work--he spoke against Brother Loughborough. His old jealous feelings led him to speak of Brother Loughborough in a manner calculated to prejudice the churches against him. That was a miserable, despicable work. God left Brother Cornell to take his own course and follow his imperfect judgment, and stirring appeals were made to the church and they handed out their means liberally to him. They thought he would use it to spread the truth, but he forfeited their confidence, which they had reposed in him, by hastening and spending the means in a wrong manner, publishing charts, which was all wrong. Brother Cornell had first preached the truth to many of them and they had so much confidence in him that when he erred it nearly ruined them.",
