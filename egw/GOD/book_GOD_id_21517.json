If I am to depend upon any strength of this world\u2014all is over. . . . The knell is struck. . . . Sentence is gone forth. . . . O thou my God! help me against all the wisdom of this world. Do this, I beseech thee . . . by thine own mighty power. . . . The work is not mine, but thine. I have no business here. . . . I have nothing to contend for with the great men of the world. . . . But the cause is thine, . . . and it is righteous and everlasting. . . . O faithful and unchangeable God! I lean not upon man. . . . Whatever is from man is tottering, whatever proceeds from him must fall. . . . Thou hast chosen me for this work. . . . Therefore, O God, accomplish thine own will; forsake me not, for the sake of thy well-beloved Son, Jesus Christ, my defense, my buckler, and my stronghold.\u201d",
