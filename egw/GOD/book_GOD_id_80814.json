I shall not try to pacify or pet you, but I will urge upon you the necessity of having a pure heart and clean hands. From a pure fountain will proceed pure and holy streams to refresh others. Oh, will you go on as you have in the past, or will you have steadiness of purpose to put away everything unbecoming to a gospel minister? I cannot allow you to misrepresent the great and solemn truth which we have to present to the world, which has been committed to us by the Lord. Serving tables, the absorbing cares of temporal life, must not be mixed with your work of ministering; for Satan will make this a means of loss in your influence and to your own soul. Christ said, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" You must have far less of self and far more of Jesus. You must meditate, you must pray, you must examine yourself in the light of God's word. If you lose eternal life, you lose everything. I cannot endure the thought of one soul being lost, but when I think of one who has preached the truth to others becoming a castaway, my soul is stirred with anguish.",
