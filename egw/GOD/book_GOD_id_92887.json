    "word": "Men may suppose that they shall be saved, and yet they perish. They may take pride in great knowledge in worldly things, but if they have not a knowledge of the true God, of Christ, the Way, the Truth, the Life, they are deplorably ignorant, and their acquired knowledge will perish with them. Secular knowledge is power; but the knowledge of the Word, which has a transforming power upon the human mind, is imperishable; it is knowledge sanctified. It is life and peace and joy forever. The deeper knowledge men may have, sanctified wholly unto God, the more they will appreciate the value of Jesus Christ.--Ms 32a, 1896. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. Nov. 5, 1987.
