    "word": "Men in the office at Battle Creek have acted as if they had jurisdiction of other men's intellect and conscience, and could manipulate them to serve any purpose which they might choose. They have had an opportunity to reveal how much they themselves really have the cause of God at heart. If it can be advanced through their plans for compelling others to sacrifice for it, they are glad to see its prosperity. While grasping all the benefit possible for themselves, they have, both in the matter of royalties and other lines felt it their prerogative to crowd down the very ones whom God was using to diffuse light. Of the work of these persons they have made very little, while they made much of their own, that bore the stamp of the unsanctified human agent. It would have been better for the cause today if these men had never put their hand to the work. They have tried to force their ideas upon those who have the cause much nearer their hearts than some of these who are so forward to dictate.",
