    "word": "One of Christ's beautiful and impressive parables is that of the sower and the seed. \"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" Mark 4:26-28.",
