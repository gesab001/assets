    "word": "The work of God requires all-around men, those who can devise, plan, build up, organize, and exercise wisdom in discipline. These are the ones that are chosen by God for His work. All whom the Lord leads, all who appreciate the solemnity, the probabilities and possibilities of the work for this time, will feel like obtaining all the knowledge they can from the Word. By earnest study of the Word, they will gain all the knowledge they can use in ministering to the needy--the sick both in body and in soul.",
