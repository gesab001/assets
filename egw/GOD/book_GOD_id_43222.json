    "word": "Through the gospel, souls that are degraded and enslaved by Satan are to be redeemed to share the glorious liberty of the sons of God. God's purpose is not merely to deliver from the suffering that is the inevitable result of sin, but to save from sin itself. The soul, corrupted and deformed, is to be purified, transformed, that it may be clothed in \"the beauty of the Lord our God,\" \"conformed to the image of his Son.\" \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him\" (Psalm 90:17; Romans 8:29; 1 Corinthians 2:9). Eternity alone can reveal the glorious destiny to which man, restored to God's image, may attain.",
