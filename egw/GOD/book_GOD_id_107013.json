    "word": "\"These things will have to be repeated over and over again, in order that our brethren may draw in harmony and unity for uplifting,--not in themselves, but for uplifting in the presence of God.

Nothing will enable us to prevail like presenting to God the sure work of his promises. Then there is no failure.",
