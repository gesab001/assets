    "word": "There are words spoken that are not Christlike,--bitter, harsh, wicked words. This should not be. Men who like Enoch are walking in the light of Christ, will exercise self-control, even under temptation and provocation. Although sorely tried by the perversity and obstinacy of others who are associated with them, they dare not let impulse bear sway. All who are walking in the light will give evidence of divine power combined with human effort; they will make it manifest that they are taught and led of God. They will feel that the Holy Watcher is by their side, taking knowledge of their words.",
