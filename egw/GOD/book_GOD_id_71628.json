    "word": "The peril of delaying to come to Christ is not discerned by those who are under the power of Satan. But when there comes the sense of acknowledged guilt, how the stricken soul hides himself with his God. Let guilty sinners come close to the One who is their atoning Sacrifice. Let them cling to Him as with the grip of death. No human being can heal the soul that has done despite to the Spirit of Christ. Only through the Saviour can healing be obtained. . . .",
