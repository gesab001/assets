It is the song of Moses and the Lamb\u2014a song of deliverance. None but the hundred and forty-four thousand can learn that song; for it is the song of their experience\u2014an experience such as no other company have ever had. \u201cThese are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.\u201d These, having been translated from the earth, from among the living, are counted as \u201cthe first fruits unto God and to the Lamb.\u201d Revelation 15:2, 3; 14:1-5.\u2014GC 648, 649.",
