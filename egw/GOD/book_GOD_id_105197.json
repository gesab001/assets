    "word": "In thought, word, and deed show that you are abiding in Christ. Let your speech reveal this. Speech is a precious talent. Our words are to be words that God and the holy angels can hear with approval. Our minds are to be storehouses filled with the treasures of the Bible. Let the walls of memory's hall be hung with the treasures of God's word, with his precious promises. Store up these promises, that in time of need you may be able to give them to the weary and heavy laden. You are God's missionary just as soon as you take your stand under his banner. You are to be a laborer together with him.",
