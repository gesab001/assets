    "word": "Unwise generalship is an offense to God, because it involves many others in difficulties. The Lord proves and tests every man, to see whether he will deal wisely with the Master's goods. If he grasps in his arms all he can possibly obtain, to manage according to his own wisdom, if he uplifts himself as very wise, and neglects to take hold in the places where God's work is in the greatest need of help, he fails to do God's will. The heavenly universe watches his course with sadness; for he robs the Lord of the glory due to him, in establishing churches in new territories, and deprives his fellow workers of the means the Lord God designed should be given to them. \n                                                                           152",
