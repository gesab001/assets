    "word": "But the churches in Ohio needed a work done for them, for both ministers and people. Not one was qualified for the work but those who were daily learning in the school of Christ to be meek and lowly of heart. Many had fallen into a shallow, superficial way of thinking and working. There were envies, jealousies, evil surmisings, and evil speaking. Some were cherishing malice toward one another, and provoking one another by criticism and censure. They did not have a clear understanding of their individual relation to the work of God and their personal responsibility. They did not realize their own weakness and inefficiency in the great work for the salvation of souls. They did not consider that they were only inferior instruments, and that the great efficient Agent was God. The good accomplished was the result of divine power combined with human effort.",
