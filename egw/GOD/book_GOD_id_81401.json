    "word": "Bro. Andrews, you shrink from running risks. You are not willing to venture when you cannot see the way all clear. Yet some one must do this very work, and move by faith, or no advance moves would be made, and nothing would be accomplished. Your fear lest you shall make mistakes, and mismoves, and then be blamed, binds you. You should move according to your best judgment, trusting the result with God. Some one must do this, and it is a trying position for any one. One should not bear all this responsibility alone. This burden, with much reflection, and earnest prayer, should be equally shared. You excuse yourself from taking responsibility because you have made some mistakes in the past.",
