    "word": "If this Institution is what God designed it should be, as his instrumentality it will not copy any Institution in our land in its practices or moral standing. It will stand as a peculiar Institution, governed and controlled after the Bible standard. No motive will be of sufficient force to move those engaged here from the straight line of duty. It will be reformatory in all its teachings and practice. There will be no uniting in closer harmony with the world in order to receive worldly patronage. Those who are under the control of the Spirit of God will not be found seeking their pleasure or amusement. If Jesus presides in the Sanitarium, there will be a greater and more distinct separation from the world. Pleasure cannot entice from the way of justice. They will answer the injunction. Come out from among them and be separate, touching not the unclean, and in no wise partaking of sin. They will aim to reach the high, pure, noble, elevated standard erected by our Lord Jesus Christ. The world, in its practices, and ways, and manners, will have no attractions to entice from duty. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate.\" Will we hear the voice of God and obey? or will we make half way work in the matter, trying to serve God and mammon at the same time?",
