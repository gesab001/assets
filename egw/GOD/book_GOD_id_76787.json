    "word": "All Christ's followers have as deep an interest in this lesson as had the disciples who listened to his words. In the apostasy, man alienated himself from God. The separation is wide and fearful; but Christ has made provision again to connect us with himself. The power of evil is so identified with human nature that no man can overcome, except by union with Christ. Through this union we receive moral and spiritual power. If we have the spirit of Christ, we shall bring forth the fruits of righteousness, fruit that will honor and bless men, and glorify God.",
