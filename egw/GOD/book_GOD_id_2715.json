    "word": "The two parties represented by Cain and Abel will exist till the close of this earth\u2019s history. The well-doer, the obedient, does not war against the transgressor of God\u2019s holy law. But those who do not respect the law of God oppress and persecute other people. They follow their leader, who is an accuser of God and of those who are made perfect through obedience. . . . The spirit that leads people to accuse, condemn, imprison, and put to death other people has waxed strong in our world. It is this spirit that always works in the children of disobedience.\u2014Manuscript 136, 1899.",
