    "word": "When you begin to work with parliaments, that sets the devil to work, and if he cannot make the work hard for us, who can? Do not let your work be known any more than necessary. Let the truth work. Our best course is not to get up an exemption. God has given light that the least said about these things the better. The devil and all his hosts are working to destroy God's law, and when you begin to work on those lines he will stir up men to believe that we do not regard their laws, nor obey their decrees.",
