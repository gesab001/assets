    "word": "The Spirit of God is continually impressing the minds of men to seek for those things which alone will give peace and rest,--the higher, holier joys of Heaven. Christ, the Lord of life and glory, gave his life to redeem man from Satan's power. Our Saviour is constantly at work through influences seen and unseen to attract the minds of men from the unsatisfactory pleasures of this life to the priceless treasure which may be theirs in the immortal future.",
