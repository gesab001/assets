    "word": "It is a parent's duty to speak right words. Children should be taught to speak respectfully and lovingly to their parents. Day by day parents should learn in the school of Christ lessons from One that loves them. Then the story of God's everlasting love will be repeated in the home school of the tender flock. Thus, before reason is fully developed, children may catch a right spirit from their parents.",
