    "word": "\"An old man, about seventy or eighty years of age, was once brought to me, as a monument of God's mercy. I asked him how old he was. He looked at me for a little while, and then said in faltering tones, while the tears ran down his cheeks, 'I am two years old.' I expressed my surprise, and then he said, 'Ah, until two years ago I lived the life of a dead man. I never knew what it was to live until I met with the life that is hid with Christ in God.'\"--Letter 160, 1903.",
