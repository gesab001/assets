    "word": "They intend to leave here sometime in May. Will forward you the examination paper. I sent for it some time ago to send to you. Her father sends one of her brothers to attend the college. I promised to pay his tuition and board. He gives this young man to the cause. He was raised up \n\n\n                                    -25- \n\nfrom what they feared would be his deathbed. The father made a vow that if the Lord would spare his life, he would give him to the cause of God. He is an excellent young man. I have devoted all the royalty on foreign books to be used in the foreign missions. I thought I would place a fund in the office to be used for the purpose of educating choice young men to become laborers for their own country-men. This young man will come with his sister. They are a nice family.--Letter 9, 1887, pp. 3, 4. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, April 15, 1887.)",
