    "word": "We very much desire the help of Elder Littlejohn. God has not released him from the work. We very much desire that Elder Smith shall have the power of the grace of Christ with him at every step, that he shall have Christ as his counselor; for Satan will surely seek to leave upon his mind impressions that will be detrimental not only to his own soul but to the flock of God. He has had a part in the work almost from its very beginning. The third angel's message will triumph. [Oh] that Elder Smith may triumph with it, and may have the full assurance of God's approval in all his work. He is in danger of making wrong moves, and it will be, with his temperament, exceedingly hard for him to acknowledge that he has erred.",
