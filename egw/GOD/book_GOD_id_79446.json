    "word": "The work of publication was represented to me by the figure which Christ used, the vine. In the different branches of this great work, as in the branches of the vine, there is to be unity in diversity. This is God's plan, the principle that runs through the entire \n\n\n                    -21- \n\nuniverse. In God's wise arrangement there is diversity, and yet He has so related each part to others that all work in harmony to carry out His great plan in extending the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He hath sent. However there may appear to be dissimilarity, the work is one great whole, and bears the stamp of infinite wisdom. God and Christ are one, Christ and His disciples are one, we in Christ, and Christ in God. The Lord designs that His work shall move forward in perfect harmony without friction. Jesus said: \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" The branches are many and diverse, yet all are united in the parent stalk, and every branch, although separate, draws its sustenance from the vine stalk. \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Jesus Christ is in God, the great Masterpiece of infinite wisdom, and power, and sufficiency, from whom all the diversity springs. Each branch bears its burden of fruit, and all together make a harmonious whole, a complete, beautiful unity. This is harmony according to the Lord's order.",
