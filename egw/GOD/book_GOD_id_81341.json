    "word": "The perfection of God's work is as clearly seen in the tiniest insect as in the king of birds. The soul of the little child who believes in Christ is as precious in his sight as are the angels about his throne. \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.\" As God is perfect in his sphere, so man may be perfect in his sphere. Whatever the hand finds to do should be done with thoroughness and dispatch. Faithfulness and integrity in little things, the performance of little duties, and little deeds of kindness, will cheer and gladden the pathway of life; and when our work on earth is ended, every one of the little duties performed with fidelity, will be treasured as precious gem before God.",
