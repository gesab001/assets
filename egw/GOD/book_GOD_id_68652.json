    "word": "When the Lord weighs in the balances of the sanctuary the actions of those who have striven to be first, when they see how He regards such strife they will bow low at His footstool, ashamed of their course of action. All cannot be first, all cannot be masters. Walk humbly before God, acknowledging Him as your Master. It is a great misfortune to be unable to see in others higher excellencies and powers of greater usefulness than in yourself.",
