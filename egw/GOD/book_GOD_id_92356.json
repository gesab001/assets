    "word": "God is the proprietor of the universe. Every man, woman, and child, with all the time and talents that have been bestowed upon them, belongs to God, He has given ability to men that they may use it to His glory, and thus have increased ability, wisdom, and understanding. God has a claim upon every soul, and we are responsible agents and should give Him constant service. Body, soul, and spirit, we should consecrate ourselves to His service, and do those things that will forward His cause in the earth. We are to do His will upon the earth. Our pleasure is not to be consulted nor permitted to be the governing impulse.",
