    "word": "The physician should show that he carries the burden of the grave, solemn responsibility, as a physician, of the bodies and souls of the sick and suffering. Not a word of careless flippancy should escape his lips; not a word should be spoken having a tendency to awaken an impure thought; every thought, word or action should be avoided approaching to this. Nothing should be said to bring down the minds of any, or direct them in an impure channel. A pure, noble-minded, God-fearing physician keeps his own counsel; but novices who have no real experience in dealing with the bodies and souls of men will talk boastingly of their knowledge and their attainments, when they have no experimental knowledge in the business they have entered upon. What these youth need is a better knowledge of themselves; then they will become more intelligent in regard to their duty, and will understand that in every department where they may have to labor, they must possess a willing mind, an earnest spirit, and a hearty, unselfish zeal in trying to do others good. They will not study how best to preserve their dignity as physicians, but by thoughtfulness and care-taking will earn a reputation and gain the hearts of those whom they serve. The heart must be enlisted and all absorbed in the work. The disciplinary process is sometimes in \n\n\n                          -5- \n\nsmall matters, and is too often regarded as menial employment.",
