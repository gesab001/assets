    "word": "Chap. 18 - The Publication of Books by Ellen G. White\n\n     What Shall Be Published?--The question of what shall be published at the office must be viewed in the light of the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. The Lord's voice must be honored and obeyed. \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" The truth must not be placed in the background as it now is, for subjects of vast importance to the soul receive only a passing notice, while these objectionable things have the foreground. The workers overlook the great truths that would make them wise unto salvation. They do not see that daily they are to receive manna from the heavenly table, that they are to feed upon the Word of life, and so gain spiritual strength. They are now to store up, for the present and the future, supplies that will provide for the soul in times of emergency. They are to lay up in store the precious gold and silver and precious gems of the Word of God, jewels that will never perish.--Lt 31, 1891. (SpTPW 176, 177; SpTWWPP 46, 47.)",
