    "word": "But, Maria, if the Christian life has charms in it for you, and you see the sinfulness of sin and your lost condition out of Christ, I advise you to commence again in earnest. In meekness seek the Lord. You may be very distrustful of yourself, for you have reason to be. But God is true, and I advise you for your soul's sake to try again and earnestly seek to become a follower of Christ. This work no other can do for you. It is a solemn work between God and your own soul, which must bear the test of the Almighty.",
