    "word": "When people will acknowledge the claims of God by obedience, then they have a standard. If every individual would acknowledge the law, confusion would be swept away. We must do the will of God. They that do not accept the law, erect a standard of their own; and as there are many minds, diverse from each other, there will be many standards, and this will establish many doctrines. In this age we see determined efforts to ignore God's law, and consequently the doctrine will not be understood. But if we know and do God's will He will not leave us in darkness, but will lead us to know the doctrine and that will bring happiness. Obedience is the only course to take. When Christ taught His disciples He showed them the magnitude of the law by applying it to all our acts, and then showed our duty to our fellow men. The scribes and Pharisees murmured at Christ's teaching and accused Him of doing away with the law of His Father. With what astonishment they must have heard from His lips, \"Think not that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.\" Christ continued, \"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or \n\n\n                                    -101- \n\none tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" Matthew 5:17-20. He addresses these words to His disciples, and they will apply all the way down through the stream of time.",
