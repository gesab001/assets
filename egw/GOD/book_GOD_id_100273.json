    "word": "I am glad I attended both these meetings in Norwich and in Lynn. My testimony was greatly needed. I do not feel all the time that those who have known me and known the work that the Lord has given me to do, are seeking to counteract my labors in order that men and women who have not the least experience in connection with me or my work should not have faith. I \n                                                                           741\nexpect they will have prejudice. They will not all believe, but their doubts and unbelief cannot bring guilt upon themselves as can the doubts and unbelief of those who have known my going out and coming in, who have had the evidence of the Holy Spirit testifying to the messages God has given me, to treat them with such comparative indifference because they reprove their course of action and do not agree with their ideas. This looks to me like speaking against and denying the Holy Spirit.",
