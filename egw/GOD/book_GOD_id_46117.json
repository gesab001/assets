    "word": "THE FOUNDATION BY WHICH TO FIX FAITH IN THE MESSAGES WHICH GOD HAS SENT TO HIS PEOPLE, WILL BE MORE READILY FOUND IN THE STUDY OF HIS DEALINGS WITH HIS PROPHETS IN PAST AGES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE STUDY OF THE LIFE AND LABORS AND WRITINGS OF SAINT PAUL ARE MORE HELPFUL AND ILLUMINATING THAN ANY OTHER LINE OF STUDY WE MIGHT SUGGEST, AND I DO NOT THINK WE SHALL BE GREATLY HELPED IN ESTABLISHING CONFIDENCE IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL BY SEARCHING TO MAKE A LIST OF HIS HELPERS AND BY STUDY INTO THEIR HISTORY AND THEIR EXPERIENCE. IT IS EASY FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT JEREMIAH WAS DIRECTED OF GOD IN HIS SELECTION OF BARUCH AS A COPYIST; ALSO THAT PAUL HAD HEAVENLY WISDOM IN SELECTING THOSE WHO SHOULD ACT AS HIS AMANUENSIS FROM TIME TO TIME ACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS.",
