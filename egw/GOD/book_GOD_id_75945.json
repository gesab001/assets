    "word": "What are we to do in regard to this institution? We do not want to tear things to pieces. We must make the best of the situation. And the best thing for every one to do is to humble his soul before God. Let those who had no part in this movement unite with those who did act a part in it, in seeking the Lord's guidance. To those who took the responsibility on their own shoulders, we want to say, \"God in his mercy, for the sake of his cause, for his name's glory, will pardon your transgressions and your mistakes, if you will be converted, if you will humble your hearts before him.\" But to their associates who stand ready to plaster up the breach that has been made, by daubing it with untempered mortar, we say, Get out of the way; let God work upon your hearts; strive with all your might to bring the light of heaven upon your own souls.--Written in 1904. \n                                                                           27",
