    "word": "A Personal Knowledge of Christ \n\n     Every Christian teacher should have an intelligent understanding of what Christ is to him individually. He should know how to make the Lord his strength and efficiency, how to commit the keeping of his soul to God as unto a faithful Creator. From Christ proceeds all the knowledge essential to enable teachers to be workers together with God--knowledge which opens to them the widest fields of usefulness.",
