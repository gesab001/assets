    "word": "Brethren Daniells and Prescott placed themselves in line to do the very work the Lord assigned them in moving the publishing work from the Battle Creek to Washington, D.C. The Lord has greatly blessed them in every step they have taken in accordance with the light He has given them. His signature has been upon their work, and He will be with them still if they will continue to look steadfastly to Him as their teacher and their example. If they turn aside, as did Solomon, to work contrary to God's designs, then the Lord cannot cooperate with them.--MS 58, 1904.",
