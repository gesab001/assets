    "word": "We entreat the heralds of the gospel of Christ never to become discouraged in the work, never to regard the most hardened sinner as beyond the reach of the grace of God. Such may accept the truth in the love of it, and become the salt of the earth. He \n39\nwho turns the hearts of men as the rivers of water are turned, can bring the most selfish, sin-hardened soul to surrender to Christ. Is anything too hard for God to do? \u201cMy word,\u201d he says, \u201cshall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\u201d [Isaiah 55:11.]",
