    "word": "I have been much perplexed in regard to some matters that have been presented before me concerning the condition of things in some of our institutions. I sent you a copy of letters sent to Elder Olsen. I have been shown that you also are in danger of making serious mistakes. You feel a deep interest in the circulation of the health publications, and this is right; but that special branch is not to be made all-absorbing. The health reform is as closely related to the third angel's message as the arm to the body; but the arm cannot take the place of the body. The proclamation of the third angel's message, the commandments of God, and the testimony of Jesus, is the burden of our work. The message is to be proclaimed with a loud cry and is to go to the whole world. The presentation of health principles must be united with this message, but must not be independent of it or in any way take the place of it.",
