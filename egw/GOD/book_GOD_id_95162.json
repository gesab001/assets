    "word": "The Lord has declared that the work of advancing the truth shall go forth in His strength. Human wisdom is the gift of God; but often that wisdom is not expressed in word, in spirit, in character, as the wisdom of God. God is misrepresented in 1898 by those who have been as graciously enlightened as were the Israelites when Christ, enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, directed the movements of His people. He was their shadow from the heat, and their light amid the darkness of the night.",
