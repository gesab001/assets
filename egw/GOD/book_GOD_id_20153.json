    "word": "Some for whom you labor will wish to have the work done in their own way, thinking that their way is best; but if you have the spirit, the meekness of Christ, if you show respect and love for one another, God will enable you to perfect the work in a manner that will please him. Work for your own souls until self is subdued, until Christ recognizes his image in you. The most impressive lesson that you can give to those whom you educate, will be that of a Christ-like character.",
