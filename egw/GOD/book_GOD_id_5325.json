    "word": "For all in responsible positions I have a message spoken by the mouth of the Lord--the fifty-fifth chapter of Isaiah.  Study this chapter, and let not any human being consider that he is above his fellow workers because greater responsibilities are involved in his \n16\nbranch of the work.  If he is like Daniel, seeking for the power that comes alone from God, that he may represent, not himself, not his imperfections in selfish and fraudulent practices, but the truth in righteousness, he will not possess a vestige of pride or self-importance; but will be weighted with the spirit of wisdom from God.--Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 356, 357.",
