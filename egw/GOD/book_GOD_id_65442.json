    "word": "Christ the Revelation of God \n\n     In Christ the world beheld the invisible God. \"I am in the Father,\" He said, \"and the Father in Me.\" \"He \n                                                                           124\nthat hath seen Me hath seen the Father.\" \"If ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also: and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.\" In all our acts of true devotion we fix our eye of faith upon our Advocate, who is standing between man and the eternal throne, waiting to meet our every effort and by His Spirit assist us to a more perfect knowledge of God.",
