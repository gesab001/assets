    "word": "God wants men is His service, under His banner, to be strictly honest, unimpeachable in character, that their tongues shall not utter a semblance of untruth. The tongue must be true, the eyes must be true, the actions wholly and entirely such as God can commend. We are living in the sight of a holy God, who solemnly declares, \"I know thy works.\" The divine eye is ever upon us. We cannot cover one act of unjust deal from God. The witness of God to our every action is a truth which but few realize.--Letter 41, 1888, p. 2. (To \"Brethren and Sisters at Fresno,\" July 7, 1888.) \n\nReleased November 10, 1975.",
