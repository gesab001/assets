    "word": "After the crucifixion Nicodemus came to the cross, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes to embalm Christ\u2019s body. He had witnessed the cruel treatment of the priests; he had marked Christ\u2019s patience and Godlike bearing, even in His humiliation. He now saw more clearly the real character of the high priest, and he came boldly to take the bruised body of his Saviour, looked upon as the body of a malefactor. Thus he identified himself with Christ in His shame and death.",
