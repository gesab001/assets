    "word": "Were men permitted to have their will and their way with regard to their fellow-men, their brethren in the faith, we have had a representation of what would be if God's hand did not cover his people. Such positions I have never seen assumed by Seventh-day Adventists. I have been made to appreciate the value of the human soul, and have some little sense of how much one soul is valued by God. Then I have been shown how little man values the souls for whom Christ has \n                                                                           1633\ndied. A spirit that has ruined the faith and corrupted the principles of many has had a controlling power in the office of publication in Battle Creek, and to a large extent has pervaded the whole office. The little respect shown to some of those employed has done much harm. This spirit has been exercised toward men far more righteous than those in position of trust. Again and again my soul has been agonized beyond expression over these things, as they have been transacted before me. You have departed far out of the way. By unfair practices you have perverted your sense of righteousness. The love of self predominates, and the love of Christ is almost extinguished.",
