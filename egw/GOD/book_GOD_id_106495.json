    "word": "Over and over again the Lord has presented before me the pioneer work that must be done in new fields. In past years I have shared with others the burden of establishing His work in important centers.

We have always gone forward, plowing our way through prejudice. From the first, every effort has been made to find and to make public the mistakes of God's servants placed in trying positions, --mistakes greatly magnified, that many have taken up and used to discourage the workers and to retard the progress of the cause, when they should have interestedly put their shoulder to the wheel to help lift the load.",
