    "word": "I saw that those who sow error cannot root it up in years. They may perhaps change their course of action, \n\n\n                                     -376- \n\nbut never can they bend or change the minds of those whom they have influenced in the wrong. Their errors are growing in the minds of others, and if Jesus is so merciful as to blot out the transgressions of those who have sown this seed and save them, they will suffer loss; they can but save their own souls. Their course has wounded the cause of God and brought shame upon the name of Jesus, and this is not easily wiped away. It lives in the minds of many.",
