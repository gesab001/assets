    "word": "The young women make advances to the young men and get up a flirtation with them. Their forwardness, their common, cheap talk and ways, are offensive to God, and I told them last Sabbath that they were fast becoming like the Sodomites. And yet they profess to be Christians. What a good, gracious Lord we have to bear with such mockery of the Christian name and such perversity of character. I am disgusted and afflicted for my Saviour that those who claim to represent His character are being led and controlled by the wily foe, the great adversary of God and man.",
