    "word": "Said the king of Nineveh, \"Let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not? And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that He had said that He would do unto them; and He did it not\" [Jonah 3:8-10]. Read this over carefully, and if the Lord [should] trust you with His work, I have not a word of objection. This is all I can say to you.",
