    "word": "I am anxious about you. I hope you will get someone to stand by your side, even if he falls short of the highest standard. Better let some things be done less thoroughly than to be crushed by the burden and be laid under the sod. You must consider that if you should fail and fall the people would have to do without you altogether. How much better for you to do only that part of the work which you can do safely and preserve your God-given powers for future labor. You know that there will be just as much call for you tomorrow and next week as today, and so it will be as long as life lasts. I think that you, a physician, ought to understand yourself, and adjust the work to the man, instead of allowing the work to overpower you because there is so much of it. May the Lord enable you to see the matter as it is and feel the necessity of observing the laws of life and health. You are drawing altogether too fast upon your capital.",
