Each Member to Work in His Appointed Place.--[1 Corinthians 12:4-6, 12 quoted.] The vine has many branches, but though all the branches are different, they do not quarrel. In diversity there is unity. All the branches obtain their nourishment from one source. This is an illustration of the unity that is to exist among Christ's followers. In their different lines of work they all have but one Head. The same Spirit, in different ways, works through them. There is harmonious action, though the gifts differ. Study this chapter. You will see from it that the man who is truly united with Christ will never act as though he were a complete whole in himself. . . .  {6BC 1090.11}  \n     The perfection of the church depends not on each member being fashioned exactly alike. God calls for each one to take his proper place, to stand in his lot to do his appointed work according to the ability which has been given him (Letter 19, 1901).  {6BC 1090.12}  \n     Two Chapters to Be Memorized.--The 12th and 13th chapters of 1st Corinthians should be committed to memory, written in the mind and heart.

The figure of the members which compose the body represents the church of God and the relation its members should sustain to one another (MS 82, 1898).  {6BC 1090.13}  \n     27.
