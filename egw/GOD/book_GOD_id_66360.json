    "word": "I beseech of you by the mercies of God that you lean wholly upon Jesus Christ. In the place of turning your eyes to Battle Creek, turn your eyes to heaven, and call upon God. It is a terrible education that our people have been receiving, to ask counsel of man instead of going to God, the source of all wisdom, grace, and efficiency. His church is married to Him, and is to become a sharer in His kingdom, a joint heir with Jesus Christ. The joint heir has the assurance that he shall be loved as God loves His Son.",
