    "word": "[P.S.] Brother Christiansen, in the night season I was talking with you. The Lord has given me a message for you. I had been writing to a \n\n\n                                    -87- \n\nbrother whose case had been presented to me, and after writing to him, I was informed by my guide that your case was similar to his, and that I was to bear a message to you also. Words were spoken to me which were to be impressed upon your mind. You were to be informed of the fact that the grace of God was provided in ample measure for you to obtain victories over all sin, that you might have the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. I commit to you this message in the name of Jesus who has given me this work to do in saving perishing souls.--Letter 11a, 1894. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C.
