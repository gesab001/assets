    "word": "\"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us\" [verse 7]. Have we received a bright thought?

If anyone tells you you have preached a good sermon, tell him the devil told you that before he did, and for him not to be an agent for \n\n\n                                      -100- \n\nthe devil. There is pride in our hearts that must be emptied out, and then Jesus Christ will come in and take possession of our whole heart.",
