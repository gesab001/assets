    "word": "Great dangers threatened the Reformation; but its advocates still trusted their cause with God, and pledged themselves to be firm to the gospel. They determined to prepare a statement of their views in systematic form, with the evidence from the Scriptures, to present before the Diet; and the task was committed to Luther, Melancthon, and their associates. The Confession thus prepared was accepted by the Protestants as an exposition of their faith, and they assembled to affix their names to the important document. It was a solemn and trying time, The Reformers were solicitous that their cause should not be confounded with political questions; they felt that the Reformation should exercise no other influence than that which proceeds from the word of God. As the Christian princes advanced to sign the Confession, Melancthon interposed, saying, \"It is for the \n                                                                           166\ntheologians and ministers to propose these things, while the authority of the mighty ones of earth is to be reserved for other matters.\" \"God forbid,\" replied John of Saxony, \"that you should exclude me. I am resolved to do my duty without being troubled about my crown. I desire to confess the Lord. My electoral hat and robes are not so precious to me as the cross of Jesus Christ.\" Having thus spoken, he wrote down his name. Said another of the princes as he took the pen, \"If the honor of my Lord Jesus Christ requires it, I am ready to leave my goods and life behind me.\" \"Rather would I renounce my subjects and my States, rather would I quit the country of my fathers, staff in hand,\" he continued, \"than to receive any other doctrine than is contained in this Confession.\" Such was the faith and daring of those men of God.",
