    "word": "Ridicule Debases the Soul--Caviling, ridicule, and misrepresentation can be indulged in only at the expense of the debasement of your own souls.  The use of such weapons does not gain precious victories for you, but rather cheapens the mind, and separates the soul from God.  Sacred things are brought down to the level of the common, and a condition of things is created that pleases the prince of darkness, and grieves away the Spirit of God.",
