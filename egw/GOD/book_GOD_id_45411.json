    "word": "A Question Raised in Early Ministry.--What if you had said ever so much, would that affect the visions that God gives me? If so, then the visions are nothing. . . . What you or anyone else has said is nothing at all. God has taken the matter in hand. . . . What you have said, Sister D, influenced me not at all. My opinion has nothing to do with what God has shown me in vision.-- Letter 6, 1851.",
