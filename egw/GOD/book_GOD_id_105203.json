    "word": "We are God's little children, but let us not forget that he expects us to grow up to the full stature of men and women in Christ. Let us talk of God's goodness and tell of his power, putting away gloom and unbelief. Let us talk faith. God wants us to be strong in his strength. He died to save us, and he wants us to reach the high standard that he holds before us.",
