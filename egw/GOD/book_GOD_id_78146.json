    "word": "What a scene is this! I pass over the ground again and again, bowed down in an agony that no tongue can express, as I see the end of the many, many who have refused to receive their Saviour. Justice will take the throne, and the arm strong to save will show itself strong to smite and destroy the enemies of the kingdom of God. Christ will lay bare the motives and deeds of every one. Every hidden action will stand out as clearly before the doer as if proclaimed before the universe. \n\n\n                                   Ellen G. White. \n\nSanitarium, Cal., Oct. 1, 1903. \n\nM. H. R.--12--S--4.",
