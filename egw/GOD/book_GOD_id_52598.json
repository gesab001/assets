    "word": "JEHOSHAPHAT'S PRAYER GIVES THE TRUE IDEA OF THE RELATION OF THAT LAND TO THE SANCTUARY: \"ART NOT THOU OUR GOD, WHO DIDST DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND BEFORE THY PEOPLE ISRAEL, AND GAVEST IT TO THE SEED OF ABRAHAM THY FRIEND FOREVER? AND THEY DWELT THEREIN, AND HAVE BUILT THEE A SANCTUARY THEREIN FOR THY NAME.\" 2 CHRONICLES 20:7, 8. THIS CORRESPONDS TO THE ORDER IN EXODUS 25:8: \"AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY; THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG THEM.\" IN THIS SAME BOOK IS GIVEN A MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF THE SANCTUARY, ITS ERECTION, AND APPROVAL BY THE LORD. THE PROCESS OF CLEANSING THE SANCTUARY IS DESCRIBED IN LEVITICUS 16. WHEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL POSSESSED CANAAN, SOLOMON BUILT A TEMPLE, IN WHICH WAS A HOLY AND A MOST HOLY PLACE, AND THE VESSELS OF THE MOVABLE SANCTUARY, WHICH WAS MADE IN THE DESERT OF ARABIA, WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE TEMPLE. THIS WAS THEN THE SANCTUARY,--THE DWELLING-PLACE OF GOD'S GLORY UPON THE EARTH. EVEN A PARTIAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE SCRIPTURES ON THIS SUBJECT WILL JUSTIFY ALL THAT THE AUTHOR HAS SAID IN REFERENCE TO IT IN PAGES 260-67. \n                                                                           499",
