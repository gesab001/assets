Because all our power is derived from Christ, these offerings are to flow from us to God. They are to keep ever before us the claim of redemption, the greatest of all claims, and the one that involves every other. The realization of the sacrifice made in our behalf is ever to be fresh in our minds, and is ever to exert an influence on our thoughts and plans. Christ is to be indeed as one crucified among us.",
