    "word": "The ark was to the Jewish people all that the Bible is to be to us. In the Bible are gathered the testimonies of divine truth we are ever to keep before our minds. We are to study the Word of God in the way pointed out in the sixth chapter of John. \"He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood,\" Christ said, \"dwelleth in Me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by me... It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" \n\n\n                               -58-",
