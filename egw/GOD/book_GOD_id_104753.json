    "word": "From time to time reports come to me concerning statements that Sister White is said to have made, but which are entirely new to me, and which cannot fail to mislead the people as to my real views and teaching. A sister, in a letter to her friends, speaks with much enthusiasm of a statement by Brother _____, that Sister White had seen that the time had come when, if we hold the right relation to God, all can have the gift of prophecy to the same extent as do those who are now having visions. Where is the authority for this statement? I must believe that the sister failed to understand Brother _____, for I cannot think that he made the statement. The writer continues: \"Brother_____said last night that is the case, not that God will speak to all for the benefit of every one else, but to each for his own benefit, and this will fulfil the prophecy of Joel. He stated that this is already being developed in numerous instances. He spoke as if he thought none would hold such a leading position as Sister White had done, and will still do. Referred to Moses as a parallel. He was a leader, but many others are referred to as prophesying, though their prophecies are not published. He, (Brother _____), will not give permission to have the matter copied for general circulation that has been read here from some sister. I wonder if you have seen one of these visions? They represent us as in the closing moments of time, with hours all in the past, and it is moments now. How solemn!\"",
