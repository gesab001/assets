    "word": "Wherever the truth goes, the people should be given instruction in the preparation of healthful foods. God desires that in every place the people shall be taught to use the products that can be readily obtained. Skilful teachers should show the people how to prepare the products that they can raise or secure in their section of the country. Thus the poor, as well as those in better circumstances, can learn to live healthfully.",
