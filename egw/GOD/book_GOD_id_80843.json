    "word": "You do not know how to use money economically, and do not learn to bring your wants within your income. Your spend thrift habits are a snare to you. The Lord has warned you, but your habits of prodigality have taken such a hold upon you that his cautions and warnings have been alike unheeded. Your wife, while she may be a help to you in many things, does not help you as she should in this respect. In order to live the life \n\n\n                           [71] \n\nof a true disciple of Christ, you must day by day deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow your self-denying, self-sacrificing Redeemer. You have not yet learned the lesson of meekness and lowliness in the school of Christ. You have an eager desire to get money, that you may freely use it as your inclination shall dictate; and your teaching and example have proved a curse to your children. How little they care for principle! They are more and more forgetful of God, less fearful of his displeasure, more impatient of restraint. The more easily money is obtained the less thankfulness is felt.",
