    "word": "Bring a new meaning into your life and work. Represent Jesus in character. You both need this transformation before you are fitted for the work of God. If you will make the most of your God-given capabilities, and walk and work in the spirit of the Master, your life may even now be made a glorious success. The Lord would have you and your family, if you work with a purpose now, and you may receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for all those that love His appearing.--Letter 23, 1890, pp. 19,20.
