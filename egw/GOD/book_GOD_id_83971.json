    "word": "I inquire of my brethren, What are you doing for the colored people, who as it were, are in the very shadow of your doors? Why do not your enterprises embrace those who have suffered so greatly through oppression? God claims of our brethren in America much more than they render to Him in service. They are to work in behalf of those who cannot help themselves. Christ declared, \"If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto Me.\" He is doing this work, but He calls upon old and young, men, women, and youth, to cooperate with Him. While Christ draws, those who have tasted of the word of life must draw with Christ. Human instrumentalities must cooperate with the divine intelligences.--Ms 101, 1898, p. 1. (General Manuscript, \"Draw With Christ,\" dated August 23, 1898.)",
