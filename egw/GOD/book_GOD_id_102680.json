    "word": "The people who have braved out their rebellion will fill the description given in Revelation 6:15-17. In these very caves and dens they find the very statement of truth in the letters and in the publications as witnesses against them. The shepherd who leads the sheep in false paths will hear the charge made against them, \"It was you who made light of the truth. It was you who told us that God's law was abrogated, that it was a yoke of bondage. It was you who voiced the false doctrines when I was convicted that these Seventh-day Adventists had the truth. The blood of our souls is upon your priestly garments. The persecution brought upon those who kept God's commandments did not destroy them or their influence. I could not read my Bible with its condemnatory words, and I laid it aside. Now will you pay the ransom for my soul. You said you would stand between my soul and God, but you are now full of anguish yourself. What shall we do who listened to your garbling of the Scriptures and your turning into a lie the truth that if obeyed would have saved us?",
