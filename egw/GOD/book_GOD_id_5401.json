    "word": "I have been shown that yourself and Elder Haskell must at your age be laying the burdens on others.  Attend fewer camp meetings, speak and work less at the campmeetings you attend, and this will force others to the front to be obtaining an experience which is essential for them.  In order to do this, you must do less and others must do more.  We want the help of every one of the old hands and the work is, I have been shown, growing more and more important.  We want these experienced men as counselors.  We cannot spare them.  This is not the voice of Sister White but it is the message to you from God.  Will you heed it, both of you?  Will you be prudent?  Will you be managers and work less?--Letter 117, 1886, p. 6 (June 25, 1886, to Brother Butler. Ages: Butler, 52; Haskell 53).",
