    "word": "Be clothed with true humility, I now ask you like an humble disciple. Come and learn just the ideas advanced, and then in the fear of God take your Bible not other men's ideas, but with much prayer, ask God to teach you. Take on no consequential feelings, but as a learner come to the Scriptures. You know but little yet what there is to be learned out of God's word. We are to set no stakes, thus far is my boundary. Your souls are of value with God. You need to put on Christ and be clothed with humility. Remember the declarations in the word of God. \"The high and lofty One who inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.\" Isaiah 57:15. \n                                                                           532",
