    "word": "We want to be so wrapped up in Jesus Christ that our faith and confidence will show to others that, verily you will do as Jesus did, and you will have that humility, that sympathy, that brokenness of spirit that shows that the spirit of Jesus has been working on your heart. Thus you will have the truth that is in Christ Jesus, and our work will be covered all over and lighted up with the love of God. We should let the love of Christ prompt us for work. Too often our workers labor for souls as though they were making a great sacrifice for someone they may be doing missionary work for; they do not act as though they were doing it for Jesus. When a soul is converted, we do not rejoice one-half enough. How much gratitude do you send back to heaven for the conversion of a soul; when that soul is brought in living connection with heaven? \n\n\n                -52- \n\nNow, I beseech of you, brethren and sisters, do not sleep at your posts. Remember, you are fit servants of Christ. You are not to be filled with jealousy, evil surmisings, envy, and all that; but you are to act as though you are doing Christ's work.",
