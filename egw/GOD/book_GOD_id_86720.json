    "word": "That surface religion talked of so glibly by the tongue that prates of the beautiful, I have learned the value of to my sorrow. Many who with flippant words are ever ready to speak of elevation and refinement do not act as though they had any practical knowledge of that which their tongues express. Their poetical religion is not the religion that will stand test and trial.

To exalt a theory which will exalt self is their great ambition. To conform to the divine plan does not suit their frothy ideas.",
