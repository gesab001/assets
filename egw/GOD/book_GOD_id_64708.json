    "word": "When conversion of the youth shall be the great burden upon the hearts of the parents and teachers, efforts will constantly be made to discipline the character, to direct the tastes and desires in the heavenly channel. Every soul is capable of being built up in solid virtues. Each soul may reach heights, depths, and breadths of knowledge in spiritual things, and be fitted for the higher life. When parents take the first steps, making their own habits and practices in eating, dressing, and living, as simple and natural as possible, with an eye single to the glory of God, there will be order in the home, and the children will not be neglected; but time will be devoted to their instruction and development.",
