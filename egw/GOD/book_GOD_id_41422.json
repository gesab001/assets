    "word": "Pacific Press to Stand Independent in God.--God would have had the Pacific Press Publishing House stand free and clear, and untrammeled by any power. God would have every one of His institutions rise above the frosty atmosphere in which the human agent will be if left to himself. Inclined to live and breathe, he must live and breathe in the holy, pure, life-giving atmosphere of heaven, else sentiments and plans and resolutions will clog and impede our heavenly advance movements.--Lt 35a, 1895.",
