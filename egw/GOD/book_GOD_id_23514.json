    "word": "Chapter 5 -- Christ\u2019s Second Coming\n\nA SMALL, BLACK CLOUD IS THE SIGN OF JESUS\u2019 COMING.\u2014Soon there appears in the east a small black cloud, about half the size of a man\u2019s hand. It is the cloud which surrounds the Saviour and which seems in the distance to be shrouded in darkness. The people of God know this to be the sign of the Son of man. In solemn silence they gaze upon it as it draws nearer the earth, becoming lighter and more glorious, until it is a great white cloud, its base a glory like consuming fire, and above it the rainbow of the covenant. Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror.\u2014GC 640, 641.",
