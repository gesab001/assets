    "word": "We long to see all who have not discerned the light to discern truth and righteousness and keep gathering and cherishing every divine ray of light. The grace of God is needed to give to every soul who asks of God a deep and increasing interest in the knowledge of His Word. Spiritual things are spiritually understood by cultivating the habit of deep attention. We are to dig for the truth as for hidden treasures. That which once possessed no special interest will open to the mind of the diligent seeker and the hidden pearls of truth will reward his faith. \n                                                                           874",
