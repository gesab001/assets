    "word": "Avoid Controversy\n\n     Lessons should be taught in the Sabbath-school that will shed light into the chambers of heart and mind. And that this may be accomplished, the teachers must be under the influence of the Holy Spirit, that all selfishness may be subdued, that no hasty word may be spoken, no inconsiderate action may be performed, but that the grace of God may be manifested as working with human effort for the salvation of souls. This should be the great end of Sabbath-school work. The Sabbath-school should not be made a place for controversy; it is not the place to make differences of opinion manifested. Let all this kind of work be kept out of \n52\nthe school, and let harmony be maintained. If ideas are advanced that are questioned by members of the school, let not a combative spirit arise and discussion and controversy follow.",
