    "word": "Your French brethren in that section are not refined and intelligent and because Brethren Taylor's and Whipple's families do not come right down to them to make much of them and supply their wants, they become jealous and dissatisfied and think themselves misused. If Brethren Taylor and Whipple should take the whole burden of these brethren upon themselves, their own families must be neglected and suffer, while they would only hurt the French people. If they should be helped, they would only look for more help from the same direction and would not depend upon their own efforts. God does not require this church to take the charge of every poor family who shall embrace the message. If they should do this, the work of the messengers to enter new fields must cease for the fund would be exhausted. Many are poor from their own lack of diligence and economy and they know not how to use means aright. If they should be helped, it would only hurt them. Poor people choose to raise large families when they know they have nothing to support them and \n\n\n                                    -415- \n\nworse than this, no family government leave their children to come up to ruin. Who must be the sufferers in this case? Must the cause of God be sapped and the treasury in different places exhausted to take care of these large families of (the) poor? No, the parents must suffer. They will suffer no more after they embrace the Sabbath than they suffered before.",
