    "word": "You ask in regard to the work of Brother Rogers. The light that has been given me is that, with good helpers, Brother Rogers would be an excellent man to work out the Huntsville School problem.

I can see light in Brother Rogers\u2019 being connected with the Huntsville School as a general helper. But it often happens that men filling such positions are depended on to do the work, while those who are more closely connected with the school fail to do their utmost to improve their capabilities, to make steady advancement, holding every inch they gain.",
