    "word": "Have you fully consecrated yourself to the Lord? Feel every day, \"I am doing my work for God. I am not living for myself, to glorify myself, but to glorify God.\" Oh, trust in Jesus and not in your own heart. Cast your burdens and yourself upon Him. If you feel no joy, no consolation, do not be discouraged. Hope and believe. You may have a precious experience in the things of God. Wrestle with your discouragements and doubts until you gain the victory over them in Jesus' name. Do not encourage grief, despondency, and darkness. Cast your burden upon Jesus and be sure not to withhold yourself.",
