    "word": "We must keep the standard uplifted. God is not slack in the fulfillment of His promises. He is jealous for His name's glory. A whole heaven of resources are at His command. Seasons of prayer are essential. We all need to pray more, and to watch unto prayer. Read the first chapter of second Thessalonians. I present this entire chapter as appropriate for your case. I speak to you in love, for my heart is full of tender compassion in your behalf. You will have trial, but ever guard your soul, that you may not dishonor your Lord who has bought you with a price. He will that you should have strong faith and a lively hope. He wants you to improve in order and discipline and courage and fortitude and love for one another, that you may seek to help one another to keep the law of God, and be blessed. \n                                                                           47",
