This \n\n\n                                    -379- \n\ncharge is for all who are acting a part in the ministry, [all] who are following the example of Christ. They must snatch the opportunities as they come. Let all be fully prepared to disseminate the light by word and by pamphlet. There should be hundreds of little tracts scattered as the leaves of autumn.",
