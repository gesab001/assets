    "word": "Christ is represented by those whom He sends forth to work for Him; therefore those who oppose His ministers are opposing Him. This is just as verily the case when those who claim to have an experience in the things of God pursue a course that hinders and afflicts one of God's servants, by misstatements and false charges, setting themselves up as judges of his course of action, which they claim to understand, but which has been misrepresented to them, and which, therefore, they do not understand.",
