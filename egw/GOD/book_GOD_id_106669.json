    "word": "At the time of the last General Conference, the Lord instructed me to have no interviews with Dr. Kellogg. I was warned that he would say things that were not true, in order to uphold his positions; and that he would misreport to his associates the words I might speak. I felt it my duty to declare to him, in the presence of the leading brethren, including his medical associates, many things that the Lord has presented to me. I felt a deep interest in him, and I believed that he would take a right position and save himself by breaking his heart before God.",
