    "word": "A Question for Every Teacher and Scholar \n\n     In studying the Scriptures, in  manifesting an unselfish interest in others, in doing those things that will please the Saviour, you will grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour. Let every teacher and scholar ask, \"What can I do that can be counted as good service to Him who has died that I might live?\" The Master gives this answer, \"Seek and save that which is lost.\" You are to work in Christ's way, with patience, with interest, with determination that you will not feel discouraged as you work for time and eternity, believing that Jesus can do much through human ability consecrated to His service. What higher privilege could we desire than to be laborers together with God, making the most of our entrusted powers, that this very work may be accomplished?",
