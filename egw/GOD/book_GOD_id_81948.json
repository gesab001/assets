For a time, the prospect looked forbidding; nevertheless, the plantation was secured, and the work was begun. The Lord would have the influence of this school widely extended by means of the establishment of small mission schools in needy settlements in the hills, where consecrated teachers may open the Scriptures to hungry souls, and let the light of life shine forth to those that are in darkness.",
