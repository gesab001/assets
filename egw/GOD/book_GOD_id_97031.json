    "word": "God has workmen. They carry the work so far and they can carry it no further, because it is just as natural for the mold of man to be placed upon man as it is to breathe. Now, God calls upon another workman to come right in and advance that work. The one that was working becomes circumscribed. He cannot see that the very line of work that he is working in is not to be \n\n\n                                    -124- \n\npursued to the very close of time. There has to be more light and power infused into the work than we have had. There are workmen to come and carry that work upward and forward. That breaks up the old mold that would be an injury to them, and which would have crippled their experience and advance. But this mold has got to be taken off. The mold of man, the peculiarities of man, are stamped upon it, and it comes to be deified by all those that receive of his labor. Now there comes in another element that takes the old mold off. This work is to be carried upward and forward, and the building is to go up. Thus God has worked with His workmen; He buried the workmen, but the work progresses still.",
