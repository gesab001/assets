    "word": "The Lord was testing and proving men. O, if they had been divested of self, if they had turned from the course of selfishness, and, as God's peculiar people, had chosen to carry out his wise and gracious purposes, what a blessing would have resulted, not only to the individuals themselves, but to their families and to the church and the institutions that God had established. But alas, instead of obeying the voice of God, listening to the warnings and admonitions he had given, they gave heed to the counsels of their own hearts, and to words from the lips of men. Thus they imperiled not only their own souls, but the souls of others through their influence.",
