It is time for much to be accomplished in Europe. A large work, such as has been done in America, can be done in Europe. Let sanitariums be established there. Let hygienic restaurants be started. Let the light of present truth shine forth from the press. Let the work of translating our books go forward. I have been shown that in foreign countries many lights will be kindled.",
