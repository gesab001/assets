    "word": "Here we are taught that finite man is not to be placed where God should be. He is not to be honored as a god, or to be bowed down to. \"Worship Him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\" The man of sin is worshiped in the person of the pope, and his representative, the cardinal. But God has not given this power to pope or prelate. The pope is not regarded by God as anything more than a man who is acting out in our world the character of the man of sin, representing in his claims that power and authority which Satan claimed in the heavenly courts.",
