    "word": "We have held our meetings in a loft above the sawmill, and there the furniture and all kinds of things used in the school gave it the appearance \n\n\n                                     -368- \n\nof an auction room. I am feeling sad, so very sad, that I should have consented to this. If the Lord will pardon my transgression, I will by His grace, in every place where I shall labor, make the spiritual rather than the temporal necessities of the first importance. I am so sorry as I realize that I have neglected this work, which should be first, until the last. The dearth of means was my excuse, but I ought to have walked by faith. I have not honored God as I should have done had I moved out in faith notwithstanding seeming impossibilities.",
