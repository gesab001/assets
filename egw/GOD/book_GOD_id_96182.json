    "word": "It was to make this vast treasure house of all good available that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. He sprinkled every gift with His own blood, making it one by this act. The richest gift, the most costly sacrifice, was selected by God to come to the world as His expression of the love of God to man. The gift of God to our world in sending Jesus is an exhibition of His grace which God Himself cannot surpass. While we live in this world, there will be new developments and the extensive glory of the great love He had for the souls He has created even in this world. But that love will be extending and expanding before the saints in light, and in characters of new and increasing interest, seen and joyously realized throughout eternity.",
