    "word": "God's people are justified through the administration of the \"better covenant,\" through Christ's righteousness. A covenant is an agreement by \n\n\n                                       -54- \n\nwhich parties bind themselves and each other to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Thus the human agent enters into agreement with God to comply with the conditions specified in His Word. His conduct shows whether or not he respects these conditions.",
