    "word": "We are years behind. Let the missionaries obey orders from their great Captain and put life and energy into the work; God will give the power of His Holy Spirit. The fields in Europe do not require so great a change in the manner of working from the way in which the work is done in America, as they \n\n\n                                     -9- \n\nrequire an element of energy and renovation that will surprise and startle the people from their sleepy lethargy. They need the quickening, vitalizing power of the Holy Spirit, which will alone be efficient, and will speed the work in rapid movements. The Lord is not asleep, if England is. The Lord will give success to His work when His workers arouse to the emergency of the situation. Tares were sown among the wheat while men slept, and unless there is an earnest pushing forward of the work, it will never assume the proportions that God designed it should assume.",
