Oh, that each soul may inquire, How much of my service has been really the result of close connection with God and communion with Him in heavenly places? Is my testimony and teaching like that of the beloved John, the outflow of a heart deeply impressed by what I have heard and seen with my eyes, and looked upon and handled of the Word of life?",
