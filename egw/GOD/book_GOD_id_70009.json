    "word": "We are commanded to \u201csearch the scriptures.\u201d The whole Word of God is our rule of action. We are to carry out its principles in our daily lives; there is no surer mark of Christianity than this. We must carry out the great principles of justice and mercy in our relations with one another. We must be daily cultivating those qualities that will fit us for the society of heaven. If we do these things, God becomes our surety, and promises to bless all that we undertake; and we \u201cshall never be moved.\u201d\u2014Signs of the Times, Feb. 7, 1884.",
