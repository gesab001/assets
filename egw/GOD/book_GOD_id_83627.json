    "word": "At family prayer the Lord wrought. I called for a decision, commencing at Bell, who is possessed of much influence in the family. . . .I set before her the case and she decidedly assented to take her stand under Christ's banner. Alex is about seventeen years old. I then asked him if he would confess Christ and enlist in His service. He decided he would. Then Victoria, a noble girl about fifteen years old, as I put the question to her, answered promptly, \"I will be a Christian.\" Charlotte, the cook for the family, is very silent, scarcely saying anything. I addressed her and she responded; so here were four in that family who decided to help the mother and the sister Martha in maintaining the religious services in the family. . . . We had a precious season of prayer. We dedicate this home to God. Martha prayed, the mother of the children prayed, and Emily prayed. Our hearts were made joyful in God.--Ms 82, 1893, pp . 2-6. (Diary, July 27 to Aug. 7, 1893. With the Brown Family at Long Point, N.Z.)",
