    "word": "God, the everlasting Father, gave His only begotten Son to the world, that all who come to him might have everlasting life. And in this gift he opened to us a channel of the richest and most inexhaustible treasures. This sacred theme should be the food of our minds. With this bread of life we should satisfy our soul-hunger. If we do this, we can not hunger for worldly excitement or grandeur. Our religious experience is of exactly the same quality as the food we give our minds.",
