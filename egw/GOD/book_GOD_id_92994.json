    "word": "To those who receive Christ He gives power to become the sons of God, in order that they may be transformed into His likeness. His followers must reveal Him in speech, in spirit, in obedience to His law, in long patience, in love, in conformity to His will in all things. They are to show forth His character in love and patience toward those who are faulty. They are to seek to restore, and not to destroy, ever manifesting a heavenly love toward every erring fellow being. Their own personality is to be submerged in the personality of Christ, as revealed in their words and actions.",
