    "word": "In quoting the scripture Satan left out a very important point, . . . \"to keep thee in all thy ways\" (Psalm 91:11). In consenting to do Satan's bidding, Christ would be venturing into Satan's ways, not in ways that God had devised for His Son. That was a dare, and Satan's agents are full of presumptuous dares to get a chance to work his will with those who will accept his dare. But Christ would not accept the dare of Satan. Christ would not enter into controversy with the arch deceiver and tempter. He said, \"It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\" . . .",
