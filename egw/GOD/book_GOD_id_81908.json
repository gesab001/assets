    "word": "\"The cross of Christ,--how many believe it to be what it is? How many bring it into their studies, and know its true significance? There could not be a Christian in our world without the cross of Christ. Then keep it before the schools as the foundation of all true education. Turn from the examples of the world, cease to extol the professedly great men; turn the mind from the glory of everything save the cross of Christ. Said Paul, 'God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.'\"--Youth's Instructor, July 7, 1898, art. \"God's Word our Study Book.\"",
