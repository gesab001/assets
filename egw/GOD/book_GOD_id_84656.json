    "word": "The Bible is so precious to me. The more I read it, the more light in Christian experience I gain. God's Word seems to be written purposely for me. In it a balm is provided for all my fears and worries. I love my Saviour because I believe His Word and many others have this same experience.--Ms 152, 1898, p. 2. (Notes of travel. Typed November 20, 1898.)",
