    "word": "That God who marks the fall of a sparrow, marks your deportment and your feelings; He marks your envy, your prejudice, your attempt to justify your action in the least matter of injustice.

When it is evident that your feelings are incorrect, do you try just as diligently to remove the erroneous impressions as you did to make them? . . .",
