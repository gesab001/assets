    "word": "Neither wicked men nor devils can hinder the work of God or shut out his presence from his people, if they will, with subdued, contrite hearts, confess and put away their sins, and in faith claim his promises. Every temptation, every opposing influence, whether open or secret, may be successfully resisted, \u201cnot by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d [Zechariah 4:6.]",
