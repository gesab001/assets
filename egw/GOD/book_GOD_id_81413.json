    "word": "If one faculty is suffered to remain dormant, or turned out of its proper direction, the purpose of God is not carried out. The faculties should be all well developed. Care should be given to each, for they have a mutual bearing upon each other, and must all be exercised that the mind be properly balanced. If one or two organs are cultivated, and in continual use, because it is the choice to put the strength of the mind in one direction, to the neglect of other powers of the mind, your children will come to maturity with unbalanced minds, and they will not have harmonious characters. They will be apt and strong in one direction, and greatly deficient in other directions just as important. They will not be competent men and women. Their deficiencies will be marked, and mar the entire character.",
