    "word": "I have written a letter to Leroy Nicola by lamplight this evening, in response to a humble confession sent to me two months since. He confesses his sin in taking the position he did in Minneapolis, and holding it so long without making confession. He makes full confession and I am rejoiced. I praise the Lord for this victory over the powers of darkness. Elder Morrison has, I understand, made a full and thorough confession publicly, and he is again a free man. I have written four pages of letter paper to Leroy Nicola, and then have written a stirring appeal in regard to the parable of the lost sheep. This striking representation has made altogether too little impression on the minds of God's people. They have not been doers of the work which this parable clearly defines should be done to save the straying sheep and bring them back with rejoicing to the fold.",
