    "word": "To many of the colored people, the difficulties against which they have to contend seem almost insurmountable. But there are those who will not give up. All who are conscientiously and in the fear of God trying to acquire an education are to be helped and encouraged. There is talent among the colored race, and this talent will be developed where least expected. Every advantage possible is to be given to the colored youth who are capable of becoming useful workers in the Lord\u2019s vineyard. There are those who with proper training can be prepared to conduct sanitariums for colored people. In all cases they will need, at times, the assistance of white workers, but their talents will tell greatly for the success of the work.",
