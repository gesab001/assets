    "word": "While one class pervert the doctrine of justification by faith and neglect to comply with the conditions laid down in the Word of God--\"If ye love me, keep my commandments,\"--there is fully as great an error on the part of those who claim to believe and obey the commandments of God but who place themselves in opposition to the precious rays of light--new to them--reflected from the cross of Calvary. The first class do not see the wondrous things in the law of God for all who are doers of His Word. The others cavil over trivialities, and neglect the weightier matters, mercy and the love of God.",
