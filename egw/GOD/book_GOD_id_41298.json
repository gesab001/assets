    "word": "Personal religion will reveal itself in bearing good fruit, sanctification is not the work of a day, but a lifetime. The human heart becomes a medley of passions, vanities, love of self, love of money, and love of the world. There should be in the heart of everyone grace which can bloom in the garden of God. Selfishness will cut out every precious likeness of Christ, will expel humility and self-denial and devotion.--MS 32, 1893.",
