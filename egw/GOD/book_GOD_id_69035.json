    "word": "Jesus says, \"Ye are the light of the world. . . . Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 5:14, 16). There are some who will observe the example and feel the influence of a consistent Christian life. Jesus does not bid the Christian to strive to shine, but just to let his light shine in clear and distinct rays to the world. Do not blanket your light. Do not sinfully withhold your light. Do not let the mist and fog and malaria of the world put out your light. Do not hide it under a bed or under a bushel, but set in on a candlestick, that it may give light to all that are in the house. Neither take pains to exalt yourself to shine nor go into the cave as did Elijah in his discouragement, but come out, stand with God and shine. God bids you shine, penetrating the moral darkness of the world. Be the salt, the savor of men.--Manuscript 40, Nov. 3, 1890, \"The Vision at Salamanca.\"",
