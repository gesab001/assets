    "word": "William Miller had no sympathy with those influences that led to fanaticism. He declared, with Luther, that every spirit should be tested by the Word of God. \u201cThe  devil,\u201d said Miller, \u201chas great power over the minds of some at the present day. And how shall we know what manner of spirit they are of? The Bible answers: \u2018By their fruits ye shall know them.\u2019\u201d \u201cThere are many spirits gone out into the world; and we are commanded to try the spirits. The spirit that does not cause us to live soberly, righteously, \n397\nand godly, in this present world, is not the Spirit of Christ. I am more and more convinced that Satan has much to do in these wild movements.\u201d \u201cMany among us, who pretend to be wholly sanctified, are following the traditions of men, and apparently are as ignorant of truth as others who make no such pretensions.\u201d \u201cThe spirit of error will lead us from the truth; and the Spirit of God will lead us into truth. But, say you, a man may be in error, and think he has the truth. What then?  We answer, The Spirit and Word agree. If a man judges himself by the Word of God, and finds a perfect harmony through the whole Word, then he must believe he has the truth; but if he finds the spirit by which he is led does not harmonize with the whole tenor of God's law or book, then let him walk carefully, lest he be caught in the snare of the devil.\u201d \u201cI have often obtained more evidence of inward piety from a kindling eye, a wet cheek, and a choked utterance, than from all the noise in Christendom.\u201d",
