    "word": "Sanctification is believed by many to be instantaneously accomplished. \"Only believe,\" say they, \"and the blessing is yours.\" No further effort on the part of the receiver is supposed to be required. But the Bible teaches that sanctification is progressive. The Christian will feel the promptings of sin, but he will keep up a constant warfare against it. Here is where Christ's help is needed. Human weakness becomes united to divine strength, and faith exclaims, \"Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" [1 Corinthians 15:57.] Paul exhorts his brethren, \"Work out your own salvation with fear and \n                                                                           301\ntrembling;\" [Philippians 2:12.] and concerning himself he declares, \"I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\" [Philippians 3:14.] The successive steps in the attainment of Bible sanctification are set before us in the words of Peter: \"Giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity.\" \"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.\" [2 Peter 1:5-7, 10.] This is a daily work, continuing as long as life shall last.",
