We have sinned against Him and are undeserving of His favor; yet He Himself has put into our lips that most wonderful of pleas: \"Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.\" Jeremiah 14:21. He has pledged Himself to give heed to our cry when we come to Him confessing our unworthiness and sin. The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His Word to us. \n                                                                           43",
