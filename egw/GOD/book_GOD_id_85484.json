    "word": "[Mark 2:17 quoted:] Then you are not to wait, but come now, and believe that He will receive you. \"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten \n\n\n                                      -19- \n\nSon, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" You cannot enjoy His blessing without any action on your part. Salvation is a gift offered to you free; on no other condition can you obtain it, only as a free gift. But cooperation on your part is essential for your salvation. . . .",
