    "word": "O how can anyone suppose that he can be in harmony with Christ and indulge in this cruel and wicked work? All who do so are departing from the word of God, disregarding that word, and failing to act out the lessons of Jesus Christ. Talking with solemn earnestness the Counsellor has said: \"There are many who, when their own ideas and will is crossed, reveal a bitterness of spirit. They cherish the same feelings as an unconverted man. They watch for an opportunity to complain, and thus set a wrong example for others. In that day, declares the word of God, \"shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. The meek shall also increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off; that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.\"",
