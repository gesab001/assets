    "word": "The Lord God of Israel has placed His goods in the hands of unbelievers, but they are to be used in favor of doing the work that must be done for a fallen world. The agents through whom their gifts come, who open up avenues through which the truth may go, may have no sympathy with the work, and no faith in Christ, and no practice of his words; but their gifts are not to be refused on that account. The Holy Ghost strives with hearts of the so-called great men of earth. He is drawing them until they have light, and when convicted turn from fables to the light of truth.",
