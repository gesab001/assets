    "word": "There are deep, earnest lessons for us to learn, else self will be our center, the controlling power of our lives. The duty is of the present, vigilant, working, and earnest, solemn waiting in view of the solemn event of our Lord's appearing. Workings, watchings, praying,--these constitute the ideal Christian duty and responsibility, making the perfect man in Christ Jesus. Our life is not to be all waiting, not all bustle and activity and excitement, to the neglect of personal piety. The door of the heart must always be open to Jesus, that we may always hear his voice and invitation, \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\" We are to be \"not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" There is always a danger of taking upon ourselves a work the Lord has not placed in our hands, and neglecting that which he has given us to do, and which would better honor his name; that which to human eyes may appear praiseworthy, may be the very thing the Lord has not placed in our hands. Then let us individually consider the many branches of the work. There are various kinds of work to do. Consider prayerfully what would best tell for the cause of God. If there is a humble, unselfish heart, and a contrite spirit, in seeking to know the Lord's will, he will lead each of us in the path where he would have us walk.",
