    "word": "(611)   7. Every Church Member to Engage in Medical Missionary \n           Work \n\n\n     We have come to a time when every member of the church should take hold of medical missionary work. The world is a lazar-house filled with victims of both physical and spiritual disease. Everywhere people are perishing for lack of a knowledge of the truths that have been committed to us. The members of the church are in need of an awakening, that they may realize their responsibility to impart these truths. Those who have been enlightened by the truth are to be lightbearers to the world. To hide our light at this time is to make a terrible mistake. The message to God's people today is, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" \"Test. for the Church.\" Vol. VII, p. 62. (Read further.)",
