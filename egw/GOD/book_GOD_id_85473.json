    "word": "The Spirit of God does not propose to do our part either in the willing or the doing. This is the work of the human agent in cooperation with the Divine agencies. As soon as we incline our will to harmonize with God's will, the peace of Christ stands to cooperate with the human agent. But it [the Holy Spirit] will not be the substitute to do our work independent of our resolving and decidedly acting; therefore it is not the abundance of light, and evidence piled upon evidence that will convert the soul. It is only the human agent accepting the light, rousing the energies of the will fully to that which he knows is righteousness and truth, and thus cooperating with the heavenly ministrations appointed of God in the saving of the soul. . . .",
