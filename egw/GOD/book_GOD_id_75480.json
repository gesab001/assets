    "word": "How can a Christian sleep in such an age as we are now living in? Knowledge is increased, and facilities are increased for attaining great results for God and humanity. Then we see so many harvest-fields of labor opening before us, inviting those of strong faith and hope and courage to enter them. To sleep now is a fearful crime. The Lord is coming. We are appointed to prepare the way for his coming by acting our part to prepare a people to stand in that great day. Is there one Christian whose pulse does not beat with quickened action as he anticipates the great events already opening before us? We hear the footsteps of an approaching God to punish the world for their iniquity.",
