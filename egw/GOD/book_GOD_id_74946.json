    "word": "The Holy Spirit does not work with men who love to be sharp and critical. That Spirit has been cherished in meeting debaters, and some have formed the habit of squaring for a combat. God is dishonored in this. Keep back the sharp thrusts; do not learn in Satan's school his methods of warfare. The Holy Spirit does not inspire the words of censure. A time of trouble is before us, and every honest soul, who has not had the light of truth, will then take a stand for Christ. Those who believe the truth are to be newly converted every day. Then they will be vessels unto honor.",
