    "word": "In ancient times God sent His people into Egypt, keeping them there until His appointed time for bringing them out. Then, with a wonderful display of power, He delivered them and led them through the wilderness into the promised land. Those who murmured and complained, refusing to be converted from their evil ways, perished in the wilderness, but there were those who, because they \n\n\n                                    -311- \n\nwere obedient, were sustained and strengthened by God. These were light-bearers to the nations through whose land they passed.",
