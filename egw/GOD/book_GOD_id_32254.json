    "word": "Mental Activity Produces Health.--God wants His delegated servants to be good preachers, and in order to do this they must be diligent students. . . . Studious habits, a firm hold from above, will qualify them for their position as ministers of the gospel of Christ. Mental activity will produce health, and this is better than a sluggish, disorderly, untrained mind. Many become worthless as ministers after advancing in age. . . . Had they worked the brain, they would have been fruitful in old age.--Lt 33, 1886.",
