    "word": "A Church School Versus Poor Home Management.-- Here is a Sanitarium, and that sanitarium must carry the highest possible influence inside and out. Then, if they see children who come there--sharp-eyed, lynx-eyed, wandering about, with nothing to do, getting into mischief, and all these things--it is painful to the senses of those that want to keep the reputation of the school. Therefore, I, from the light that God has given me, [declare that] if there is a family that has not the capabilities of educating, nor discipline and government over their children, requiring obedience, the very best thing is to put them in some place where they will obey. Put them in some place where they will be required to obey, because obedience is better than sacrifice. Good behavior is to be carried out in every family.",
