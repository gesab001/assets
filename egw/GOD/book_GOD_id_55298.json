    "word": "Satan Triumphs at His Ruinous Work.--Satan exults to see the human family plunging themselves deeper, and deeper, into suffering and misery. He knows that persons who have wrong habits, and unsound bodies, cannot serve God so earnestly, perseveringly, and purely as though sound. A diseased body affects the brain. With the mind we serve the Lord. The head is the capital of the body. . . . Satan triumphs in the ruinous work he causes by leading the human family to indulge in habits which destroy themselves, and one another; for by this means he is robbing God of the service due Him. --Spiritual Gifts, vol. p. 146. \n                                                                           15\n\n      3. Impairment Through Indulged Appetite",
