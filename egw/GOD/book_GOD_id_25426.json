    "word": "Here is held out the very thing for which we are to labor: \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love.\" If we have the love of Christ in our souls it will be a natural consequence for us to have all the other graces--joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; and \"against such there is no law.\" The law of God does not condemn and hold in bondage those who have these graces, because they are obeying the requirements of the law of God. They are law keepers, and . . . are not under the bondage of the law. . . .",
