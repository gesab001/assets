    "word": "One of the signs that we are living in the last days is that children are disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy. The Word of God abounds in precepts and counsels enjoining respect for our aged parents who have guided us through infancy, childhood, and youth up to manhood and womanhood. It impresses upon us a sacred duty to love and cherish those who are in a great degree dependent upon us for happiness, peace, and health. The Bible gives no uncertain sound on this subject; nevertheless, its teachings have been greatly disregarded.",
