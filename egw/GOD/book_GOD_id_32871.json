    "word": "Recent Memory Passes Fast.--He who has grown old in the service of God may find his mind a blank in regard to the things that are happening about him, and recent transactions may soon pass from his memory; but his mind is all awake to the scenes and transactions of his childhood. Oh, that the youth may realize how important it is to keep the mind guarded, pure and clean, from corrupting thoughts and to preserve the soul from all debasing practices, for the purity or impurity of youth is reflected upon old age.--YI, Oct 25, 1894. (SD 78.)",
