    "word": "The message that God gives to his longing, starving people, is the same that Jesus gave to the palsied man, who was brought to him, and let down through the roof, as the only way in which he could reach the Great Physician, is given us. \"Behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed.\" There was a crowd about the house, and the sick man's friends sought means to bring him directly to Christ, that they might lay him before Him.\" \"And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.\" Christ saw the man suffering with bodily disease. He also saw him suffering with a sin-sick soul. In order to heal the bodily maladies, he must bring relief to the mind, and cleanse the soul from sin. The Saviour was not unmindful of the efforts that had been made to bring the man to him. His heart of love and pity was at once moved. \"When he saw their faith, \"It was enough.\" He said to the sick man, \"Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.\" Many were watching with bated breath every movement in this strange transaction. Many felt that Christ's words were an invitation to them. Were they not soul-sick because of sin? Were they not anxious to get rid of this burden?",
