    "word": "I saw that those who oppose the Sabbath of the Lord could not take the Bible and show that our position was incorrect, therefore they would slander those who believe and teach the truth, and would attack their characters. And many who were once conscientious, and loved God and his word, have become so hardened by rejecting the light of truth that they will not hesitate to wickedly misrepresent and falsely accuse those who love the Holy Sabbath, if by so doing they can injure the influence of those who fearlessly declare the truth. But these things will not hinder the work of God. In fact, this course pursued by those who hate the truth, will be the very means of opening the eyes of some. Every jewel will be brought out and gathered, for the hand of the Lord is set to recover the remnant of his people, and he will accomplish the work gloriously.",
