    "word": "The very same thing you complain of in C. H. Jones, in reference to your book, was carried out in reference to Great Controversy, and Patriarchs and Prophets. The Pacific Press violated their solemn promise to me that if I would take ten cents royalty, they would give wide sale to the book. They would have reduced the royalty still more, but warnings were given me that I was encouraging a spirit of injustice, and that it was my duty to guard not only my individual rights but the rights of others. I was to take my stand firmly, and not be swayed by men, however high their position, for their business transactions were not all directed by the Spirit of God. The Lord will vindicate only the truth, and all who practice injustice and double dealing God will judge.",
