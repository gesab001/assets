    "word": "Let not one thread of selfishness be woven into the work of the Lord. Those in responsible positions are on test and trial. God calls for more mercy, more tenderness, more pity, more courtesy, than has been shown. There should be a reformation among the workers, Those who handle the work of the Lord should show themselves to be men of broad minds, men who appreciate what has been done for the relief of the schools. Let not that which was designed to relieve the schools be made no relief because of the grasping spirit of selfishness.",
