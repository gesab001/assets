    "word": "Bible history is to be repeated. Calamities will come--calamities most awful, most unexpected; and these destructions will follow one after another. If there will be a heeding of the warnings that God has given, and if churches will repent, returning to their allegiance, then other cities may be spared for a time. But if men who have been deceived continue in the same way in which they have been walking, disregarding the law of God, and presenting falsehoods before the people, God allows them to suffer calamity, \n\n\n                                    -92- \n\nthat their senses may be awakened.--Ms 35, 1906. (\"Adopting Infant Children,\" General manuscript bearing date of April 27, 1906.)",
