    "word": "John also saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, with its twelve gates and twelve foundations, coming down from God out of heaven. He was shown that city and saw the streets of transparent gold clear as crystal. Every one that goes into that city is changed and sanctified in character here in this life. The nations that have kept the truth enter in to the city of God, and a voice is heard, clear and distinct, \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" [Revelation 22:14].",
