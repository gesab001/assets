    "word": "Turning from the Light \n\n     Those  who turn away from the precious light that God has permitted to shine upon them in messages of warnings, of caution and reproof, would not believe if greater light were shed upon their pathway. They would not be inspired with faith, when they have failed to believe in and act upon the light which has already been given them. \"Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? . . . He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart.\" How does the Lord harden the hearts of men? --In the same way in which the heart of Pharaoh was hardened. . . .",
