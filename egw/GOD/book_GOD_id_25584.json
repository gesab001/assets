    "word": "What wonderful lessons we shall learn as the result of depending constantly on the sufficiency of Christ. He who is learning these lessons need not depend on another's experience. He has the witness in himself, and his experience is the actual knowledge that Christ is all-sufficient, faithful, and powerful. He has the realization of the promise, \"My grace is sufficient for thee\" (2 Corinthians 12:9). \"God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able\" (1 Corinthians 10:13).",
