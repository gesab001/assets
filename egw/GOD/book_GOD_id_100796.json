    "word": "There is need of wise generalship at the great head and heart of the work. One great and important trust is to see that no advantage is given to the enemies of God by publishing expressions detrimental to those of like precious faith. When a worker hears his fellow-laborer present views that do not in all respects harmonize with his ideas, and without having a kindly interview to see if they cannot come into harmony, publishes the difference to the world in as marked a manner as possible, he brings dishonor upon God and the truth, and causes Satan to triumph.",
