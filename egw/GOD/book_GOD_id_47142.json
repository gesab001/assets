    "word": "22, 23 (Luke 22:31, 32). Satan Between Peter and Christ.--See what the Lord said to Peter. . . . He said, \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\" What was Satan doing? He came right up face to face with Peter and between the Lord and Peter, so that Peter even took it upon him to reprove the Lord. But the Lord came close to Peter and Satan was put behind Christ. The Lord told Peter that Satan had desired him, that he might sift him as wheat, but He says, \"I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" If Peter had learned the lessons he ought to have learned, if he had stood right with God at the time of his trial, he would have stood then. If he had not been indifferent to the lessons Christ taught, he would have never denied his Lord (MS 14, 1894).",
