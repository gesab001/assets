They look upon others who are more orderly and refined, as being proud, and you may hear them say, \"The truth brings us all down upon a level.\" Here is an entire mistake, in thinking that the truth brings the receiver down. It brings him up, refines his taste, sanctifies his judgment, and if lived out, is continually fitting him for the society of holy angels in the city of God. The truth is designed to bring us all up upon a level.",
