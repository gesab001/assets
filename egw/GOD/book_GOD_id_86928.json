    "word": "This work is just what is needed to soften and subdue hearts, but I have been shown that it is too sparingly done. I tell you in the fear of God that there is more sermonizing than ministering. The field is a large one, but the servants of God, by straining themselves beyond their strength in their effort to do much preaching, neglect the corners of the Lord's vineyard, and overlook the hundred weekly opportunities for doing good.--Letter 95, 1896, pp. 4, 5. (To G. B. Starr, August 11, 1896.)",
