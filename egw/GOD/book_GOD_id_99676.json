    "word": "The Brn. Millers have walked in unbelief, Phariseeism, and darkness, to such an extent that they do not know what it is to breathe the free atmosphere of heaven, of faith, love, confidence, and truth. If they stood in the clear light, they would not see anything in the way of hearty co-operation with the work of others. God is displeased with the spirit that prompts them to combat and oppose their brethren. But they do not realize that their criticism results from the natural and cultivated traits of their own character. They have never seen these to be evil as they really are, or the necessity of overcoming them. The Lord can do without the aid or co-operation of these men, He does not need their acknowledgment, and is not really hindered by their objections and resistance for God will work just the same, but some are influenced by their example, and they themselves are losing much because they have not a teachable spirit. Bro. Howard is self-sufficient and feels not his great poverty.",
