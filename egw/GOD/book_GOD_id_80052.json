    "word": "God has expended amazing sacrifices upon men, and mighty energies for the reclaiming of man from transgression and sin to loyalty and obedience, but I have been shown that he does nothing without the co-operation of human agencies. Every endowment of grace and power and efficiency has been liberally provided, and the strongest motives presented to arouse and keep living in the human heart the missionary spirit, that divine and human agency may be combined. What more has been done in self-denial in moving out of Battle Creek, in carrying the light, the influence of God's Spirit testifying to the truth in regions where the standard \n\n\n                          -12- \n\nhas never yet been lifted? Did the Lord of heaven open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing at the last Conference? What use have you made of the gift of God? He has supplied the motive forces of which he has made a lodgment in your hearts, that with patience and hope and untiring vigilance you might set forth Jesus Christ and him, crucified, that you send the note of warning that Christ is coming the second time with power and great glory, and calling men to repent of their sins.",
