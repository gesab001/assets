    "word": "\"To us, as God's servants, has been entrusted the third angel's message, the binding-off message, that is to prepare a people for the coming of our King. Time is short. The Lord desires that everything connected with His cause shall be brought into order. He desires that the solemn message of warning and of invitation shall be proclaimed as widely as His messengers can carry it. The means that shall come into the treasury, is to be used wisely in supporting the workers. Nothing that would hinder the advance of the message, is to be allowed to come into our planning. . . .",
