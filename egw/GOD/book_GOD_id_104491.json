    "word": "Jesus Christ is the great healer, but He desires that by living in conformity with His laws, we may co-operate with Him in the recovery and the maintenance of health. Combined with the work of healing there must be an imparting of knowledge of how to resist temptation. Those who came to our sanitariums should be aroused to a sense of their own responsibility to work in harmony with the God of truth.",
