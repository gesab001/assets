    "word": "In every place that you visit, you will find the sick and suffering. Relieve them if possible, even if by so doing, you are detained some little time. . . . The use of simple means in the treatment of the sick will be an object lesson. If at all consistent, pray for the sick one. God may raise him up, and this will be a witness for the truth. Tell the families you visit what they must do to keep well. Take with you some pamphlets bearing on health reform, and leave them with the people. Thus you can sow the seeds of truth.--Manuscript 18a, 1901.",
