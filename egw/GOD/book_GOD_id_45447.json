    "word": "Truthfulness of Testimonies Publicly Acknowledged.-- I spoke to the people [in Bloomfield, California] in the forenoon in regard to the necessity of having the defects in their characters removed, that they may stand before the Son of God blameless when He shall appear. There was deep feeling in the meeting. I addressed several personally, pointing out the wrongs I had been shown in their cases. They all responded and many with weeping confessed their sins and the truthfulness of the testimony.--Letter 7, 1873.",
