They are abusing their probationary opportunities, and are grievously neglecting the high privileges conferred upon them. Though finding nothing in the word of God to vindicate their actions, or countenance their opinions, yet they persist in their own way. In that day when judgment is passed upon all, the sentence will be pronounced against them, \"Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.\" \n\n\n                        - 35 -",
