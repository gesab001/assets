    "word": "God says to every minister of the gospel, to every medical missionary worker, to every other worker in his cause, Take your stand on the elevated platform of truth and justice. God will not serve with any man who draws threads of selfishness and unfairness into the web, by his example leading others astray. Our ministers and doctors are to put on the garment of Christ's righteousness. They are to wash their robes of character and make them white in the blood of the lamb.",
