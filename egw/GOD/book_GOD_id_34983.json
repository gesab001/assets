    "word": "The Israelites placed over their doors a signature of blood, to show that they were God\u2019s property. So the children of God in this age will bear the signature God has appointed. They will place themselves in harmony with God\u2019s holy law. A mark is placed upon every one of God\u2019s people just as verily as a mark was placed over the doors of the Hebrew dwellings, to preserve the people from the general ruin. God declares, \u201cI gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.\u201d Ezekiel 20:12.",
