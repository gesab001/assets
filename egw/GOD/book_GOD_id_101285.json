    "word": "The Lord God of Israel demands an altogether deeper piety than has been manifested by those who have been placed in positions of sacred trust in the Review & Herald office and in the management of the great work in connection with the cause of God. If these men are not under the special influence of the Spirit of God, if they do not recognize his voice, they will work after their own imagination, and will set in operation plans that will be entirely contrary to the mind and Spirit of God, and that will counteract the work of God.",
