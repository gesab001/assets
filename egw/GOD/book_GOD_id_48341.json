    "word": "The Last Plagues and the Judgment\n     At the general conference of believers in the present truth, held at Sutton, (Vt.) September, 1850, I was shown that the seven last plagues will be poured out after Jesus leaves the Sanctuary. Said the angel, It is the wrath of God and the Lamb that causes the destruction or death of the wicked. At the voice of God the saints will be mighty and terrible as an army with banners; but they will not then execute the judgment written. The execution of the judgment will be at the close of the 1000 years.",
