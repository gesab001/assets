    "word": "Let Others Develop Their Talents and Bear Responsibilities--You are not the only men whom God will use. Give the Lord room to use the talents he has entrusted to men in order that the cause may grow. Give the Lord a chance to use men's minds. We are losing much by our narrow ideas and plans. Do not stand in the way of the advancement of the work, but let the Lord work by whom He will. Educate, encourage young men to think and act, to devise and plan, in order that we may have a multitude of wise counselors. . . . \n\n\n                                  -80-",
