    "word": "Chapter Thirty - Our Responsibility to the Blind\n\n     Treat the Blind With Compassion.--The Lord desires those connected with the medical missionary work to be true missionaries. In word and action they are to be Christlike. They are not to be merciful only when they feel an impulse to show mercy, nor are they to act selfishly toward the ones who are the most deserving of medical missionary work. The blind, for instance, are to be treated with compassion. Let medical missionaries reflect concerning their actions toward the blind, that they may learn whether as true missionaries for God they could not have done for this unfortunate class of people many things that they have left undone. From what has been presented to me I know that many, many cases have not received the encouragement that Christ would have given them were He in the place of our medical missionaries.",
