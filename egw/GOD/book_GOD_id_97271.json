    "word": "We are lost without Christ, but God has given us something to bring us back to our loyalty. We want the deep moving of the Spirit of God on our hearts. We want to walk in the light as God is in the light and then we shall not walk in darkness. We shall have songs of praise and rejoicing, for we can tell the story of the love of Jesus toward man. He died on Calvary that we should not perish in our sin. Then cease from evil and follow on to know the Lord. Oh, the light and love and preciousness that there is in Jesus Christ! He will encircle us in the arms of His mercy and He will love us freely.",
