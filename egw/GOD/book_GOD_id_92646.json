    "word": "MR No. 1290 - God's Counsel to be Sought Before Enlarging Buildings; Means Needed for Opening New Fields\n\n     (Written June 14, 1895, from Norfolk Villa, NSW, to Dr. J. H. Kellogg.) \n\n     I thank you for the letters you have sent, and will now try to reply to them as best I can. The first American mail for this month was sent off yesterday, but another mail goes by the Vancouver on the 20th, by which you will receive this letter. Brother McCoy wrote me in reference to enlarging some of your buildings, and especially mentioned the enlarging of your bakery, saying that this was very much needed. I must leave you to settle the matter as you think best, for your necessities are known to yourselves and to God. I have given you the light that God has given me in regard to investing means in erecting buildings, and I must have no voice in saying anything further about the matter.",
