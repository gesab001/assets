    "word": "\"Behold,\" Christ declares, \"I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" God calls upon us to voice the words, \"Even so, come Lord Jesus.\" God will do much more for His people if they will have faith in Him. Infidelity is stalking abroad through the land. Satan has laid his plans to undermine our faith in the history and the cause and work of God. I am deeply in earnest as I write this. Satan is working with men in prominent positions to sweep away the foundations of our faith. Shall we allow this to be done, brethren?",
