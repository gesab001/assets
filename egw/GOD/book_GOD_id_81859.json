    "word": "You have an unhappy family. Your children have a hard time. They are growing up with habits uncorrected, which will destroy their usefulness, and, unless they reform, will shut them at last from the presence of God. Who is responsible for this? The father, who knows not himself, yet thinks he is qualified to manage. Could your children have had a mother of mature years, her age measuring nearly with your own, a woman of experience and self-control, your children would be far different in character from what they are.",
