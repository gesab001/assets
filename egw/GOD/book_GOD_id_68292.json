    "word": "It is in working actively to supply the necessities of the cause of God that we shall bring our souls in touch with the Source of all power. But let no one entertain the idea that those who have embraced the truth will be engaged in imparting more than in receiving. Your spiritual expenditures need not exceed your spiritual income. The one is essential to the other. Neglect the one, and the other will be neglected. The most interested active servants of God in every age have been those who have had most living, practical piety. Their spiritual wants were supplied from the never failing source of power, that they might impart to others. When we have an eye single to the glory of God, we shall cultivate personal piety.",
