    "word": "Jesus Accepts Our Intentions \n\n     When it is in the heart to obey God, when efforts are put forth to this end, Jesus accepts this disposition and effort as man's best service, and He makes up for the deficiency with His own divine merit. But He will not accept those who claim to have faith in Him, and yet are disloyal to His Father's commandment. We hear a great deal about faith, but we need to hear a great deal more about works. Many are deceiving their own souls by living an easygoing, accommodating, crossless religion. But Jesus says, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\"--The Signs of the Times, June 16, 1890.",
