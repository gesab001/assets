    "word": "Christ is the uniting link in the golden chain which binds believers together in God. There must be no separating in this great testing time. The people of God are \"fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord\" [vss. 19, 20]. The children of God constitute one united whole in Christ, who presents His cross as the center of attraction. All who believe are one in Him. Human feelings will lead men to take the work into their own hands and the building thus becomes disproportionate. The Lord therefore employs a variety of gifts to make the building symmetrical. Not one feature of the truth is to be hidden or made of little account. God cannot be glorified unless the building, \"fitly framed \n\n\n                                     -186- \n\ntogether, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.\" A great subject is here comprehended, and those who understand the truth for this time must take heed how they hear and how they build and educate others to practice.--Ms 109, 1899, pp. 9, 10.
