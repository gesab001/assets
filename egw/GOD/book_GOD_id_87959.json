    "word": "There is now to be a change, and there must be division of responsibility to remedy the neglect. The same men are not to be selected for all responsibilities, for their past showing is not a confirmation of their wisdom or correct bearings. We have come to a place where there must be a change in the administration. One set of men are not always to stand as qualified for the bearing of large responsibilities. Men are needed who evidence that they are ruled by the Lord and controlled by strictest integrity. I am pained to say there needs to be a change of elements. The present showing is not correct in the sight of God. Many things that should have been done have not been done. Many souls that might have been reached, and the truth bear a decided victory, have not been reached. Nothing has been done in large neglected centers because of the necessity of means to do the work. It is time that a change is made, that the neglected cities are entered everywhere in America. In different sections men are to be appointed to care for these different sections.--Ms 113, 1909, pp. 1-5 (\"The Work in Portland, Maine, and the East, \"July 3, 1909.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.
