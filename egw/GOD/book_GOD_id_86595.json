    "word": "Those who receive the holy calling to bear God's message to the world, will exalt the message, not self. They will walk humbly with God day by day. If they will work under the guidance of the Great Shepherd, proving themselves caretakers, worthy of such responsibility, God will exalt them in due time. Whatever his position, man is never to teach his fellow man to look to him for wisdom. Human beings are never to take the place of God; man is never to put his trust in man, nor make flesh his arm. The Lord is to be our trust. We are to look to Him for guidance. And when we receive counsel from the Lord, we are to follow that counsel.",
