    "word": "Those whom God employs to do service for Him, He would have fitted in His way for that service. Those who preach Christ must learn of Christ daily, in order to understand the mystery of saving and serving the souls for whom He had died. They must bring with them nothing like spiritual pride or self-indulgence. In speech, in voice, in every phrase of character, they must reveal the spiritual refinement, the Christlike courtesy, that connection with the Saviour gives. His tender love and compassion must constantly be revealed.",
