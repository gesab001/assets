    "word": "The Bible contains a simple and complete system of theology and philosophy. It is the book that makes us wise unto salvation. It tells us of the love of God as shown in the plan of redemption, imparting the knowledge essential for all students--the knowledge of Christ. He is the Sent of God; he is the Author of our salvation. But apart from the word of God, we could have no knowledge that such a person as the Lord Jesus has ever visited our world, nor any knowledge of his divinity, as indicated by his previous existence with the Father.",
