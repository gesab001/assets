    "word": "There are today moral heroes, men and women who are living noble lives of self-denial. They have no ambition for worldly fame. Their will is subordinate to the will of God. The love of God inspires their ministry. To do good and to save souls is their highest aim. These have gained genuine knowledge, even the knowledge set forth by Christ in the words, \"This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent\" [John 17:3].",
