    "word": "We are striving to come into possession of eternal riches. In the appropriation of your means, let it be used in such a way that it will be constantly yielding returns to God. In placing in another's hands that which would be spent merely to gratify human vanity, you are placing that \n\n\n                                    -120- \n\nportion of your means where it can bring no returns to God. The Lord has made you a steward of means, that you may do good works in many ways. Be careful that you do all things with an eye single to the glory of God. Our offerings made to carry out the great plan of salvation will bring glory to the One for whose sake the gifts were made.",
