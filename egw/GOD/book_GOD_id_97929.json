    "word": "After Christ had been placed in the tomb, Roman guards were stationed round to protect His body. But a mighty angel from the court of heaven parted the darkness from his track, and descended to where the Son of God lay. When his light fell on the guards, they fell as dead men to the earth. But if the light from one angel caused men to fall to the earth as dead, Christ could not have come with even that glory. He took humanity that we, by partaking of His nature, might receive the impress of Jehovah, and stand as witnesses before men and angels, and before the whole army of the powers of darkness, of the efficacy of a crucified Saviour.",
