    "word": "Such, I saw, have the carnal mind, therefore, are not subject to the holy law of God. They are not agreed among themselves, yet labor hard with their inferences, to wrest the scriptures to make a breach in God's law, to change, abolish, or do anything with the fourth commandment rather than to observe it. They wish to silence the flock upon this question, therefore they get up something with the hope that it will quiet them, and many of their followers search their Bibles so little, that their leaders can easily make error appear like truth, and they receive it as such, not looking higher than their leaders.",
