    "word": "You cannot with safety pursue the course you have done. There is conniving at sin, a covering up of sin. They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts, and those seeking for heaven are endowed with whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are lovely and of good report. There is an unseen witness in your meetings and your association with those who are corrupted and corrupting. The Word of God forbids our attaching undue importance to our works, but it nowhere forbids self-respect. There is a conscious dignity of character which is not pride or self-esteem, but is the safeguard of youth. He is impressed that he has a reputation to sustain, a character to lose or to keep. In God's inspired book you will have a faultless instructor, an unerring counsellor, an unfailing guide.",
