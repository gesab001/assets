    "word": "I sent word to Brother Kilgore that I would speak to the Scandinavians in the afternoon, and to the American brethren in the forenoon. I stated to the brethren that I had continued the same work since the Minneapolis meeting.

They have not repented of their evil work. I had testimonies for individuals that were in sin, but I had no liberty to reprove them, for these were joined with those who held responsible positions and had a mob spirit, the spirit of the devil to berate, to falsify and inflame the minds of those who ought to have had the spirit of Jesus.",
