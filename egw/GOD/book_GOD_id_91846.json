    "word": "Friday morning [Nov. 22], Brother Henry came to Paris for James to shave him to attend the funeral. We had a very solemn, interesting time. The Lord did not leave us but let His Spirit rest upon us. Sister Foey's last days were decidedly her most spiritual and best days. Brother Foey has this to console him, that she died a Christian.
