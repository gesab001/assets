    "word": "When our prayers seem not to be answered, we are to cling to the promise; for the time of answering will surely come, and we shall receive the blessing we need most. But to claim that prayer will always be answered in the very way and for the particular thing that we desire, is presumption. God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from them that walk uprightly. \n261\nThen do not fear to trust Him, even though you do not see the immediate answer to your prayers. Rely upon His sure promise, \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you.\u201d(Steps to Christ, 96.)",
