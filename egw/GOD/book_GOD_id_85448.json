    "word": "By giving his only begotten Son to die on the cross, God has shown us the estimate he places on the human soul. All that the world admires, all it calls precious, sinks into insignificance when placed in the balance with one soul; for a matchless ransom has been paid for that soul. All heaven has been given in one gift.--Ms 29, 1899, pp. 4, 5. (\"Sacrificed for Us,\" typed March 17, 1899.)",
