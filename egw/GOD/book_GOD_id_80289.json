    "word": "On which side are you standing? On the side of those that worship the beast and his image? Are you connected with those who have lost the spiritual principles that distinguish them as men, and allied them to God, and who have become secondary subordinates, united with the great apostate? Christ died to make it possible for you to be allied with angels, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. If you are obedient to all his commandments, you will reign as kings and priests unto God. Will you choose the degrading captivity of disobedience and transgression? Will you link yourselves with those who make void God's law?",
