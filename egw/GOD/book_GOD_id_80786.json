    "word": "Children should be kept free as possible from the demoralizing influences of the fashions of this age. Fathers who minister in word and doctrine should have their children examples of what they teach to others in the pulpit. When you realize the responsibility that rests upon you, your life and character will be elevated and ennobled, and you will seek to reach the \n\n\n                           [17] \n\nhigh standard God has erected. Ministers should be far more earnest and anxious to train their children so that they shall meet the Lord's standard than that they may meet the approval of the world. I do not wish you to be blindfolded by the enemy, to feel flattered because your daughter is praised and petted by those who do not keep the commandments of God. What if sickness or death should come upon your children? What if their reason should be taken away, and their souls unsaved, where would the blame lay? Has your work been done according to the light and knowledge you have had? Have you followed the directions of Holy Writ? Have you not educated and trained your child to fall in love with fashionable dress because you have not firmness of principle to deny her desires? Have you taught your children that they must have moral courage in order to be God's peculiar treasures, separate from the spirit and habits of those who love not God and keep not his commandments?",
