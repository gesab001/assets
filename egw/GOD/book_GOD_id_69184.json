    "word": "The lady in waiting [i.e., stewardess nurse] is very kind to me. I gave her Steps to Christ and some papers and pamphlets. I talked with her in regard to her soul's salvation. I pointed out the perils of anyone whose life was on the sea. She said she had thought of this ofttimes, but she said, \"If I could, I would be a Christian, but I cannot. It would be an impossibility to serve God on such a vessel as this. You do not know, you cannot have any idea of the wickedness of these sailors. The captain and mates are so closely of the same character with the crew of sailors that they have no influence to introduce reform, if they desired such a thing.\" I asked why she did not seek some other employment. She said, \"It would be no use. I have four children to support and I have not strength to do hard work.\" She was a small, delicate, fine-featured woman. . . .",
