W., \n                                      May 4, 1896. \n\n\n     I felt sorry when I read your letter breathing so depressed a spirit. Read Ephesians 2:4-22. This scripture has been given me for you. Read it carefully, as you never read it before. It is full of instruction. Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith means the contemplation of Christ, beholding Christ, ever cherishing the dear Saviour as our very best and honored friend, so that we would not in any action grieve and offend him. We have always this promise to comfort and help us, \"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.\"",
