    "word": "Qualifications of Teachers. \n\nConverted teachers. \n     \"I would that the teachers in our schools could be of God's selection and appointment. Souls will be lost because of the careless work of professedly Christian teachers, who need to be taught by God day by day, else they are unfit for the position of trust. Teachers are needed who will strive to weed out their inherited and cultivated tendencies to wrong, who will come into line, wearing themselves the yoke of obedience, and thus giving an example to the students. The sense of duty to their God and to their fellow beings with whom they associate, will lead such teachers to become doers of the word, and to heed counsel as to how they should conduct themselves.\"--Sept. 17, '887.",
