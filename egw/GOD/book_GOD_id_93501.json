    "word": "All heaven is working to resist Satan's power, to bind the strong man. The angels of God are working to put restrictions upon the power of the enemy until man shall be fully tested and tried. Hear the gracious invitation made to every soul: \"He that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out.\" This is not a bodily movement, but the submitting of the human will to the will of supreme wisdom. The human agent does not have to go into heaven to bring God down, or into the deep to bring Him up. He is not far from every one of us. \"In Him we live, move, and have our being.\"",
