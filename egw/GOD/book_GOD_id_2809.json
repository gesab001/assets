    "word": "The law of God was first transgressed by Satan in heaven. He has kept up his controversy upon that point till the present time, and will until the close of time. The test that was brought to bear upon the representative people in past ages will be brought to bear upon people in this age.

Did it improve their condition to separate themselves from the law of their Creator? Will it make men and women any better in this age to put their feet upon God\u2019s holy law and transgress it?",
