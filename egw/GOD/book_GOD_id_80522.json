    "word": "At our yearly convocations these things should be set before the people, and they should be encouraged to hope in the Lord, for he says, \"When ye shall search for me with all your heart,\" \"I will be found of you.\" The standard should be elevated, and the preaching should be of a more spiritual character, that the people may see the reason of their weakness and unhappiness. Many are unhappy because they are unholy. Purity of heart, innocence of mind, only can be truly blessed of God. When sin is cherished in the heart, there can be nothing but unhappiness in the end; and the sin which leads to the most unhappy results is pride of heart, the lack of Christlike sympathy and love.",
