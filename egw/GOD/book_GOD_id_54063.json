    "word": "On account of the standard of piety being so low among professed Christians generally, it is much more laborious and trying for those who wish to follow Christ in sincerity. The influence of worldly professors is injurious to the young. The mass of professed Christians have removed the line of distinction between Christians and the world. And while they profess to be living for Christ, they are living for the world. Their faith has but little restraining influence upon their pleasures. While they profess to be children of the light, they walk in darkness and are children of the night and of darkness. Those who walk in darkness cannot love God, and sincerely desire to glorify him. They are not enlightened to discern the excellence of heavenly things, and therefore cannot truly love them. They profess to be Christians because it is considered honorable, and there is no cross for them to bear. Their motives are often selfish. Some such professors can enter the ball-room, and unite with all the amusements which it affords. Others cannot go quite to such a length as this, yet they can attend parties of pleasure, picnics, donation-parties, and exhibitions. And the most discerning Christian would fail to detect in such professed Christians one mark of his or her Christianity. One would fail to see any difference in their appearance from the greatest unbeliever. The profligate, and open scoffer of religion, and the openly profane, all mingle together as one. And God regards them as one in spirit and practice.",
