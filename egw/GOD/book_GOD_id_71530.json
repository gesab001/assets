    "word": "God is also the guardian of justice and mercy. He regards the way in which we treat our fellow workers. We cannot hide from Him the smallest act that affects the rights of one of His heritage. He will vindicate His righteousness before all who would take advantage of or wrong a fellow being. He discerns the motive that prompts to every action. . . . As the professed followers of One who is the guardian of truth and righteousness, you are to hold the truth in its purity. In every act of the daily life, you are to reveal a strict sense of right and justice.--Letter 94, March 14, 1907, to the workers in Boulder Sanitarium.",
