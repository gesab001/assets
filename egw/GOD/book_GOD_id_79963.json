    "word": "God Requires All the Heart. \n\n     33. The Lord will accept only the supreme affection of the soul, and this is his righteous requirement, for he has redeemed you with his blood. You are to seek to do the will of God, not your way and your will. I ask you now the question that the Lord is asking you: Who of you are resolved to eat the bread of life, that you may become stalwart Christians, maintaining spirituality, and able to \"show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light\"? Who of you in any capacity in the work of the office, will seek wisdom from God that you may represent the character of Christ in all your walks in life? Remember, your words, your actions, are either a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. Never forget that you are making a favorable or an unfavorable impression upon others in regard to the truth you profess to believe.",
