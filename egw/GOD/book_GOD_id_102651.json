    "word": "God calls sternly for an adjustment of these matters; for his name is reproached. He marks every move made by his missionary workers in improving his vineyard. He sees the unfair way in which these workers have been treated. There is need of a recognition of the rights of the missionaries sent by God to carry the gospel message to all parts of the world. These men and women take their lives into their hands, and for Christ's sake endure trials and hardships. Let men realize that God is a God of justice. His actual presence follows his missionaries from place to place as they try to do his will, devoting all their time and energy to his service.",
