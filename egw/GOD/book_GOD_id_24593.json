    "word": "When Jesus ascended to heaven he committed his work on earth to those who had received the light of the gospel. They were to carry the work forward to completion. He has provided no other agency for the promulgation of his truth. Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d \u201cAnd lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d This solemn commission reaches us in this age. God leaves with his church the responsibility of receiving or rejecting it.",
