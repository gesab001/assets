    "word": "The Jews, as a nation, refused to accept Christ. They turned from the only One who could have saved them from eternal ruin. A similar condition of things exists in the so-called Christian world today. Men who claim to understand the Scriptures are rejecting God's law, and are exerting a strong, determined influence against it. They make the keeping of God's commandments a matter of condemnation. What is the result? Look at the course of the youth growing up around us.",
