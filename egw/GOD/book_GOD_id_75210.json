    "word": "Study God's Methods. \n\n     As a people we should study God's plans for conducting his work. Wherever he has given directions in regard to any point, we should carefully consider \n\n\n                         - 29 - \n\nhow to regard his expressed will. This work should have special attention. It is not wise to choose one man as president of the General Conference. The work of the General Conference has extended, and some things have been made unnecessarily complicated. A want of discernment has been shown. There should be a division of the field, or some other plan should be devised to change the present order of things. . . .",
