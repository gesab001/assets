    "word": "Mercy of God Exemplified. \n\n     We can see what evidence was given the priests and rulers, and how firmly they resisted the Spirit of God. Those who claim superior wisdom and piety may make most terrible and (to themselves) fatal mistakes if they allow their minds to be molded by another power, and pursue a course in resistance to the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus, represented by the Holy Spirit, was in the presence of that assembly, but they did not discern him. For a moment they had felt the conviction of the Spirit, that Jesus was the Son of God, but they stifled conviction, and became more blind and hardened than before. Even after they had crucified the Saviour, God in his mercy had sent them additional evidence in the works wrought through the apostles. He was giving them another call to repentance, even in the terrible charge brought against them by the apostles, that they had killed the Prince of Life.",
