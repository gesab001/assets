    "word": "Through the influence of the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, we love God supremely and our neighbor as ourselves, and this comprehends the whole duty of man. Love worketh no ill to his neighbor, for to love God \n\n\n                                   -85- \n\nwith all our heart and our neighbor as ourself is the fulfilling of the law. When all malice, hatred, jealousy, and selfishness are cleansed from the soul temple, the vacuum is supplied with kindness, patience, longsuffering, benevolence, and love. The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us.",
