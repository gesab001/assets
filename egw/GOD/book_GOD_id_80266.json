    "word": "Will you in Battle Creek, who have spread yourselves contrary to the expressed will of God, in your buildings, and in your selfish acceptance of wages, allow the treasury to be robbed that the \n\n\n                      -8- \n\nlaborers shall not be sustained in home and foreign ministerial work? God looks with disfavor upon your selfish appropriation of the means that is consecrated for a special purpose. You have followed this plan that you might have a better opportunity to indulge self, and make little self-denial for Christ's sake. This is something you need to adjust quickly. Make no delay. Will a man rob God? Will he steal God's means to settle outgoing expenses when the ministry needs every dollar?",
