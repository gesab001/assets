    "word": "To lead them to Jesus is not all that is required. . . . These children are to be educated and trained to become disciples of Christ, \"that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace.\" This work of molding, refining, and polishing is the mother's. The character of the child is to be developed. The mother must engrave upon the tablet of the heart lessons as enduring as eternity; and she will surely meet the displeasure of the Lord if she neglects this sacred work or allows anything to interfere with it. . . . The Christian mother has her God-appointed work, which she will not neglect if she is closely connected with God and imbued with His Spirit.",
