    "word": "The history of the Reformation teaches us that the church of Christ is never to come to a standstill and cease reforming. God stands at the head, saying to them as He did to Moses, \u201cGo forward.\u201d\u201cSpeak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.\u201d God\u2019s work is onward; step by step His people advance onward through conflict and trial to final victory. The history of the church teaches us that God\u2019s people are not to be stereotyped in their theories of faith, but to be prepared for new light, for opening truth revealed in His Word.",
