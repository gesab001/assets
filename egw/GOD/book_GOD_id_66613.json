    "word": "U. T.--March,'96 (H. L. para. 295) \n     The meat is served reeking with fat, because it suits the perverted taste. Both the blood and the fat of animals is consumed as a luxury. But the Lord has given special directions that these should not be eaten. Why? Because their use would make a diseased current of blood in the human system. Disregard of the Lord's special directions has brought a variety of difficulties and diseases upon human beings. . . . If they introduce into their systems that which can not make good flesh and blood, they must endure the results of the disregard of God's word.",
