    "word": "\"God desires to bring men into direct relation with Himself. In all His dealing with human beings, He recognizes the principles of personal responsibility. He seeks to encourage a sense of personal dependence, and to increase the need of personal guidance. His gifts are committed to men as individuals. Every man has been made a steward of sacred trusts; each is to discharge his trust, according to the direction of the Giver; and by each an account of his stewardship must be rendered to God.",
