    "word": "In forming your opinions and choosing your associates let reason and the fear of God be your guide. Be firm in your purpose here, regardless of the opinions which others may entertain concerning you. When God's requirements lead you to an opposite course from that which your associates are pursuing, go resolutely forward, whether you follow many or few. Whatever God's Word condemns, that reject even though the whole world adopt and advocate it. . . .",
