    "word": "It is a painful sight when artisans to whom the Lord has given ability for the most skillful work become exalted because of their skill and aptitude. In the Bible we read that the Lord called men who had qualifications of character, and gave them aptitude and skill in all manner of workmanship for the tabernacle. They were not left to their own human wisdom. God called them to accomplish a work which was to be a special representation of the exalted character of His service, and was also to represent the sacredness of the human temple.",
