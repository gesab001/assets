    "word": "We may claim the blessed assurance, \"I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions\" (Isaiah 44:22). Thy \"sins, which are many, are forgiven\" (Luke 7:47). O how precious, how refreshing, is the sunlight of God's love! The sinner may look upon his sin-stained life, and say, \"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died\" (Romans 8:34). \"Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound\" (Romans 5:20). Christ the Restorer plants a new principle of life in the soul, and that plant grows and produces fruit. The grace of Christ purifies while it pardons, and fits men for a holy heaven. We are to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ until we reach the full stature of men and women in Christ. O that we might all reach the high standard which God has set before us, and no longer remain dwarfs in the religious life! What beams of light would be reflected to the world in good works if we should become light bearers such as God would have us!",
