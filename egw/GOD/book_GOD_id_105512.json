    "word": "I know not how to describe the way in which the Southern field has been presented to me. In this field thousands and thousands of people are living in ignorance of the third angel\u2019s message, and they are right within the shadow of our doors. This field bears testimony to the neglect of a people who should have been wide-awake to work for the Master among all classes, but who have done very little for the colored people of the South. A little work has been done there, it is true; we have touched the field with the tips of our fingers; but not one hundredth part of the work has been done that should be done. God calls upon his people to stand in a right position before Him, to heed the light given fifteen years ago-that the colored people be labored for and helped.",
