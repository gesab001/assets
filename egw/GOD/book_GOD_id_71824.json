    "word": "We are living in a time which calls for decided, sanctified action. Everything that can be done by the followers of Christ should be done, for the enemy will work with all his power to deter souls from receiving the truth. . . . But nevertheless, God's work is to go forward. We are to sow beside all waters, even though we know that many will seek to extinguish the light of truth.--Letter 59, June 5, 1901, to A. G. Daniells.",
