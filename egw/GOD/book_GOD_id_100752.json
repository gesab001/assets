    "word": "Christ is the channel through which alone man can have access to God, and become a partaker of the divine nature. The Lord God gives light to the true, earnest seekers after him, for he giveth them himself. \"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. \"And why? Because God in his own mysterious way communicates himself to the soul. \"The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" God substitutes his ideas for human ideas and inventions, and these ideas are great, noble, and luminous.",
