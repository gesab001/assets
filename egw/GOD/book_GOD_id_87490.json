    "word": "The Lord would have the youth now coming on the stage of action be assured that no irreverent hand must touch the Lord's anointed or do His prophets harm. And not only are the ones sleeping in their graves to be respected, but those who are living also. These men may err, for they are not infallible, but if they confess their mistakes the Lord will forgive their sins, and pardon their transgressions. While they cannot say, We have never sinned, yet if they have the meekness and gentleness of Christ, the Lord will hold them more firmly than they can possibly hold the Lord. None are to boast, or sneer at sacred things. Men may think themselves wise, and in their conceit seek to belittle those whom the God of heaven loves, but in this they reveal that they are not learning in the school of Christ to be meek and lowly in heart.",
