    "word": "There are thousands hungering for the message of pure truth which sanctifies the soul. In Sister Haskell you have a wise teacher of truth. You \n\n\n                                    -408- \n\nboth have a wide understanding of the Scriptures. But you will need to trust firmly in God. The Lord calls upon us as a people to occupy a position that is without fault before Him. You are one in the Lord. Guard yourselves and your influence, considering that you are to be instruments of the Lord for the carrying forward of His sacred work on the earth.--Letter 64, 1911, p. 3. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, August 31, 1911.)",
