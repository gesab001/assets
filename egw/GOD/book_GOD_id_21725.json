    "word": "When the Saviour pointed out to his followers the signs of his return, he foretold the state of backsliding that would exist just prior to his second advent. There would be, as in the days of Noah, the activity and stir of worldly business and pleasure-seeking\u2014buying, selling, planting, building, marrying, and giving in marriage\u2014with forgetfulness of God and the future life. For those living at this time, Christ's admonition is: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.\u201d \u201cWatch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\u201d [Luke 21:34, 36.]",
