    "word": "The priests who officiated before the Lord in the temple were commanded to remove their shoes before entering, lest some particles of dust should be carried in. They were to wash their feet before approaching God. So careful were they to be in regard to their persons that they were not to ascend to the altar by steps, lest some part of the person should be exposed. All these things were to have the most careful attention.",
