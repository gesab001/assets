    "word": "I write to you as I would to my own sons. You are in the place where God would have you. I tell you, my brother, there is no mistake in this matter. I know what I am talking about. Be true to God, and you will do the work He has given you to do with fidelity. God lives and reigns. We have a living and a risen Saviour. He has a care for you.... He has never proved false; He has never deceived you. He will be your guide and deliverer in the most trying circumstances. He will be at your right hand. We are every moment girded with His power and surrounded by His presence as really as were the Israelites in the midst of the divided sea.",
