    "word": "Notwithstanding the rage of persecution, a calm, devout, earnest, patient protest against the prevailing corruption of religious faith continued for centuries to be uttered. The Christians of that early time had only a partial knowledge of the truth, but they had learned to love and obey God's Word, and they patiently suffered for its sake. Like the disciples in apostolic days, many sacrificed their worldly possessions for the cause of Christ. Those who were permitted to dwell in their homes, gladly sheltered their  banished brethren, and when they too were driven forth, they cheerfully accepted the lot of the outcast.

But the number was not small\u2014and among them were men of noble birth as well as the humble and lowly\u2014who bore fearless testimony to the truth in dungeon cells, in \u201cLollard towers,\u201d and in the midst of torture and flame, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to know \u201cthe fellowship of His sufferings.\u201d",
