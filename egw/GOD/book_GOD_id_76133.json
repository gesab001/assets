    "word": "When God sends a message to any person, minister or doctor, if men pursue a course to make of no effect the message sent, a course that destroys the influence of the message that God designed should make a change in the principles of the one corrected, and turn his heart to repentance, it would be better for these men if they had never been born. Wickedness and deceit remain in the one to whom the Lord in mercy sent His message, but they, through Satan's devising, took it upon themselves to justify and vindicate the one whom God had corrected, and he took it upon himself to refuse the message given, and went on, sustained by men who claimed to be the ministers and doctors of the Lord. The one who should have realized his sin and corrected his evil, was presumptuous, and turned from the messages of God to follow his own course, until sin, in deception, in falsehood, in unprincipled working, in underhand dealing, became current. Whether there is any hope of a change, we know not. But all who have built that man up in his crooked course of action, which they know was not justice and righteousness, will suffer with the transgressor, unless they shall humble themselves before God, and show that repentance that needeth not to be repented of. \n                                                                           60",
