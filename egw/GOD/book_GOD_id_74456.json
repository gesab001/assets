    "word": "Paul says that \"as touching the law\"--as far as outward acts were concerned--he was \"blameless,\" but when the spiritual character of the law was discerned, when he looked into the holy mirror, he saw himself a sinner. Judged by a human standard, he had abstained from sin, but when he looked into the depths of God's law, and saw himself as God saw him, he bowed in humiliation, and confessed his guilt.--Review and Herald, July 22, 1890.",
