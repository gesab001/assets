    "word": "There is danger of our religious activity losing in depth as it gains in surface. There is danger of our workers depending upon human agents, upon facilities, and great preparations for work, and losing their firm faith in God, in making every outward show of prosperity, while the work in the heart is neglected. Philanthropy, however widespread, cannot take the place of personal piety. Danger is on every hand, and we need to be constantly depending upon God, that His Holy Spirit may make our hearts pure, unselfish, and quick to hear the orders from above. . . .",
