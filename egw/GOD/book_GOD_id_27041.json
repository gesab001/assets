    "word": "\u201cMany times that night I was at the window watching the weather, and about day-break there was a change, and it commenced snowing. The next evening, about five o'clock, we started on our way to Waukon\u2014brethren E. and H., my husband, and myself. Arriving at Green Vale, Illinois, we held meetings with the brethren there, and were delayed nearly a week by a severe snowstorm. At length we ventured to pursue our journey, and, weary, cold, and hungry, we stopped at a hotel a few miles from the Mississippi River. The next morning, about four o'clock, it commenced raining. We felt urged to go on, and rode through the rain, while the horses broke through the crusted snow at almost every step. We made many inquiries about crossing the river, but no one gave us encouragement that we could cross it. The ice was mostly composed of snow, and there lay upon the top of it about a foot of water. When we came to the river, Bro. H. arose in the sleigh and said, \u2018Is it Iowa, or back to Illinois? We have come to the Red Sea; shall we cross?\u2019 We answered, \u2018Go forward, trusting in Israel's God.\u2019 We ventured upon the ice, praying as we went, and were carried safely across. As \n331\nwe ascended the bank on the Iowa side of the river, we united in praising the Lord.",
