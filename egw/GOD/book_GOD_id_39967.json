    "word": "Christ has said, \u201cWhat things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\u201d Mark 11:24. \u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the \n312\nFather may be glorified in the Son.\u201d John 14:13. And the beloved John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, speaks with great plainness and assurance: \u201cIf we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.\u201d 1 John 5:14, 15. Then press your petition to the Father in the name of Jesus. God will honor that name.",
