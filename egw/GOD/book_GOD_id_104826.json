    "word": "The Lord is soon to come. We must work while the day lasts; for the night is coming, in which no man can work. Many, many have lost the spirit of self-denial and sacrifice. They have been burying their money in temporal possessions. There are \n\n158. \n\nmen whom God has blessed, whom He is testing to see what response they will make to His benefits. They have with-held their tithes and offerings until their debt to the Lord God of hosts has become so great that they grow pale as the thought of rendering to the Lord His own, a just tithe. Make haste, brethren, you have now opportunity to be honest with God; delay not. For your souls' sake no longer rob God in tithes and offerings.",
