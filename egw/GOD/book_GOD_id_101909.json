    "word": "Bro. Henry Kellogg, the Lord has wrought upon your life and character, and you have a love for the truth. Jesus loves you, and he has placed you in a position of trust, connecting you with his sacred work. You might have revealed that the Lord had wrought much, but you \n                                                                           1683\nhave failed to consecrate yourself, soul body and spirit, to God both in home and business life. Especially have you lost much by not taking your place in religious assemblies, placing yourself under the most healthful influences, in the channel of light. The precious opportunities for witnessing for Christ ought never to seem unessential. Do you know that when the people of God assemble to worship him, as earnest active witnesses, they receive a rich blessing. They are Christ's representatives and he is in their midst to bless.",
