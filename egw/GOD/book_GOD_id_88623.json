    "word": "Passed Cheyenne about three o'clock. It is snowing and hailing. I feel like breathing out my heart's desire for the protecting care of God on this journey. When I think that this is the fifteenth time we have passed over this road without accident or harm, I feel grateful to God and trust Him still. He will be our guide and guard on this journey. My heart is grateful, very grateful, for the assurance I have of the presence of God. I love Him; I trust Him; I will praise Him.--Ms. 7, 1880, p. 1. (Diary entry.)",
