    "word": "God has His workmen in every age. The call of the hour is answered by the coming of the man. Thus when the divine Voice cries, \u201cWhom shall I\n27\nsend, and who will go for Us?\u201d the response will come, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Isaiah 6:8. Let all who labor effectually in the canvassing field feel in their hearts that they are doing the work of the Lord in ministering to souls who know not the truth for this time. They are sounding the note of warning in the highways and byways to prepare a people for the great day of the Lord, which is so soon to break upon the world. We have no time to lose. We must encourage this work. Who will go forth now with our publications? The Lord imparts a fitness for the work to every man and woman who will co-operate with divine power. All the requisite talent, courage, perseverance, faith, and tact will come as they put the armor on. A great work is to be done in our world, and human agencies will surely respond to the demand. The world must hear the warning. When the call comes, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\u201d send back the answer clear and distinct, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201dTestimonies, Vol. 6, pages 329-333.",
