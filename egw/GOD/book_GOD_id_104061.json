    "word": "Chap. 22 - Doubting the Testimonies\n[EXTRACT\nFROM A SERMON AT THE GENERAL\nCONFERENCE OF 1883.]\n\nBy Ellen G. White\n\n     When you find men questioning the Testimonies, finding fault with them, and seeking to draw away the people from their influence, be assured that God is not at work through them. It is another spirit. Doubt and unbelief are cherished by those who do not walk circumspectly. They have a painful consciousness that their life will not abide the test of the Spirit of God, whether speaking through His Word or through the Testimonies of His Spirit that would bring them to His Word. Instead of beginning with their own hearts, and coming into harmony with the pure principles of the gospel, they find fault, and condemn the very means that God has chosen to fit up a people to stand in the day of the Lord.",
