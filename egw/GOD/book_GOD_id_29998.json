    "word": "\"In him [Christ] was life; and the life was the light of men.\" It is not physical life that is here specified, but immortality, the life which is exclusively the property of God. The Word, who was with God, and who was God, had this life. Physical life is something which each individual receives. It is not eternal or immortal; for God, the Life-giver, takes it again. Man has no control over his life. But the life of Christ was unborrowed. No one can take this life from Him. \"I lay it down of myself,\" He said. In Him was life, original, unborrowed, underived. This life is not inherent in man. He can possess it only through Christ.",
