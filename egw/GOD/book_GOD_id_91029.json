    "word": "We need to keep our eye single to the glory of God. Our fitness for His service will be found in constant communion with Him. God's messengers must tarry long with God if they would have success. When men consecrate themselves to God, the power which comes alone from God will bring them definite results in their work. We are to act as in the presence of God; His eye is ever upon us; His arm is guiding us. We must die to self before God can use us to His name's glory. If we will learn of Christ as His little children, we shall make a success wherever we are.",
