    "word": "Hygienic Restaurants in Connection with Treatment Rooms \n\n     To return to the question concerning boarding-houses: I have not seen, and cannot now see, any light in opening a boarding-house for the purpose of taking in every tourist that desires merely food and lodging. I have had light, however, that in many cities it is advisable for a restaurant to be connected with treatment rooms. The two can work in harmony, and uphold right principles. In connection with our treatment rooms and restaurants in the cities, it is sometimes advisable to have rooms where we can provide lodgings for the sick. But we are not to erect in the cities immense buildings in which to care for the sick, because of God does not want them to remain in the cities.",
