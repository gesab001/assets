    "word": "Christ points you away from the earthly to the heavenly. He invites you to lay up your treasures above. . . . Will you say as you present your offering to God, Of Thine own, O Lord, we freely give Thee? . . . All the means you may give will not buy for you salvation. You must give yourself. In surrendering yourself to the claims and influences of the Saviour your life may be as a fruitful branch in a beautiful vine. The fruits of the Spirit may adorn it. Clusters of rich graces will appear, such as love, joy, peace, gentleness, goodness, and meekness, which will make it attractive. . . .",
