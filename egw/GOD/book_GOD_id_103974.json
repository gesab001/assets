    "word": "How important that we should be rooted and grounded in the truth! No falsehood is of the truth. The Lord Jesus has promised that if we receive Him by faith and believe in Him as our pattern He will give us \"power to become the sons of God.\" The gospel of Jesus Christ contains the grand principles of all truth, expressed in a life of purity.
