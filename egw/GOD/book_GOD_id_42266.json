    "word": "Wait on the Lord, and again I say, Wait on the Lord. We may ask of the human agents and not receive. We may ask of God and He says, Ye shall receive. Therefore you know to whom to look; you know in whom to trust. You must not trust in man or make flesh your arm. Lean as heavily as you please upon the Mighty One who hath said, \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.\" Then wait and watch and pray and work, keeping your face constantly turned to the Sun of Righteousness.",
