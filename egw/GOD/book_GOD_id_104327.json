    "word": "Pray for the Laborers \n\n     Let everyone do all in his power to help both by his means and by his prayers to carry the burden for the souls for whom the ministers are laboring. Earnest prayer sent up to God for His blessing upon the laborers in the field will follow the laborers as sharp sickles into the harvest field. When the people thus pray for the work, they will not be selfish. They will seek to answer their own prayers by corresponding works. They will not hold the minister preaching to them, but will say to him, Go and carry the truth so precious to us to those who are in error, and our prayers will go with you. This will be a valuable experience to every member of the church.",
