    "word": "The present is a season of solemn privilege and sacred trust to the servants of God. If these trusts are faithfully kept, great will be the reward of the faithful servant when the Master shall say, \u201cGive an account of thy stewardship.\u201d The earnest toil, the unselfish work, the patient, persevering effort, will be rewarded abundantly; Jesus will say, \u201cHenceforth I call you not servants, but friends, guests.\u201d The approval of the Master is not given because of the greatness of the work performed, because many things have been gained, but because of the fidelity in even a few things. It is not the great results we attain, but the motives from which we act, that weigh with God. He prizes goodness and faithfulness more than the greatness of the work accomplished.",
