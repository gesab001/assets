    "word": "Great light and understanding in the Scriptures will not atone for roughness, for thrusts, for bitter words and evident uncharitableness. He who advocates truth in this manner makes a mistake that is fatal to his own soul and to the souls of all those who come in contact with him. Those who advocate truth in this way have need to learn what truth is and what it can do for the soul. How many need to be melted over in the furnace, to have the dross consumed and the image of God stamped upon the soul. He who is thus transformed will not with voice or pen present anything that will seem like a fiery defense. The advocates of truth must lay off the war armor, and be clothed with the garments of Christ, be clothed with humility as with a garment. \n\n\n                                    -208-",
