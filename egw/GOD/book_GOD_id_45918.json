    "word": "Let their mistakes and errors remain where God has put them--cast into the depths of the sea. The less that is said by those who profess to believe present truth, in regard to the past mistakes and errors of the servants of God, the better it will be for their own souls, and for the souls of those whom Christ has purchased with His own blood. Let every voice proclaim the words of the first and the last, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. John heard a voice saying, \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them\" (Revelation 14:13).--The Review and Herald, Nov. 30, 1897. [THIS COUNSEL WAS WRITTEN TO A WORKER WHO HAD PUBLISHED TWO ARTICLES IN THE REVIEW AND HERALD (APRIL 3 AND 10, 1894) UNDER THE TITLE \"DANGER OF ADOPTING EXTREME VIEWS.\"--COMPILERS.]",
