    "word": "Women Missionaries to Be Financially Supported--When I see the great desire shown by men and women to hear the truth, I long earnestly for means to open up the work where the third angel's message has never been heard. We have had some very interesting experiences in Maitland. Our women workers, in giving Bible readings, find families, not always poor, who cannot read. They have taught several persons to read. By the blessing of God these can now read the Word of God for themselves.",
