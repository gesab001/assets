    "word": "Satan Delights in Contention.--Satan is constantly seeking to cause distrust, alienation, and malice among God's people. We shall be often tempted to feel that our rights are invaded when there is no real cause for such feelings. . . . Contentions, strife, and lawsuits between brethren are a disgrace to the cause of truth. Those who take such a course expose the church to the ridicule of her enemies and cause the powers of darkness to triumph. \n\n498 \n     They are piercing the wounds of Christ afresh and putting Him to an open shame.--5T 242, 243 (1882).",
