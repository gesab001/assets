    "word": "I was very sorry my health was so poor when you were with us. I feared I was near the close of my life. I have refused to speak in our churches for months because of the danger from impure air. Again and again I have nearly lost my life addressing people indoors. But my life has been spared because my work was not done. But I am writing, writing now because there is a time of trouble just before us, which we all must meet. This is why I carry the burden I do, for souls are in peril. I do want to save every soul that I possibly can, for if we can save them, they will live through the ceaseless ages of eternity. This is why I have traveled so much to bear my testimony before thousands. I know that the instruction I receive is given me of God, and I would not forbear giving it to the people. I must speak the words I am given to speak.",
