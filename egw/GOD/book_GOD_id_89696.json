    "word": "A large company beheld the events of this day and the day following. Some regard the publicity of Christ's death only as shame and defeat. But this God had appointed.

He was betrayed in the garden of Gethsemane, and He underwent a mock trial in the judgment hall. He was condemned by Pilate. \n\n\n                                    -414- \n\nThe governor declared, \"I find no fault in Him.\" Yet he condemned to death an innocent Man, a God disguised by humanity.",
