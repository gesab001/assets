    "word": "The minister is not to indulge in the relation of anecdotes, but he is to preach the Word. \"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality\" [1 Timothy 5:20, 21]. \"Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity\" [1 Timothy 4:12]. \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth\" [2 Timothy 2:15].",
