    "word": "You must stop inquiring about the duty of others, and go to work for your own soul. Through faith in Christ, you may come to the light. When you view Christ as He is, you will decrease in your own estimation, and He will increase. The words of God spoken to Saul by Samuel are worthy of your consideration; for they apply in your case: \"Obedience is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams; for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.\" You have set yourselves to stoutly resist the light, and the Lord will not compel you to have faith in Christ; but without faith it is impossible to please God. The faith that works by love, and purifies the soul, produces the fruit of humility, patience, forbearance, long suffering, peace, joy, and willing obedience. Says the Scripture, \"Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.\" \"He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.\"",
