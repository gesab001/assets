    "word": "Many seem to feel that religion has a tendency to make its possessor narrow and cramped, but genuine religion does not have a narrowing influence; it is the lack of religion that cramps the faculties and narrows the mind. When a man is narrow, it is an evidence that he needs the grace of God, the heavenly anointing, for a Christian is one whom the Lord, the God of hosts, can work through that He may keep the way of the Lord in the earth, and make manifest His will to men.--Ms 3, 1892, pp. 1-4, 6-9.
