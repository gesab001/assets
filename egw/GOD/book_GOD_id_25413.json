    "word": "As you go through life, you will meet with those whose lot is far from easy. Toil and deprivation, with no hope for better things in the future, make their burden very heavy. . . . Careworn and oppressed, they know not where to turn for relief. Put your whole heart into the work of helping them. It is not God's purpose that His children shall shut themselves up to themselves. Remember that for them, as well as for you, Christ died. Hold out to them a helping hand. . . . Make it a rule never to utter one word of doubt or discouragement. You can do much to brighten the lives of others . . . by words of holy cheer.",
