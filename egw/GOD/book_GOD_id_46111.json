    "word": "FOR MYSELF, I WILL SAY THIS: THAT THE MORE I STUDY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ADVENTIST PEOPLE, THE MORE I FEEL TO HONOR AND PRAISE AND MAGNIFY THE WISDOM OF THE GOD OF HEAVEN WHO GAVE TO A PLAIN MAN LIKE WILLIAM MILLER AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE GREAT TRUTHS OF THE PROPHECIES. IT IS EVIDENT TO ANYONE WHO WILL STUDY HIS EXPLANATION OF PROPHECY THAT WHILE HE HAD THE TRUTH REGARDING THE PRINCIPAL FEATURES, THAT HE ADOPTED AT FIRST MANY INACCURATE AND INCORRECT INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING DETAILS. AT FIRST THESE WERE ACCEPTED BY HIS ASSOCIATES; BUT GOD RAISED UP SCHOLARLY MEN WHO HAD ENJOYED BROADER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDY THAN MILLER, AND THESE MEN BY THEIR STUDY OF THE PROPHECIES AND HISTORY FOUND THE TRUTH REGARDING MANY POINTS IN WHICH MILLER'S EXPOSITION WAS INCORRECT.",
