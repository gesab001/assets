    "word": "The man who seeks to pattern after any man's character will make an utter failure. Each person is to look to God for himself, to trade with conscientious fidelity upon the talents God has given him. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" [Philippians 2:12, 13]. It is in you, brother, in you; not in another for you. You  are to have an individual experience. Then you will have rejoicing in yourself, and not in another.",
