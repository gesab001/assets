    "word": "He sees the past movements you have made, he knows every error and mistake of your life, which has been a hindrance to your spiritual advancement. He seeth not as man seeth; he knoweth the outcome of every \n\n\n                          -20- \n\nmovement, and if you have had little faith mingled with your prayers and movements, cultivate faith and hope and trust in God now, for if there was ever a period that has tried the souls of men in the past, there will be a greater necessity for faith in the times before us. We cannot have a weak faith now; we cannot be safe in a listless, indolent, slothful attitude. Every jot of ability is to be used, and sharp, calm, deep  thinking is to be done. The wisdom of any human agent is not sufficient for the planning and devising in this time. Spread every plan before God, with fasting, with the humbling of the soul before the Lord Jesus, and commit thy ways unto the Lord, and the sure promise is, \"He will direct thy paths.\" He is infinite in resources. The Holy One of Israel, who calls the host of heaven by name, and holds the stars of heaven in position, has you individually in his keeping.",
