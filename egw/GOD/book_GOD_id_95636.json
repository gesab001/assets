    "word": "Some will even sacrifice the claims of friendship to carry out their own ideas, thinking that their wonderful zeal is zeal for the Lord, but their inspiration is not from above. We have need constantly to be watchful and to guard self, lest we press upon others principles which we do not practice ourselves. A domineering, overbearing spirit is not of God, and should not be exercised toward believers or unbelievers, however lowly may be their station. Christians are required to represent Christ in all their dealings with those for whom He has given His precious life.",
