    "word": "I have not received a line from Brother Hickox or from his wife. All that I have heard is from these whom I know are not moving in the counsel of God. I think that it would be best for us to humble our hearts before God, and obtain bowels of mercy, and the incense of sanctified love, and see if this will not change the recipe given to Brother Hickox. I do not speak of him as a perfect man; for he is \n\n\n                                  -65- \n\nthe same as his brethren. He has the same liability to err, and the same need of a teachable spirit. But if you think that the course pursued toward him will enable you to obtain his confidence, and lead him to rely on his brethren, believing that if he makes a mistake, they will have wisdom to help him, you have made a wrong calculation.",
