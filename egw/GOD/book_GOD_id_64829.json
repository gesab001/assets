I have a message from God to you that you need not despair, but return unto the Lord. \"Seek the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon\" (Isaiah 55:6, 7).",
