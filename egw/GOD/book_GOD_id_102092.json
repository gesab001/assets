    "word": "Christ's righteousness has been misrepresented by some in positions of responsibility, who, supposing they were doing God's service, have done things which show that they are spiritually blind. Men have been overbearing and imperious in spirit, and their wrong course of action, their want of principle, will cause them to be denounced by the Lord as surely as the Pharisees were denounced. The woes that fell on the Pharisees will as verily fall on all who are engaged in a like work, unless they repent.",
