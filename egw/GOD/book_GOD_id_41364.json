    "word": "Let men be connected with God's work who will represent His character. They may have much to learn in regard to business management; but if they pray to God as did Daniel, if with true contrition of mind they seek that wisdom which comes from above, the Lord will give them an understanding heart. Read carefully and prayerfully the third chapter of James, especially verses 13-18. The whole chapter is an eye-opener, if men wish to open their eyes.--Lt 55, 1895.",
