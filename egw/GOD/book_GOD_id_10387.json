    "word": "When We May Tire of Giving \n\n     Well, says one, the calls keep coming to give to the cause. I am weary of giving. Are you? Then let me ask, Are you weary of receiving from God's beneficent hand? Not until He ceases to bless you will you cease to be under bonds to return to Him the portion He claims. He blesses you that it may be in your power to bless others. When you are weary of receiving, then you may say, I am weary of so many calls to give.--5T 150.",
