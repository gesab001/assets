    "word": "The desire to grasp large wages, with a determination to deprive others of their God-given rights, has its origin in Satan's mind, and by their obedience to his will and way men place themselves under his banner. Little dependence can be placed on those that have been taken in this snare, unless they are thoroughly converted and renovated; for they have been leavened by wrong principles which they could not perceive were deleterious in their effect.--SpT Series A, No. 10, p 26, Feb 6, 1896.
