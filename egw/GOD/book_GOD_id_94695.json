Christ looked pityingly and compassionately upon the punished, repenting people, \"and He answered and spake unto those that stood before Him, saying [to the angels of God], Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him [Joshua] He said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord stood by. And the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou wilt walk in My ways, and if thou wilt keep My charge, then thou shalt also judge My house, and shalt also keep My courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by\" [Zechariah 3:4-7].",
