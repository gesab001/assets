    "word": "No Commanding--Among the Lord's servants there is to be no commanding.  No yokes are to be placed on the necks of God's blood-bought heritage.  Every yoke is to be broken.  Men and women are more precious in the sight of God than the human mind can estimate.  Christ understands their value; for he sacrificed Himself for their redemption.  We are His property, the purchase of His life-blood.  Sign not away your allegiance to any human jurisdiction or power.  \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20.--Ibid.",
