    "word": "I am made sad to see my brethren cherishing doubts and talking doubts in regard to the light God has been pleased to give them. We shall all have to wrestle with doubts, for this is a constitutional tendency with not a few, while others believe on the simple evidence that God has been pleased to give them. But doubt is the atmosphere which surrounds many souls at the present time. Unbelief and doubts come forth from the lips as readily as their breath, and it is dangerous for the weak in the faith to be in their presence, inhaling the atmosphere which is poison to the soul, for the seeds of doubt soon germinate and bear a harvest of fruit which is dangerous to the health of the soul.",
