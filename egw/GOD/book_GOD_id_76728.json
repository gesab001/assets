    "word": "We have come to have very meagre ideas as to what constitutes the duty of a Christian minister. Many who minister in the sacred desk do not half understand their responsibilities. They are taking things altogether too easy and comfortable; many are in Satan's easy chair, thinking that if they partially copy another minister, they will meet the requirements. There is need of alarm among the ministers, but no one need be hopeless. There is need of self-examination that we may understand whether we are learning the meekness and lowliness of Christ; for we are to follow his example. In our labors we are to bear the same testimony as did Paul. He says: \"Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you in all seasons, serving the Lord in all humility of mind, . . . and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\" \"Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God. Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the flock of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.\" \"I have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\"",
