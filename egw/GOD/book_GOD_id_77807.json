    "word": "Teachers in the home. \n\n\n     \"As wise teachers, parents should labor earnestly for their children, leading them to co-operate with God. They should study carefully and prayerfully how to manifest kindness, courtesy, and love, but not blind affection. True Christian parents are teachers in the home. . . . How startling is the proverb, 'As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined.' This is to be applied to the training of your children. Parents, will you remember that the education of your children from their earliest years is committed to you as a sacred trust?\"--P.C., \"Study for Time and Eternity.\"",
