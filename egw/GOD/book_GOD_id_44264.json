    "word": "The same law was proclaimed in grandeur by His own voice from Sinai. He said: \"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes\" (Deuteronomy 6:6-8). How impatient the transgressors of God's law become when the law is mentioned; they are irritated to have it spoken of.",
