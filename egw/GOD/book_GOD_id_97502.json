    "word": "In the name of whom were you baptized? You went down into the water in the name of the three great Worthies in heaven--the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost you were buried with Christ in baptism; and you were raised up out of the water to live in newness of life. You were to have a new life. You were to live unto God; you were not to live unto yourself, and keep yourself under your own supervision for fear someone would touch you and hurt you.",
