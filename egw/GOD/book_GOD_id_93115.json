    "word": "I want to say to the church in Battle Creek, there is much work to be done in missionary fields. This work men and women can engage in, bringing all their capabilities and all their education with them to do honor to God. Every ray of light, every important truth, is to be imparted to others; for not one child of God will live to himself. All the light God has given is to be diffused.",
