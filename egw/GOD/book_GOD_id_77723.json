    "word": "When the Lord specified that there should be a health and temperance institution at Battle Creek, he also specified what should be its object. It was not to be fashioned after the character of any other institution in the world. It was to stand as a Seventh-day Adventist institution, one that should give character to God's cause in the world. It was also to be an asylum for those who should accept the truth, to which they might resort when sick. It was to be a place where the truth should be made to shine out--not where it should be placed under a bushel. The truth should be the all-important thing in the institution. The Lord designed that it should be a place where he would be honored in word and in deed, where his law should be magnified, where the true faith of the Bible should ever be made prominent before the patrons. \n     1895. \n                                                                           50",
