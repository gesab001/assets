    "word": "September 1, 1902 \n\n     The Time of the End. My mind is deeply stirred. I cannot sleep after eleven o'clock. I long for the gift of the Holy Spirit. My soul panteth after God as the hart panteth after water-brooks. The present condition of our world shows us what we may expect to see in the future. Everything is to be shaken that can be shaken. Men will be placed in positions where they will reveal what human beings will do and what the world will be when God's law is no longer respected.",
