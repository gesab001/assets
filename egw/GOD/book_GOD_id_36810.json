    "word": "God will help us if we take hold of the help He has provided. \"Let him take hold of my strength,\" He says, \"that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.\" Isaiah 27:5. This is a blessed promise. Many times when I have been discouraged and almost in despair, I have come to the Lord with this promise. . . . And as I have laid hold of the strength of God, I have found a peace which passeth understanding.",
