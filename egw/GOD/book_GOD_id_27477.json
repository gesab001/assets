    "word": "\"I do not look to the end for all the happiness; I get happiness as I go along. Notwithstanding I have trials and afflictions, I look away to Jesus. It is in the strait, hard places that He is right by our side, and we can commune with Him, and lay all our burdens upon the Burden Bearer, and say, 'Here, Lord, I cannot carry these burdens longer.' Then He says to us, 'My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.' Matthew 11:30. Do you believe it? I have tested it. I love Him; I love Him. I see in Him matchless charms. And I want to praise Him in the kingdom of God.",
