    "word": "The Lord reproves those who do not watch unto prayer, those who forget that they are wholly dependent upon him and amenable to Him. He reproves those who misrepresent the great Medical Missionary, those who do not keep the way of the Lord, doing their utmost to prepare a people to become members of the family of the redeemed. \n\n\n                             -91- \n\nHe is dishonored by those whose course leads away from Christ and the truth for this time. The Lord desires that our medical workers shall proclaim the last warning message of the gospel. When they leave out the principles of present truth, skepticism runs through their work, and God can not endorse it.",
