    "word": "Christ assures us that he is pledged to intercede in our behalf. Thus He would encourage our faith and our belief in success. He said to His disciples, and the word is for us, \"If he shall ask anything in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. I am beloved by my Father, and for my sake he will refuse you nothing.\" Let us not cease to pray. Let us believe the assurance of the word of God. Let us receive the promise, and say, \"I thank thee, my heavenly Father, that I receive the things I ask of thee.\"--Letter 231, 1899, pp. 1-3. (To Sister S. M. I. Henry, December, 1899.)",
