    "word": "7-11 (Galatians 3:19; Ephesians 2:15; Colossians 2:14; Hebrews 9:9-12;  10:1-7). A Twofold System of Law.--God's people, whom He calls His peculiar treasure, were privileged with a two-fold system of law; the moral and the ceremonial. The one, pointing back to creation to keep in remembrance the living God who made the world, whose claims are binding upon all men in every dispensation, and which will exist through all time and eternity. The other, given because of man's transgression of the moral law, the obedience to which consisted in sacrifices and offerings pointing to the future redemption. Each is clear and distinct from the other.",
