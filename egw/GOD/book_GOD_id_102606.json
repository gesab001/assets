    "word": "The world by wisdom knows not God. The men and women of the world do not realize that they are daily deciding their own destiny, and that it becomes them as believers in His word, to walk very softly before God. Immortality,--a life that measures with the life of God,--is not obtained through human beings, but through Christ, \"who will render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory, and honor, eternal life.\"",
