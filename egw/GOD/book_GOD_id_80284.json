    "word": "Men are to become the subjects of Christ's kingdom. Through the divine power imputed to them, they are to return to their allegiance. By laws and resources God has ordained a heavenly communication with man's spiritual life, that in \n\n\n                    -9- \n\nits action is as mysterious as the science and operation of the wind. (John 3:7, 8.) Christ declared, \"My kingdom is not of this world.\" While it imprints its influence upon earthly governments, it cannot take the slightest imprint from them without marring the divine similitude. So spiritual is the character of God's work upon the human heart that receives it, that it makes every one a new creature, without destroying or weakening any capability God has given to man. It purifies every attribute fit for connection with the divine nature. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit, and when man is born from above, a heavenly peace pervades the soul.",
