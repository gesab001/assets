    "word": "In enabling us to obtain possession of this property, the Lord has certainly brought to the cause a most wonderful opportunity. We praise God with heart and soul and voice. There are five cottages, well fitted up, besides the large building. These are all furnished in the best of style. The smaller cottages are made with wide piazzas running around the four sides, and the windows are so arranged that the beds can be wheeled out on to the veranda. In each cottage there is a bathroom. The larger cottage has two stories, and is furnished throughout with solid red and black mahogany furniture.",
