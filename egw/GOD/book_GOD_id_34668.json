    "word": "Many refuse to obey God's commandments, yet they make a great deal of faith. But faith must have a foundation. God's promises are all made upon conditions. If we do His will, if we walk in truth, then we may ask what we will, and it shall be done unto us. While we earnestly endeavor to be obedient, God will hear our petitions; but He will not bless us in disobedience. If we choose to disobey His commandments, we may cry, \"Faith, faith, only have faith,\" and the response will come back from the sure word of God, \"Faith without works is dead.\" Such faith will only be as sounding brass and as a tinkling cymbal.",
