    "word": "Mistakes will occur in every institution, but if the managers will learn the lesson all must learn--to move guardedly--these errors will not be repeated, and God will preside over the work. Every worker in our institutions needs to make the Word of God his rule of action. Then the blessing of God will rest on him. He cannot with safety dispense with the truth of God as his guide and monitor. If \n\n156 \n\nman can take one breath without being dependent upon God, then he may lay aside God's pure, holy Word as Guidebook. The truth must take control of the conscience and the understanding in all the work that is done. The Holy Spirit must preside over thought and word and deed. It is to direct in all temporal and spiritual actions.--Lt 81, 1896. (SpTWWPP 50, 51.)",
