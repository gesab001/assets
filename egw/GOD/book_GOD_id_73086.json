    "word": "Talent of Singing--One night I seemed to be in a council meeting where these matters [the place to give messages of warning and instruction] were being talked over. And a very grave, dignified man said, \"You are praying for the Lord to raise up men and women of talent to give themselves to the work. You have talent in your midst which needs to be recognized.\" Several wise propositions were made and then words were spoken in substance as I write them. He said, \"I call your attention to the singing talent which should be cultivated; for the human voice in singing is one of God's entrusted talents to be employed to His glory. The enemy of righteousness makes a great account of this talent in his service. And that which is the gift of God, to be a blessing \n                                                                           409\nto souls, is perverted, misapplied, and serves the purpose of Satan. This talent of voice is a blessing if consecrated to the Lord to serve His cause. _______ has talent, but it is not appreciated. Her position should be considered and her talent will attract the people, and they will hear the message of truth.--Ev 497, 498.",
