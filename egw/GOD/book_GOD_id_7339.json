    "word": "\"Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, . . . Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the Lord. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment.\" Here God contrasts the obedience of the Rechabites with the disobedience and rebellion of His people, who will not receive His words of reproof and warning. . . . The Rechabites were commended for their ready and willing obedience, while God's people refused to be reproved by their prophets.",
