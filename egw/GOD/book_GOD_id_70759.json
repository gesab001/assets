    "word": "Angels Help Us Do Right\n     Learn to trust in God. Learn to go to Him who is mighty to save. . . . Tell the dear Saviour just what you need. He that said, \u201cSuffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not,\u201d will not reject your prayer. But He will send His angels to guard you and protect you from the evil angels, and will make it easy for you to do right. Then it will be much easier than if you should try in your own strength. You may ever feel like this: \u201cI have asked God to help me, and He will do it. I will do right in His strength. I will not grieve the dear angels\n19\nthat God has appointed to watch over me. I will never take a course to drive them from me.\u201d\u2014AY 55, 56.",
