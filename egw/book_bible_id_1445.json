{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     \\93Be instant in season, out of season.\\94 [2 Timothy 4:2.] To be \\93instant in season,\\94 is to be alert to the privileges of the house and hour of worship and to the time when men are conversing on the topics of religion. And \\93out of season,\\94 when you are at the fireside, in the field, by the way-side, in the market, seek to be ready to turn the thoughts of men, in a suitable and wise manner, to the great themes of the Bible. With tender and fervent spirit urge the claims of God upon the soul. Many, many precious opportunities are allowed to slip by unimproved, because men are persuaded that it is out of season. But who knows what might be the effect of a wise appeal to the \n275\nconscience, by using the word of God that will accomplish that for which God has given it? It is written, \\93In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.\\94 [Ecclesiastes 11:6.] He who is sowing seeds of eternal truth may bear a burdened heart, and send up prayers with supplication and tears, but he will come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 274}
