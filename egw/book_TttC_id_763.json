    "word": "Satan has come unperceived through these sciences and has poisoned the minds of thousands and led them to infidelity. He is well pleased to have the knowledge of these sciences widespread. It is a plan which he himself has laid \n                                                                           291\nthat he may gain access to minds and influence them as he pleases. While it is believed that one human mind so wonderfully affects another, Satan, ready at hand, insinuates himself and works on the right hand and on the left. And while those devoted to these sciences laud them to the heavens because of the great and good works they affirm are wrought by them, they are cherishing and glorifying Satan himself, who steps in and works with all power and signs and lying wonders--with all deceivableness of unrighteousness. Said the angel: \"Mark its influence. The controversy between Christ and Satan is not yet ended.\" This entering in of Satan through the sciences is well devised by his Satanic majesty, and in the minds of thousands will eventually destroy true faith in Christ's being the Messiah, the Son of God.",
