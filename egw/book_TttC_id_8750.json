    "word": "Just before us is the closing struggle of the great controversy when, with \"all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness,\" Satan is to work to misrepresent the character of God, that he may \"seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.\" If there was ever a people in need of constantly increasing light from heaven, it is the people that, in this time of peril, God has called to be the depositaries of His holy law and to vindicate His character before the world. Those to whom has been committed a trust so sacred must be spiritualized, elevated, vitalized, by the truths they profess to believe. Never did the church more sorely need, and never was God more solicitous that she should enjoy, the experience described in Paul's letter to the Colossians when he wrote: We \"do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.\" \n\n                                               -",
