{"word": "We are to follow the example set by Christ, and make Him our pattern, until we shall have the same love for others as He has manifested for us. He seeks to impress us with this profound lesson of love. . . . If your hearts have been given to selfishness, let Christ imbue you with His love. He desires that we shall love Him fully, and encourages, yes, even commands, that we shall love others as He has given us an example. He has made love the badge of our discipleship. . . . This is the measurement to which you are to reach,\\97\\94Love one another; as I have loved you.\\94 What height, what depth and breadth of love! This love is not simply to embrace a few favorites, it is to reach to the lowliest and humblest of God\\92s creatures. Jesus says, \\93Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\\94 . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 27}
