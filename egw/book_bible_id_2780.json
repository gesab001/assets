{"word": "I call upon the children and youth to empty their minds of foolish vanities, and make Jesus their everlasting friend. Be sure you have a well-grounded hope. . . . It is insanity to be quiet and at ease as so many are at the present time, having no assurance that they are indeed sons and daughters of God. Eternal interests are at stake. Put away that story, fall upon your knees in prayer for strength to overcome temptations, and devote your time to searching the Bible. . . . You need not remain in suspense; true light shines from God's Word upon all hearts that are open to receive its precious rays; and it is your privilege to say, \"I know that my redeemer liveth.\" Job 19:25.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OHC", "page": 202}
