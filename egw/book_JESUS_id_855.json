It was God\\92s design that the men who delivered Jesus should hear the testimony of His innocence. \\93I find no fault in him,\\94 Pilate declared. And Judas, throwing at the feet of the priests the money he had received for betraying Christ, bore testimony, \\93I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.\\94", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 269}
