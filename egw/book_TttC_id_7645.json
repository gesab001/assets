    "word": "Praise the Lord in the congregation of His people. When the word of the Lord was spoken to the Hebrews anciently, the command was: \"And let all the people say, Amen.\" When the ark of the covenant was brought into the city of David, and a psalm of joy and triumph was chanted, \"all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord.\" This fervent response was an evidence that they understood the word spoken and joined in the worship of God.",
