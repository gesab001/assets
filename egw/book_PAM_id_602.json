{"word": "Members should consider it a privilege and a blessing for the church to have a school building.--Brethren and sisters, what will you do to help build a church school? We believe that every one will regard it as a privilege and a blessing to have this school building. Let us catch the spirit of the work, saying, \"We will arise and build.\" If all will take hold of the work unitedly, we shall soon have a schoolhouse in which from day to day our children will be taught the way of the Lord. As we do our best, the blessing of God will rest upon us. Shall we not arise and build?--3SM 213.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 239}
