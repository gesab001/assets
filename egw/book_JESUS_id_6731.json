{"word": "\"And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you\" (Luke 24:36). . . . Here we have before us the precious evidence that Christ is a living Saviour. A little while before, He was enclosed in Joseph's new tomb, but He had burst the bands of death and walked forth a triumphant conqueror. . . . The angel of God said, He is risen. Wonderful testimony! The hope of the world! Christ had risen and their Saviour was a risen Saviour! . . . Christ had obtained the victory, and although man had fallen and was condemned to death, yet he could live again. Those who sleep in Jesus will be called from their prison house . . . to a glorious immortality. . . . He has risen, dear friends, and in your despondency you may know . . . that Jesus is by your side to give you peace.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 353}
