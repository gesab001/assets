We may see and condemn the faults of others, while we have greater faults which we have never realized, but which are distinctly seen by others.

The world has not enough true Christians; the church has need of them; society cannot spare them. Christ's prayer for His disciples was: \"I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\" Jesus knows we are in the world, exposed to its temptations, but He loves us and will give us grace to triumph over its corrupting influences. He would have us perfect in character, that our waywardness may not occasion moral deformity in others.",
