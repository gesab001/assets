{"word": "None of us should go to the camp meeting [regional meetings] depending on the ministers or the Bible workers to make the meeting a blessing to us. God does not want His people to hang their weight on the minister. He does not want them to be weakened by depending on human beings for help. They are not to lean, like helpless children, upon someone else as a prop. As a steward of the grace of God, every church member should feel personal responsibility to have life and root in himself.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 248}
