{"word": "Let us study our Bibles, and teach the words of truth. Let us do as Christ's apostles did; let us offer prayer for the sick, for there are many who cannot have the advantages of our sanitariums. The Lord will remove infirmities in answer to prayer. Gospel ministers should be able to present the subject of health reform in its simplicity. If this phase of present truth is presented in a clear, simple, Christlike manner, it will have an effect upon the people. There will be a response from many hearts.-- Letter 128, 1909.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 242}
