{"word": "We all need to exercise wisdom in eating. If more food is eaten than can be digested and appropriated, a decaying mass accumulates in the stomach, causing an offensive breath and a bad taste in the mouth. The vital powers are exhausted in an effort to throw off the excess, and the brain is robbed of nerve force. Less food would have nourished the system, and not wasted its powers in overwork. Yet wholesome food should be supplied, sufficient in quantity and quality to nourish the system. If we follow the Bible rule, \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God,\" we shall not indulge appetite at the expense of the physical health, which it is our duty to preserve.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 425}
