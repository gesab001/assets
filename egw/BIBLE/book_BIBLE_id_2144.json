{"word": "\"Be courteous,\" is a Bible injunction. We all have our peculiar temperaments. Some have very quick tempers; some are inclined to be morose, some stubborn, and others coarse and rough, unkind in words. Therefore we need to cultivate our tempers, take ourselves in hand. . . .Soften whatever is harsh in your temper and burnish off the rough edges of your character.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 296}
