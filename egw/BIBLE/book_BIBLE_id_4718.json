{"word": "As a man He lived upon earth. As a man He ascended to heaven. As a man He is the substitute of humanity. As a man He liveth to make intercession for us. As a man He will come again with kingly power and glory to receive those who love Him, and for whom He is now preparing a place. We should rejoice and give thanks that God \"hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained\" (Acts 17:31).--Bible Echo, Nov. 1, 1892.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 368}
