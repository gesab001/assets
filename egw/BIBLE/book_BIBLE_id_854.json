{"word": "Study of the Bible Develops the Intellect.--\"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\" The Word of God should be made the great educating power. How shall students know the truth, except by a close, earnest, persevering study of the Word? Here is the grand stimulus, the hidden force which quickens the mental and physical powers, and directs the life into right channels. Here in the Word is wisdom, poetry, history, biography, and the most profound philosophy. Here is a study that quickens the mind into a vigorous and healthy life, and awakens it to the highest exercise. It is impossible to study the Bible with a humble, teachable spirit, without developing and strengthening the intellect. Those who become best acquainted with the wisdom and purpose of God as revealed in His Word become men and women of mental strength; and they may become efficient workers with the great Educator, Jesus Christ.--FE 432 (1896).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 80}
