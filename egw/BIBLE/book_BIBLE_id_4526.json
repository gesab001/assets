{"word": "The Millennial Judgment\n     During the thousand years between the first and the second resurrection, the judgment of the wicked takes place. Daniel declares that when the Ancient of\n288\ndays came, \\93judgment was given to the saints of the Most High.\\94 At this time the righteous reign as kings and priests unto God. John in the Revelation says, \\93I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.\\94 \\93They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.\\94 It is at this time that, as foretold by Paul, \\93the saints shall judge the world.\\94 In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according to the deeds done in the body. Satan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and His people.\\97SW, March 14, 1905.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TA", "page": 287}
