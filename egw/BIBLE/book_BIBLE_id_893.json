{"word": "Women Reaching Out to Other Women.--Women can learn what needs to be done to reach other women. There are women who are especially adapted for the work of giving Bible readings, and they are very successful in presenting the Word of God in its simplicity to others. They become a great blessing in reaching mothers and their daughters. This is a sacred work, and those engaged in it should receive encouragement.--MM 140 (1910).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 228}
