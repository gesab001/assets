The questions that the disciples brought to the Saviour after the crowds had dispersed and the teachings that He then explained more fully to them are essential for the multitudes today to understand and obey.

Belief in the grand truths He presented will work a reformation in all who truly receive them.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 362}
