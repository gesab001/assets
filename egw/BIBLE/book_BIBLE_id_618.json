{"word": "Drifting From Bible Landmarks \n\n\n     Many know so little about their Bibles that they are unsettled in the faith. They remove the old landmarks, and fallacies and winds of doctrine blow them hither and thither. Science, falsely so called, is wearing away the foundation of Christian principle; and those who were once in the faith drift away from the Bible landmarks, and divorce themselves from God, while still claiming to be His children.--Review and Herald, Dec. 29, 1896.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 35}
