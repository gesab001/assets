{"word": "Precious Gems in Mines of Truth \n\n     After the crucifixion and the resurrection of Christ, His disciples listened with wonder and amazement to His lessons of truth; for they seemed as new ideas to them; but He told them, \"These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you.... Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures\" (Luke 24:44, 45). The truth is constantly unfolding and presenting new features to different minds. All who dig in the mines of truth, will constantly discover rich and precious gems. We are anxious that all who claim to believe the truth now open before us, and especially those who take the responsibility of teaching the truth to others, should have a clearer conception themselves of the all-important significance of the themes of the Bible.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 404}
