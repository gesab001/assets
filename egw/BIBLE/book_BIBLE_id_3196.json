{"word": "Danger Attends New Experience \n\n     I have seen that danger attends every new phase of experience in the church, because some hear things with such a strong spirit. While some teachers may be strong \n                                                                           363\nand efficient in teaching in the lines of Bible doctrines, they will not all be men who have a knowledge of practical life and can advise perplexed minds with surety and safety. They do not discern the perplexing situation that must necessarily come to every family who shall make a change. Therefore, let all be careful what they say; if they know not the mind of God in some matters, let them never speak from a guess or suppose so. If they know nothing definite, let them say so, and let the individual rely wholly upon God. Let there be much praying done, and even with fasting, that not one shall move in darkness, but move in the light as God is in the light. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 362}
