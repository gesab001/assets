{"word": "Christ, the great Medical Missionary, is no longer in our world in person. But He has not left the world in darkness. To His subjects He has given the commission, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,\" \"teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" The great questions of Bible truth are to enter into the very heart of society, to reform and convert men and women, bringing them to see the great necessity of preparing for the mansions that Christ told His disciples He would prepare for those that love Him. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 327}
