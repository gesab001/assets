{"word": "Its advocates teach that the law of God is a grievous yoke. and that by faith in Christ, men are released from all obligation to keep his Father's commandments. Bible sanctification is a conformity to the will of God, attained by rendering obedience to his law, through faith in his Son. Our Saviour prayed for his disciples, \"Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.\" [John 17:17.] There is no genuine sanctification except through obedience to the truth; and the psalmist declares, \"Thy law is the truth.\" [Psalm 119:142.] The law of God is the only standard of moral perfection. That law was exemplified in the life of Christ. He says, \"I have kept my Father's commandments.\" [John 15:10.] And the apostle John affirms, \"He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.\" And again, \"This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.\" [1 John 2:6;  5:3.] Those who love God will love his commandments also. The truly sanctified heart is in harmony with the divine precepts; for they are \"holy, and just, and good.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 299}
