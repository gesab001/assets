{"word": "The ten commandments were spoken by God himself, and were written by his own hand. They are of divine, and not human composition. But the Bible, with its God-given truths expressed in the language of men, presents a union of the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the nature of Christ, who was the Son of God and \nd\nthe Son of man. Thus it is true of the Bible, as it was of Christ, that \\93the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\\94 John 1:14.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 0}
