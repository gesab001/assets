{"word": "Chap. 3 - The Holy Scriptures\n\n      How Shall We Search the Scriptures? [GOSPEL \n          WORKERS, 1893 EDITION, PAGES 125-131.] \n\n\n     How shall we search the Scriptures in order to understand what they teach? We should come to the investigation of God's word with a contrite heart, a teachable and prayerful spirit. We are not to think, as did the Jews, that our own ideas and opinions are infallible; nor with the papists, that certain individuals are the sole guardians of truth and knowledge, that men have no right to search the Scriptures for themselves, but must accept the explanations given by the fathers of the church. We should not study the Bible for the purpose of sustaining our preconceived opinions, but with the single object of learning what God has said.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 105}
