Those who have dwelt mostly upon the prophecies and the theoretical points of our faith, should without delay become Bible students upon practical subjects. They should take a deeper draught at the \n183\nfountain of divine truth.

They should be imbued with the spirit of their great Exemplar, and have a high sense of the sacred life of a follower of Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 182}
