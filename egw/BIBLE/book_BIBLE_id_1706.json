{"word": "It was apostasy that led the early church to seek the aid of the civil government, and this prepared the way for the development of the papacy,\\97the beast. Said Paul, There shall \n444\n\\93come a falling away, . . . and that man of sin be revealed.\\94 [2 Thessalonians 2:3] So apostasy in the church will prepare the way for the image to the beast. And the Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord there will exist a state of religious declension similar to that in the first centuries. \\93In the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\\94 [2 Timothy 3:1-5] \\93Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\\94 [1 Timothy 4:1.] Satan will work \\93with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.\\94 And all that \\93received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,\\94 will be left to accept \\93strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.\\94 [2 Thessalonians 2:9-11.] When this state of ungodliness shall be reached, the same results will follow as in the first centuries.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 443}
