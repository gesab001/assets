{"word": "Grythyttehed\n     Sabbath and Sunday, October 24 and 25, we spent at Grythyttehed, a village surrounded by forests, nearly a hundred and fifty miles north-west from Stockholm. Here we were kindly cared for at the hospitable home of Bro. and Sister Hedin. This brother had in former years been a man of dissipated habits; and as the result, he was poor in every sense. When the truth was preached here, he received it, and it began its work in his life and character. He became temperate and industrious, and began to prosper in his business, so that he now keeps several men in his employ. He desired to entertain the ministers that visited them; but his house was small, and his family large, and it was often necessary for the ministering brethren to find a place among strangers. Such was Bro. Hedin's love for the truth, that he hired money to build a good-sized two-story house where he could have room to receive the Lord's servants. Two large chambers, comfortably furnished, and provided with stoves and writing-tables, are kept for their use. This brother's history shows what Bible truth can do for a man. It elevates, ennobles, and refines him; it will fit him for the society of holy angels in the kingdom of God.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 194}
