{"word": "That the expression, \\93bottomless pit,\\94 represents the earth in a state of confusion and darkness, is evident from other scriptures. Concerning the condition of the earth \\93in the beginning,\\94 the Bible record says that it \\93was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.\\94 [GENESIS 1:2; THE WORD HERE TRANSLATED \\93DEEP\\94 IS THE SAME THAT IN REVELATION 20:1-3 IS RENDERED \\93BOTTOMLESS PIT.\"] \n659\nProphecy teaches that it will be brought back, partially, at least, to this condition. Looking forward to the great day of God, the prophet Jeremiah declares: \\93I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down.\\94 [Jeremiah 4:23-27.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 658}
