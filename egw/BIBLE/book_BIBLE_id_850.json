{"word": "All to Reach High Standard of Excellence.--The Bible should be a book for study. The precious pearls of truth do not lie upon the surface, to be found by a careless, uninterested reader. Christ knew what was best for us, of whatever age, when He commanded us, \"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.\" Jesus, the greatest teacher the world ever knew, would have men and women and children and youth reach the highest standard of excellence of character. He would have them become fully developed mentally, morally, and physically.--RH, Nov. 9, 1886.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 78}
