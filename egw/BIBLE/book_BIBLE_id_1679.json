{"word": "The announcement which had been made by the disciples in the name of the Lord was in every particular correct, and the events to which it pointed were even then taking place. \\93The time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at hand,\\94 had been their message. At the expiration of \\93the time\\94\\97the sixty-nine weeks of Daniel 9, which were to \n347\nextend to the Messiah, \\93the Anointed One\\94\\97Christ had received the anointing of the Spirit, after his baptism by John in Jordan. And the \\93kingdom of God\\94 which they had declared to be at hand, was established by the death of Christ. This kingdom was not, as they had been taught to believe, an earthly empire. Nor was it that future, immortal kingdom which shall be set up when \\93the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High;\\94 that everlasting kingdom, in which \\93all dominions shall serve and obey him.\\94 [Daniel 7:27.] As used in the Bible, the expression \\93kingdom of God\\94 is employed to designate both the kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory. The kingdom of grace is brought to view by Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews. After pointing to Christ, the compassionate intercessor who is \\93touched with the feeling of our infirmities,\\94 the apostle says, \\93Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace.\\94 [Hebrews 4:16.] The throne of grace represents the kingdom of grace; for the existence of a throne implies the existence of a kingdom. In many of his parables, Christ uses the expression, \\93the kingdom of Heaven,\\94 to designate the work of divine grace upon the hearts of men.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 346}
