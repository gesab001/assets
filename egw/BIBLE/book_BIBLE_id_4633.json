{"word": "But let the children of believers have our first consideration. There are among Sabbathkeepers very many large families of children that are not properly cared for. Many parents give evidence that they have not learned of Christ the lessons that would make them safe guardians of children. Their children do not receive proper training. And there are among us many children whom death has deprived of the parents' care. There are those who might take some of these children and seek to mold and fashion their characters according to Bible principles.--Manuscript 35, 1896.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 232}
