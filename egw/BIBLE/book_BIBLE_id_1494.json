But who knows what might be the effect of a wise appeal to the conscience? It is written, \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.\" [Ecclesiastes 11:6.] He who is sowing the seeds of truth may bear a burdened heart, and at times his efforts may seem to be without result.
