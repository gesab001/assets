{"word": "The leading men in our college should be men of piety and devotion. They should make the Bible the rule and guide of life, giving heed to the sure word of prophecy as to \"a light that shineth in a dark place.\" Not one of us should dare to be off guard for a moment, for \"in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.\" It is only those who continue faithful in well-doing that shall reap the reward. Much that has no part in Christ is allowed a place among us. Unconsecrated ministers, professors, and teachers assist Satan to plant his banner in our very strongholds.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 12}
