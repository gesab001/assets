He manifested great interest while we were praying, responding to \n299\nour prayers, saying, \\93Amen! Praise the Lord! Glory to God! I will praise him, for he is worthy to be praised! His name is Jesus, and he will save us from our sins!\\94 He prayed earnestly and in faith for a full consecration to God's will, to be baptized with his Spirit, and purified by his blood. Said he, \\93Thou hast forgiven me all my sins. Thou hast sanctified me to thyself, and I will honor thee as long as I have breath.\\94 His face shone, and he looked very happy. He said that the room seemed light, and he loved us all. After we arose from prayers he said, \\93Anna, I love you, come here.\\94 She went to his bedside, and he embraced her, and said, \\93I am very happy, the Lord has blessed me.\\94 Nathaniel was triumphant in God through the day, although he was very sick. I remained in his room and entertained him by reading the Bible and conversing with him. As I read he would say, \\93How appropriate that is! How beautiful! I must remember that!\\94", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LS88", "page": 298}
