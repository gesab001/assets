{"word": "A Preparation for the Ministry\nSome men whom God was calling to the work of the ministry have entered the field as canvassers. I have been instructed that this is an excellent preparation if their object is to disseminate light, to bring the truths of God's word directly to the home circle. In conversation the way will often be opened for them to speak of the religion of the Bible. If the work is entered upon as it should be, families will be visited, the workers will manifest Christian tenderness and love for souls, and great\n84\ngood will be the result. This will be an excellent experience for any who have the ministry in view.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CEv", "page": 83}
