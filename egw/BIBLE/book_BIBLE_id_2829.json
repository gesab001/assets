{"word": "The work must not be hindered through prejudice caused by national customs.--There must be a firm determination on the part of our laborers to break with the established customs of the people whenever it is essential to the advancement of the work of God. The work might be much farther advanced in Europe if some of those who have embraced the truth were not so wedded to the habits and customs of nationalities. They plead that the efforts of our ministers must be made to conform to these customs and prejudices, or nothing will be accomplished. This has had a binding influence upon the work from its commencement. The effort that has been made to conform to English customs, to eat and drink English, to dress and sleep English, has circumscribed the work, and it is now years behind what it might have been. The effort to keep bound about by French customs and ideas has hindered the work in France. My heart aches as I hear our brethren say, Such an one does not understand how to labor for these nationalities. Does not God know what the people need? and will He not direct His servants? Is not the truth one? Are not the teachings of the Bible one? Let God give His messengers the word to speak, and His blessing will not fail to attend their labors.--RH Dec. 8, 1885.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 94}
