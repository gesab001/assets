{"word": "ASIDE FROM THE GREAT VOLUME OF INSPIRATION\\97THE BIBLE\\97NO OTHER BOOK PRESENTS A MORE WONDERFUL AND INTENSELY INTERESTING HISTORY OF THE PRESENT DISPENSATION, TO THE COMPLETE RESTITUTION OF ALL THINGS, THAN THE VOLUME HERE OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC. AND AS THE CLOSING SCENES OF THIS WORLD'S HISTORY ARE OF THE MOST THRILLING AND MOMENTOUS NATURE, THESE ARE MORE PARTICULARLY DWELT UPON IN THIS WORK. THE READER, AS HE FOLLOWS THE NARRATIVE, BEGINNING WITH A SKETCH OF OUR LORD'S GREAT PROPHECY IN MATTHEW 24, WILL FIND HIMSELF ENTERING INTO NEW SYMPATHY WITH THE CHURCH IN HER WARFARE AND HER SUFFERINGS, AS SHE PASSES ON TO HER PROMISED REDEMPTION; AND THE SOUL OF EVERY BELIEVER WILL KINDLE AT THE VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE FINAL TRIUMPH OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD, THE DESTRUCTION OF SATAN AND ALL HIS FOLLOWERS, THE TOTAL AND ETERNAL EXTIRPATION OF EVIL FROM THE UNIVERSE, AND THE RENOVATION OF THE EARTH AS THE EVERLASTING INHERITANCE OF THE SAINTS, WHEN THIS GREAT CONTROVERSY IS CONCLUDED.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 0}
