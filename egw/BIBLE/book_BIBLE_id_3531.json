{"word": "In their labors for the Protestant churches, Wm. Miller and his companions encountered a spirit of hatred and opposition little less bitter than that which Luther experienced from Rome. By Romanists in Luther's time, and by Protestants in the time of Miller, fables, false theories, human forms and customs, were received and honored in place of the teachings of the word of truth. In the sixteenth century the Roman Church withheld the Scriptures from the people; in the nineteenth century, when Bibles are scattered everywhere like leaves of autumn, the Protestant churches teach that an important part of the sacred word--and that portion which brings to view truths especially applicable to our time--is sealed, and cannot be understood.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 210}
