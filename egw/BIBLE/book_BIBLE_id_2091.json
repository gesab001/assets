{"word": "I showed the importance of temperate habits by citing warnings and examples from Bible history. Nadab and Abihu were men in holy office; but by the use of wine their minds became so beclouded that they could not distinguish between sacred and common things. By the offering of \\93strange fire,\\94 they disregarded God's command, and they were slain by his judgments. The Lord, through Moses, expressly prohibited the use of wine and strong drink by those who were to minister in holy things, that they might \\93put difference between holy and unholy,\\94 and might teach \\93the statutes which the Lord hath spoken.\\94 The effect of intoxicating liquors is to weaken the body, confuse the mind, and debase the morals. All who occupied positions of responsibility were to be men of strict temperance, that their minds might be clear to discriminate between right and wrong, that they might possess firmness of principle, and wisdom to administer justice and to show mercy.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 208}
