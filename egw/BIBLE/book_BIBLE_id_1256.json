{"word": "Young Christian, you have everything to learn. You must be an interested student of the Bible; you must search it, comparing scripture with scripture. If you would do your Master good and acceptable service, you must know what He requires. His word is a sure guide; if it is carefully studied, there is no danger of falling under the power of the temptations that surround the youth, and crowd in upon them.--The Youth's Instructor, September 10, 1884.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 94}
