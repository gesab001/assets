{"word": "IN VERMONT\n \n     In the spring of 1850 we decided to visit Vermont and Maine. I left my little Edson, then nine months\n134\nold, in the care of Sister Bonfoey, while we went on our way to do the will of God. We labored very hard, suffering many privations to accomplish but little. We found the brethren and sisters in a scattered and confused state. Almost everyone was affected by some error, and all seemed zealous for their own opinions. We often suffered intense anguish of mind in meeting with so few who were ready to listen to Bible truth, while they eagerly cherished error and fanaticism. We were obliged to make a tedious route of forty miles by stage to get to Sutton, the place of our appointment.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 133}
