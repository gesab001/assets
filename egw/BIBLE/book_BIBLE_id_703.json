{"word": "Our schools are to be as the schools of the prophets. In them the truths of the Bible are to be earnestly studied. If rightly brought before the mind and thoughtfully dwelt upon, these truths will give the students a desire for that which is infinitely higher than worldly amusement. \n                                                                           354\nAs they draw near to God, becoming partakers of the divine nature, earthborn amusements will sink into nothingness. The minds of the students will take a higher turn, and beholding the character of Jesus, they will strive to be like Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 353}
