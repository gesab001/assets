{"word": "We have every endowment of capability, every facility provided for discharging the duties devolving upon us; and we should be grateful to God that by His mercy we have these advantages, and that we possess the knowledge of His grace and of present truth and duty. Are you, then, as teachers, trying to maintain the false education you have received? Are you losing the precious opportunities granted you to become better acquainted with God's plans and methods?

Do you believe the Bible and heed what it says? Do you believe that we are living in the last days of this earth's history? And have you hearts that can feel? We have a large work before us; we are to be bearers of the sacred light of the word, which is to illume all nations. We are Christians, and what are we doing?", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "6T", "page": 158}
