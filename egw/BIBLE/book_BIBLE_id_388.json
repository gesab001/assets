{"word": "Be Bible Students\nWe have a grand work to do for the Master, to open the word of God to those who are in the\n50\ndarkness of error. Young friends, act as though you had a sacred charge. You should be Bible students, ever ready to give to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you. By your true Christian dignity give evidence that you know you have a truth that it is for the interest of the people to hear. If this truth is inwrought in the soul, it will manifest itself in the countenance and demeanor, in a calm, noble self-possession and peace which the Christian alone can possess.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CEv", "page": 49}
