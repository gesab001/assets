{"word": "If we will let it speak to us, the Bible will teach us what nothing else can teach. But alas! everything else is dwelt upon except the word of God. Worthless literature, fictitious stories, are greedily devoured, while the Bible, with all its treasures of sacred truth, lies neglected upon our tables. The Sacred Word, if made the rule of life, will refine, elevate, and sanctify. It is the voice of God to man. Will we heed it?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 257}
