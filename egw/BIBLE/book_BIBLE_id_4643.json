{"word": "If you search the Scriptures with a meek and teachable spirit, your efforts will be richly rewarded. \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\" (1 Corinthians 2:14). The Bible should be studied with prayer. We should pray as did David, \"Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law\" (Psalm 119:18). No man can have insight into the Word of God without the illumination of the Holy Spirit. If we will but come into the right position before God, His light will shine upon us in rich, clear rays.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 23}
