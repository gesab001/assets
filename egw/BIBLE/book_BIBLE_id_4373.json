{"word": "The same beautiful and expressive figures are carried throughout the Bible. Centuries before the advent of Christ, Moses pointed to Him as the rock of Israel's salvation; the psalmist sung of Him as \"my redeemer,\" \"the rock of my strength,\" \"the rock that is higher than I,\" \"a rock of habitation,\" \"rock of my heart,\" \"rock of my refuge.\" In David's song His grace is pictured also as the cool, \"still waters,\" amid green pastures, beside which the heavenly Shepherd leads His flock. Again, \"Thou shalt make them,\" he says, \"drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life.\" And the wise man declares, \"The wellspring of wisdom {is} as a flowing brook.\" To Jeremiah, Christ is \"the fountain of living waters\"; to Zechariah, \"a fountain opened . . . for sin and for uncleanness.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 24}
