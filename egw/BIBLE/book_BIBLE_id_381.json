{"word": "Parents may well inquire, \\93Who is sufficient for these things?\\94 God alone is their sufficiency; and if they do not seek his aid and counsel, hopeless indeed is their task. But by prayer, by the study of the Bible, and by earnest zeal on their part, they may succeed nobly in this important duty, and be repaid a hundred-fold for all their time and care. Gossiping and anxiety concerning the external appearance have often taken the precious time that should have been devoted to prayer for wisdom and strength from God to fulfill this most sacred trust. Fathers and mothers who are wise unto salvation will seek to make their surroundings such that they will be favorable to the formation of correct character in their children. The source of wisdom is open to them, and from it they may draw the knowledge which they need. The Bible, a volume rich in instruction, should be their text-book. If they train their children according to its precepts, they are not only setting their young feet in the right path, but are educating themselves in their holy duties as well.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTBH", "page": 138}
