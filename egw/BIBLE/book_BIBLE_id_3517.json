{"word": "Said John Wesley, referring to the charges against himself and his associates: \"Some allege that the doctrines of these men are false, erroneous, and enthusiastic; that they are new and unheard-of till of late; that they are Quakerism, fanaticism, popery. This whole pretense has been already cut up by the roots, it having been shown at large that every branch of this doctrine is the plain doctrine of Scripture interpreted by our own church. Therefore it cannot be false or erroneous, provided the Scripture be true.\" \"Others allege that their doctrines are too strict; they make the way to Heaven too narrow; and this is in truth the original objection, as it was almost the only one for some time, and is secretly at the bottom of a thousand more which appear in various forms. But do they make the way to Heaven any narrower than our Lord and his apostles made it? Is their doctrine stricter than that of the Bible? Consider only a few plain texts: 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.' [Luke 10:27.] 'Every idle \n                                                                           179\nword that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of Judgment.' [Matthew 12:36.] 'Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.' [1 Corinthians 10:31.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 178}
