{"word": "But that which above all other considerations should lead us to prize the Bible, is that in it is revealed to men the will of God. Here we learn the object of our creation, and the means by which that object may be attained. We learn how to improve wisely the present life, and how to secure the future life. No other book can satisfy the questionings of the mind or the cravings of the heart. By obtaining a knowledge of God's word and giving heed thereto, men may rise from the lowest depths of degradation to become the sons of God, the associates of sinless angels.--\"Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students,\" pp. 52-54.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 264}
