{"word": "Chap. 13 - Our Church Paper\n\n     Every Article to Reflect Light.--I am instructed to say to those who edit our denominational  papers that they are to print all the matter possible dealing with the affirmative side of Bible truth. They are to give the trumpet a certain sound. Let every article that is printed in the Review and Herald be of a character that will reflect light amid the moral darkness of this world. Every column is to be filled with the precious truth.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CW", "page": 105}
