{"word": "We frequently have brought to our notice cases of youth who are bewildered by the teachers and the ministry of the Word in the churches of today, because they are doing as the Jewish nation did, \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\" . . . The Bible is taken as a whole [as] the Word of God, but not all the Inspired Word. One wise man questions some portions of it and some other wise, supposed good man questions another book, and infidelity is stealthily making itself a place in the minds of youth. Soon the knowledge of the truth weakens and their faith is confused. They do not know what to believe. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 370}
