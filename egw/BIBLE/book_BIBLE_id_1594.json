{"word": "When enemies appealed to custom and tradition, or to the assertions and authority of the pope, Luther met them with the Bible, and the Bible only. Here were arguments which they could not answer; therefore the slaves of formalism and superstition clamored for his blood, as the Jews had clamored for the blood of Christ. \\93He is a heretic,\\94 cried the Roman zealots; \\93it is a sin to allow him to live an hour longer! Away with him at once to the scaffold!\\94 But Luther did not fall a prey to their fury. God had a work for him to do, and angels of Heaven were sent to protect him. Many, however, who had received from Luther the precious light, were made the objects of Satan's wrath, and for the truth's sake fearlessly suffered torture and death.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 132}
