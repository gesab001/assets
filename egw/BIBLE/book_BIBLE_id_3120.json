WHITE LEFT THE CARE OF HER WRITINGS TO FIVE CHURCH LEADERS, WHOM SHE NAMED, APPOINTING THEM AS A SELF-PERPETUATING BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF HER LITERARY ESTATE. ONE OF THE DUTIES ASSIGNED TO THIS BOARD WAS \"THE PRINTING OF COMPILATIONS FROM MY MANUSCRIPTS.\"  BEGINNING IN THE 1920S, MANY COMPILATIONS WERE PRODUCED, GIVING INSPIRED COUNSEL ON SINGLE TOPICS SUCH AS HEALTH, GOSPEL WORK, STEWARDSHIP, OR HOME LIFE.\n   THE THREE VOLUMES OF THE SELECTED MESSAGES SERIES DEPART FROM THIS PATTERN.  THESE BOOKS RESEMBLE THE TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH IN THAT THEY INCLUDE WRITINGS ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS, SUCH AS HOW INSPIRATION WORKS, REVIVAL AND REFORMATION, AND THE DANGER OF SPECULATIONS, EXTREME VIEWS, AND TIME-SETTING.  THEY ALSO CONTAIN INSTRUCTION ON HEALTHFUL LIVING, THE USE OF DRUGS AND REMEDIAL AGENCIES, PREPARING FOR LAST-DAY EVENTS, AND OTHER PRACTICAL TOPICS ON HOW TO HONOR GOD IN ALL ASPECTS OF DAILY LIFE.\n   MORE THAN HALF OF THE PRESENT VOLUME FOCUSES DIRECTLY ON JESUS, EMPHASIZING THE FACT THAT HE IS THE TRUE CENTER OF ALL DOCTRINE, TEACHING, AND EXPERIENCE.  TOPICS COVERED INCLUDE THE INCARNATION, THE TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, CHRIST AS CREATOR AND LIFE-GIVER, CHRIST OUR DIVINE SIN-BEARER, AND CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\n   THE SOURCES FROM WHICH THESE COUNSELS WERE DRAWN INCLUDE PERIODICAL ARTICLES, OUT-OF-PRINT PAMPHLETS AND TRACTS, THE NOTEBOOK LEAFLETS SERIES, AND MRS. WHITE'S LETTERS AND MANUSCRIPTS.  AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN, THE SELECTIONS WERE NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHER, BUT IN THIS AND THE OTHER TWO VOLUMES OF SELECTED MESSAGES THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR EASY ACCESS AND BALANCED PRESENTATION.  WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF SPACE, THE COMPILERS HAVE ENDEAVORED TO INCLUDE AS MUCH CONTEXT AS WOULD BE RELEVANT AND HELPFUL.\n   THIS VOLUME WAS COMPILED IN THE OFFICES OF THE WHITE ESTATE BY ITS STAFF UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE ELLEN G. WHITE ESTATE.  INTRODUCTORY STATEMENTS THAT APPEAR AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SECTION GIVE BACKGROUND ON THE SUBJECTS INTRODUCED, AND ARE SIGNED BY THIS BOARD.  EXPLANATORY NOTES, APPROVED BY THE TRUSTEES, ARE SIGNED \"COMPILERS.\"\n   THAT THIS VOLUME MAY HELP THE CHURCH ACCOMPLISH ITS GOD-ASSIGNED TASK IS THE SINCERE PRAYER AND DESIRE OF THE PUBLISHERS AND\n\n                               THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE\n                                  ELLEN G. WHITE ESTATE\n\n\nChap. 1 - The Inspiration of the Prophetic Writers\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n     STATEMENTS PENNED BY ELLEN G. WHITE, REGARDING HER WORK AS THE MESSENGER OF THE LORD AND CONCERNING THE PROCESSES BY WHICH GOD COMMUNICATES HIS WILL TO MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN FAMILY, ARE ALWAYS HELPFUL AND INTERESTING. SUCH ARE PRESENTED IN THIS OPENING SECTION OF SELECTED MESSAGES.\n      ALTHOUGH THE QUESTION OF INSPIRATION WAS TOUCHED ON AT INTERVALS THROUGH HER SEVENTY YEARS OF MINISTRY, THE OUTSTANDING PRESENTATION IS THE AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION TO THE GREAT CONTROVERSY (NOT APPEARING HERE) WRITTEN IN MAY, 1888. AN EARLIER STATEMENT, \"OBJECTIONS TO THE BIBLE,\" PENNED IN 1886, IS PUBLISHED HEREIN, AND ANOTHER, \"THE INSPIRATION OF THE WORD OF GOD,\" WRITTEN IN THE AUTUMN OF 1888, IS ALSO PRESENTED HERE. A FOURTH MAJOR STATEMENT, \"THE MYSTERIES OF THE BIBLE A PROOF OF ITS INSPIRATION,\" WAS PUBLISHED IN 1889 AND MAY BE FOUND IN TESTIMONIES, VOLUME 5, PAGES 698-711.\n     VARIOUS EXPLANATIONS ABOUT HER WORK, THE REPUBLICATION OF THE 1913 TRACT \"THE WRITING AND SENDING OUT OF THE TESTIMONIES TO THE CHURCH,\" AND MRS. WHITE'S ANSWERS TO CERTAIN QUESTIONS AND CHARGES CONCERNING HER EARLIER WRITINGS ROUND OUT THE SECTION DEVOTED TO \"THE LIGHT ON OUR PATHWAY.\"--WHITE TRUSTEES.\n\n        The Inspiration of the Word of God \n\n     This is a time when the question with all propriety may be asked, \"When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\" (Luke 18:8).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 15}
