{"word": "Of all the gifts which God has given to man, none is more precious than the gift of speech, if it is sanctified by the Holy Spirit. It is with the tongue that we convince and persuade: with it we offer prayer and praise to God, and with it we convey rich thoughts of the Redeemer's love. Those who are fitted to enlighten minds will often have opportunity to read from the Bible or from books which teach the truth, and thus bring the evidence to enlighten souls.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 179}
