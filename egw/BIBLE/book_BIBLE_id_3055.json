{"word": "The Bible contains all the principles that men need to understand in order to be fitted either for this life or the life to come. And these principles may be understood by all. No one with a spirit to appreciate its teaching can read a single passage from the Bible without gaining from it some helpful thought. But the most valuable teaching of the Bible is not to be gained by occasional or disconnected study. Its great system of truth is not so presented as to be discerned by the hasty or careless reader. . . . The truths that go to make up the great whole must be searched out and gathered up, \"here are little, and there are little\" (Isaiah 28:10).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 162}
