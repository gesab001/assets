{"word": "Ezra became a mouthpiece for God, educating those about him in the principles that govern heaven.... Whether near the court of the king of Medo-Persia or at Jerusalem, his principal work was that of a teacher. As he communicated to others the truths he learned, his capacity for labor increased. He became a man of piety and zeal. He was the Lord's witness to the world of the power of Bible truth to ennoble the daily life.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CC", "page": 259}
