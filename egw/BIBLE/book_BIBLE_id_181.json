{"word": "The Bible is God\\92s great director. It is a lamp to our feet, a light to our path. It flashes its light ahead, that we may see the path by which we are traveling; and its rays are thrown back on past history, showing the most perfect harmony in that which to the mind in darkness appears like error and discord. In that which seems to the worldling an inexplicable mystery, God\\92s children see light and beauty. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 328}
