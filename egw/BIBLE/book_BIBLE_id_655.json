{"word": "High Aims \n\n     God would not have us in any sense behind in educational work. Our colleges should be far in advance in the highest kind of education. . . . If we do not have schools for our youth, they will attend other seminaries and colleges, and will be exposed to infidel sentiments, to cavilings and questionings concerning the inspiration of the Bible. There is a great deal of talk concerning higher education, and many suppose that higher education consists wholly in an education in science and literature; but this is not all. The highest education includes the knowledge of the word of God, and is comprehended in the words, \"That they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou has sent.\" John 17:3.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 45}
