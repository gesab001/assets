{"word": "On his return to England, Wesley, under the instruction \n256\nof a Moravian preacher, arrived at a clearer understanding of Bible faith. He was convinced that he must renounce all dependence upon his own works for salvation, and must trust wholly to the \\93Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.\\94 At a meeting of the Moravian society in London, a statement was read from Luther, describing the change which the Spirit of God works in the heart of the believer. As Wesley listened, faith was kindled in his soul. \\93I felt my heart strangely warmed,\\94 he says. \\93I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.\\94", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 255}
