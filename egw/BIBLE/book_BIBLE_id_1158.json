{"word": "Ministers Not to Engage in Secular Affairs.--I wish to say to Brethren _____ and _____ that their work is largely among unbelievers. Those who are successful expositors of Bible truth are to stand before those who have not heard the message for this time. These brethren whose names I have mentioned have a work to do in our camp meetings, which are to be held in the large cities. But they are in danger of disqualifying themselves for doing the work that God has given them to do. Elder _____ will surely lose his bearings unless he ceases to interest himself in work that God does not require him to do, work that demands attention to business details. By engaging in secular work he would not be doing that which has been appointed him by God. The proclamation of the gospel message will be his light and life.--Manuscript 105, 1902.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 654}
