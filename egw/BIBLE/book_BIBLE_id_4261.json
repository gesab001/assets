{"word": "We must have an increase of faith, else we can not be renewed in the divine image, and love and obey the requirements of God. Let the prayer go forth from unfeigned lips, \\93Lord, increase my faith; give me divine enlightenment; for without help from thee I can do nothing.\\94 Come in humility and bow before God; open before the Lord your Bibles, containing the divine promises; take your position upon them; make a covenant with God that you will answer His requirements; tell Him you will believe, without any other evidence except the naked promise. This is not presumption; but unless you work with zeal, unless you are earnest and determined, Satan will obtain the advantage, and you will be left in unbelief and darkness. The words and promises of God are the only foundation of our faith. Take the Word of God as truth, as a living, speaking voice to you, and obey faithfully every requirement. God is faithful, who hath promised. He will work with the efforts of superintendents and teachers. Our blessings are limited by the weakness of our faith. God is not unwilling to bestow; He is a reservoir of power. We must cherish meekness and lowliness of heart. \n29\nWe may have rich evidences of His love and mercy daily in our self-denying efforts to do others good. I entreat the workers in our Sabbath-schools to put on the whole armor of God, and, as faithful soldiers of Jesus Christ, show their fidelity. God will reward every word that is done to His glory.\\97S. S. W., April, 1886.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSS", "page": 28}
