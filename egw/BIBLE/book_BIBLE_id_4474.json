{"word": "In the days of Christ the rabbis put a forced, mystical construction upon many portions of Scripture. Because the plain teaching of God\\92s Word condemned their practices, they tried to destroy its force. The same thing is done today. The Word of God is made to appear mysterious and obscure in order to excuse transgression of His law. Christ rebuked these practices in His day. He taught that the Word of God was to be understood by all. He pointed to the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority, and we should do the same. The Bible is to be presented as the word of the infinite God, as the end of all controversy and the foundation of all faith.\\97Christ\\92s Object Lessons, pp. 38-40.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 123}
