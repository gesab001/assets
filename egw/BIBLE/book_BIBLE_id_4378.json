{"word": "Are those who know the truth for this time anchored in Bible doctrines? Are our weapons, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" \"It is written\"? Is our anchor cast within the vail? Are we individually rooted and grounded in gospel truth so that we may be established, strengthened, and settled in the faith? Are we, as those who have the knowledge of the mysteries of God, those to whom God has committed the living oracles, loyal and true to our stewardship? Those who are truly converted will reveal, as missionaries for God, what the truth means to them in its transforming efficiency and sanctifying power.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 129}
