{"word": "The Spirit of God, with its vivifying power, must be in every human agent, that every spiritual muscle and sinew may be in exercise. Without the Holy Spirit, without the breath of God, there is torpidity of conscience, loss of spiritual life. Many who are without spiritual life have their names on the church records, but they are not written in the Lamb's book of life. They may be joined to the church, but they are not united to the Lord. They may be diligent in the performance of a certain set of duties, and may be regarded as living men; but many are among those who have \"a name that thou livest, and art dead\" (Revelation 3:1).--The SDA Bible Commentary, Ellen G. White Comments, vol. 4, pp. 1165, 1166.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 45}
