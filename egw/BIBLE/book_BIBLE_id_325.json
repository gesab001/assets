{"word": "There is a cause for alarm in the condition of the religious world today. God's mercy has been trifled with. The multitude make void the law of Jehovah, \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\" Infidelity prevails in many of the churches in our land; not infidelity in its broadest sense,--an open denial of the Bible,--but an infidelity that is robed in the garb of Christianity, while it is undermining faith in the Bible as a revelation from God. Fervent devotion and vital piety have given place to hollow formalism. As the result, apostasy and sensualism prevail. Christ declared, \"As it was in the days of Lot, . . . even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.\" The daily record of passing events testifies to the fulfillment of His words. The world is fast becoming ripe for destruction. Soon the judgments of God are to be poured out, and sin and sinners are to be consumed.--Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 166.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 56}
