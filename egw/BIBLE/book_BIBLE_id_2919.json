{"word": "OUR UNDERSTANDING OF GOD\\92S WORD EXPANDED.\\97No man is safe for a day or an hour without prayer. Especially should we entreat the Lord for wisdom to understand His word. Here are revealed the wiles of the tempter and the means by which he may be successfully resisted. Satan is an expert in quoting Scripture, placing his own interpretation upon passages, by which he hopes to cause us to stumble. We should study the Bible with humility of heart, never losing sight of our dependence upon God. While we must constantly guard against the devices of Satan, we should pray in faith continually: \\93Lead us not into temptation.\\94(The Great Controversy, 530.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 95}
