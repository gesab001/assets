{"word": "In the pressroom of the new publishing house at Basel she recognized one of these places. A few months after this, during her visit to Norway, she recognized in the pressroom of the Christiania publishing house another of these places; and six years later, during her visit to Australia, she saw, in the Bible Echo Office in Melbourne, still another pressroom where she recognized the place and the presses as among those she had seen in the vision at Battle Creek, Jan. 3, 1875. [A FEW MONTHS AFTER ELLEN WHITE HAD THIS VISION, HER HUSBAND WROTE, \"IT IS A PLEASURE HERE TO STATE RELATIVE TO THE GRACIOUS MANIFESTATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO MRS. WHITE ON THE EVE OF JANUARY 3, 1875, THAT SHE HAD BEEN SICK WITH SEVERE INFLUENZA, AND CONFINED TO HER ROOM AND BED FOR ONE WEEK, TILL THE PHYSICIANS AT THE HEALTH INSTITUTE HAD BECOME ANXIOUS IN HER CASE. IN THIS CONDITION SHE FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE OF JAMES, AND AFTER A GREAT STRETCH OF FAITH, LIKE THE MAN IN THE GOSPEL WHO STRETCHED FORTH HIS WITHERED HAND, SHE REACHED THE POINT OF DELIVERANCE FROM PAIN AND SICKNESS, AND WAS SOON IN VISION, WHICH LASTED TEN MINUTES. SHE THEN DRESSED FOR MEETING, WALKED TO THE CHURCH, AND SPOKE TO THE CROWDED ASSEMBLY TWENTY MINUTES, AND WALKED HOME. SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAS WRITTEN VERY MUCH, AND HAS SPOKEN TO THE PEOPLE WITH FREEDOM.\"--JAMES WHITE, 3T 570, FOOTNOTE.]", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 35}
