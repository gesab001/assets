{"word": "Those who profess to be servants of the living God, must be willing to be servants of all, instead of being exalted above the brethren, and they must possess a kind courteous spirit. If they err, they should be ready to confess thoroughly. Honesty of intention cannot stand as an excuse for not confessing errors. Confession would not lessen the confidence of the church in the messenger, and he would set a good example, a spirit of confession would be encouraged in the church, and sweet union would be the result. I have seen that those who profess to be teachers, should be patterns of piety, meekness, and of great humility, possessing a kind spirit, to win souls to Jesus, and the truth of the Bible. A minister of Christ should be pure in conversation and in actions. He should ever bear in mind that he is handling words of inspiration, words of a holy God. He must bear in mind that the flock is entrusted to his care, and he is to bear their cases to Jesus, and plead for them as Jesus pleads for us to the Father. I was pointed back to the children of Israel anciently, and saw how pure and holy the ministers of the Sanctuary had to be, because they were brought by their work into a close connection with God. They that should minister, must be holy, pure and without blemish, or God would destroy them. I saw that God had not \n                                                                           22\nchanged. He was just as holy and pure, just as particular as ever he was. He changeth not! Those who profess to be the ministers of Jesus, should be men of experience and deep piety, and then at all times, and in all places they can shed a holy influence.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ExV54", "page": 21}
