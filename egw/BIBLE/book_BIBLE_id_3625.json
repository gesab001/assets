{"word": "Sunday morning we met with the brethren. My husband arose to preach on the parable of the ten virgins. He had no freedom in speaking, and proposed that we have a season of prayer. We bowed before the Lord and engaged in earnest prayer. The dark cloud was lifted, and I was taken off in vision, and again shown the case of this woman. She was represented to me to be in perfect darkness. Jesus frowned upon her and her husband. That withering frown caused me to tremble. I saw that she had acted the hypocrite, professed holiness, while her heart was full of corruption. After I came out of vision I related what I had seen with trembling, yet with faithfulness. I was severely tried, and troubled for the people of God. Would those present believe the testimony? The woman put on a calm appearance and said, \"I am glad the Lord knows my heart. He knows that I love him.\" Then her husband rose in anger, and laying his hand on the Bible said, \"The Bible is all we want, I shall not give up the Bible for visions.\" His wife affected to check him, saying, \"Don't husband, dear, don't talk, the Lord knows me, and will take care of it all.\" Then she vindicated \n                                                                           126\nherself, saying, \"If my heart could only be opened that you might see it.\" I knew the minds of some were unsettled, whether to believe the vision, or let her appearance weigh against the testimony borne, for her appearance was perfectly calculated to get sympathy. I had discharged a painful duty and God would take care of the result. As we left, she said she had no hard feelings against me, and that she should pray for me, and if I got to heaven I should see her there. We returned with Bro. Preston's family, and that night the Lord met with us. I believed that the Lord would show his people the truth, and justify the vision. The neighbors said that I had abused the poor woman.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 125}
