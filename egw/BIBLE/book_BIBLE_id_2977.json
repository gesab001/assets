{"word": "Using Your Influence on the Side of Truth.--There will be seasons of severe trial for those connected with our institutions; but if you know the Source of your strength, you need not be overcome. Whatever influence God has given you, He requires you to throw on the side of truth, of godliness. In making men, women, and children better by pointing them to the cross of Calvary, you are doing the work He has given you to do. True Bible Christians will have an influence that will lead other minds. You, as Christians, have a weight of responsibility which no one can take from you.--Lt 74, 1896.
