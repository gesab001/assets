{"word": "IN ONE OF HER EARLIEST VISIONS, SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD\n4\nELLEN HARMON (WHITE) WAS GIVEN AN UNUSUAL MESSAGE. IT WAS FEBRUARY, 1845. WHEN CHRIST HAD NOT RETURNED TO THIS EARTH AS EXPECTED A FEW MONTHS EARLIER, THE DISAPPOINTED ADVENTISTS WERE DIVIDED AND CONFUSED. THROUGH BIBLE STUDY SOME OF THEM FOUND AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS DISAPPOINTMENT. VISIONS GIVEN TO ELLEN HARMON HELPED TO CONFIRM THEIR CONCLUSIONS. THEY DISCOVERED BIBLE TRUTHS THAT HAD LARGELY BEEN IGNORED WHILE THEIR ATTENTION HAD BEEN FOCUSED ON PREPARATION FOR CHRIST'S RETURN. BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF ADVENTISTS REJECTED ALL SUCH STUDY OR EXPLANATION.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "NL", "page": 4}
