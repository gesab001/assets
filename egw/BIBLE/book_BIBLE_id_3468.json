{"word": "The lesson book, the Bible, contains the instruction of the character they must have, the moral excellence of character which must be cultivated, which God and heaven require. \"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\" \"Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.\" \"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins: and in him is no sin.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 234}
