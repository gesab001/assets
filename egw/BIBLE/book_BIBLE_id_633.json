{"word": "Faith in God's Promises \n\n     We must have an increase of faith, else we cannot be renewed in the divine image, and love and obey the requirements of God. Let the prayer go forth from unfeigned lips, \"Lord, increase my faith; give me divine enlightenment; for without help from Thee I can do nothing.\" Come in humility and bow before God; open before the Lord your Bibles, containing the divine promises; take your position upon them; make a covenant with God that you will answer His requirements; tell Him you will believe, without any other evidence except the naked promise. This is not presumption; but unless you work with zeal, unless you are earnest and determined, Satan will obtain the advantage, and you will be left in unbelief and darkness.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 72}
