{"word": "Teach Them to Do Evangelistic Work.--The Lord calls upon those connected with our sanitariums, publishing houses, and schools to teach the youth to do evangelistic work. Our time and energy must not be so largely employed in establishing sanitariums, food stores, and restaurants that other lines of work will be neglected. Young men and young women who should be engaged in the ministry, in Bible work, and in the canvassing work should not be bound down to mechanical employment.--Review and Herald, May 16, 1912.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 24}
