{"word": "The last message of mercy is to be given to the world by the proclamation of gospel truth. Truth, Bible truth--this is what the people need. On our knees we are to claim the promises of God's Word, asking that we may receive pure, unadulterated truth, and that we may realize the necessity of giving this truth to others. Then men and women will be converted. The hand of God will be recognized in the raising up of new churches. The Lord will baptize with the apostolic spirit many who will go forth to do missionary work in places where the people know not the truth.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 123}
