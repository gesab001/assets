    "word": "Pride and weakness of faith are depriving many of the rich blessings of God. There are many who, unless they humble their hearts before the Lord, will be surprised and disappointed when the cry is heard: \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh.\" Matthew 25:6. They have the theory of the truth, but they have no oil in their vessels with their lamps.  Our faith at this time must not stop with an assent to, or belief in, the theory of the third angel's message. We must have the oil of the grace of Christ that will feed the lamp and cause the light of life to shine forth, showing the way to those who are in darkness.",
