    "word": "Many youth as well as older sisters appear shy of religious conversation. They do not appreciate their opportunities. They close the windows of the soul that should be opened heavenward, and open their windows wide earthward. But when they see the excellence of the human soul they will close the windows earthward, which depend on worldly amusements and associations in folly and sin, and will open the windows heavenward to behold spiritual things. The word of God must be their assurance, their hope, their peace. Then they can say: \"I will receive the light of the Sun of Righteousness, that it may shine forth to others.\" \n                                                                           115",
