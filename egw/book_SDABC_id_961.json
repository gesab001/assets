    "word": "11 (Hosea 12:7). Religion With Deceitful Balances an Abomination.--Fraud in any business transaction is a grievous sin in God's sight; for the goods men are handling belong to Him, and must be used to the glory of His name if men would be pure and clean in His sight. The religion that carries in its hand the scant measure and the deceitful balance is an abomination in the sight of God. He who cherishes such a religion will be brought to confusion; for God is  a jealous God (Letter 8, 1901).",
