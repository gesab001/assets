    "word": "You have a very good estimate of yourself, but you have a work to do that no other man can do for you. Your nature must be changed, and there must be a transformation of the entire being. You love the truth in word, but not in deed. You love the Lord a little, but your riches more. Would the Master say to you, if He should find you as you are at the present time: \"Well done, good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\"? What joy is here referred to? \"Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\" The joy that was set before Jesus was that of seeing souls redeemed by the sacrifice of His glory, His honor, His riches, and His own life. The salvation of man was His joy. When all the redeemed shall be gathered into the kingdom of God, He will see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied.",
