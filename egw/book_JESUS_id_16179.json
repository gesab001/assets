In the place of carrying your supposed grievances to Ira K, a poor, erring, sinful mortal, to obtain sympathy, take your grievances to Jesus. He has invited you, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" [Matthew 11:28-30].--Letter 23a, 1890.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TSB", "page": 140}
