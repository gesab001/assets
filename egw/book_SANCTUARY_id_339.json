The sanctuary in Heaven is the very center of Christ's work in behalf of men. It concerns every soul \n489\nliving upon the earth.

It is of the utmost importance that all should thoroughly investigate these subjects, and be able to give an answer to every one that asketh them a reason of the hope that is in them.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 488}
