    "word": "God has repeatedly shown that persons should not be encouraged into the field without unmistakable evidence that He has called them. The Lord will not entrust the burden for his flock to unqualified individuals. Those whom God calls must be men of deep experience, tried and proved, men of sound judgment, men who will dare to reprove sin in the spirit of meekness, men who understand how to feed the flock. God knows the heart, and He knows whom to select. Brother and Sister A may decide in this matter, and be all wrong. Your judgment is imperfect, and can be no evidence in this matter. I saw that you were drawing off from the church, and if you continue to do so, you will have enough of it; for God will let you go, to suffer by following your own way.",
