{"word": "52, 53 (see EGW on ch. 28:2-4). Resurrection Known to Priests and Rulers.--The captives brought up from the graves at the time of the resurrection of Jesus were His trophies as a conquering Prince. Thus He attested His victory over death and the grave; thus He gave a pledge and an earnest of the resurrection of all the righteous dead. Those who were called from their graves went into the city, and appeared unto many in their resurrected forms, and testified that Jesus had indeed risen from the dead, and that they had risen with Him. . . .", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1109}
