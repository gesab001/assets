{"word": "Brethren, cling to your Bible, as it reads, and stop your criticisms in regard to its validity, and obey the Word, and not one of you will be lost. The ingenuity of men has been exercised for ages to measure the Word of God by their finite minds and limited comprehension. If the Lord, the Author of the living oracles, would throw back the curtain and reveal His wisdom and His glory before them, they would shrink into nothingness and exclaim as did Isaiah, \"I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips\" (Isaiah 6:5).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 18}
