{"word": "I plead before the angel that God would save his people who had gone astray, to save them for his mercy's sake. I saw that those who continued to break the Holy Sabbath, when the plagues begin to fall, will not open their mouths to plead those excuses that they now make to get rid of it. Their mouths will be closed while the plagues are falling, and the great Law-giver is requiring justice of those who have had his holy law in derision, and have called it \\93a curse to man,\\94 \\93miserable,\\94 \\93rickety,\\94 &c. And when they feel the iron grasp of this law, taking hold of them, these expressions will appear before them in living characters, and they will then \n54\nrealize the sin of having that law in derision, that the word of God calls, \\93holy, just, and good.\\94", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ExV", "page": 53}
