{"word": "It requires the faith that works by love and purifies the soul to meet the mind of God. There are those who believe in Christ; they do not think Him an impostor; they believe the Bible to be a revelation of His divine character.

They have not opened the heart to let Jesus in.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 307}
