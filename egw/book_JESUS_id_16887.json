{"word": "Good character does not come by chance; it is formed by persevering, untiring effort. The youth should seek to make all that is possible of themselves, by improving every entrusted talent and capability to the glory of God. The world's Redeemer says, \"Without me ye can do nothing\" (John 15:5). Faith in Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour will give strength and solidity to your character. Those who have faith in Christ will be sober-minded, ever remembering that God's eye is upon them, that angels of God are watching to see what manner of characters they will develop. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 233}
