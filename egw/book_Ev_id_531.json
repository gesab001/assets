{"word": "Printed Sermons And Literature \n\n     The Effective Use of Literature.--The truth must be published far more extensively than it yet has been. It must be defined in clear, sharp lines before the people. It must be presented in short but conclusive arguments, and plans must be laid that at every meeting where the truth has been set before the people, it may be followed by the distribution of tracts and pamphlets. At the present time it may be found necessary to give these away, but they will be a power for good, and nothing will be lost.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 159}
