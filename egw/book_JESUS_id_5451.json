{"word": "302\n     Those who are appointed to open the work in new fields should be careful that their defects are not exalted as virtues, thus retarding the work of God. It is testing truths that we are bringing before the people, and in every effort these truths should be presented in their real beauty. The laborer should not throw about the truth the peculiarities of his own character, or manner. Keep self in the background; let it be lost sight of in Jesus. Let the work of God bear the impress of the divine.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 302}
