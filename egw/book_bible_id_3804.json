{"word": "I saw that it is God's plan that these riches should be used properly, distributed to bless the needy, and to advance the work of God. If men love their riches better than they love their fellow men, better than they love God or the truths of His word, if their hearts are on their riches, they cannot have eternal life. They would rather yield the truth than sell and give to the poor. Here they are proved to see how much they love God, how much they love the truth; and, like the young man in the Bible, many go away sorrowful because they cannot have their riches and a treasure in heaven, too. They cannot have both; and they venture to risk their chance of eternal life for a worldly possession.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 172}
