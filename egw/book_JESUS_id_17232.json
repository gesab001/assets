{"word": "At times as I see a cloud in the sky, I involuntarily exclaim, \"Come, Lord Jesus, and come quickly.\" Such times as this will reveal character. I long to see the deceptive power of the enemy broken. But we will not let our faith fail. The only real comfort I find is to look beyond this conflict, and see the final triumph, the glory of God reflecting brightness on the overcomers. Prophecy points out the sure result of the conflict, and by faith we may see it. I long to realize the experiences opened before me in the visions the Lord has given to me.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 198}
