{"word": "Halls and Church Building Problems.--Go to New York City. Look the ground over carefully, and see whether it is advisable to purchase the hall and the land on which it stands. Perhaps the land could be leased for a term of years. I have been instructed that some such methods will have to be followed in the work in the large cities. If, after careful consideration, you decide that it is best to purchase the hall, we shall do all in our power to raise the money. But it is best to move understandingly. Pray, pray, pray, for if possible Satan will close the doors which have opened for the entrance of truth. The Lord desires a center for the truth to be established in the great, wicked city of New York. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 388}
