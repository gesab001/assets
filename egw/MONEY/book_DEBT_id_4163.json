    "word": "\\n     Everywhere men are tying up their money, and hiding it in the earth. They are seeking worldly treasure. They do not make the kingdom of God and his righteousness their first consideration. That must wait their time and pleasure, although thousands of souls are dying around them without the light, unready for eternity. God says to them, \\\"Thou wicked and slothful servant,. . . thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\\\" These short-sighted men have no ability to measure the gift of eternal life, to realize the value of the eternal weight of glory. They have allowed the world to eclipse the divine attractions. They build upon the treacherous sand, and when the blasts of the tempest break upon them, their foundation will be swept away.",
