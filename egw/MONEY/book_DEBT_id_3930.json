    "word": "\\n     Brethren and sisters of like precious faith, shall we give heed to the last warning message? Is this a time to use the Lord's money in ministering to our pride and ambition?--a time to add land to land, or to build grand houses for ourselves and our children?--a time to lay up our treasures and fix our affections here? The Lord is coming. In his great mercy he has delivered us from the darkness of error, and has permitted the bright beams of truth to shine into our souls. We should manifest our gratitude by so reflecting the light from Heaven, in our words and works, that others may be led to believe the truths we advocate. Let us beware that we be not swept away by the current of worldliness, thus saying to unbelievers, \\\"The time is not. Be not alarmed. My Lord delayeth his coming.\\\" Let us be consistent; let our works correspond with our profession of faith. \\n\\n\\n          \\\"The Lord is coming--let this be \\n           The herald note of jubilee.\\\" \\n\\n                                               -\\n",
