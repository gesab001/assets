    "word": "\\n     As we pass through life, there come to us many opportunities for service. All around us there are open doors for ministry. By the right use of the talent of speech, we may do much for the Master. Words are a power for good when they are weighted with the tenderness and sympathy of Christ. Money, influence, tact, time, and strength,--all these are gifts entrusted to us to make us more helpful to those around us, and more of an honor to our Creator.",
