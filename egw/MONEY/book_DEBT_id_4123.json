    "word": "\\n     This very man may make large donations to the church; but will God accept of the money that is wrung from the family of the drunkard? It is stained with the blood of souls, and the curse of God is upon it. God says, \\\"For I the Lord love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt-offering.\\\" The church may praise the liberality of one who gives such an offering; but were the eyes of the church-members anointed with heavenly eye-salve, they would not call good evil and iniquity righteousness. The Lord says, \\\"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?. . . .When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? Bring no more vain oblations. Incense is an abomination unto me.\\\" \\\"Ye have wearied the Lord with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of Judgement?\\\"",
