    "word": "\\n     Let us seek counsel from God. It is the Lord's money which the wealthy men of the world have, and we should not hesitate to ask them to impart of the Lord's goods for the establishment of sanitariums, which are a benefit to all classes of people. It is the privilege of God's servants to go to these men and solicit their aid for the advancement of the work. As you in southern California do this, tell those to whom you go of the missionary work being done throughout America. Tell them of the sanitarium in Battle Creek. Do not be afraid to tell them that you need money to establish in California certain lines of missionary work, and that it is in their power to help.",
