    "word": "\\n\\nDecember 8, 1887 Christmas Gifts for Christ.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     Christmas and New Year's will soon be here, and what plans are we making in reference to them? How shall we employ them so that we may be workers together with God? The people in general celebrate the professed anniversary of the Saviour's birth, by feasting and merriment, and by making gifts to earthly friends. Time, thought, and money are devoted to these things, and Christ and his cause are neglected. The very day chosen to honor Christ is devoted by the many to honoring and pleasing themselves. Appointed to keep the Saviour in remembrance, it is spent in causing him to be forgotten.",
