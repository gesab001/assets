    "word": "\\n     The great cities must be warned; and if you have not surplus means, then it is certainly the duty of some of our brethren to sell and invest means in the different branches of the work. \\\"Lay up for yourselves a treasure in the heavens.\\\" Duty is plain; the selling time has come if means is demanded to advance the cause and work of God and cannot be raised without selling your land and your extra houses. Awaken, brethren, to the call of duty. I see no other way that the light in Chicago and other places can be withdrawn from under the bushel and placed on a candlestick. I appeal to every one in the ranks of Sabbath-keepers to deny self for Christ's sake. There is earnest work to be done for the Master; and those who have no houses and lands to turn into money, can deny self in various ways, and save means which would have been needlessly expended. Practice temperance in all things. Cut down selfish indulgences at your tables, and dress plainly, with the great and grand object before you of having money to place in the treasury of God. You may thus be the means of advancing his cause, enlightening those who are in the darkness of error.",
