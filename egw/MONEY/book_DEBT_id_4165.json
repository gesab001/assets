    "word": "\\n     \\\"They that will be rich,\\\"--those who are fully determined to obtain riches and to enjoy the pleasures of this world,--\\\"fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts.\\\" For a time Satan holds out before them many worldly attractions and opportunities, but that which the word of God declares to be the sure result must come upon them. Their end is destruction and perdition. \\\"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\\\"",
