    "word": "\\n     In the temple courts were the priests clad in their temple garments for display, and to mark out their position as priests of God. The garments of Christ were travel-stained. He had the appearance of a youthful Galilean, and yet as He took up the scourge of small cords, and stood on the steps of the temple, none could resist the authority with which He spoke, as He said, \\\"Take these things hence,\\\" and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and drove out the sheep and the oxen. The people looked upon Him as though spell-bound; for divinity flashed through humanity. Such dignity, such authority shone forth in the countenance of Christ, that they were convicted that He was clothed with the power of heaven. They had been taught to have great respect for the prophets, and the power displayed by Christ convinced many who had not closed their hearts against conviction, that He was one sent of God. Some said, \\\"He is the Messiah,\\\" and those to whom He revealed Himself were indeed convicted that He was the Teacher sent of God. But those who stifled the voice of conscience, who desired riches, and were determined to have them, no matter in what way they were to be obtained, closed the door of the heart against Him. The money-changers, who were there for the purpose of changing the Roman money for the money that was to be used in the temple, were displeased at His action. Their merchandise was robbery of the people, and they had made the house of God a den of thieves. These men beheld in Christ a messenger of vengeance, and fled from the temple as though a band of armed soldiers were on their track, The priests, the rulers, and the traffickers in merchandise also fled in dismay.",
