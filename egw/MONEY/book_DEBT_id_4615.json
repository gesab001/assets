    "word": "\\n     The Christian church needs to be purged and purified. The members must be consecrated to a higher office than they have hitherto occupied. \\\"Go,\\\" said Christ, \\\"and preach the Gospel to every creature.\\\" God calls for a decided reform. You call yourselves Christians. Are you Christians? Are you not afraid that you misrepresent Christ by taking His name, and saying, \\\"The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord\\\" are we, while you allow the love of money to lead you to withhold your tithe, your offering, and your service from Him? The neglect and indifference of professed Christians are cast by the world as a reproach upon God.",
