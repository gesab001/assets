    "word": "Parents, teach your children self-denial. Teach them not to spend their money for bows and ribbons and things that are unnecessary, but to spend all they can spare for the relief of the needy. Children, for Christ's sake, learn to deny yourselves. Put your savings into a self-denial box for the colored work. In the great day of judgment, every soul will be rewarded according as His works have been. The Lord will pronounce His blessing upon those who have denied themselves for His sake.",
