    "word": "\\n\\nSeptember 18, 1884 The True Object of Education.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     The true object of education should be constantly kept in view. God has intrusted to each one capacities and powers, that they may be returned to him enlarged and improved. His gifts are granted to us to be used to the utmost. He requires every one to attain the highest possible degree of usefulness. All the talents that we possess, whether of mental capacity, money, or influence, are of God, so that in dedicating them to his service we may say with David, \\\"All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.\\\"",
