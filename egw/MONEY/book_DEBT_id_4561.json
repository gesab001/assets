    "word": "\\n     What will be the reward of those who spend their money in extravagance? These persons have souls, which Christ has purchased with his own blood, and if they are saved at all, they must be saved through God's appointed way. Their bodies may be weighed down with jewels, with gold and silver, but will this enhance their value in the sight of God? Will this purchase for them the crown of eternal life, that fadeth not away? Will this buy for them the exceeding and eternal weight of glory, that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, that hath not entered into the heart of man, that God hath prepared for them that love him? God has prepared indescribable glories for them that love not gold, not display, not extravagance, not luxuries and ornaments, but that love him. Those who love God with all their hearts, and their neighbor as themselves, will reap the eternal reward.",
