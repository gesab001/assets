    "word": "\\n\\nJuly 9, 1894 Failure of the Rich in Bearing the Test.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     Jesus has said, \\\"He that gathereth not with me, scattereth.\\\" Who is with Christ in the manner in which they treat the poor and suffering? Jesus has said again, \\\"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\\\" \\\"So shall ye be my disciples.\\\" In what contrast to the manner of Christ in his humiliation is the manner of those who exalt themselves, and have no care for the needy around them! The rich people of the world are called the great ones, but what does the Creator call them? Thousands and even millions of dollars have been expended in extravagant display, by those who do not know what to do with their abundant means, while at the same time thousands are starving for bread, thousands living in comfortless homes, who are naked and destitute. The souls of the poor are just as valuable in the sight of God as the souls of the rich. The riches of the world belong to God, and he does not estimate men by the amount of money they possess. God intrusts money to men in order that he may see what use they will make of it.",
