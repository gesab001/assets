    "word": "\\n     A solemn responsibility rests upon you who have brought children into the world. You are to educate, and train, and discipline them. Show them how to make the world better and nobler; teach them to seek that which will elevate and ennoble, instead of running into all the amusements and selfish expenditure of money. You may say, \\\"It is my money.\\\" But no, it is not your money at all. It is God's money. It is lent you in trust, that you may feed the hungry and clothe the naked; that you may elevate humanity, teaching them, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little, patiently, perseveringly, kindly, with the love of Christ in your hearts. In the home teach your children true courtesy; teach them how to keep busy and be helpful; teach them that they are not in this world as mere butterflies, but to form a character after the pattern of Christ, and that they may have that life which measures with the life of God, an immortal inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away. Christ has told you what to seek as that which is precious in the sight of Heaven. He says, \\\"Whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament or a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\\\"",
