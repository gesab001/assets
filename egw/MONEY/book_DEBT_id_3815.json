    "word": "\\n     In the visions of the night, the Lord revealed to me that the churches in America were ready to help, but that some of the brethren in positions of responsibility were speaking words of caution, saying, \\\"We shall need this money in this country.\\\" Thus the help that would have been given was withheld. If those who spoke the words of caution had known how the workers in new fields,--fields where there were almost no buildings, no institutions, to give character to our work,--had spent hours in earnest prayer before God, asking for help to meet the responsibilities coming upon them, they would not have spoken as they did.",
