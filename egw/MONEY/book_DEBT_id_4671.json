    "word": "\\n     God says, \\\"My son, give me thy heart.\\\" Will you refuse him that which you cannot give with merit because it is his already,--that which you cannot refuse without ruin to your own soul? He asks your heart; give it to him, it is his own. He asks your intellect; give it to him, it is his own, lent you in trust. He asks your money; it is his own, give it to him. \\\"Ye are not your own; ye are bought with a price.\\\"",
