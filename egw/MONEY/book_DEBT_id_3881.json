    "word": "\\n     He who embezzles his Lord's goods not only loses the talent lent him of God, but loses eternal life. Of him it is said, \\\"Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness.\\\" The faithful servant who invests his money in the cause of God to save souls, employs his means to the glory of God, and will receive the commendation of the Master, \\\"Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\\\"",
