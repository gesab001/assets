    "word": "\\n\\nJune 8, 1893 Words to the Young.\\n\\n     By the gift of his dear Son, God has made provision that every man, woman, and child may be saved. The invitation has been given, \\\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.\\\" The Lord has sent to the world the light of life; but if we deliberately choose darkness rather than light, or fail to improve our opportunity to understand the truth, the time will come when we shall see that the sin of neglecting God's great salvation is no light matter. He who passes on in life, careless concerning those things which pertain to his eternal interests, is blind to the great work that might be accomplished through him as God's human agent if he cooperated with the heavenly agencies waiting his request for help. If he did but see what advantages would accrue to himself through the unreserved surrender of himself to the Lord, he would know that it was the utmost folly to turn from him who entreats, \\\"Turn ye, turn ye; . . . . for why will ye die?\\\"",
