    "word": "\\n     The means which God has furnished for the advancement of his cause are placed in the hands of his servants. He has intrusted them with his goods, and made them his agents, the dispensers of these goods to advance his glory. The cause has waited for years for men to get ready to do, and work that ought to have been done years ago is not done yet. How many more years will God wait the convenience of moneyed men, who are doing their best to lay up treasure on earth in direct opposition to the command of Christ? All now have an opportunity to use their means to advance the cause of God, but those who wait till some future time will be too late. Let the stewards critically examine the use they have made of God's intrusted capital. Have they embezzled it? Have they squandered it by mismanagement? Are they guilty of robbery toward God?",
