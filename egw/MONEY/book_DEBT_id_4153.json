How many youth might have been assisted to procure an education; how many orphans and widows might have been made to rejoice, to send up to God a tribute of praise for the supply of necessary comforts, if money expended for gold and jewels had been devoted to philanthropy! Many young men and women might have been trained for missionary fields, to go forth to bring light to those who sit in darkness and have no light.",
