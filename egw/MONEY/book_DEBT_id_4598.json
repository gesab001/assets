    "word": "\\n     Many poor souls torture themselves, many go on long pilgrimages, thinking to find Christ. But if this were the way to secure the treasure, many would be in a hopeless condition. The afflicted, the lame, and the blind would fail to find Christ. But salvation is given without money and without price. It is not necessary to go on pilgrimages to gain it. All we are asked to do is to believe on Christ as our personal Saviour, and be doers of His Word. \\\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.\\\"",
