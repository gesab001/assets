    "word": "When my husband has overworked, \n                                                                           20\nand nature has been burdened beyond endurance, a long period of sickness has resulted, then has come discouragement, as he has had a painful consciousness of his inability to plan and work to advance the cause of God. It has seemed to him of but little consequence to retain money, and he has donated largely to the various enterprises connected with the work of God. When he has recovered his health, he has found himself limited in means, and fearing he has not been as careful in its application as would best serve the cause of God, he has claimed the privilege of reconsidering the matter, especially as he has seen bad management in using the means which has cost us so much hard labor, physically and mentally, to accumulate. But the principle of this is not good. If he has given to his own hurt, when in physical and mental strength he should not change. If he sees that he has made mistakes, he should move more carefully in the future, consulting others at every step, and seeking wisdom from above \n                                                                           21\nmore earnestly, that all his work may be wrought in God.",
