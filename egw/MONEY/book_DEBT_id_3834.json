    "word": "\\n     Christ has not given His goods to any to be used for the gratification of pride and selfishness. All that we have is but a loan from Jesus; it is not our own. Money, possessions, intellect, are but lent us to be held as a precious trust for the service of Christ. Reason, ability, knowledge, affection, property have been received from Jesus, and are to be used with wisdom to bring honor and glory to His name.",
