    "word": "Nov. 6, 1906. \n     The case of the Madison school, and the good work that should be done there without let or hindrance has been placed before me, and I designed that this sum of money, though only a small amount in comparison with what they actually need, should be invested in that enterprise. I could not feel at rest in my mind until this was done. The workers there could use double this amount with good results. It has been presented to me that before this our people should have provided this school with means, and thus placed it on vantage-ground. This is the way in which I still view the matter.",
