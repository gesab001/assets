    "word": "\\n     We counsel parents to avail themselves of the opportunity now offered to separate their children from these worldly associations. Mothers, would it not be true wisdom to practice economy and self-denial in the furnishing of your house or the adorning of your dress, and let the means thus saved be devoted to the education of your children? Fathers, can you not sell a piece of your land, and send your children to a school where the moral and religious influence predominates? The money thus invested will bring returns more valuable than bank-stock. It will be repaid to you, both principal and interest, in the mental and spiritual advancement of your children.",
