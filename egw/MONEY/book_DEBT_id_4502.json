    "word": "\\n     In these days it is difficult for the truth to find access to the human heart. You know that on one occasion when Jesus entered into the temple, he found there \\\"those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.\\\" Thus the sacred courts of the Lord's house were converted into a place of merchandise, where greed and avarice flourished. As the eye of Jesus swept over the scene of busy traffic, divinity flashed through his humanity. He \\\"cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\\\" The traffic suddenly stopped, and the throng of buyers and sellers fled as though a company of armed men were pursuing them. With bated breath the priests and rulers looked upon him who was clothed with such majesty and power; and, as though a flash of light from Heaven had revealed the truth to their beclouded minds, the conviction forced itself upon them that this was no common man.",
