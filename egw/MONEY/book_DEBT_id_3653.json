IT IS REQUESTED THAT\\nTHIS ARTICLE BE NOT PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE.]\\n-\\nReading for Thursday, December 26.\\n-\\n\\n     The parables of the lost sheep and the lost piece of silver represent the attitude of God toward the sinner. The parable of the prodigal son also represents the attitude of the sinner toward God. While one presents the divine, the other gives also the human aspect of redemption. \\\"A certain man,\\\" said Jesus, \\\"had two sons; and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country.\\\" This younger son desires to have his own way. There is in his heart no response to his father's love, no gratitude for the years of care and tenderness that have been his. Having obtained his patrimony, he goes into \\\"a far country,\\\" away from his father's home. With money in plenty, and liberty to do as he likes, he flatters himself that the desire of his heart is reached. He has no one to say, \\\"Do not do this, for it will be an injury to yourself;\\\" or \\\"Do this because it is right.\\\" Evil companions help him to plunge deeper and deeper into sin, and he \\\"wastes his substance in riotous living.\\\"",
