    "word": "\\n     This liberality on the part of the believers was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit. The converts to the gospel were made \\\"of one heart and of one soul.\\\" One common interest controlled them,--the success of the mission entrusted to them; covetousness had no place in their lives. Their love for their brethren and the cause they had espoused was far greater than their love of money and possessions, and their works testified that they accounted the souls of men of far greater value than earthly wealth.",
