    "word": "\\n     Many today are keeping back that which the Lord has entrusted to them for the carrying forward of his work. Year after year thousands pass into the grave unwarned and unsaved, while the talent of means is hidden in a napkin, buried in worldly enterprises. The guilt of thus hiding the Lord's money passes all computation. When I see persons spending money for needless trimmings and needless furnishings, I think of Jesus. He might have come to this earth adorned with the glory of kingly power. But he chose a life of self-denial and self-sacrifice. \\\"If any man will come after me,\\\" said Christ, \\\"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\\\" Those who follow in his footsteps will remember that every dollar they can spare is needed in the work that God has said shall be done in the earth.",
