    "word": "\\n\\nMarch 4, 1880 Deceitfulness of Riches.\\n\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n\\n     Many who profess the special truths for our time, have not a proper discernment of character. They fail to appreciate moral worth. They may boast much of their fidelity to the cause of God, and their knowledge of the Scriptures; but they are not humble in heart. They have a special regard for those who are wealthy and prosperous, forgetting that riches do not give man favor with God. True excellence of character is frequently overlooked, if possessed by the poor man. Money sways a mighty influence. But does God care for money--for property? The cattle upon a thousand hills are his,--the world and all that is therein. The inhabitants of the earth are as grasshoppers before him; and the nations, with all their riches, \\\"are counted as the small dust of the balance.\\\" He is no respecter of persons. Yet men of property have often looked upon their possessions and said, By my wisdom have I gotten me this wealth. But who gave them power to get wealth? God has bestowed upon them the ability which they possess; and instead of giving him the glory, they take it to themselves. He will prove them and try them, and will bring their glorying to the dust; he will remove their strength and scatter their possessions. Instead of a blessing, they will realize a curse.",
