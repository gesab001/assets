    "word": "\\n     The great responsibility bound up in the use of the gift of speech is plainly made known by the word of God. \\\"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned,\\\" Christ declared. And the psalmist asks: \\\"Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoreth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.\\\"",
