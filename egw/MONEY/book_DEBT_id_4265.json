    "word": "\\n     Christ has made for us a complete offering, an offering without defect or blemish. Let us make an offering of whole-hearted service to God. Let us bring our money to God as a thank offering for what He has done for us, even as the wise men brought to Christ their offerings of gold and frankincense and myrrh. As we do our best, making our gift proportionate to our ability to give, God will accept our offering. Remember the offering that Christ made,--the offering of himself to a life of suffering, humiliation, and shame, in order to save a world perishing in sin. Had not this offering been made, we must have perished. How much do we owe to Him who gave His life for us? As we look upon the self-sacrifice of Christ, do not the sacrifices we are called upon to make for Him sink into insignificance?",
