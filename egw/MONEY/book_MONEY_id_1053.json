    "word": "Soon Christ will reward every man according to his works.  Soon your money will pass out of your hands for another to handle.  It will then not be the test of your stewardship.  Now it is yours, by which the Lord desires to try you.  While you are alive, be your own almoner and receive the blessings that will come to you in a faithful discharge of duty.  Give back to God that which is His own.  This is God's way.  He always lends His talents to His stewards, to be used to spread the knowledge of the truth.  This work cannot be done without the funds that are in the hands of God's servants.",
