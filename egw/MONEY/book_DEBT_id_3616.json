    "word": "\\n     Parents should be an example to their children in the expenditure of money. It is not necessary to specify here how economy may be practiced in every particular. Those whose hearts are surrendered to God, and who take His word as their guide, will know how to conduct themselves in all the duties of life. They will learn of Jesus, who is meek and lowly of heart; and in cultivating the meekness of Christ, they will close the door against innumerable temptations.",
