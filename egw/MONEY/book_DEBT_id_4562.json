    "word": "\\n     \\\"The wedding presents represented $2,000,000. So much then for the day. Now as to the young people's start in life: Preceding their trip to Europe, Mr. Astor and his bride will spend about three weeks cruising in Mr. William Astor's yacht Nourmahal, in Florida waters. Despite the fact that her furnishings were scarcely worn and almost new, the boat was refurnished out and out with the most costly and magnificent furniture that money could secure. The complement of officers is fifty-two men, not including servants and personal attendants. It takes from $8,000 to $10,000 per month to keep her in service, besides the cost of food and wines.\\\" Twenty-five thousand dollars for the day's ceremony, two million dollars worth of presents, a cruise in a half-idle yacht costing ten thousand dollars per month to maintain. When we read this we are reminded of Thackeray's description of the extravagance of the prince regent during the Napoleonic wars. If he had been a manufacturing town, or populous rural district, or an army of five thousand men, he would not have cost more. The nation gave him more money, and more and more. The sum is past counting.",
