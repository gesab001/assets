    "word": "\\n     Another sister spoke in behalf of a sister who was baptized in Wasioja. She is now in Canada, and has written a letter saying she has passed through great trials, but she can now rejoice in God because her husband has taken the truth. She is very poor, but she sent twenty-five cents of British money to aid in publishing these truths she so highly prizes. She said in her own behalf that the truth she has heard at this meeting will be a savor of life unto life to her and her family. She hoped they would be a united family in the kingdom of God.",
