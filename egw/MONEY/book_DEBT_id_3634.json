    "word": "\\n     Come, my brethren and sisters, and seek conversion of soul, body, and spirit. Unfold your napkin and begin to trade with your Lord's goods. In so doing you will gain other talents. Every soul entrusted with talents is to use his talents to benefit others. Who in the great day of final reckoning will say, \\\"I was afraid, and went and hid thy money in the earth; lo, there thou hast that is thine\\\"? To such the Lord will answer, \\\"Thou wicked and slothful servant, . . . thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\\\"",
