    "word": "25. The follower of Christ has a cross to bear, for the requirement of Christ cuts directly across the inclination of the natural heart, and uproots pride, empties and cleanses the soul of selfishness and self-love, and leads men to deny self daily for Christ's sake. If you will act as Christians, there will be meat in the house of the Lord, whereby the sacred, holy work of God may be extended and advanced in the world; for those who are laborers together with God will bind about their wants, and not spend money for trifles, when souls are perishing for the bread of life.",
