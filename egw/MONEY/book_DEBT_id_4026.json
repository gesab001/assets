    "word": "\\n     Many wonder at the unwillingness of the Jews to receive Christ as the promised Messiah. Why did they cling to their false creeds, empty forms, and useless ceremonies, when the truth of heaven waited their acceptance? They spent their money for chaff and husks, when the Living Bread was within their reach. Why did they not go to the word of God, and search diligently to know whether or not they were in error, and to discover to Jesus the absurdity of his claims and the evidences of his deception? The cause of their rejection of Christ was the same as that which keeps men in error today: they \\\"loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.\\\"",
