    "word": "\\n     We prayed much in regard to the necessities of the cause and the meaning of the dream, and resolved to venture out in accordance with the light given. My husband and I decided to sell our property in Battle Creek, that we might use the proceeds in this work. We wrote to our brethren, \\\"Sell everything we have in Battle Creek, and send us the money at once.\\\" This was done, and we helped to build the churches in Oakland and San Francisco.

The Lord would inspire men by his Holy Spirit to carry forward the work with faith and courage and perseverance.",
