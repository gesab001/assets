    "word": "\\n     I am afraid that some will say, \\\"It is expensive to travel, and it would be better for me to save the money, and give it for the advancement of the work, where it is so much needed.\\\" Do not reason in this way; for God calls upon you to take your place among the rank and file of his people. You are to be there in person, and to strengthen the meeting all you possibly can. Let no one say, \\\"I will remain at home, and let some one else go;\\\" for we want to see you, and the somebody else as well. Let no stay-away argument be used. We know that the believers in the truth are scattered widely; but make no excuse that will keep you from gaining every spiritual advantage possible. Come to the meeting, and bring your families. Put forth extra exertions, and be at the gathering of God's people.",
