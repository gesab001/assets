    "word": "\\n     We must have more religion. We must love the Lord better. We must daily consecrate ourselves to the Lord and practice the truth. We profess to believe in earnest, sincere, self-denying effort. Let it ever be borne in mind that if a man who professes to believe the truth neglects his God-given responsibility, he will in the day of God be placed with the unprofitable servant. He will learn by the announcement made in the great day of accounts, if not before, that God was the owner of all he possessed, and that he was only made a trustee, or steward, and was held to a stern reckoning for the faithful administration of his trust. It is all the same, whether we have one talent, or three, or five, or ten; all are the Lord's. Not a farthing is to be squandered upon needless things to gratify the lusts. Not a particle is to be hoarded to the neglect of the salvation of souls for whom Christ has given his life. The principal is all the Lord's, the improvement of it is his, and on every dollar is stamped the image and superscription of Jehovah. All must render an account to God, of how their time and their talents of intellect and money have been used. It is not a light thing to be intrusted with riches; but it is a grand thing to be accounted as a faithful steward of God in making right use of the Lord's money. \\\"How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\\\" but how beautiful will be the character of those who have borne the trust of God's capital worthily! If one has held all as God's property, and heeded God's voice to invest his property in his cause to save precious souls, he will see these souls saved in the kingdom of God, because he appropriated God's means as he designed it should be appropriated. He will then be received into everlasting habitations.",
