    "word": "\\n     My sisters, let us face the mirror of God's holy law, and test our spirit and character by the first four and last six commandments. The first four commandments require that we should love God will all our heart, might, mind, and strength; and anything that tends to draw the mind away from God, assumes the form of an idol, occupying the thought, and consuming the time, and crowding out of the soul-temple the spirit of Christ. O, how much means that should go to the cause and work of God is laid upon the altar of idols! Unless God is enthroned in the heart, the commandments are violated; for we have other gods before the Lord of hosts. \\\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.\\\" \\\"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\\\" Examine your thoughts and actions in the light of God's law, and see if you have not failed in your duty to your fellow-men. Can a true follower of Christ so forget the sacrifice made in behalf of fallen man, that he will become careless of the time and means intrusted to him of Heaven to do good to others? The means we have is ours only to relieve the necessities of ourselves and others. The money expended for the gratification of selfish desires in dress or in any other way, is money lost to the cause of God.",
