    "word": "\\n     God calls upon those who have possessions in lands and houses, to sell, and to invest the money where it will be supplying the great want in the missionary field. When once they have experienced the real satisfaction that comes from thus doing, they will keep the channel open, and the means the Lord intrusts to them will be constantly flowing into the treasury, that souls may be converted, and brought into the church. These souls will, in their turn, practice the same self-denial, economy, and simplicity, for Christ's sake that they, too, may bring their offerings to God. Through these talents, wisely invested, still other souls may be converted; and thus the work goes on, showing that the gifts of God are appreciated. The Giver is acknowledged, and glory redounds from earth to heaven in the salvation of souls, through the faithfulness of God's stewards. Although Jesus was the Prince of Life, he did not take his place with the rich and lordly ones of earth, but he honored the lowly, the oppressed, and the suffering, and bestowed upon them the blessings of his love.",
