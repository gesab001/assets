    "word": "\\n     Brethren, are your lands and houses of more value than the precious souls for whom Christ has died? Every church-member should awake, and go to work in the Lord's vineyard. If there are some who cannot give personal effort in missionary work, let them live economically and give of their earnings. Thus they can contribute money to send papers and books to those who have not the light of truth; they can help pay the expenses of students who are fitting for missionary work. Open your hearts in gifts and offerings; bring them to Jesus; lay them at his feet, and he will bless you. The necessities of the cause of God demand a continual flow of liberality. Let those who have been selfishly withholding their means, now bring offerings to the Lord. Be prompt in rendering to God his own. One reason why there is so great a dearth of the Spirit of God, is because so many are robbing God of his just claims.",
