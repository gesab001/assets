    "word": "\\n     One soul is of more value to heaven than a world of property, houses, lands, money. If the sacrifice were essential for the salvation of one soul, it would be the duty of the inhabitants of the earth to sell their possessions in order to secure that soul for eternity. For the conversion of one soul we should tax our resources to the utmost. One soul won to Christ will flash heaven's light all around him, penetrating the moral darkness, and saving other souls. Thus two, five, ten talents will accumulate and double. This is not exaggeration. If Christ left the ninety and nine, that he might seek and save the one lost sheep, shall we be justified in doing less?",
