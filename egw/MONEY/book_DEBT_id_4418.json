    "word": "\\n     Our field is the world. Repeat it again and again: Our field is the world. We rejoice for those who have made a willing offering of their property to the Lord. We encourage all to help with their means in the cause of God. Christians who are fully awake to the needs of the work will not spend the Lord's money needlessly. They will consider the great missionary field to be worked, and, viewing their obligations in the light of the cross of Calvary, they will consider no sacrifice too great to make for him who gave his life for the life of the world.",
