    "word": "\\n     While Jesus was at Bethany, he told his disciples of what was to come to pass in a few days from that time. At the Passover the case of Judas was decided.

At all events, he would make something out of the transaction, and make a sharp bargain by betraying his Lord. He went to the priests and offered to aid them in searching for him who was accounted the troubler of Israel. Thus it was that the Lord was sold as a slave, purchased by the temple money used for the buying of the sacrifices.",
