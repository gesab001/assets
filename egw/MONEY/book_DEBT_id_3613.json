    "word": "\\n     My heart is stirred to its depths as I read of the prostitution of noble powers to the service of Satan. In positions of high responsibility, in official trusts, men are tempted: and corruption and crime, embezzlements, robberies, and extortions are the result. There are terrible sinks of corruption, pouring out upon the world poisonous influences that corrupt the community. In every place Satan's traps are set, that he may catch men of education, of good natural endowments, men who are capable of becoming labourers together with God, companions of angels, inhabitants of heaven,-- that he may bind them to his car as his slaves, and make them instruments of working evil. Jesus has ransomed them from this bondage; yet they refuse to be set at liberty. They live as though the earth, money, position, houses, and lands were the main objects of their creation. Is it not a pitiable sight to see men of high ability living on so low a plane, for so ignoble a purpose?",
