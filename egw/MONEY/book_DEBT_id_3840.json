We have done all in our power to advance the work there, and now that this sanitarium property in San Diego County has been purchased, we call upon our brethren and sisters to aid us in properly equipping the institution that it may do successful work. Ask those who have been entrusted with the Lord's money to make gifts to the sanitarium, that it may be prepared to do the work that must be done for the sick and suffering.",
