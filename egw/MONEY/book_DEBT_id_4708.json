    "word": "\\n\\nMarch 6, 1902 What Shall It Profit?\\n\\n     Cares, riches, pleasures, all are used by Satan in playing the game of life for the human soul. The warning is given: \\\"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\\\" He who reads the hearts of men as an open book says: \\\"Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life.\\\" And the apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, says: \\\"They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\\\"",
