    "word": "\\n     The words of Jesus in connection with the promise of receiving upon presenting your petition to God have an application to every soul. He says, \\\"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?\\\" Or, as Luke says, \\\"How much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\\\" In the teachings of these verses there is not a place in which to put a peg to hang a doubt upon. In the relation chosen to represent the love of God, the beseeching soul is brought close to the heart of Jesus. The Holy Spirit imparts love, joy, peace, strength, and consolation; it is as a well of water springing up unto everlasting life. The blessing is free to all: \\\"Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat,; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.\\\" With overflowing heart you may say:-- \\n           \\\"In my hand no price I bring, \\n            Simply to thy cross I cling.\\\"",
