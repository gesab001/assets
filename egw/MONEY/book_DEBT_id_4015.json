    "word": "\\n     Those who profess our exalted faith, who are keeping God's commandments and expecting the soon coming of our Lord, should be distinct and separate from the world around them, a peculiar people zealous of good works. Among the peculiarities which should distinguish God's people from the world in these last days is their humility and meekness. \\\"Learn of me,\\\" says Christ; \\\"for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\\\" Here is the repose which so many crave and in vain spend time and money to obtain.",
