    "word": "\\n     When, as a people, our appreciation for the souls for whom Christ died is proportionate to the value of the reward we hope to gain,--eternal life,--we shall make more earnest efforts to do Christian work. We shall appreciate the sacrifice made by the Son of God to save souls from destruction. Let us teach the truth by practising it. Let us deny self that we may have money to give to the Lord's work. The Lord will greatly bless those who work in faith.",
