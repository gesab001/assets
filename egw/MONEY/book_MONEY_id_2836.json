    "word": "There are portions of the Lord's vineyard untilled because no means have been supplied. There are meetinghouses burdened with debt which should never have had a debt upon them if proper efforts had been made. To find means to put up a house of worship entirely free from debt is one of the greatest acts of benevolence that can be performed. The interest goes out yearly for an old debt, and no one feels the disgrace, but the hardest part is to redeem the blunder made at the first, to clear off the old debt, and stop the interest that is so difficult to raise. The Lord has need of the money He has lent to men to use in doing good.",
