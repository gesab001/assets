    "word": "\\n     The tree of knowledge, so-called, has become an instrument of death. Satan has artfully woven himself, his dogmas, his false theories, into the instruction given. From the tree of knowledge he speaks the most pleasing flattery in regard to the higher education. Thousands partake of the fruit of this tree, but to them it means death. Christ says to them: \\\"Ye spend money for that which is not bread. You are using your God-entrusted talents to secure an education which God pronounces foolishness.\\\"",
