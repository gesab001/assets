    "word": "\\n     We should be on our guard, and not allow ourselves to spend money upon that which is unnecessary, and simply for display. We should not permit ourselves to indulge tastes that lead us to pattern after the customs of the world, and rob the treasury of the Lord. The apostle says, \\\"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\\\" O what a representation is this of the security, the peace, the rest, the confidence, we may have in the love of God. No man, no power, can force us from our refuge. Jesus says, \\\"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, and ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.\\\" Thank God with heart and soul and voice for a safe abiding-place. \\\"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then [if you have hid your life with Christ in God] shall ye also appear with him in glory.\\\"",
