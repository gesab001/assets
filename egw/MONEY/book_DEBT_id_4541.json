    "word": "\\n     But with what indifference many professed Christians look upon those in ignorance and sin. They do nothing with their money, nothing with their influence, nothing with tongue or pen. They do not even take upon themselves the burden of their own souls, but leave themselves a constant anxiety for others, and thus bring care upon the church. These would be a burden and clog in heaven itself. For Christ's sake, for your soul's sake, make diligent work for eternity. Christ has gone to prepare heavenly mansions for all who will comply with the conditions stated in the word of God. Souls for whom Christ died are dwelling in darkness and error; God has done his part to enlighten them, and is waiting for the co-operation of his followers. The plan of salvation has been fully developed. The blood of Jesus has been shed for the sins of the world. The word of God has been given, and it speaks to man in counsels, in reproof, in warning, in instruction, in promises, in encouragement. The Holy Spirit has been given to help man in all his efforts to overcome, and yet the world is perishing in darkness and sin. Who will be laborers together with God to win souls to Christ? Who will bear to dying souls the glad tidings of salvation? The people whom God has blessed with light and truth are to be messengers of salvation. Their money should flow in a channel of beneficence to bless their fellow-men, and they should devote all their powers to the cause of God, becoming laborers together with him. They should be self-denying, self-sacrificing, like him who, \\\"though he was rich, yet for your sakes became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.\\\" \\n                                                                -\\n",
