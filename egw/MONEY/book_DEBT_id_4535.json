    "word": "\\n     The Lord does not propose to do that which we can do ourselves. He will educate us to do his work, and as we go forth to his service, he will work mightily with our efforts. God claims our talents, he requires that they shall be employed in his service. A portion of our substance is the Lord's also, and if we render him his just dues, he will recognize the offering and commend our course. He does not estimate the value of our gifts to his cause by their amount in money, he looks upon our motives. It is the heart service that makes the gift valuable. When we fulfill our obligations in faith, we shall not rob God even in little things, but we shall bear every responsibility that he places upon us to his glory.",
