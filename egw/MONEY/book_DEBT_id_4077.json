White.\\n-\\n\\n     \\\"Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded.\\\" Young men are not to be lovers of pleasure, seekers for amusement, ready to squander time and money and influence in selfish gratification; but they are to cultivate sobriety and godliness. They should seek each day to realize that they are now in the sowing time, and that the harvest reaped will be according to the seed sown. Young men should form their plans of life with thoughtful deliberation, and subject their conduct to criticism, as they seek for integrity of heart and action that will stand the test of the judgment. They should be willing to receive counsel from those of experience, that they may be fortified to stand in the perils that will beset their pathway. They will be exposed to influences which will lead them away from fidelity to God, unless they ever keep a realization of their responsibilities.",
