    "word": "\\n     In Europe there are outsiders who have money. Let men who have tact go to these people, and tell them what is being done to help the people of all denominations. Tell them that you are desirous of establishing a sanitarium, where all classes of people can be helped; that you want to establish a school where the Bible will be used as the basis of all the work, where the youth can be educated in Bible lines. There are those who, if approached in the right way, will give of their means to help in this work.",
