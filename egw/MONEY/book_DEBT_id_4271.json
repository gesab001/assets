    "word": "\\n     We are to follow God's design exactly in the formation and establishment of the work, small though it may be in some places. Outward show and a large outlay of means are not necessary in order to gain the blessing of God. Human taste, human devising, human inclination to ornament, are not to be encouraged. An unnecessary expenditure of money means that there will be less to invest in the work in other places.",
