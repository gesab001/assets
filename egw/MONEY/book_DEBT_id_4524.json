    "word": "\\n     Frequently mothers permit their children to eat candy and sweetmeats, and the habit thus formed, besides involving an unwise expenditure of money, is ruinous to the health. One mother said to me, as she placed a package of candy in her child's hand, \\\"It is only five cents' worth.\\\" It was a very poor quality of candy and highly colored. The child looked in my face with much interest, to see how I regarded the matter. Said I, \\\"The lessons in the selfish indulgence of taste which you are giving your children are setting their feet in an evil path. You, as their guardian and teacher, should be helping them to overcome. You should be teaching them to cease to do evil and to learn to do well.\\\"",
