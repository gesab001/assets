    "word": "\\n     The invitation is to be given to classes that have not heard the constant efforts made to urge ministers and people, so constantly and at great expense, to hear the word of God and do it. These efforts have not accomplished the work it was supposed they would; because the Lord could not sanction this constant effort and expenditure of time and means for weeks, with the idea of helping the ministers to do more perfect work. They were enjoying a rich feast to repletion, and were cloyed, while other souls who had never heard the truth were in most deplorable need, and the time and money should have been expended to feed hungry souls starving for the bread of life.",
