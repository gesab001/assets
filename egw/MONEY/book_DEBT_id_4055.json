    "word": "\\n     Teach your children to be useful, to bear burdens according to their years; then the habit of laboring will become second nature to them, and useful work will never seem like drudgery. Train them to habits of economy. Some parents bend all their energies to the accumulation of money, and precious opportunities are lost for giving daily instruction, for filling the minds of their children with precious material for use in afterlife. Children should be impressed with the high sense of their moral responsibility. The time that parents devote to fashionable display, should be devoted to teaching their children self-reliance. They should not train their children to seek pre-eminence in dress or speech or action. The inward adoring of a meek and quiet spirit is of great price in the sight of God. This adorning will not tarnish or wear out, but will be as enduring as the throne of God.",
