    "word": "\\n     Elder _____ has labored unselfishly and untiringly to raise money for the General Conference and for the Review and Herald and other institutions. His persevering, self-sacrificing zeal carried him long distances through the heat of summer and the cold of winter. On one occasion he drove a long distance in the winter in Minnesota. I think it was there that he froze his hands, causing himself great suffering, but he got the money that was needed. Though weary and worn, he had no thought of laying down the armor, but fought his way through every difficulty.",
