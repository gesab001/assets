    "word": "\\n     The Saviour's love for his followers can not be measured; and Judas could not but see the lovable traits of his Master's character, his sympathy and compassion, because they were in such marked contrast with his own. But the words spoken by Christ as he rebuked him for criticising Mary's action rankled in his heart. He was not humbled, but provoked, by the reproof. He said to himself, \\\"I will be revenged for this reproof.\\\" By betraying Christ, he thought to obtain a large sum of money. He went directly from the supper to the chief priests, and agreed to deliver Christ into their hands. The priests were greatly rejoiced, \\\"and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.\\\"",
