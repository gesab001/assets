    "word": "\\n     The preaching of the word is not to be undervalued. To preach the grand and solemn truths of the gospel which is to save men's souls, is a sacred, holy work. \\\"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.\\\" What an honor is conferred upon men who are called to be laborers together with God. As John, they are to be messengers to proclaim the coming of Christ! Like him they are to cry, \\\"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\\\" \\\"Lift him up, the risen Saviour,\\\" and say to all who hear, Come unto him who \\\"hath loved us, and hath given himself for us.\\\" Lead men to contemplate the self-denial, the compassion, the great love wherewith he has loved them, which led him to pay the purchase money of his own life for our sakes. Let the science of salvation be the burden of every sermon. Let it be the theme of every song of praise. Let it be poured forth in every supplication. Let nothing be brought into the preaching to supplement Jesus Christ, the wisdom and power of God. Let his name, the only name given under heaven whereby we may be saved, be exalted in every discourse. From Sabbath to Sabbath let the trumpet of the watchmen give a certain sound. Let them hold forth the word of life, presenting hope to the penitent, and Christ as the stronghold to the believer. Let them reveal the way of peace to the troubled and despondent; let them show forth the grace and completeness of Christ as their living Saviour.",
