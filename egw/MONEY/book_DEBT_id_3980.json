    "word": "\\n     In many circles it is customary to serve a variety of highly seasoned dishes at a meal. In this way much time and money are spent unwisely. An unnecessary expense is imposed on the provider, and great care and weariness on the cook who prepares the food, when a few simple dishes, free from condiments and spices, would be much more healthful, and would soon be enjoyed with a keener relish. We commit sin when we indulge appetite at the expense of physical and mental soundness, or sacrifice health and comfort for the sake of outward show; for the physical and mental powers are God's gifts, and like all the blessings that he bestows, should be used to his glory, instead of being made to minister to pride or perverted taste. \\\"Ye are not your own. Ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\\\"",
