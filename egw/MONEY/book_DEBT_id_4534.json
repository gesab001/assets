    "word": "\\n     \\\"For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability.\\\" When they were called to give an account as to how they had employed their lord's talents, he who had the five had doubled his talents, and he who had two had doubled his; but he who had received but one came to his lord and said, \\\"Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed; and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth; lo, there thou hast that is thine. His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed; thou oughtest therefore to put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\\\" The lord rewarded those who had increased their talents, but he condemned him who had buried his lord's money. \\n                          (Concluded next week.) \\n                                                                -\\n",
