    "word": "I do most sincerely hope and pray that you will see the necessity of bringing your living expenses within the limit of your means, so that you may not give to others a wrong example in your home life. The brethren who have placed their money in your hands, believing you to be in great need, should not long be kept waiting for its return. If anyone among us needs to practice economy and self-denial, it is yourself, for the money you have received from others should be returned as soon as possible. Brother Leininger's family live in accordance with the principles of strictest economy. They did not have a carriage until I told them it was their duty to provide one for Sister Leininger. Brother Leininger had conscientiously decided not to build a convenient wood-shed and kitchen for his large family, because he did not feel free to invest means in personal conveniences when the cause of God needed money to carry it forward. I tried to show him that it was necessary for the health as well as for the morals of his children that he should make home pleasant, and provide conveniences to lighten the labor of his wife. Now, my brother, you would not think you could live as that family lives. You would not economize as that family have economized in order to save money in every way possible. You would think it your privilege to invest means in twenty ways for your own convenience where he would not feel that he could indulge in the gratification of self in one way. He binds about his inclinations and wants, while you use means freely, and \n\n\n                          [61] \n\nalthough you have had repeated cautions and reproofs on this point, you will continue to pursue the same course, unless yourself and wife are converted.",
