    "word": "\\n     We must awake out of sleep. Europe is stretching out her hands, and the Macedonian cry comes from across the broad waters, \\\"Come over and help us.\\\" The work here has advanced very slowly, for want of men and means. Where are the idlers in the market places? Let them arouse, and place themselves where they may be trained to render acceptable service. Oh, my heart is full to bursting when I think what ought to have been done here in Europe in days gone by, and how far the work might now be advanced if those who have received the light of present truth had been faithful to their trust! If so many had not wrapped their talents of ability and money in a napkin, and buried them in the earth; if the church had done the work that God made it her duty to do, we should today have thousands rejoicing in the truth here, and there would be light-bearers in all parts of Europe. Brethren, God calls upon you to redeem the time. Make haste to unearth your buried talents. If God has intrusted you with money, show yourselves faithful to your trust; unwrap your napkin, and send your talents to the exchangers, that when Christ shall come, he may receive his own with interest. What if some do become poor by investing their means in the work of spreading the truth? Your Master for your sakes became poor; and by following his example, you are securing for yourselves eternal riches, a treasure in heaven that faileth not. Your means are far safer placed in the cause of God than deposited in a bank, or invested in houses and lands. No thief can approach them, no fire can consume them. They are laid up in bags that wax not old.",
