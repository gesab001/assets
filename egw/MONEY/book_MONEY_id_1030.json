    "word": "Souls for whom Christ died are perishing in their sins, and we are continually bound about because of want of means wherewith to advance the cause of God. Would you not rather have gems in the crown which Jesus shall place upon your head than expend your money for precious stones to please the fancy here in this world?. . . Every pound is needed, every shilling can be put to use, and invested in such a way as to bring you imperishable treasure.--Letter 90, 1895.",
