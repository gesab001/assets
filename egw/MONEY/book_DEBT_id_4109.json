    "word": "\\n     We have been sent here by the General Conference, and we are here on the ground; but we have not been provided with facilities to do the work, although urgent calls have been made for facilities, and the needs of the field have been repeatedly presented before our brethren. The trouble is that our brethren do not comprehend the appeal that has been made. But something more must be done, they think, to give additional strength to, and to multiply facilities in, America, where there is a great abundance of facilities; while the fields that have no strength, which need money and workers, are left almost entirely in their destitution, and the call for means and men is scarcely heeded. Workers now, and money now, would be of more value than double the financial assistance in two years from this time. I must now make an appeal to the churches. I must call upon you in America to help us at this time. I call upon those whom God has made stewards of his means to send us financial help, and let those who are willing to go out as did Abraham, leaving country and kindred, come as missionaries to this field, not looking to the Conference to pay your expenses, or to support you, but looking to God for grace to diffuse the light he has given you.",
