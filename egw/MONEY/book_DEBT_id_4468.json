    "word": "\\n     If parents desire that their children shall become pure, noble, upright men and women, they must give them right surroundings and proper associates in childhood. Inquire into the history of the world's best and noblest men, --those who have made life a success,--and you will find that from childhood they were governed by sterling principle. They were simple in their tastes, and temperate in their habits. The lessons of self-denial and self-control were early learned. Such men can be said, in the highest sense, to still enjoy their youth. Its purity remains unsullied, its strength and vigor undiminished. The parents thought less of hoarding money for their children than of securing to them pure morals and a vigorous intellect. The fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, was the foundation of their greatness.",
