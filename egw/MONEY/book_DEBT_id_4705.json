    "word": "\\n     The parable presents a truth which all should understand. God has not distributed his talents capriciously. To every man are given abilities which will fit him for the work he is called to do. To one are committed five talents; to another, two; to another, one: and each is accountable to God for his gifts. A time is coming when Christ will require his own with usury. He will say to each of his stewards, \\\"Give an account of thy stewardship.\\\" Those who have hid their Lord's money in the earth, in worldly investments, instead of putting it out to the exchangers, to increase by use; and those who have squandered his money by expending it for needless things, instead of investing it in his cause, will receive the condemnation of the Master. Not only will they lose the talent lent them by God, but they will lose eternal life. The command will be given: \\\"Take therefore the talent from him, . . . and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\\\" The faithful servant, who invests his talent in the cause of God, who uses his money to the glory of God, will receive the commendation, \\\"Well done, thou good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\\\" What will be this joy of the Lord? --It will be the joy of seeing souls saved in the kingdom of God. Those who are faithful stewards are partners with Christ, who, \\\"for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\\\" \\n                                                      Mrs. E.
