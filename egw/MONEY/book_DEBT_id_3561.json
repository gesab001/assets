    "word": "\\n     The Lord calls upon his people to make offerings of self-denial. Let us give up something that we intended to purchase for personal comfort and pleasure. Let us teach our children to deny self, and become the Lord's helping hands in dispensing his blessings. If there was ever a time when sacrifices should be made, it is now. Those who have money should understand that now is the time to use it for God. Let us send in our offerings with thanksgiving, and with prayer that the Lord will bless the gifts, and multiply them as he did the food given to the five thousand. If we use the very best facilities we have, the power of God will enable us to reach the multitudes that are starving for the bread of life. \\n                                                            Mrs. E.
