    "word": "\\n     To those who tie up their money in worldly enterprises, I would say, We want that money, that we may set the work of God in operation in places where the people are still in darkness. The towns from here to Queensland are to be worked, and yet there are regions beyond. There are those who, when the Spirit of God comes upon them, can go to Western Australia, where a great work is to be done. Get hold of God, and God will get hold of you. Reach the people through Christ; you cannot reach them through yourself. Reach them through the Spirit of God. God calls upon us to put on the armour. We do not want Saul's armour, but the whole armour of God. Then we can go forth to the work with hearts full of Christ-like tenderness, compassion, and love.",
