    "word": "\\n     I want to know more and more of God's word and of his works. I do not want to build myself up in myself; for I am nothing. What I desire is to know the ways of the Lord. I do not wish to be so particular as to how my house is furnished; spending unnecessary time and money, so that everything may be just to my taste in this or that arrangement, and neglect the all-important question, Is it well with my soul? What is the order of my soul? Is the soul temple pure? Is the defilement of sin in my heart? Have I felt the necessity of cleansing my heart from all impurity? It is of the greatest importance to understand and practice the truth; for this sanctifies the soul. Our greatest anxiety should be to stand perfect before the Lord, clothed in the spotless garments of Christ's righteousness.",
