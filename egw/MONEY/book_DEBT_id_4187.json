White.\\n-\\n\\n     The Lord expects his followers to reveal, in the transformation of their life and character, the power of the gospel, which converts and sanctifies the soul. He calls for all tact and energy to be educated and trained for his service. And yet there are but few who have educated themselves to take in the subject of redemption, and the responsibility which it places upon the followers of Christ. Thousands are doing nothing in real service for the Master. They have no feeling for sin-sick souls who are perishing out of Christ. Although many profess godliness, they help very little in alleviating the poverty and suffering that exist all around them; they reach out no hand to save the perishing. Selfishness increases in every line. It is seen in the clothing of the body, in the decorating of the home, in expending money for that which is not bread, in gratifying pride, and in selfish indulgence. Compassion is becoming rare in the hearts of those who claim to be Christians. They seem to have drunk a deadly draft of Satan's \\\"peace-and-safety\\\" decoction, and to be insensible to the perils to which human souls are exposed.",
