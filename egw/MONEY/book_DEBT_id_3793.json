    "word": "\\n     I appeal to all our brethren and sisters to bear in mind the words of Christ, \\\"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\\\" Jesus, the world's Redeemer, gave his precious life to save fallen man; every son and daughter of Adam is his purchased possession. He paid the infinite price, the ransom money in his own precious life, to redeem man; therefore he identifies his interest with suffering humanity. He requires every man to be interested for his fellow-man, making the word of God his standard of duty. With meekness and lowliness of heart we are to show reverence and love to him who hath bought us, giving his own life, that \\\"whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.\\\" Then let love and tender regard toward our fellow-men be ever revealed, not merely in words, but in deeds. \\n\\n                                               -\\n",
