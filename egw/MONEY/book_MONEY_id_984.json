    "word": "The loss in Mountain View has come as a test to the believers in present truth. Those who carry on the work of printing the truth, to be sent out broadcast, now need tangible evidence as to how the work for this time is regarded by God's people. In the rebuilding of Pacific Press, money will be required. Let us remember that all we have is the Lord's. Let us manifest faith and put into the Lord's treasury that which is necessary, that this institution may be prepared to proclaim the truth in its purity.--Lt 260, 1906.",
