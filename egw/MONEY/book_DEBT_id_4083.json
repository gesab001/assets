    "word": "\\n     When the disciples went forth, they were to preach that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, and they were not to burden themselves with money or scrip. The Saviour added, \\\"Into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go hence.\\\" There is no question as to where you shall take up your abode when you go forth to preach the gospel, or what shall be the character of the people with whom you are to dwell. You are to go the best place, among the people who can be a blessing to you, and whom you can benefit, those who will receive your instruction, and whose influence will tell on the side of truth. Then you can work with courage.",
