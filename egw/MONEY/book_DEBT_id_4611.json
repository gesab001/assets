    "word": "\\n     As Noah warned the people of the coming flood, so God desires His people today to give the warning message of Christ's soon coming. There is no time to lose. Christ's coming is near at hand, and instead of spending our lives in inactivity, instead of investing our means in the things of this world, we should use our talents to the glory of God. Let us put out our money to the exchangers, that at His coming Christ may receive His own with usury.",
