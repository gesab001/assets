    "word": "\\n     When men realize that they are not their own, that they are bought with a price, and are therefore the Lord's property, and all they have is simply intrusted to them as His stewards, they will, with cheerful heart, render to God the things that are His, and there will be no occasion to urge or beg for the tithe. All will realize that they are not proprietors, but stewards, and will know that they must give an account of their Lord's money.",
