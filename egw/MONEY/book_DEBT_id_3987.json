    "word": "\\n     The people of God are not half awake. A stupor seems to be paralyzing their sensibilities. Brethren and sisters, lay aside your love of self, your love of ease and of dress, and let your contributions flow into the treasury. Each of us will soon have to stand before the Judge of all the earth, to answer for the deeds done in the body. All will then have to give an account for the good they might have done, but did not do because they were not so closely connected with God that they could know his will and understand his claims upon them. In God's great book is recorded every dollar that has been needlessly expended for selfish gratification. The means thus used was the Lord's, and you made self an idol and neglected the souls of your fellow-men for whom Christ died. If the money expended for changeable suits of apparel and for adornment had passed into the treasury of God, houses of worship could have been built, halls could have been hired for mission purposes, and where there is now one missionary in the field there might have been one hundred. Who will have to render an account for this great lack of funds? Many of our American friends have done nobly and willingly for the advancement of the truth in Europe. But there is a great work yet to be done. Many who have given liberally could do more, and others should now come forward and bear their share of the burden. Now is the time when houses and lands should be converted into mission funds. Men are to be educated and disciplined. We feel alarmed at the little that is being done, when we have a world-wide message, and the end of all things is at hand. Christ is soon to come in the clouds of heaven to reward every man as his works have been. To whom will it then be said, \\\"Ye have done what ye could.\\\"",
