    "word": "\\n     Many occupy their time in needless stitching and trimming and ruffling of their own and their children's clothing, and thus lose golden moments which they might spend in service. The money that is expended for needless trimmings and useless ornaments, should be used in the purchase of papers and tracts to send to those who are in the darkness of error. The souls saved by this personal effort will be of more value to them than fashionable dress. The white robes and, the jeweled crowns given them by Christ, as their reward for unselfish effort, will a thousand times repay them for the self-denial and self-sacrifice they have shown in his cause.",
