    "word": "\\n     The ardor of the youth is now needed. They should put away vanity and restrict their wants. I would urge upon them and upon all our people that the money usually invested in unnecessary things be put to a higher, holier use. Do what you can toward creating a fund for the aged ministers, worn out with constant labor and care. Consecrate all that you have to the Lord. Do not use your money to gratify self. Put it into the Lord's treasury. Do not allow means to pass recklessly out of your hands merely to gratify the wishes of yourselves or others. In your expenditure of means consider that it is the Lord's money which you are handling, and that you must render to Him an account for its use.",
