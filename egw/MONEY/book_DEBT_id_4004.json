    "word": "\\n     A great responsibility rests upon those who profess the truth, to guard their means from flowing into channels that will not bring glory to God. How much has been thoughtlessly wasted by our youth in America, spent for display, for things which they would have been just as happy without! Every dollar we possess is the Lord's. Instead of spending means in self-indulgence, we should invest it in answering the calls of missionary work. As new fields are opened, these calls are constantly increasing. A deep longing is now taking possession of souls, a longing for something which they have not. They call for light, for help, for the opening of the Scriptures. To meet these calls we must have means. If we ever needed workers who would use means economically, it is now. They should see in the money they handle, a trust which God has committed to them. Every cent should be carefully treasured. A cent seems like a trifle; but a hundred cents make a dollar, and, rightly spent, may be the means of saving a soul from death.",
