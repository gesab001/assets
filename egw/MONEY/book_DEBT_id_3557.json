    "word": "\\n     \\\"'The Lord is good; praise his holy name,' I said over and over again. He has mercifully saved every life, and has taken away an objectionable part of the building. I am glad that it has come about in this way. Had a proposition been made to tear that part of the building down, some would have regarded it as a great waste. Now you can have a suitable addition put on the building. It is an unfavorable time of the year to take up this work, but begin to rebuild as soon as you can. Be continually making preparations to this point. If much snow falls, I suppose you will have to wait. If I could help you financially, I certainly would; but I can not. I have had to borrow money recently myself. We must do our best. There is so much to do, and such a lack of means, that it almost looks as if we had to make bricks without straw. I will pray the Lord to open the way for you to rebuild in a way that will correspond with the rest of the buildings. I pray that God will bless all that you do, and that it may be well done. \\n                                                             \\\"Ellen G. White.\\\"",
