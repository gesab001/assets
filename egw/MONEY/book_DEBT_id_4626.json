    "word": "\\n\\nMarch 23, 1904 A Life of Helpfulness.\\n\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n\\n     God has given every one a part to act in His great plan for the uplifting of humanity. Christ has linked together the human and the divine. On this earth, in the garb of humanity, He lived the life that He desires His disciples to live,--a life of unselfish service. Are we living this life? Are we giving the invitation: \\\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? . . . Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near; let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon\\\"? \\n\\n                                               -\\n",
