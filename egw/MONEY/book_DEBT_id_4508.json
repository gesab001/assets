    "word": "\\n     Experience shows that a spirit of benevolence is more frequently found among those of limited means than among the more wealthy. Many who greatly desire riches would be ruined by their possession. When such persons are intrusted with talents of means, they too often hoard or waste the Lord's money, until the Master says to them individually, \\\"Thou shalt be no longer steward.\\\" They dishonestly use that which is another's as though it were their own. God will not intrust them with eternal riches.",
