    "word": "It is true that more money was used in the erection of the Boulder Sanitarium than ought to have been used. If men had moved in the order of God, the institution would not have absorbed so large an amount of money, and we would not now have such a heavy burden of interest-bearing debts. Money was expended lavishly, in a way not in the order of God. And because of this, those who have come in to take charge of the institution have had to bear a severe test and trial. But when the burden and the test come, it is for us to ask what God means by the burden, and what He means by the test. There certainly is a work to be done by the Boulder Sanitarium, and a broad work to be done in the vicinity of this sanitarium. Laborers should be working all through that section of the country. There are souls there to be brought to a knowledge of the truth.",
