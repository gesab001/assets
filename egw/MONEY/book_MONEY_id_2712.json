    "word": "Many poor souls torture themselves, many go on long pilgrimages, thinking to find Christ. If this were the way to secure the treasure, the poor \n\n\n                                  -131- \n\nwould be in a hopeless condition. The afflicted, the lame, and the blind would fail to find the treasure. But salvation is given without money and without price. All we are asked to do is to believe in Christ as our personal Saviour, and be doers of His Word. [Romans 10:6-10, quoted.]",
