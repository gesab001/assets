    "word": "\\n     \\\"One man, who, in prosperous times, was a well-to-do livery-man, became sick and poor, and the whole family, numbering eight, were all sick with influenza. A young man who had learned lessons in the Health Home, nursed the father, and Sister McEnterfer cared for the mother and the children, and all recovered. The father and mother came to our meetings, were convicted, and both were converted; and the father threw his pipe into the fire. When his wife saw this she cried most heartily. 'Are you feeling bad because I broke my pipe?' She said, 'Oh, no; but I thought when my family was supported by the washings I was taking from place to place, I had to give of my little to buy tobacco. Why did you not do this before' Said he, 'Wife, I was not before understanding the sinfulness of tobacco using, and liquor and tea drinking; but I will not grieve you any more. If Brother and Sister White will give me work to do I will earn money now to support my wife and children.' He has worked steadily for one year, and he says, 'I look at my self and say: Is this Hungerford? I really scarcely know myself, -- eating proper food and enjoying physical strength,--I am coming up from being sick and discouraged, and work like a strong man.'\\\"",
