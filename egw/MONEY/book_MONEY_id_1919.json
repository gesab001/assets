    "word": "Your being a physician, in no wise releases you from the necessity of practising economy. There are new fields to be entered, and to enter these fields requires the closest economy. Will you be content to let others lift the cross and practise self-denial, while you indulge your fancies, spending money freely to make a show? God requires you to accomplish good with every jot of your influence and with every dollar of your money. Then will be seen the most blessed results.",
