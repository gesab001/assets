    "word": "\\n     The talents lent us on trust are to be used to benefit and bless others. They are lent to be improved. Their value is in themselves. Whether or not the one to whom they are intrusted realizes their value, they remain the same. But if he does not appreciate them, they are of no value to him. Money may be locked up in various ways. It is still money, but it is of no special benefit to any one. But money wisely invested brings money in return, which may be used to gain more money. Thus it is with the householder's treasures, the Word of the living God. The use made of the gems of truth determines their value to the possessor. They are to be used to help and bless and save those for whom the Lord gave His only-begotten Son. Then they are of the highest value to us. In this way we may increase our talents, adding jewel to jewel.",
