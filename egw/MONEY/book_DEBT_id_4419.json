    "word": "\\n     For many years Jehoshaphat was allowed to live in peace, unmolested by the surrounding nations. \\\"The fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the land that were round about Judah.\\\" From Philistia he received tribute-money and presents; from Arabia, large flocks of sheep and goats. \\\"Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store. . . . Men of war, mighty men of valor, . . . waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.\\\" Blessed with \\\"riches and honor in abundance,\\\" he was enabled to wield a mighty influence for truth and righteousness. \\n\\n                                               -\\n",
