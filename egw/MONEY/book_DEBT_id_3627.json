    "word": "\\n     Many parents act as if it were a great privilege to be able to introduce their children into so-called \\\"good society.\\\" To do this, their resources are taxed to the utmost. Money and time are laid on the altar of Mammon until the expenditure far exceed-the income. Still further to keep up appearances, money is borrowed. Daily such parents practise deceit, that they may lead people to think them worthy to be members of what is falsely called \\\"good society.\\\" The children of the family understand the programme; they understand that they must seek to be what they are not,--they must act a deceptive part, in order to be counted worthy of good society.",
