    "word": "\\n     We are taught in the word of God that it is the duty of Christ's followers to prove to the world that while Christianity will lead to industry and economy, it will also condemn avarice and over-reaching, and every other form of dishonesty. The talent, energy, and zeal will not be devoted exclusively to money-getting, but will be used in the interest of the church and the cause of God everywhere. We need God's presence to control, his wisdom to guide us in all the affairs of life. We cannot afford to separate ourselves from him in the smallest transaction. Unwavering integrity marked the character and life of Christ; one of the principles of Heaven was thus exemplified on earth. If the course of his professed followers is contrary to the life given them as a pattern, they show that they have no part in him.",
