    "word": "We must be imbued with the Spirit of Christ. We cannot labor with God merely from our intellect or our education. We cannot buy the grace of God with money; we cannot buy it with eloquence; we cannot buy it with the power of our intellect. It is God's to begin with. . . . We are to occupy to the best knowledge that we have, and sense our responsibility, and let our light shine through us to those that are around us, and in doing that we are doing the work of God.--Manuscript 11, Feb. 17, 1894, \"Isaiah 58.\"",
