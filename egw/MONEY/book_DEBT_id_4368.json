    "word": "\\n     My sisters, do not spend your money lavishly for dress. Fathers and mothers teach your children to dress inexpensively; teach them to save their pennies for missionary work. Let every member of the family practise self-denial. Christ is our example. He was the Prince of glory, but he had such an interest in our world that he left his riches and came to this earth to live a life that should be an example to rich and poor alike. He taught that all should come together in love and unity, to work as he worked, to sacrifice as he sacrificed, and to love as children of God.",
