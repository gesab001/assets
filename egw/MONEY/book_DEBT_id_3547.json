    "word": "\\n     Notwithstanding the light given by God, ten thousand dollars were called for, and double that amount was used in building an addition to the school. The managers of the Review and Herald had much to do in this matter. These things must be considered. The Review and Herald is not required to pay the College debt; for if this were done, calls would be made for other schools to be helped in the same way. But the interest on this debt should be made as low as possible. Interest should not be charged upon interest. Neither should those who have loaned money charge a higher rate of interest than they themselves pay. One institution should have the tenderest and most kindly feelings for the sister institution. The work done in one is as much the Lord's work as the work done in the other. The time has come when the Lord will have all the powers of his people brought into exercise to relieve the situation of our schools. In order to help in this cause, I have proposed giving my book, \\\"The Parables of Jesus.\\\" I feel very anxious that the General Conference shall act unselfishly in regard to this book, which is to be published to help the schools. This is a time when the conference should stand before the people in a better light than it has hitherto done. We shall call upon the people to help to the utmost of their ability just now. We shall call upon them to do a work which will be pleasing to God in purchasing the book. We shall ask that every available means be used to help circulate this book. We shall ask that the whole field be supplied with canvassers. We shall call upon our ministers, as they visit the churches, to encourage men and women to go out as canvassers, and to make a decided forward movement in the path of self-denial by giving part of their earnings to help our schools to get out of debt. Surely they can do this much to help the Master.",
