    "word": "\\n     Time and money are thus expended, not to add to the convenience and healthfulness of the dress, but to render it ungraceful, untidy, cumbersome, and injurious; and all this is for the express purpose of conforming to a senseless fashion. The useless trimming and arranging of these dresses take a vast amount of time. This may not seem of so much consequence to the wealthier class, who hire all their sewing done, but to those of limited means it is a serious consideration. Yet, nevertheless, most of them endeavor as far as possible to meet the demands of fashion, and impose upon themselves a rigorous task in forming with their own hands the useless trimming and appendages thought necessary to complete a \\\"stylish\\\" costume. The purse is pinched, things needed for the comfort of the home are dispensed with, time which should be given to the family is wasted, poverty creeps in with extravagance and neglect; and wretchedness follows this blind, unreasoning effort to keep pace with the fashionable world. Happiness, health, and often life itself, are sacrificed on the altar of fashion.",
