    "word": "\\n     Woe to him whose wisdom is not from above, but from beneath. Men of superficial piety, by their desire to obtain patronage for our institutions, to advance the fame of our colleges or sanitariums, should never be permitted to betray sacred trusts into the hands of unbelievers. Let not money be obtained by touching or by sanctioning any unclean practice or business. Let the grace of Christ be brought into the heart of every worker, and though the workers may be few, God can work with them, and the truth will prevail. There must be no deceptive work, for it is an unclean thing. Hands that are defiled must not handle God's sacred work. It is clean hands and a pure heart only that God will accept. \\\"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\\\"",
