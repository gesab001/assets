They are taught that the money which they save by denying themselves goes to relieve a race whom the great majority of people in this country seem largely to have forgotten. The colored people need help and education and training, and we are going to work to the point until a great work is accomplished. As long as God gives me breath, I shall bear my testimony regarding this matter. I thank God that he has means and ways by which self-denial can be taught in the family. Thus his people are to be taught how to do missionary work, how to go out and in simplicity open the Word of God to others. When questioned about their faith, they are able to state plainly and clearly the reasons of their faith. Such families bring into the church the influence of their home training. \\n                            (To be concluded) \\n                                                                -\\n",
