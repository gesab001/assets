    "word": "\\n     The churches must arouse, and not sit down at ease, merely enjoying the sermons. Light is beaming all around them; let this light shine forth as a lamp that burneth. Let men enter the work, and let the money God has lent his stewards be invested. Those who can work for God's cause should break loose from their home attachments, sell their farms, and give themselves either to home or foreign missions. You have no time to spend in contention over little matters. Go to work, and that which may now seem obscure, will become clear. There are fields close to your own doors and also in foreign lands, that are ripening for the harvest. The Lord calls for volunteers now. Go forth, workers for God, weeping, bearing precious seed; for doubtless you will return with rejoicing, bringing your sheaves with you. Your prayers and tears must accompany your labors, that the unholy traits of your own character may not mar the sacred work of God. Depend less upon what you can do, even through your best efforts, and more on what God can do for you in every effort for his name's glory.",
