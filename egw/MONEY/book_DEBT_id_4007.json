    "word": "\\n     None need be in darkness concerning their duty if they make God's word their rule. They should study the instructions given by Christ upon different occasions, and should put them in practice. The Saviour has bidden us, \\\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, . . . but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.\\\" Some selfishly retain their means during their life-time, trusting to make up for their neglect by remembering the cause in their wills. But not half of the means thus bestowed in legacies, ever benefits the object specified. Brethren and sisters, invest in the bank of heaven yourselves, and do not leave your stewardship upon another. Do just as Christ has directed you, and you are in a safe path. In obeying this injunction, our example will preach louder than words. The highest display of the power of the truth is seen when those who profess to believe it give evidence of their faith by their works. Those who believe this solemn truth, should possess such a spirit of self sacrifice that the worldly ambition of the money-worshiper will be rebuked. We shall be brought into straight places in our work. Trials will come. God will test the strength of our faith. He will prove us to see if we will trust him under difficulties. The silver and the gold are the Lord's; and when his stewards have done their duty fully, and can do no more, they are not to sit down at ease, and let things take their course. It is then that they should cry to God for help. There should be stated seasons for prayer. Let those who have faith seek the Lord earnestly, remembering that the \\\"kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.\\\"",
