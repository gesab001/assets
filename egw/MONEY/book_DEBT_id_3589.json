    "word": "\\n     Again, there is work to be done by those who have money in banks. These should place their money in the trust of God's servants, and the money should be loaned without interest to carry forward the work of God in the world. The last great message, the gospel of mercy, is to press its way to every nation and kindred and tongue and people. Let the stewards of means wake up, and put into circulation the means that is now doing no good in the cause of God. Advance work must be done in the vineyard of the Lord. Opportunities are constantly arising for opening the work in new fields and carrying forward aggressive warfare in places where there are souls to be saved while probation lasts, in places where men and women will be influenced to come to a knowledge of the truth. Let all who believe the truth for this time work out their own salvation with fear and trembling; \\\"for it is God which worketh in you, to will and to do of His good pleasure.\\\" There is no time to be lost.",
