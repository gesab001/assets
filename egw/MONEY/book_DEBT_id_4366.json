    "word": "\\n     When I see those who claim to believe present truth spending their means for useless trimmings and personal adornment; when I see their tables loaded down with story-magazines which have cost money; when I see the many photographs which have called for the outlay of means that might have been used in blessing the needy, my heart is made sad, and I pray, \\\"Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.\\\" I wish such souls could understand the spirit in which Christ, the Prince of heaven, came to this world. He laid off his kingly crown and royal robe, and for our salvation assumed human nature. He would give to every church that should be established in his name an example of what every true missionary worker should be. He was in the world as \\\"a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\\\" Though he was one with God, and had made the world, he became a member of a humble family, and experienced the privations of the poor. Throughout his life he ever manifested a burden for the souls of men.",
