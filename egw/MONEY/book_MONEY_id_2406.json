    "word": "Bismarck is very much like Colorado in appearance. Homes and little spots of cleared land are dotted here and there among the hills. Wisely the farmers do not expend money and time and strength to make large clearings at once. They build their cottages in a cleared spot of land, and then clear the land gradually for their orchards and crops. If in the place of forests of bluegum trees there were the lofty evergreens--pine, spruce, and hemlock--we should consider it an excellent representation of Colorado.",
