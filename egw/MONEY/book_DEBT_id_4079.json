    "word": "\\n\\nAugust 11, 1891 Care of the Mites.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     I wish I could impress on every mind the grievous sinfulness of wasting the Lord's money on fancied wants. The expenditure of sums that look small, may start a train of circumstances that will reach into eternity. When the Judgment shall sit, and the books are opened, the losing side will be presented to your view--the good that you might have done with the accumulated mites and the larger sums that were used for wholly selfish purposes. And what will it reveal?--Just that deficiency in the bank of heaven,--robbery toward God, some destitute bodies not clothed, some poor souls praying for light and knowledge robbed of the bread of life. Your money went to gratify perverted appetite, or to indulge vanity. O, what shame and grief will come to your souls as you see how much you have lost! Look about you, and see if there is not a work which the Lord has given you. The 58th chapter of Isaiah presents before you a work that has been neglected.",
