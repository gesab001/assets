    "word": "\\n     Great wisdom is needed in order to act wisely, and yet offend as little as possible; but should a kind, God-fearing minister attempt to conduct the affairs of a Conference in such a way as to please all, he will be liable to end by pleasing no one. The presidents of the several Conferences should seek wisdom of God, and should counsel with men of experience, and they should then work for the general good of the cause of God. The interests of selfish, money-loving men and women should not sway their judgment, even if these persons are greatly offended because their wishes are not met.",
