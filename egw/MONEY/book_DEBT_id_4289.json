    "word": "\\n     Soon there is to be trouble all over the world. It becomes every one to seek to know God. We have no time to delay. With earnestness and fervor the message must be given: \\\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, . . . buy wine and milk without money and without price.\\\" \\\"Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice; for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the Lord, speak, saying, The Lord hath utterly separated me from his people; neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.\\\"",
