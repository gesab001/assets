White.\\n\\n\\n                        The Object of Education. \\n\\n     I would not in any case counsel restriction of the education to which God has set no limit. Our education does not end with the advantages that this world can give. Through all eternity the chosen of God will be learners. But I would advise restriction in following those methods of education which imperil the soul and defeat the purpose for which time and money are spent. Education is a grand life-work; but to obtain true education it is necessary to possess that wisdom that comes alone from God. The Lord God should be represented in every phase of education.",
