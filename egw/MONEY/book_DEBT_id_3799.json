    "word": "\\n     Thousands are groping in darkness who ought to have had light long ago. Time and money have been consumed unnecessarily, and voices that could speak have been silent when they should have been giving the last message of mercy to the world. O how much the people of God have yet to learn before they will realize that it is not those who know the truth who are to be forever favored with the work of the ministers; but the ministers should work with their God-given ability to erect the standard of truth among those who have not even heard that there is such a people in the world as Seventh-day Adventists.",
