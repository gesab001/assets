    "word": "Basel, Nov. 23, 1885. Devote some time to writing. Have conversation with Elder Whitney. He read letters from Brethren Daniel and A. C. Bourdeau, urging our going to Italy, and Daniel urges we come around through Geneva. But this will cost time and money, and as our tickets take us on that route in returning, we decide to go direct to Italy, leaving Basel next Thursday morning, which will bring us to Torre Pellice about noon.",
