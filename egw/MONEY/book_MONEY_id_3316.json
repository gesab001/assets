    "word": "\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto Me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto Me; hear, and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the (814) people, a leader and a commander to the people. Behold thou shalt call a nation that you knowest not; and nations \n\n\n                              -463- \n\nthat know not thee shall run after thee, because of the Lord thy God, and for the holy One of Israel; for He hath glorified thee.\" (Isaiah 55:1-5)",
