    "word": "\\n     I entreat of you to extend your vision and broaden your ideas. In the place of investing so largely in your supposed necessities, and swallowing up the available means in the treasury, give us something that we may work in cities where there are not any souls who have an interest in the truth, who must be warned and aroused that the kingdom of God may be built up. God does not purpose to do your work; but he requires that you give some chance that the seeds of truth may be sown in places where the soil has never been broken; and the seed sown in these cities will be watered by the Lord of heaven, and there will be an increase. The leaven of truth must be first hidden in the meal before it will leaven the lump. Once get the truth planted in new fields, in cities where they have never heard the message, and then the increase and progress will follow. The people know nothing of the truth. They are ignorant of truth. They know nothing of the reasons of our faith. They believe what the church ministers tell them. And is there, then, to be no effort made, that they shall know what is truth for this time? What can be done in these cities, without money to start the work? And if you continually see places where you think you may use to advantage the means, must these countries be left and the ground not plowed or sown? Will the Lord be pleased with this kind of neglect? The field is the world. America is not the whole world,--only a little piece of it. I know there are many calls for means in all foreign countries; but here there is such a condition of things financially that we cannot depend on any help coming from these fields, until we have some facilities to till the soil and sow the seed.",
