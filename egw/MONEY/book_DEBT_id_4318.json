    "word": "\\n     A sanitarium building is to be erected at Takoma Park, that this work may be carried forward. Will not those who have means feel it a privilege to give something toward this work, that the needed fund may be raised soon? The Lord will certainly bless those who will cheerfully return to him his own. Doors that were once fast closed are now opening wide for the entrance of our workers. I call upon our people, while the way is open, to do earnest work, to rally round the standard, to answer the call that has been made for the completion of the One Hundred Thousand Dollar Fund. Come up to the help of the Lord against the mighty. This work is the Lord's, and he calls upon those who have means to place it in the treasury for the advancement of his work. Send in your offerings for the buildings to be erected at Takoma Park. We are praying that the money buried in lands and houses may now be called in, because it is the Lord's money, and he needs it. It is to our honor to send in large and small sums, so that, when the next General Conference shall assemble, we can say that the fund needed has been raised.",
