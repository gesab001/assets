    "word": "\\n     Consecrate yourselves wholly to the work of God. He is your strength, and he will be at your right hand, helping you to carry out his merciful designs. By personal labor reach those around you. Preaching alone will not do the work that needs to be done. A perfect work can not be done by proxy. Money lent or given will not accomplish all that is to be done. By visiting the people, talking, praying, sympathizing with them, you will win hearts. This is the highest missionary work that you can do. To do it, you will need resolute, persevering faith, unwearying patience, and a deep love for souls.",
