    "word": "The men whose heads were white with age, and their faces furrowed with care, who were eagerly grasping the treasures within the crown, were the aged who have but a few years before them. Yet they were eager to secure their earthly treasures. The nearer they came to the grave, the more anxious they were to cling to them. Their own relatives were not benefited. The members of their own families were permitted to labor beyond their strength to save a little money. They did not use it for other's good, or for their own. It was enough for them to know that they had it. When their duty to the poor, and the wants of God's cause are presented before them, they are sorrowful. They would gladly accept the gift of everlasting life, but are not willing that it should cost them any thing. The conditions are too hard. But Abraham would not withhold his only son. He could sacrifice this child of promise to obey God, more easily than many would sacrifice some of their earthly possessions.",
