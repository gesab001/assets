    "word": "You have nothing to fear; invest your means where it will be doing good; scatter rays of light to the darkest parts of the world. There is no such thing as failure in this work. It is your privilege and duty to do now as your brethren did when there were but few friends of the cause of truth. Take stock in our houses of publication, that you may feel that you have an interest in them. Many invest their money in worldly speculations, and in doing this are robbed of every dollar. We ask you to show your liberality by making investments in our publishing work. It will do you good. Your money will not be lost, but will be placed at interest to increase your capital stock in heaven. Christ has given all for you; what will you give for Him? He asks your heart; give it to Him, it is His own. He asks your intellect; give it to Him; it is His own. He asks your money; give it to Him, it is His own. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price.\" God wants you and yours. Let the words of the royal psalmist express the sentiment of your hearts: \"All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.\"--4T 592-596.",
