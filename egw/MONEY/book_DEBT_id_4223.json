    "word": "\\n     The gospel of Christ is an educator. It teaches us not to pamper and indulge self, and waste the money that should be used to extend the triumphs of the cross of Christ. There never lived a more energetic, self-sacrificing disciple of Christ than was Paul. He was one of the world's greatest teachers. He crossed the seas, and traveled far and near, until a large portion of the world had heard from his lips the story of the cross of Christ. But although he had planted many churches, he refused to be supported by them, fearing that his usefulness and success as a minister of the gospel might be interfered with by suspicions of his motives. He would remove all occasion for his enemies to misrepresent him, and thus detract from the force of his message.",
