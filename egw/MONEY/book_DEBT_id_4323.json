    "word": "\\n\\nJune 1, 1905 The Work in Washington\\n\\n        A Talk by Mrs. E. G. White, Friday, May 19, at 10 A. M. \\n\\n     We feel very grateful to our Heavenly Father because he has moved by his Holy Spirit upon the minds of his people to give so liberally for the establishment of his work here in Washington. Every dollar of the money that has been sent in is needed. If God's people knew as I do the necessities of the cause in different parts of the great harvest-field, and if they felt as they should the urgency of the work, they would not permit of delay. I have seen workers on their knees, pleading with God to open the way for the truth to be proclaimed in places where souls, unwarned and unsaved, are perishing in their sins. There are houses of worship to be built, and in some places it is necessary that there be erected small sanitariums, that the higher classes may be reached.",
