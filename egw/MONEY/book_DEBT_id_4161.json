    "word": "\\n     Were the thousand channels of selfishness cut off that now exist, and the means directed in the right channel, there would be a large revenue flowing into the treasury.

Self-denial and the cross lie directly in the path of every Christian who is truly following Christ. Jesus says: \\\"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\\\" Will every soul consider the fact that Christian discipleship includes self-denial, self-sacrifice, even to the laying down of life itself if need be, for the sake of Him who has given his life for the life of the world?",
