    "word": "\\n     Those who would be happy, who would be a blessing to the world, must make the Bible their standard of character, and work in Christ's lines. Can it be possible that those who have riches and who spend money only for the gratification of self, have Bibles? If they have, do they read them? Have they read of the foolish rich man, who was abundantly blessed of God? Why?--In order to test and prove him, and make it manifest that he was not a character that could be trusted with eternal riches. What did the rich man do?--Just what many today are doing. Instead of opening his eyes to see the suffering around him, instead of opening his ears to hear their cry of distress, instead of appropriating his goods to supply their deficiencies, he said: \\\"What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do; I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\\\" But what decision does the Lord make in regard to this disposal of matters?--\\\"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.\\\"",
