    "word": "\\n     What are we doing to proclaim Christ to the world? What sacrifices are we making to second his efforts? Who is putting forth every effort to bring the light of truth to others, that they may be enriched by its imperishable treasure? Millions of human beings are perishing for the water of life; and what excuse will many have to give in the judgment for their love of ease and amusement, and for indulging in self-gratification? They put forth no personal effort, neither do they give of the money which the Lord has intrusted to their keeping for the very purpose of blessing their fellow-men and bringing salvation to the doors of those who are ignorant of truth and righteousness. A free gospel, and yet bound away from hungering souls for want of money and self-denying, self-sacrificing workers! The Rock of salvation was smitten for you to drink. For Christ's sake, drink, and he will be in you a well of water, springing up into everlasting life. If you drink, and your soul is refreshed, you will want others to drink, that they may be refreshed. Your hearts will be softened, your souls invigorated.",
