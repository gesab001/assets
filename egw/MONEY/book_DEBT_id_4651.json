    "word": "\\n\\nSeptember 3, 1901 Be Assured\\n\\n     Be assured the plagues are already beginning to be poured out. But notwithstanding Christ's warning, notwithstanding what is taking place in the world, even those who claim to be expositors of Bible truths do not take in the situation. Well indeed is it that sanitariums are established among us, to be as lights shining in a dark place. The calamities that come as the result of wrong eating and drinking have little effect upon the people. We are to mark the fulfillment of the words of Christ, \\\"As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it also be in the days of the Son of man.\\\" By searching the Scriptures we shall form the habit of drawing spiritual instruction from the common occurrences of life. The signs of the times give evidence that the threatened judgments of God are being permitted to do their work. Indulgence of pride, selfishness, and covetousness, thefts and bold robberies, are common; but the world is not being warned as it should be. Thousands are perishing in their sins, and the last message of mercy to a fallen world is to be proclaimed. But little is being done! Genuine benevolence will lead those who have been entrusted with the Lord's money to place this money where it will advance His work. Souls are perishing, and hundreds of workers are now needed. Men will be moved by the Holy Spirit to leave their ordinary employment and enter the barren fields that have never heard the last message of mercy.--From private letter from Mrs. E. G. White, under date of August 7, 1901.",
