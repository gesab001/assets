    "word": "\\n     Upon our churches rests a solemn responsibility in this line. The youth who wish to become workers for God should be given an opportunity to obtain a knowledge of Bible truth. Many workers are needed in home missions as well as in foreign fields. They are needed as Bible workers, as canvassers, nurses, teachers in church schools, and in many other lines. Will you not aid them in gaining a preparation for the work? Through the teacher your money has prepared for the field, souls may be saved from ruin, to shine as stars in the Redeemer's crown.",
