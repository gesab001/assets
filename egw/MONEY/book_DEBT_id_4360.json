    "word": "\\n     Every dollar is required in the work of saving souls. The money invested by the professed people of God in getting pictures made of human faces would support several missionaries in the field. Many small streams, when put together, swell into a large river. We embezzle our Lord's goods when we use for selfish pleasure the means which should be used to proclaim the last message of warning. If you spend the Lord's money for self-gratification, how can you expect him to continue to bestow his goods on you? How does the Master regard those who selfishly invest his money in photographs? That very money could have been used to purchase reading-matter to send to those in the darkness of ignorance.",
