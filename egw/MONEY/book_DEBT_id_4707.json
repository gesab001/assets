    "word": "\\n     No man is excusable for being without financial ability. Of many a man it may be said, He is kind, amiable, generous, a good man, and a Christian, but he is not qualified to manage his own business. As far as the proper outlay of money is concerned, he is a mere child. He has not been educated by his parents to understand and practice the principles of self-support. Such a man is not fitted to become a minister or a physician. The churches everywhere are suffering through the neglect of parents to train their children to bear hard, stern responsibilities. Too often the wicked love to do nothing but use the mind takes possession of children and youth. Then the enemy takes control, and makes the mind his workshop, using in his service the ability needed in the family and in the church.",
