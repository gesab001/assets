    "word": "Spend Your Money on Souls, Not Jewelry.--Shall those who profess the name of Christ see no attraction in the world's Redeemer? Will they be indifferent to the possession of truth and righteousness, and turn from the heavenly treasure to the earthly? Can you, my sister, use the Lord's money to purchase diamonds or any other jewels for any person? These cannot save one soul. They will not lead anyone to accept the saving truths for this time. Let us do nothing to encourage a vanity that is sinful. No, my sister, save the money you may be tempted to spend in this way, and place it where it will bring honor and glory to Christ. When your brother becomes anxious to secure the Pearl of great price, which is truth, pure, unadulterated truth, he will see that that which he now deems wisdom is vanity.",
