    "word": "\\n     There are many professors of religion in our world, but few who follow Jesus with pure and holy purposes. The Bible means just what it says. The blessings are distinctly apportioned to those who are Christ-like, whose hearts are touched with human woe, and who realize that they are trading with their Lord's money. Such will not feel at liberty to use the money in their hands for purchasing unnecessary articles to please their vanity, to gratify pride and love of display; but they will look at it as the Lord's. There is a place for every penny that you do not actually need for comfortable food and clothing. The empty treasury in different States calls out against every needless expenditure. If you have money, do not spend it for extra ribbons or trimmings or articles of adornment, but let the rivulets flow into the treasury of God, to be registered to your account in the books of heaven. To fashion the garments after the world's standard, requires much more means than to make them after the divine directions given in the word of God.",
