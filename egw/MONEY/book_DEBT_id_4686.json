    "word": "\\n     No church is to be passive; no individual member of the church is to be irresponsible and unemployed. The Lord soon cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their iniquity; the earth shall disclose her blood, and no more cover her slain. The message of warning must be carried to sinners; it must be proclaimed to those who have not had the light of truth. The church must be educated to the idea that they are not to use their time and their money upon themselves, but must devote themselves to the diffusing of light to those who are in darkness. The whole law is fulfilled by him who loves God with all his heart, and his neighbor as himself. Upon these two principles of love hang all the law and the prophets. The Lord Jesus loves those for whom he died, and he requires all who believe on his name to cooperate with him in self-denial and self-sacrifice. Those who believe in Christ as their personal Saviour will put forth earnest efforts to make him known. He is the way, the truth, and the life, and by presenting the truth as it is in Jesus, souls that are perishing will be saved.",
