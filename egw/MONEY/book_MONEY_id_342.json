    "word": "Self-Denial--Self-Sacrifice \n\n     In want and distress, God's children are calling to Him. Many are dying for want of the necessaries of life. Their cries have entered the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. He will call to a strict account those who have neglected His needy ones. What will these selfish rich men do when the Lord asks them, \"What did you do with the money I gave you to use for Me?\" \"These shall go away into everlasting punishment.\" The Lord will say to them, \"Depart from Me, ye cursed; . . . for I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in: naked, and ye clothed Me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited Me not.\"",
