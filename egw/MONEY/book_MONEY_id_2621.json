    "word": "Let those that have work bringing the highest wages come forward and act a part proportionate to the wages they receive. Let the men who have limited wages have an interest in this matter also. Do what you can, and lay aside something besides your tithe money. Have you a box for this purpose? Explain to your children that it is the self-denial box, in which you lay aside every penny, every shilling, that you can obtain and do not need to spend for actual necessities. It is for the Lord's house. It is sacred self-denial money. It is a gift to the Lord, to lift the God-dishonoring debt from the meeting house. Doing this, every member of the family will be blessed.--Manuscript 116, 1897, pp. 8,9,12-15. (\"The Building of the Lord's House,\" no date.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 22, 1980",
