    "word": "\\n     \\\"What makes it so hard for the rich to enter into the kingdom of heaven? Why are riches, in the place of becoming a precious treasure used to advance the work and cause of God, made a curse, separating the soul from God? Why allow them to lead to the idolatry of self? God wants you, rich men, to use your goods as a sacred trust, not your own. He has made you stewards over these goods. You are to calculate wisely, employing your powers to use, to the very best advantage, the money entrusted.",
