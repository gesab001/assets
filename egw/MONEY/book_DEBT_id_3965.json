    "word": "\\n     The true object of education should be carefully considered. God has intrusted to each one capacities and powers, that they may be returned to him enlarged and improved. All his gifts are granted to us to be used to the utmost. He requires every one of us to cultivate our powers, and attain the highest possible capacity for usefulness, that we may do noble work for God, and bless humanity. Every talent that we possess, whether of mental capacity, money, or influence, is of God, so that we may say with David. \\\"All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.\\\"",
