    "word": "\\n     Let no one at this time say, \\\"We will hold our means in reserve that we may do what will need to be done in our own vicinity.\\\" You may not be prepared to erect buildings, be they ever so humble, while we in this locality are prepared to arise and build. Indeed, we must do this. The owners of the present Sanitarium building have kindly extended our time of occupation to accommodate our real necessities; but the building must soon be vacated, and we must have a place in which to carry on the work now in progress. Then let each without delay first make their donations, and then loan their money without requiring interest. Let the mind and purpose of God be seen in the faith and good works, the self-denial and self-sacrifice of God's believing people.",
