    "word": "\\n     Our sisters can serve as vigilant workers in writing, and drawing out the true feelings of friends who have received our papers and tracts. Very valuable items are brought to light through this means. The writers should not seek for self-exaltation, but to present the truth in its simplicity wherever they shall have an opportunity. The money that has been spent for needless trimmings and useless ornaments should be spent in the purchase of papers and tracts to send to those who are in the darkness of error. The souls saved by their personal efforts will be more precious to them than fashionable dress. The white robes given them by Christ, and the jeweled crown as their reward for their unselfish efforts in the salvation of souls, will be more valuable than needless adornments. The stars in their crowns will shine forever and ever, and will a thousand times repay them for the self-denial and self-sacrifice they have exercised in the cause of God.",
