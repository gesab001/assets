    "word": "\\n     The mind must be active to invent the best ways and means of reaching the people next us. We should not be far-reaching, incurring great expense. There are individuals and families near us for whom we should make personal efforts. We often let opportunities within our reach slip away, in order to do a work at a distance from us which is less hopeful, and thus our time and means may be lost in both places. The study of the workers now should be to learn the trade of gathering souls into the gospel net. Our cause is struggling in poverty because we are trying to do so much. The banner of truth is being planted in all countries and among all nations; and every worker should try so to shape his labor as to secure immediate results. He should remember that he is a light-bearer from God to the world, and should so educate those who receive the truth at his hands that they in turn will become light-bearers to others. This will require foresight and much careful study and earnest prayer. At this point in the history of our work we may spread over a great deal of territory, scatter our efforts, use up our time and money, and yet have little fruit to show for our labors--few souls who will help sustain the work by their influence, their efforts, and their means.",
