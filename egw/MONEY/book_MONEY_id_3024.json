    "word": "Money is to be used to the best advantage. There are those who are not as discreet as they might be in dealing with their Lord's goods, while others make money go as far as it will. The Lord desires the managers in our institutions to be economical, for no one can tell what work may open which would advance the cause if there was money in the treasury to use at the proper moment. We should act discreetly for the simple reason that we are trading on the Lord's goods. Our money is not our own. Watch unto prayer, and then study how the Lord's money may be best used to advance His cause and raise memorials to Him in fields which have never yet been entered.",
