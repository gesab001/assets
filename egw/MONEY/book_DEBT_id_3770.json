    "word": "\\n     Will men and women be warned? Will they cherish the light? or, will they become slaves to appetite and passion? Christ presents to us something higher to toil for than merely what we shall eat, and what we shall drink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed. Eating, and drinking, and dressing, are carried to such excess that they become crimes, and are one of the marked sins of the last days, and constitute a sign of Christ's soon coming. Time, money, and strength, which are the Lord's, that he has intrusted to us, are wasted in needless superfluities of dress, and luxuries for the perverted appetite, which lessen vitality, and bring suffering and decay. It is impossible to present to God our bodies a living sacrifice, when they are diseased by sinful indulgence.",
