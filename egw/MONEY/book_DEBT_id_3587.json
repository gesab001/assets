    "word": "\\n     God wants us to bring our lives into closer relationship to Him, who owns all we possess, and who sustains us by His power. All we have is Christ's. By our reception of the truth we are linked to God in Jesus Christ--linked up with God to meet our opportunities with the very life principles which make this union a possibility, the principles of self-denial and self-sacrifice. Men and women who believe the truth are to awake and face their responsibilities, and show themselves willing and ready to co-operate with God. The money and houses and lands which He has given them in trust, they can trade upon and bring into active service. There is a work to be done in the world in the blessing of humanity by giving them an opportunity to prepare for the future eternal life. Each day bears with it responsibilities. Each day brings its opportunities, and these must be discerned by the workmen and made use of without delay. Personal agencies are required to make men laborers together with God to exalt the power of truth in a world of darkness and ignorance and sin. Then let us put forth consecrated efforts, feeling that we are working under the influence of heavenly agencies.",
