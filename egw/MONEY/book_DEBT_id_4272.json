    "word": "\\n\\nJuly 8, 1902 The Lord Knew Best\\n\\n     The Lord knew just the best way to help us out of our difficulty in regard to the debt on the schools. The school work is to me a part of myself, and I am greatly encouraged by the success of the plan to relieve our schools from debt. My heart is made glad in the Lord as I hear of the money brought in by the sale of \\\"Christ's Object Lessons.\\\" The sale of this book is the Lord's own plan, and his blessing is attending the efforts made to carry out this plan. I have already seen much more accomplished than I expected to see.",
