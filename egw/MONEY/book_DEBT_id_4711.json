    "word": "\\n     Many who endure the test of poverty and sickness fail when prosperity comes to them. While they feel that they are dependent on their Heavenly Father for all they have, they preserve their purity and simplicity. But when prosperity comes to them, and they accumulate riches, they forget the Giver. They lose their trust in God. Self-confident and self-sufficient, they look upon their prosperity as the result of their own wisdom and perseverance. They forget that as their money increases, God desires them to use it in doing good.",
