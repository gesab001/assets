    "word": "\\n     God calls upon us to take hold of his work intelligently, and I hope that a beginning is to be made at this meeting. Remember that Battle Creek is not the whole world. No, indeed. We have a world to save, and upon every one of us rests a most solemn responsibility. Let us stand in the counsel of God, in our lot and place, ready to help wherever help is needed. Your money is the Lord's. Use it to build up, not to tear down. When under the direction of God, men say, \\\"I wish to open the work in that field,\\\" do not say, We have no means to help. That is a terrible thing for the angels to hear you say. God wants you to get to work.",
