    "word": "Exalt the Value of the Books\nGod calls upon His people to act like living men and not to be indolent, sluggish, and indifferent. We must carry the publications to the people and urge them to accept, showing them that they will receive much more than their money's worth. Exalt the value of the books you offer. You cannot regard them too highly.\u2014Testimonies, Vol. 4, pages 389-392.",
