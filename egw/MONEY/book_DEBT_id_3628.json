    "word": "\\n     Truth, benevolence, kindness, and love are the graces that dwell in the Christian home. But Satan is constantly inventing interests and excitements to occupy the time and consume the money that should be used for better purposes,--to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and advance the cause of God. Parents, purify the atmosphere of your homes. Let not the home life be of such a character that all influences for good in the training of your children, are counteracted because you are a slave to the world. Can you not see, on every side, the corrupting influences that are being used to pollute the young? Bring into your home the simplicity of correct Christian practices. Give your children instruction in purity and true modesty, that they may not be hurt by the contagion of immorality and irreligion. Make home radiant with the precious rays of the Sun of Righteousness. If pure religion is seen in your lives, it will captivate the hearts of your children. \\n\\n\\n                                                        Mrs. E. G.
