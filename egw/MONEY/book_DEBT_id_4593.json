    "word": "\\n     In his letter to Timothy, Paul speaks of a class of people who dishonor God. In the place of seeking for purity of heart, for love and unity, they reveal that they know not what it means to have the leaven of truth in the heart to mold the affections and sanctify the soul. They are proud, \\\"knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness. From such,\\\" the apostle warns Timothy, \\\"withdraw thyself. But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain that we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\\\"",
