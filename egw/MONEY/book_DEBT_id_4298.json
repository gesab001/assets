    "word": "\\n     \\\"We are laborers together with God.\\\" Ever remember that all your capabilities, all your possessions, are the Lord's, to be used and improved in his service. Remember that all the means you have is given you by God. Use it to glorify his name. Use it wisely and economically, because it is a sacred trust. I ask those who have been entrusted with the Lord's money to labor unselfishly for the Master. Do not tie up your money in estates and banks, when there is such need that it be put into circulation to advance the Lord's work. Remember that your money is yours only in trust. Give the light to others by giving of your means to send workers into new fields. Thus you will hasten the coming of Christ. He who is truly converted will feel it a privilege to give of his means to send the truth into the dark places of the earth.",
