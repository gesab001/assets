    "word": "\\n     This parable illustrates the sin and danger of a self-serving life. Poor are the devotees of mammon. They have embezzled the Lord's goods, placed their own name where God's name should be written, and robbed the soul of his love and favor. \\\"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.\\\" There are a greater number following the example of the foolish rich man than we imagine. The worship due to God is given to money. That which can satisfy the earthly, sensual faculties is sought as the highest good. Many show that they will not trust God's promises, but are trusting to property for happiness. They may call themselves rich, but God calls them poor. Men who claim to acknowledge God, forget him and disown him. They turn from the heavenly treasure for worldly pleasures and enjoyments, until the patience of God is exhausted, and he says, \\\"This night thy soul shall be required of thee.\\\" \\\"Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches.\\\"",
