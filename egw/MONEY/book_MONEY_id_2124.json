    "word": "W. C. SISLEY--SHE CAME TO US AND WANTED TO SELL THE MSS. I SAID TO HER, \"THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY; IF THE BOOK SELLS READILY, WE WANT TO PAY YOU FOR IT.\" SHE SAID TO ME, \"WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOME MONEY; I CAN NOT WAIT FOR ROYALTY.\" SO SHE FORCED US INTO MAKING THAT ARRANGEMENT WITH HER. SHE SAID SHE DID NOT WANT EXTRA ROYALTY. SHE REFERRED TO THIS VERY KIND OF TRADE MADE WITH BROTHER SMITH ON \"SPIRITUALISM,\" AND SAID SHE WANTED THAT KIND OF TRADE. THIS WAS ALL DONE TO SUIT HER, AND NOT TO SUIT US. I THINK THE WHOLE BOARD WILL SUSTAIN ME IN THAT. THAT IS HOW THAT CAME ABOUT. OF COURSE, IF IT IS NOT RIGHT TO DO THAT-----",
