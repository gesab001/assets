    "word": "You have been made the depositaries of sacred, solemn messages of warning to an idolatrous and impenitent world, and the Lord is not pleased with your ways; he cannot prosper you in thus misrepresenting the truth, denying the message by your own course of action. Will our people awake? Will they continue to strain every nerve to purchase things they do not positively need, which are making them a by-word before the world? The Lord has money in the hands of his stewards, which they are misappropriating, binding it up in idols of some description.",
