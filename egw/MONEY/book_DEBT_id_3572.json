    "word": "\\n     One brother said to me not long ago: \\\"You are in a heavy pressure for means. I will loan you sixty pounds for one year without interest.\\\" We were under heavy pressure in order to put up the Health Retreat, and I knew this means would help us. I felt as though it was a God-send, and I was very grateful for it. I believe the Lord stirred up our brother's mind to loan this money, and I felt very thankful. I help as long as I have any means to help with. As for laying up money, I do not do it; and I do not expect to do it.",
