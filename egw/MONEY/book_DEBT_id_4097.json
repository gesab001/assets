    "word": "\\n     The Lord is ever bestowing his blessings and mercies upon me. Should he withdraw these gifts, we should perish. Every moment he has his human family in view. \\\"He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\\\" He gives us \\\"fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.\\\" It is God who gives men power to get wealth. The quick, sharp thought, the ability to plan and execute, are from him. It is he who blesses us with health, and opens ways for us to acquire means, by diligent use of our powers. And he says to us, \\\"A portion of the money I have enabled you to gain is mine. Put it into the treasury in tithes, in gifts and offerings, that there may be meat in mine house,--that there may be something to sustain those who carry the gospel of my grace to the world. Money must be provided by my stewards to advance the different branches of my work, to build up my kingdom.\\\"",
