    "word": "This is a sermon which needs to be presented to the people. The question of health reform is not agitated as it must and will be.

The intellectual and moral energies of Christians need to be awakened. Far less money and time should be given to the table, and more to the advancement of missionary work in our land. Cooks should be thought of, and their strength saved as much as possible, for they have souls to save. The many dishes usually prepared for dessert should be dispensed with.",
