    "word": "\\n     How many in our world recognize God as the owner of the money they handle? They spend it for self-pleasing, for selfish gratification. But before the bar of God they must give an account of the way in which they have spent this money. Here they must settle for their neglect of the fatherless and the widow. What a terrible account liquor sellers will have to meet in the great day of God! In the books of heaven a record is kept of every tempting glass held out by man to his fellow-man, to forge the chains of an appetite which makes him mad. At the judgment the money and influence that might have been used to relieve suffering human beings will be charged against those who might have helped in this work, but did not. God will render to every man according to his work.",
