    "word": "\\n     My brethren and sisters, shall we not deny ourselves, in order that we may help to send the present truth to needy fields? We have very little time now in which to work. Let us deny ourselves for the building up of the cause of God. The money we invest in this work will be returned to us with large interest. Let us take hold in faith. Let us pray and believe. Let us act, and the Lord will encourage and strengthen us in the way. The Lord expects His human agencies to do their best. The fragments are to be gathered up. All needless expenditures for selfish gratification are to be cut off. Let self-denial and the cross become a part of our individual experience.",
