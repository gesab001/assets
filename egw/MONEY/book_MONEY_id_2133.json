    "word": "\"The authors are responsible to God for the use which they make of their means. There will be many calls for money. Mission fields will have to be entered, and this requires much outlay. Those to whom God has entrusted talents, are to trade upon these talents according to their ability; for they are to act their part in carrying forward these interests. When the members of the Board take it upon themselves to urge that all the profits from our denominational books shall go to the Publishing Association and the agents, and that The Authors, After Being Paid for the Time and Expense of Writing a Book, Should Relinquish Their Claim to a Share in the Profits, They are Undertaking a Work Which They can not Carry Out. These book-writers \n                                                                           47\nhave as much interest in the cause of God as do those who compose the Board of Trustees. Some of them have had a connection with the work almost from its infancy.\"",
