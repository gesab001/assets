    "word": "\\n     Those who have means are to help the work with the money the Lord has intrusted to them. And God wants men and women who are willing to give themselves entirely to him, even as Elisha did, when as he was plowing, Elijah came to him, and bade him follow him. Elisha obeyed, and we read that his first service was to pour water on the hands of the prophet. He willingly took up the work of ministering to him, and thus he became acquainted with the work in which he was afterward to have a leading part.",
