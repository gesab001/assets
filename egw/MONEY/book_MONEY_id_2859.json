    "word": "The Lord calls for workers who will deny self and follow in His footsteps. \n\n\n                                     -45- \n\nHe calls for a faithful tithe, for gifts and offerings, that there may be in His treasury means wherewith to advance His work. Our money is His, and it is to be returned to Him. Christ is the light and life and joy of His people. Because He lives, they shall live also, and when He appears it will be to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all them that believe.",
