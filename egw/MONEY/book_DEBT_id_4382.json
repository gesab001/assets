    "word": "\\n     This is a time when every church and every family should be exercised unto godliness. I feel sad as I see men and women and youth spending time and energy in self-gratification. Selfishness is occupying much time that the Lord would have devoted to religious activities. I have been shown that the money that is lavishly spent by many believers for unnecessary things should be given to the work of winning souls that are ready to perish. It is time that our people felt the need of being laborers together with God. Self-denial and self-sacrifice are highly appropriate for this time. \\\"We are laborers together with God,\\\" the Spirit through Paul declares. If unbelievers see in our works and lives devotion and self-sacrifice in order to save souls ready to perish, they will be impressed with the reality of the truths we profess. The truth that sanctifies the receiver will make its impression upon them.",
