    "word": "Children are what their training has made them. Boys who lavishly spend money from their father's pocket, who learn to smoke, to drink wine, to play cards, who do not apply themselves to any useful occupation, have no foundation to build upon, and cannot become self-reliant and independent. Money which \n\n\n                        [51] \n\ncomes to the young with but little effort on their part will not be valued. Some have to obtain money by hand work and privation, but how much safer are those youth who know just where there spending-money comes from, who know what their clothing and food cost, and what it takes to purchase a home. There are many ways in which children can earn money themselves, and can act their part in bringing thank-offerings to Jesus, who gave his own life for them. Children should be educated to make the very best use of their time, to be helpful to father and mother, to be self-reliant. They should not be allowed to consider themselves above doing any kind of labor that is necessary. They should be taught that the money which they earn is not theirs to spend as their inexperienced minds may choose, but to use judiciously, and to give to missionary purposes. They should not be satisfied to take money from their father or mother, and put it into the treasury as an offering, when it is not theirs. They should say to themselves, \"Shall I give of that which costs me nothing?\"",
