    "word": "\\n     But Christ says, \\\"Behold, I come as a thief.\\\" At the very time when the world is asking in scorn, \\\"Where is the promise of his coming?\\\" the signs are fulfilling. While they cry, \\\"Peace and safety,\\\" sudden destruction is coming. When the scorner, the rejecter of truth, has become presumptuous; when the routine of work in the various money-making lines is carried on without regard to principle; when the student is eagerly seeking knowledge of everything but his Bible, Christ comes as a thief.",
