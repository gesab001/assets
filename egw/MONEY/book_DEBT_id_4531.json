    "word": "\\n     We should have hearts overflowing with sympathy for souls for whom Christ died. We should seek to educate our children in the fear of God, teaching them that Christ died for them, and that they may have salvation without money and without price. It will only be a little while before Jesus will come to save his children and to give them the finishing touch of immortality. \\\"This corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality.\\\" The graves will be opened, and the dead will come forth victorious, crying, \\\"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\\\" Our loved ones who sleep in Jesus will come forth clothed with immortality. And as the redeemed shall ascend to Heaven, the gates of the city of God will swing back, and those who have kept the truth will enter in. A voice, richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, will be heard saying, \\\"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\\\" Then the righteous will receive their reward. Their lives will run parallel with the life of Jehovah. They will cast their crowns at the Redeemer's feet, touch the golden harps, and fill all Heaven with rich music.",
