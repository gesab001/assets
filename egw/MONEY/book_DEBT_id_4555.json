    "word": "\\n     \\\"God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\\\" The ransom money has been paid for every son and daughter of Adam, and that those who have been ransomed by the precious blood of Christ, refuse allegiance to him, will not shield them from the retribution that will come upon them in the last day. They will have to answer for their neglect to use their intrusted talents for the Master. They will have to answer for their reproaches against their Maker and Redeemer, and for their robbery of God in withholding their talents from his service, and burying their Lord's goods in the earth.",
