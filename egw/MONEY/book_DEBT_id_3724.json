    "word": "\\n     \\\"In order to save money, camp-meetings have been held over and over in the same place. They should have been held in new places, that the standard of truth might be lifted, and the message proclaimed, The Lord is coming, and the end of all things is at hand. But unconsecrated hearts and unsanctified counsel have used the means necessary to do this, in other directions, to gratify selfish ambitions. God is not pleased. There is a dearth of means, and there will be a dearth of means just as surely as those who are connected with the work of God neglect to humble their hearts before God. They must fall on the Rock, and be broken, or that Rock will fall on them, and grind them to powder.\\\" . . . .",
