    "word": "\\n     God calls for those who would be laborers together with him to yoke up with Christ. \\\"Learn of me,\\\" said the greatest Teacher the world ever knew. \\\"Take my yoke upon you,\\\" and come down to learn my meekness and my lowliness. Your intellectual pride will not aid you in the work of communicating with souls perishing for the bread of life. Your devotion to the study of these books is taking the place in mind and heart of the practical lessons you should be learning from the great Teacher. The multitude are not fed. The Holy Spirit is not dependent on the work of human agents. They want to work themselves. Very little of the money invested in piling up volumes for study and research, which is wearying to the brain, furnishes anything that will make one a successful laborer for souls.",
