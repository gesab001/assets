    "word": "\\n     The Lord instructed me that much could be accomplished by placing Self-Denial Boxes in the homes of our people. I acted upon the light given. I am glad to learn that the love of Christ has moved many hearts, and that so large a number have responded. My heart says, Thank God for the good results that have been seen. The money sent in from these Self-Denial Boxes helps in the accomplishment of the great and good work that we desire to see done.",
