    "word": "\\n     Had the money and talent so largely spent in trying to reach the lower classes been spent in taking the truth with special tact to the higher classes, many would have been added to the church of such as should be saved. God desires His servants to labor for those men and women who have fallen low. But in no case are they to neglect those who, if converted, would be a blessing, not a curse, to the world. The Lord has shown me that our work is to bring into the truth those who will be producers as well as consumers. There are men of talent and influence who are longing for something they have not yet received. Let the truth in its simplicity be presented to them. If converted, they would exert a powerful influence for the truth.",
