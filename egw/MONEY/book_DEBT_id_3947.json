    "word": "\\n     Christ assured the young man who came to him, that if he would obey his requirements he should have treasure in Heaven. This world-loving man was very sorrowful. He wanted Heaven, but he desired to retain his wealth. He renounced immortal life for the love of money and power. Oh, what a miserable exchange! Yet how many are pursuing the same course who profess to be keeping all the commandments of God. In their first experience their hearts were all aglow with love for the truth; their minds were absorbed in the study of the Scriptures; they saw new beauty in every line. Then the good seed sown in the heart was springing up, and bearing fruit to the glory of God; but after a time, the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches choke the good seed of the word of God sown in the heart; and they fail to bring forth fruit. The truth struggles for supremacy, but the cares of this life and the love of other things gain the victory. Satan seeks through the attractions of this world to enchain them, and paralyze their moral powers, that they should have no sense of God's claims upon them.",
