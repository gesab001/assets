    "word": "\\n     The possession of the Word of God places great responsibilities upon us; for it makes us accountable for the means that he entrusts to us. It is a great privilege to have money to invest in the cause of God; and that man is blessed who desires to place it where instead of ministering to selfish desires, it will help to work out the purposes of God.
