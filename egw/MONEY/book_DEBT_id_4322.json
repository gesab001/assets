    "word": "\\n     Yesterday I went for a short ride through the forest, and O, the trees--God's trees and God's forest--how beautiful they looked! The city is not the slightest temptation to me. And yet we must carry the truth to the cities. Tents are to be pitched in the most favorable places, and meetings held. Let our workers pray the Lord to open the way that they may enter the large cities of the South, and labor as men taking down trees in the forest, as men earning a large amount of money. For they are. One soul saved is worth more than the whole world. If we can but take hold upon the arm of the Lord, success will attend our efforts. Christ gave his life on Calvary's cross to make it possible for human beings to be saved; and yet we are leaving the world without the knowledge of the truth that would make them wise unto salvation. What kind of an account will many have to settle with the Lord in the future?",
