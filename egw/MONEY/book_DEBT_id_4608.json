    "word": "\\n     Christ says to us: \\\"Occupy till I come. Do all that is in your power, and much that seems beyond your power, to save perishing souls.\\\" There are many who can not give large offerings of money, because they have no money to give. But by self-denial, by denying inclination, they may save something for the Master; and this discipline will be of great value to them. They may think their gift too small to be worth anything. But as it is laid upon the altar, God will bless it, and the results from it will be surprising. To practise self-denial and self-sacrifice is a discipline necessary to the disciples of Christ.",
