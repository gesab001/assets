    "word": "\\n     My soul is stirred within me as the Macedonian cry comes from every direction, from the cities and villages of our own land, from across the Atlantic and the broad Pacific, and from the islands of the sea, \\\"Come over and help us.\\\" Brethren and sisters, will you answer the cry? saying: \\\"We will do our best, both in sending you missionaries and money. We will deny ourselves in the embellishment of our houses, in the adornment of our persons, and in appetite. We will give the means intrusted to us into the cause of God, and we will devote ourselves also unreservedly to his work.\\\" Your property, your time, your strength, your opportunities all belong to God, and for these talents you must render an account. The wants of the cause are laid before us; the empty treasuries appeal to us most pathetically for help.",
