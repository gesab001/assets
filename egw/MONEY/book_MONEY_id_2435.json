    "word": "I know that God would not have His money absorbed in Chicago as it now is. The money invested in this way, consumes much time and labor. This is pleasing to Satan; for he knows that it will close the door against the support of missionaries in their work, and then the work of the gospel \n\n\n                                    -137- \n\nministry will be held up to ridicule in comparison with the large work done in medical missionary lines. A large amount of money has been used in a way which has accomplished very little. Much has been spent on a class of people who will never be fitted to receive and impart, unless the Holy Spirit shall make them entirely new, heart, mind, and body. The work done for this class has been disproportionately large in comparison with the work that has been done in fields that are waiting and longing for the truth. How many more years will the ways of man counterwork that which God would have done?--Letter 92, 1900, p. 8. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, July 2, 1900.)",
