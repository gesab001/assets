    "word": "\\n     Many men in their eagerness to get money allow themselves to become so absorbed in business and the cares of this life that they sacrifice rest, sleep, and the comforts of life to this one object. Their naturally good constitutions are broken down, disease sets in, and death closes the scene. And yet the man who has obtained wealth at such a terrible price cannot take one dollar of it with him. Money, fine dwellings, and costly apparel avail him nothing now; his life-work is worse than useless.",
