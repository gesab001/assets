    "word": "\\n     There is very little of this work done today. If there were more of it done, there would be more order and harmony in our churches. In order to do this work, we must connect with Christ, take hold of Infinite Power, and be real Christians at home. But none should feel that they are entitled to eternal life because they have given to God their money, their education, or even themselves; for all was his before, and they have only returned to him his own. For our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might become rich. He has intrusted us with ability; he has given us all things freely; and he expects his gifts to be returned with usury.",
