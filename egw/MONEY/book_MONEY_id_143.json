    "word": "Funds to be Wisely Invested--The men in positions of trust should regard the means they handle as God's revenue, and use it in an economical manner.  When there is an abundance in the treasury, they are not to invest it in adding building to building in places already provided with memorials for God.  Hundreds of other places are in need of this money, that they, too, may have something established to represent the truth.  All parts of the Lord's vineyard are to be worked.  The power to use and disburse the Lord's money is not to be left to the judgment of any one man.--Medical Ministry, pp. 164, 165.",
