God calls for a change among his people. Agents of mercy are needed, not merely in a few places, but throughout the world. Men and women in this field should be preparing for service in distant lands. From every country is heard the cry, \\\"Come over and help us.\\\" Rich and poor are calling for light. Money and workers are needed.",
