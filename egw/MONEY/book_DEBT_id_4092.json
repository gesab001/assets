    "word": "\\n     In the teaching of Christ the use or abuse of talents is presented in a solemn light. He says he gave to \\\"every man according to his several ability.\\\" \\\"Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his Lord's money. And after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.\\\" But he who had the one talent, and had refused to do with his Lord's goods what the others had done, had no increase to present to the Master. He had only accusation to present as an excuse for his neglect of duty; he said to his Lord, \\\"I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed: and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth.\\\"",
