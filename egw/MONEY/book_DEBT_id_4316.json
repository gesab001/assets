    "word": "\\n     This sanitarium has a good patronage, and the hearts of the workers have been greatly cheered by the favors and tokens of appreciation shown them by the patients. One day one of the wealthy patients, after climbing the stairs to his room after his bath, remarked that they should have an elevator. Sister Edwards replied that when they had taken in sufficient money so they could afford it, they would put in an elevator. Very soon this gentleman gave Dr. Edwards instruction to select a good elevator, promising that he and a friend of his would purchase it, and present it to the institution. This elevator is now in daily use.",
