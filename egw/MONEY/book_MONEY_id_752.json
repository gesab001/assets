The very next night there came from South Africa a draft for two hundred pounds, . . . to help us in building the meetinghouse. Our faith had been tested, we had decided to begin the work, and now the Lord put into our hands this large gift with which to begin. With this encouragement the work began in earnest. The school board gave the land and one hundred pounds, two hundred pounds was received from the Union Conference, and the members of the church gave what they could. Friends outside of the church helped; and the builders gave a part of their time, which was as good as money. Thus the work was completed, and we have this beautiful house, capable of seating four hundred people.\" [REVIEW AND HERALD, NOV. 1, 1898.]",
