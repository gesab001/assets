    "word": "\\n     The Lord says, \\\"Return unto me, and I will return unto you.\\\" Do not, like the slothful servant, ask, Wherein shall I return? wherein have I robbed thee? God has laid out the truth plain and clear before every one who has embezzled his Lord's goods. God is in earnest with us. We make desperate efforts to accumulate money, and there may be flattering appearances of our success; but God says, I will blow upon it, I will scatter their substance as the wind scattereth the chaff.",
