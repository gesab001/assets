    "word": "\\n     I pledged myself that if I came to America, I would speak the truth in California and in Battle Creek. My husband and I were the pioneers in the work in Battle Creek, and in connection with \\n                                                                           84\\nElder Loughborough we established the work in California. In the starting of the work in Oakland, we came to the place where we must have means; and we did not know what to do. My husband was sick and feeble, and very busy. I said, \\\"Will you let me go to Battle Creek to try to raise some money for the work here.\\\" \\\"How can you go?\\\" he said. \\\"I am overwhelmed with responsibility. I can not let you go.\\\" \\\"But God will take care of you,\\\" I said. We held a meeting in an upper room of a house in Oakland, where prayer was wont to be made. We knelt down to pray, and while we were praying, the Spirit of God like a tidal wave filled the room, and it seemed that an angel was pointing across the Rocky Mountains to the churches in this part of America. Brother Tay, who is now sleeping in Jesus, rose from his knees, his face as white as death, and said, \\\"I saw an angel pointing across the Rocky Mountains.\\\" Then my husband said, \\\"Well, Ellen, I shall have to let you go.\\\" I did not wait for another word, but hurrying home, put a few gems in a basket, and hastened to the cars. I made very little preparation, for I had just time to get to the cars. Weeping like a child, my husband said, \\\"If I had not said you could go, I do not think I could say it now, but I have said it, and I will not take it back.\\\"",
