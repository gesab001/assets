    "word": "We belong to God; we are His sons and daughters, --His by creation, and His by the gift of His only-begotten Son for our redemption. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" The mind, the heart, the will, and the affections belong to God; the money that we handle is the Lord's. Every good that we receive and enjoy is the result of divine benevolence. God is the bountiful giver of all good, and He desires that there shall be an acknowledgment, on the part of the receiver, of these gifts that provide for every necessity of the body and the soul. God demands only His own. The primary portion is the Lord's, and must be used as His entrusted treasure. The heart that is divested of selfishness will awaken to a sense of God's goodness and love, and be moved to a hearty acknowledgment of His righteous requirements. --R. & H., Dec. 8, 1896.",
