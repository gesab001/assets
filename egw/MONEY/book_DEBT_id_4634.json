    "word": "\\n     The mission schools that have been established in Mississippi and in other states, are doing a good work; and these should receive our continued support. Hundreds of these schools must be established. This line of effort has been especially presented before me as one of the most effectual and economical methods of giving the truth to the colored people. But the work is almost at a stand-still for the lack of money to provide facilities and pay the wages of the teachers.",
