    "word": "\\n     But there are many who do not regard their duty to their neighbour. Look at the breweries planted all over the land, to supply to the public that which is a deadly evil. There are drinking houses all over the cities and towns, inviting the traveller to stop and water his horses at the troughs which are so convenient, and also to come in, and spend his money for a glass of intoxicating drink. The water is a blessing to the thirsty horses, but what a curse is the liquor to the man who enters and drinks! The traveller enters the public house with his reason, walking uprightly; but look at him as he leaves; the lustre is gone from his eye, his reason is paralysed, and he reels to and fro like a ship at sea.",
