    "word": "\\n     There is robbery of God among Seventh-day Adventists. For years this great evil has been increasing, till it seems as though the people had lost their connection with Jehovah. The money which should be returned to the Lord in tithes and offerings is spent for useless purposes, such as producing pictures of human faces. The many, many photographs in your houses are a dishonor to God. They bear silent witness that you have backslidden from righteousness. I look to heaven and cry, \\\"Lord, how long shall this evil divert means from thy treasury?\\\"",
