    "word": "\\n     No church should become so lifted up that its members shall feel above the poor, and the poor feel that they cannot enter freely into the house of God. A church that is too rich for the poor to feel at home in is too aristocratic for Jesus to make one in its assembly. This narrow exclusiveness that shuts man away from his brother is an abomination in the sight of God. When men are converted, they will have an abiding sense of the fact that they have been bought with a price. Whatever may be the sum of our talents, whether one, two, or five, not a farthing of our money is to be squandered upon vanity, pride or selfishness. Every dollar of our accumulation is stamped with the image and superscription of God. As long as there are hungry ones in God's world to be fed, naked ones to be clothed, souls perishing for the bread and water of salvation, every unnecessary indulgence, every overplus of capital, pleads for the poor and the naked. It is no light thing to be intrusted with riches, although men treat their position and property as though they were not accountable to any one, as though it was by their own virtue that they had these things. \\\"How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.\\\" Those who consecrate themselves to God, with their riches, becoming laborers together with him, are the only ones to whom the King of glory will give the benediction: \\\"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\\\" \\\"Well done, thou good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.\\\" \\n                                                                -\\n",
