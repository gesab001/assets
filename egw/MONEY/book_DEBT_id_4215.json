    "word": "\\n     There are many who deny themselves the comforts and blessings of life that they may add a little more to their earthly store. But it is not for this that God gives men money. He \\\"giveth us richly all things to enjoy.\\\" Christ bids us, \\\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.\\\" There are high and holy interests which call for our money, and the money invested in these will yield to the giver more elevated and permanent enjoyment than if it were expended for personal gratification, or selfishly hoarded for greed of gain. When God calls for our treasure, whatever the amount may be, the willing response makes the gift a consecrated offering to him, and lays up for the giver a treasure in heaven, where moth can not corrupt, where fire can not consume, where thieves can not break through and steal. The investment is safe. The treasure is placed in bags that have no holes; it is secure.",
