    "word": "My brother, I write these things to you, which is the word of the Lord to you. Temptations surround you. The Lord has committed to you talents to be used to His name's glory. To be entrusted with the use of money is a talent from God not to be demerited, not to be misapplied, to be an injury to the user by selfishly and unwisely appropriating these trusts to administer to selfish ends, but to be wisely employed to confer its benefits to the saving of souls for whom Christ has died.",
