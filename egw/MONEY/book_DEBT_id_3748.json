    "word": "\\n     Let those who are spending small or large sums for self-gratification ask themselves, Can I not, for Christ's sake, deny self? Are you using tea, coffee, or other harmful things? Will you not give up their use, and send the money thus saved to those who are trying to help the colored people? The good thus accomplished will be two-fold: you yourself, by giving up these harmful indulgences, will be helped mentally and physically; and by your gifts the needy colored people of the South will be helped.",
