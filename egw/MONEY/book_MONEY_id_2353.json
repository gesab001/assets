    "word": "The Christian physician has no right to follow the custom of the world, to shape his action to obtain the patronage or praise of the ungodly. He should not accept exorbitant wages for his professional services, for the reward is awaiting the faithful and true. He has no more right to minister to others requiring a large remuneration than has the minister of the gospel a right to set his labors at a high money value, but only in accordance with consistency and mercy and the value of his work. It is manifest that unless Christianity is planted in the heart, it will not control the life. The profession of faith is of no more value than the spirit and the life testify that it is of a genuine character. Cleansing the outside of the cup has never succeeded in elevating the soul, making it pure and heavenly. The truth of God is of value \n                                                                           205\nto the receiver, only as it is permitted to have a restraining influence upon his spirit and practice. There is no snare so subtle, so constant, and fraught with such peril to the professed follower of Christ, as conformity to the world. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate\" (2 Corinthians 6:17), is the call of God.",
