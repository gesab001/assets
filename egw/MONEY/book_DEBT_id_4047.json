    "word": "\\n     One brother has made a confession of discontentment because of his small wages. I wish every family in America could have some idea of the way the poor of Europe are situated. They are very destitute, and yet you hear no murmuring or complaining. I visited a family in Valence, France, where the mother was a widow. Her daughter was an intelligent woman, but as she had failed in one part of an examination, she could not obtain a teacher's certificate, and she was obliged to go from house to house sewing, for twenty cents a day. The mother tied on her little white cap, and took her basket on her arm and a crust of bread for lunch, and started for the gardens to work like a man, and receive but twenty cents a day for her labor. The son was a book-binder, diligent and sober, and he received but three dollars a week. They had only one small room to live in, and had but simple, meager food. Still there was no complaint. When this class of persons heard the truth, the tears trickled down their cheeks, and their faces lighted up with love and gratitude to God. One young man, a musician in France, who had heard and rejoiced in the truth of God, was separated from his friends because of his acceptance of the Bible faith; and although his people are wealthy, he could not obtain money to go to Basle, Switzerland, where he could receive a better knowledge of our methods of missionary work. We were soon to go to Torre Pellice, Italy, and we said, \\\"We will go third-class on the cars.\\\" This is the way in which the rough, smoking, working peasants travel; but we said, \\\"By this means we can save enough money to send this young man to Basle.\\\"",
