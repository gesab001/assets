    "word": "\\n     The professed people of God do not study the life of Christ as they should. Satan has filled their minds with interest in things of minor importance, and the eternal realities are set aside. It is this that makes so great a dearth of laborers; this is why the sowers and reapers are so few. The fields already white unto the harvest, call for workers from every walk in life. There is so much, O, so much undone that should be done for the benefit of humanity! The widows, the fatherless, the poor, the helpless, are all around us; and we can expend money in selfish thoughtlessness when so much needs to be done? Christ will give us grace to do the work next to us; he will help us to use our time with wisdom, to give our means to unselfish projects. But he declares, \\\"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\\\" The absence of the heart-felt religion, the love that purifies the soul, places the professed followers of Christ with his enemies.",
