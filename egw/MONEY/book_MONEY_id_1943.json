    "word": "I have no charge to make, no judgment of my own to give. I speak the word of the Lord. Our people are not to become entangled with the present leader of the medical work in Battle Creek, in sanitariums which are to be established or in sanitariums that have already been established. As a people, we are to make sure that the Lord's money is invested wisely. We are not to take on any additional burdens of debt unless it is made plain that we should do this.",
