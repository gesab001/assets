    "word": "\\n     We could not urge our brethren at this small camp-meeting to make large pledges to the European Mission fund; for many of them were residents of Fresno, and had pledged $30,000 toward erecting church, mission, and school buildings. However, $3,125 were pledged for the European work. One thousand dollars were pledged at the meeting in Fresno. Eighty dollars were raised by the children for the London mission, and money was provided to defray the camp-meeting expenses. We thank the Lord for the liberality of our brethren, and we hope and pray that the blessing of the Lord will rest upon those who are striving to do their duty in supporting home and foreign missions. We need, not only money for this work, but also men who will give themselves to the cause of God.",
