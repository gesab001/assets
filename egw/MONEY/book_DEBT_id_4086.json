    "word": "\\n     Christ said of his disciples. \\\"Ye are the light of the world.\\\" Those who profess his name are to come into close relationship with Jesus, and the light that shines upon them from him, is to be reflected upon the world, to the glory of God. When those who embrace the truth have no love for their fellow-men, we know that the love of Jesus is not in their hearts. Do they really believe that souls are in danger of being lost? Do they make earnest efforts to save them? Our indifference to the salvation of souls is in marked contrast to what took place in Healdsburg, one summer. A little lad who was playing upon the banks of the Russian River, fell into the water, and was drowned. It was a week before his body was found. During that time hundreds of people gathered every day on the banks of the river, and every effort was made to find the body. The people sent for a skillful diver, and spared neither labor nor money to find the body, and no one thought they were taking too much trouble. People would stand beside the river all day. They knew the child was dead, his life could not be restored; but they wanted to see the lifeless body given back to the parents. Why cannot men be as interested in seeking and in saving perishing souls for whom Christ died? We have come to a time when religious enthusiasm is almost unheard of; forms and ceremonies are abundant, but the service of the living God is not made of the highest importance. O that an interest might be awakened for the salvation of souls, for Christ has given his life a sacrifice, and should not we show a lively interest in those who sit in darkness?",
