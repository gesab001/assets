    "word": "\\n     If we only had some of the means that has been invested in buildings to make a display that will never bring honor to the cause of God, what a good work might be done! How does the Lord, looking down from heaven, regard these things? How does he look upon the perversion of his goods, when money is put to a wrong use? Will he not inquire, Why did you use my goods in this way? Brethren who believe the truth, we must have more of Jesus, and less, a great deal less, of self,--none of self, and all of Jesus. We must have a baptism of the missionary spirit. We should feel that we are a part of God's great whole, united in one common brotherhood. This will lead to a willing consecration of our property to the cause of Christ. Shall the Lord Jesus see his professed followers willing to deny self, to heed the injunction, \\\"Sell that ye have, and give alms;\\\" and to render a portion of their property for the same object for which Christ came to our world and gave his own life? \\\"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.\\\" Let no one think that he will meet the mind of Christ in hoarding up property through life, and then at death making a bequest of a portion of it to some benevolent cause. Men are expending millions of money for selfish indulgences, to gratify the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life.",
