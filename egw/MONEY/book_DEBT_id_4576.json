    "word": "\\n     Those who live the life of the world, though they may be looked upon as educated and refined, manifest that they are selfish, that the words of Christ do not abide in them. They separate themselves from the needy and distressed, and use the gifts which God has intrusted to them to bless their fellow-men in exalting and glorifying themselves. They are interested only in that which will bring them the most money. The value of the man is measured in the world by the amount of money he possesses, and so men cultivate the love of money, place the world first, and make it manifest that the words of Christ do not abide in their hearts. They do not follow in the footsteps of our Redeemer, who gave his life for the ransom of the world. They separate themselves from those who are in poverty, from those who have not been favored with advantages to obtain an education. They value men according to the amount of money they have, but Jesus places an altogether different estimate upon the human soul. He is weighing men in the golden scales of the sanctuary, and inquires, \\\"What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\\\"",
