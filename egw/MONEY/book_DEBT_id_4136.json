    "word": "\\n     In keeping the first four commandments, which reveal the duty of man to his God, the worshiper of God will find that he cannot cherish one fiber of the root of selfishness. He cannot do his duty to his God, and practice oppression toward his fellow-men. The second principle of the law is like unto the first, \\\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\\\" \\\"This do, and thou shalt live.\\\" These are the words of Jesus Christ, from which there can be no departure on the part of any man, woman, or youth who would be a true Christian. It is obedience to the principles of the commandments of God, that molds the character after the divine similitude. Those who render this obedience through the grace of Christ, possess the attributes of the Saviour's character, and are partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. The word \\\"lust\\\" here includes not only licentiousness, but covetousness, desire for position, love of money, and that which leads to false dealings and unjust practices.",
