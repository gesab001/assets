    "word": "\\n     Many in this our day claim fellowship with God while by their lives they deny the claim. They do not love God supremely and their neighbor as themselves. They are not willing to do to others as they wish them to do to them. Selfishness is shown in the use of God's money. Extravagance is seen where economy should be practised in order that the cause of God may be advanced. Man ventures to use for self-indulgence means which should be used for the Lord. This is entirely contrary to the lessons Christ has given. It is impossible to harmonize a selfish use of the Lord's money with the principles of Christ's life.",
