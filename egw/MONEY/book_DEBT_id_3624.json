    "word": "\\n     Nobility of soul, gentleness, generosity, are bartered away to gratify the lust after evil things.

Such madness concerning the changing fashions of the world should call forth an army of reformers who would take their position for simple and plain attire. Satan is ever inventing fashions that cannot be followed except through the sacrifice of money, time, and health.",
