    "word": "\\n     Before the races both the older and the younger members of families try to hoard up a stock of money to bet on some trotting horse, and with feverish anticipation they wait for the day of the races. God is put out of their thoughts, and the salvation of their souls is the last thing for which they are concerned. This is the kind of education the youth are receiving. In this wonderful manifestation of folly we see a picture of the days before the flood. These occasions of excitement do not end simply in days of feverish anticipation and in the day of fulfillment, but they lead to worse folly. The venders of wine and beer and tobacco reap a harvest from such occasions, and inebriates are seen everywhere.",
