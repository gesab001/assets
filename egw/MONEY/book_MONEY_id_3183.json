    "word": "Let forces be set at work to clear new ground, to establish new living interests wherever an opening can be found. Let men learn how to pray earnestly, short, and right to the point. Let them learn to speak of the world's Redeemer, how to lift up the man of Calvary higher and still higher. Transplant trees out of your thickly planted nursery. God is not glorified in centering such immense advantages in one place. We need wise nurserymen who will transplant trees to different localities, and give them advantages whereby they may grow. It is a positive duty to go into regions beyond. Rally workers who possess true missionary zeal, and let them go forth to diffuse light and knowledge far and near. Let them take the living principles into health \n                                                                           1416\nreform into communities that to a large degree are ignorant of what they should do. Let men and women teach these principles to classes that cannot have the advantages of the large Sanitarium at Battle Creek. It is a fact that the truth of heaven has come to the notice of thousands through the influence of the Sanitarium, yet there is a work to be done that has been neglected. Money has been expended in enlarging facilities at Battle Creek, when the Lord would have you introduce the leaven into the mass of meal that the whole may be leavened. Instead of adding building to building to the Sanitarium, you should have at this time many institutions fully equipped and in working order at other places.",
