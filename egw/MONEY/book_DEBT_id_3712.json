    "word": "\\n     Behold our cities and their need of the gospel. The need for earnest labor among the multitudes in the cities has been kept before me for more than twenty  years. Who is carrying a burden for our large cities? Some will say, We need all the money we can get to carry on the work in other places. Do you not know that unless you carry the truth to the cities, there will be a drying up of means? When you carry this message to those in the cities who are hungry for truth, and they accept the light, they will go earnestly to work to bring that light to others. Souls who have means will be brought into the truth, and will give of their means to advance the work of God.",
