    "word": "\\n     Among those present was a man who had been brought to the sanitarium in such a diseased condition that his case was thought to be hopeless. But he was carefully treated, and the crisis was safely passed. In response to my appeal for means he showed his appreciation of what has been done for him, by lending one thousand dollars for a year without interest. No collection was taken up, but some money was placed in Brother Burden's hands after the meeting.",
