    "word": "\\n     Do not, for the sake of appearance, spend time and money on self. Those who do this are obliged to leave undone many things that would have comforted others, sending a warm glow to their weary spirits. We all need to learn to improve more faithfully the opportunities that so often come to us to bring light and hope into the lives of others. How can we improve these opportunities if our thoughts are centered upon self. He who is self-centered loses countless opportunities for doing that which would have brought blessing to himself and those around him. It is the duty of the servant of Christ, under every circumstance, to ask, What can I do to help others? Having done his best, he is to leave the consequences with God.",
