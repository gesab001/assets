    "word": "\\n     In the day of judgment no one will be accepted because through clever schemes and sharp dealing he became rich. To such a one Christ will say, \\\"I gave you talents of skill, talents of worldly treasure, that you might co-operate with Me. I was willing to teach you how to impart aright. I could have made you a channel of communication. I could have helped you to reveal My attributes by imparting to others the wisdom and understanding imparted to you. You could have used My gifts to My glory and for the uplifting of those around you. But you allowed the tempter to corrupt your senses; and under his guidance you have robbed Me of the glory I should have received, had you used your talents to relieve the suffering of My children. You were a receiver, but not a producer. Had you used My money to advance My kingdom, I could now recognize you as a faithful servant. But you withheld the means you should have imparted. I gave you My goods to dispense, but you did not feed the hungry or clothe the naked. You neglected the widow and the fatherless. In their destitution they cried for help, but you heeded them not. Their cries have ascended to Me. Their tears are registered in My book. The time has now come for Me to deal with My unfaithful servants. Wherein do your riches help you now? What peace, what happiness do you find from your transactions? 'What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'\\\"",
