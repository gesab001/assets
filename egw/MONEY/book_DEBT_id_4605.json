    "word": "\\n     There are many in poverty who are being driven to ruin. If the large sums of money now devoted to erecting monuments to the dead were used to help the hungry, starving, dying millions that throng our world, God would be better pleased. Is He not a God of the living? In the judgment a strict account will be required for every misused talent. Those who now engage in horse-racing, cricket matches, gambling, are spending money for that which is not bread. Can they receive the benediction, \\\"Well done, thou good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\\\"?",
