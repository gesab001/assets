    "word": "\\n     Spiritual indolence is sin. If we allow selfishness to come in and occupy our time and absorb the mind and affections, we are unfitted for the solemn work, and the record is made, Unfaithful servants. It means much to have an eye single to the glory of God. We are to let no object interpose between our souls and God. We are in danger of worshiping earthly, temporal things, thus disqualifying ourselves for putting to the best use our God-given powers. In that case we are robbing God of time, money, and service.",
