    "word": "\\n     The question was asked by Christ, \\\"What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\\\" Man sells himself cheaply when he spends his life in securing worldly advantages; for in the ambition to secure earthly estate, God is forgotten, and he reaps loss to all eternity. His money and lands can not pay a ransom for his soul. Better, far better, to have shattered hopes and the world's denunciation with the approval of God, than to sit with princes and forfeit heaven. \\\"Ye can not serve God and mammon,\\\" Christ declares.",
