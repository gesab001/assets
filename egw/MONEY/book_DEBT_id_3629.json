Albums, filled with photographs of the family and the photographs of their friends, are placed where they will attract the attention of visitors. Thus the thoughts, which should be upon God and heavenly interests are brought down to common things. Is not this a species of idolatry?

Should it not have been placed in the Lord's treasury to advance His cause and build up His kingdom in the earth?",
