    "word": "\\n     God's rule of giving, as expressed in His word, excludes no one, and it presses heavily on no one. It touches the poor man but lightly, and is not really felt by the rich. But many professed followers of Christ will not give in proportion to their means because to do so would require the sale of some of their property; therefore they rob the treasury of God, and lose the blessing He has promised to the liberal. Some even allow the love of money to become the ruling passion of their lives. They are as much intoxicated with riches as is the inebriate with his cups. In their case how appropriate are the words of Christ: \\\"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\\\"",
