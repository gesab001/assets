    "word": "\\n     However large the income of the possessions of any person, any family, or any institution, let all remember that they are only stewards, holding in trust the Lord's money. All profit, all pay, our time, our talents, our opportunities, are to be accounted for to Him who gives them all. The Lord is constantly proving us, to see if our work is free from selfishness and pride. Those workers will have the richest reward who prove that they love God supremely and their neighbors as themselves.",
