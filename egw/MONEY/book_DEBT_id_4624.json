    "word": "\\n     The man who received the one talent \\\"went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.\\\" Just what he did, many today are doing. But let them not think that when Christ comes to reckon with His servants, He will be satisfied with the return of that only which was given. He will call for His own \\\"with usury.\\\" The Lord expects every one to increase His gifts. Every provision has been made for us to do this. He who does not improve his talents is regarded by the Lord as a slothful, untrustworthy servant, unworthy of admittance into the heavenly courts.",
