    "word": "\\n     Let those who have money help the work in England with their means. The work there has had very little help in this line. God forgive and pardon us for not making plants all over Europe and in the great city of London and its suburbs. God grant that men and women will go there who are willing to sacrifice for him, who in their homes will exert an influence that will tell in favor of the truth, who will hold Bible readings with their neighbors, bringing the third angel's message to their personal attention. We can not hide ourselves away from the multitude and expect them to hunt us up. God wants us to make ourselves known. The third angel's message is to go with a loud cry.",
