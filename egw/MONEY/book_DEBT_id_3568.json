I felt that if this donation came to our people in this way, it would deprive them of a blessing, according to the eighth and ninth chapters of 2 Corinthians, so that rich supplies of grace might flow in upon God's people, because of their self-denial and self-sacrifice. Christ says: \\\"He that will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\\\" You have read your Bibles, and you know of the cross the Saviour bore when He laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown and clothed His divinity with humanity. He did not come to take his position among the wealthy, where He could have all the luxuries and conveniences of life. For our sakes He became poor, that we, through His poverty, might become rich. He is our example. We can deny ourselves, and we can do a great deal more of this than we have any idea of.",
