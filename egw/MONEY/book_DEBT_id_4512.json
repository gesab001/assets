    "word": "\\n     \\\"Every week letters come to this place from France, Italy, Russia, and India, stating that souls are embracing the truth from reading our French paper. Today one has been received with five names signed of persons who are much interested in the truth from reading Les Signes, and who send the pay for a year's subscription. Another comes from a man in France, thanking Brother Whitney for the papers sent him. He says he has no money to pay for the paper, and asks if Brother Whitney will take a blank book (a register) in exchange for it. His father and mother have been opposed to his reading Les Signes, but now they are reading it themselves. Brother Whitney has most precious letters from India and Russia also, commending Les Signes, and telling the good it has accomplished. These testimonies are cheering to our hearts.",
