    "word": "\\n     Those who neglect to search the Scriptures, choosing rather to read books of skeptical writers, or of writers who are frivolous or worldly, will be tempted to neglect prayer, to withdraw from religious meetings, to invest money in cheap literature, and will so educate themselves that all taste for the sacred oracles will be erased from the mind. Thus will they be led to refuse to hear, to refuse to incline the heart to seek God while he may be found, to call upon him while he is near, while he is still sending messages of reproof, warning, and entreaty. They say to all the tender entreaties of God's Spirit, \\\"Not now; I will go into another city, and buy and sell and get gain; and after that I will begin a new life.\\\" O do not be deceived by this suggestion of the enemy to wait, and that after a time you will repent. The longer you put it off, the less will be your inclination to turn to God, and obey the invitations of mercy. The most discouraging development in your case is the very fact that you say, \\\"Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.\\\" This is an evidence that conscience has become aroused, and then put to sleep again with an opiate. But think of this;--conscience may never wake again! While God grants you life, while you are sure of probation, embrace your day of opportunity and privilege.",
