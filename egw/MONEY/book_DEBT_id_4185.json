    "word": "\\n     The Lord has endowed man with capabilities and power and influence; he has entrusted him with his money; but these gifts are not to be lavishly spent in self-gratification. To every man he has given his work. Man is to be a co-worker with God in the great redemption. The money that God has entrusted to men is to be used in blessing humanity, in relieving the necessities of the suffering and the needy. Men are not to feel that they have done a very wonderful thing when they have endowed certain institutions or churches with large gifts. In the wise providence of God, there are constantly presented before them the very ones who need their help. They are to relieve the suffering, clothe the naked, and help many who are in hard and trying circumstances, who are wrestling with all their energies to keep themselves and their families from a pauper's home. God never meant that this misery should exist. He never meant that one man should have an abundance of the luxuries of life, while the children of others should cry for bread. The means over and above the positive necessaries of life are entrusted to men to do good, to bless humanity. God has entrusted his goods to stewards; and if these stewards love him, they will love those formed in his image.",
