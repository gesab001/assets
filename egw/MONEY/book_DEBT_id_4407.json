    "word": "\\n     Christ wept at the sight of woe.  Let his tenderness come into your hearts.  Practise self-denial that you may have wherewith to relieve the suffering of God's children.  Let the same mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.  He is the author of your faith, and he will be the finisher if you will be partakers of his self-sacrifice.  Many of you enjoy a portion of this world's goods.  When spending your money, think of what Jesus would do were he in your place. He calls upon his followers to tread in his footsteps of self-denial and self-sacrifice. The character of the Christian is to be a reproduction of the character of Christ. The same love, the same grace, the same unselfish benevolence, seen in his life, is to characterize the lives of his followers. God will bless all who are willing to give and to labor for the salvation of the world as did his beloved Son.",
