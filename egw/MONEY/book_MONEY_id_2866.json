    "word": "In the same suburb, Wallsend, there is a stone church which has been closed. This place will seat about 250 people. The church has been misused; mischievous boys have felt at liberty to break up the flooring and the windows and pull down the pulpit. It will take about one hundred pounds to repair it and put in the seats. Then it will be a valuable little church. If we had the money we would purchase and repair it at once, but we dare not invest.",
