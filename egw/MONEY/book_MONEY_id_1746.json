    "word": "Selfishness is at the root of all unfairness and all lack of fidelity. . . . There is with many of the youth who profess to believe the truth a vanity, pride, profligacy, and carelessness that are making them reckless and disqualifying them for a noble and elevated life here, and unfitting them for the future life hereafter. . . . There is not with all a careful improvement of the time for which they are paid. Those who fritter away their time or fail to put it to the best use are robbing God. Some . . . have a very favorable opinion of those who are careless, reckless of money and reckless of time, but God regards all these things in their true character--frauds which He will avenge.",
