    "word": "\\n     Coffee is a hurtful indulgence. It temporarily excites the mind to unwonted action, and the effect is prostration, sadness, exhaustion of the mental, moral, and physical forces. The mind becomes enervated, and unless through determined effort the habit is overcome, the activity of the brain is greatly lessened. All these nerve irritants are wearing away the life forces, and the restlessness caused by shattered nerves, the impatience, the mental feebleness, becomes a warning element against spiritual progress. Then shall not those who advocate temperance and reform be awake in regard to these injurious things? And shall not this pledge paper embrace coffee and tea, as hurtful stimulants? In some cases it is as difficult to break up this tea and coffee habit as it is for the inebriate to discontinue the use of liquor. The money used for tea or coffee as a common drink is worse than wasted. It does the user, be it man or woman, harm and that continually. Shall Christians bring under the control of reason this appetite, or will they continue its practice because they feel so let down without it, like the drunkard without his stimulant?",
