    "word": "\\n     No one can safely remain in a neutral position. \\\"Ye are not your own,\\\" \\\"ye are bought with a price.\\\" You belong to God. Jesus has paid the purchase money for your redemption, and he requires of you whole-hearted service. He has a right to your service, even to the full extent of your capabilities, for his own honor and glory. There is a cross lying directly in your pathway, and you must lift it if you would follow Jesus and be indeed his disciples. Pride must be up-rooted, self must die, every wrong must be made right. Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, through his boundless mercy and love, manifested in the sacrifice of his own precious life! O! let no one plead for self-indulgence.",
