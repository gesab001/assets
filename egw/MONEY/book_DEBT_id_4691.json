    "word": "\\n     Those who love Christ will love those for whom he has died. They will interest themselves not alone in the most promising human subjects, but in the most needy, the most commonplace and unattractive. By faith they will see that if these can be won to love Christ, they will be workers for others, they will echo the words of Christ, and point to him who said, \\\"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him should receive; for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)\\\" They will repeat the invitation, \\\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? harken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.\\\"",
