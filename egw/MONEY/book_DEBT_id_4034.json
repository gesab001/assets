    "word": "\\n     The church of Christ is the repository in which heaven's wealth is stored, to be imparted to others, in the providence of God, as the extension of his work and the upbuilding of his cause shall demand. The rich dowry of grace, the intrusted capital of money, and the possessions in houses and lands, he has intrusted to his stewards upon the earth; and nothing can be more offensive to God, who is constantly bestowing his gifts upon man, than to see him selfishly grasping these gifts, and not rendering back to God either interest or principal. God designs that his stewards shall work as Christ worked, exerting all their influence to win souls to him, denying self as he denied himself, and practicing strict economy, in order to have means to use in Christ's cause. I have seen that we do not answer the claims of God upon us as we should. We might invest larger treasures in the bank of heaven, to be employed in missionary work. Said Christ, \\\"Ye are the light of the world.\\\" God is constantly clothing us with temporal and spiritual blessings as with a garment. Jesus is today in heaven, preparing mansions for those who love him; yea, more than mansions, a kingdom, which is to be ours. But all who shall inherit these blessings must be partakers of the self-denial and self-sacrifice of Christ in the salvation of souls.",
