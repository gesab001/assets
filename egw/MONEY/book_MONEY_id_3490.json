    "word": "The work in Nashville demands our first attention. I was a little surprised at first to know that five hundred dollars from the funds of the Southern Union Conference had been apportioned to the work in Graysville, while there was such need of means in Nashville. But the light given me was that this was the right thing to do. Brother Kilgore has helped the work in mission fields. He has not been wanting in liberality; and now, if means has been sent to Graysville to help the work there in an emergency, let no one question the matter. All the workers should be filled with a noble spirit of helpfulness and of willingness to use the Lord's money where it is needed most. Graysville needed the money at the time that the five hundred dollars was sent there; and when the work there is firmly established, and the time comes for a school and sanitarium to be built at a little distance from Nashville, the workers can with confidence call for help from Graysville.",
