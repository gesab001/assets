The builders were full of earnestness and determination to complete the work, putting into it their very best efforts. But the second time I came to look at the building, it was not half completed, yet the builders had gone to other work. I said, \\\"What does this mean?\\\" The answer was, \\\"We began to build, but were not able to finish. We had no money with which to purchase material, and had to stop building.\\\" Again an illustration was presented before me. There were elaborate buildings, abundant facilities, and many plans for new improvements. I asked, \\\"Who owns these buildings?\\\" The answer was, \\\"They are supposed to be the Lord's property.\\\" \\\"Well, who owns that building not half yet completed?\\\" \\\"O, that, too, is the Lord's building; but the workers could not complete it; for they had nothing to build with.\\\" This represents the comparative situation of the work here and in America,--the great lack in one place and the superabundance in the other.",
