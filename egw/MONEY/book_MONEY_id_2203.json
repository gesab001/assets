    "word": "Conformity to the world can be prevented by the truth, by feeding on the word of God, by its \n\n\n                      -4- \n\nprinciples circulating through the entire life current, and working out that word in the character. Christ exhorts us by the apostle John to \"love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\" This is plain language, but it is God's measure of every man's character. \"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\" \"They that will be rich [those who are resolved by every possible way to obtain money and enjoy it in the world] fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some covet after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\" How true this is! It can be traced in the experience of every church.",
