    "word": "\\n\\nNovember 28, 1882 Love of the World.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     In his sermon on the mount, our Saviour admonished his followers, \\\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven.\\\" Notice, that those who lay up treasure in Heaven do it for themselves; they are thereby advancing their own interests. Those who lay up treasure upon earth will center their interest and affection here. They cultivate a love for money, for houses and lands, until it absorbs the powers of mind and body; their love for worldly possessions is greater than their love for souls for whom Christ died. The god of this world blinds their eyes, so that eternal things are not valued.",
