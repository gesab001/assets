    "word": "\\n     But how many who have been intrusted with talents of means and influence have lost sight of the pattern, and followed the standard of the world, instead of the example of Christ. Men and women who have been blessed with an abundance of money, with houses and with lands, generally train their children to a life of idleness and selfish indulgence. Thus they are made useless for this life, and unfit for the future, immortal life. Christ in his life gave men an altogether different example. In his youth he worked with his father at the carpenter's trade; but the youth of today are educated to believe that it is the money that makes the man. The sure result of such education is seen in the pride, the vanity, the love of pleasure, the sinful practices, that are so prevalent in this degenerate age. Where there is an abundance of idleness, Satan works with his temptations to spoil life and character. If youth are not trained to useful labor, whether they be rich or poor, they are in peril; for Satan will find them employment after his own order. The youth who are not barricaded with principle, do not regard time as a precious treasure, a trust from God for which every human being must give an account. Money is also a trust from God, and is not given to parents to use in an extravagant way to gratify pride, to the ruin of themselves and their children, but that they may be the means of doing good to their fellowmen.",
