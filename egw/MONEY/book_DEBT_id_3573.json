    "word": "\\n     This work will take money. Then let none of us go into any extravagance, for we cannot afford it. We must bind about our wants, because the Master tells us to. We must be laborers together with Him who left the royal courts, and for our sakes became poor that we through His poverty might be made rich. He says to us, \\\"Follow Me.\\\" I have been instructed that we need to wake up and cut off every needless expense. Come right down to self-denial and self-sacrifice, that the work of God may be advanced, and places entered where people know nothing about the truth. The souls of those in darkness are just as precious as our souls, and they are to be won to God.",
