    "word": "\\n     Professed Christians, Jesus is speaking to you: \\\"Why stand ye here all the day idle? Go work in my vineyard.\\\" Work while it is called day, for the night cometh, when no man can work. We are never to set a limit to our efforts in his service, saying, \\\"This will I do, and no more.\\\" It is enough for us to know that we are Christ's servants. The ransom money has been paid for our souls, and every jot of power or ability we have is the gift of God, not inherent in ourselves, and hence not to be employed to please or glorify self.",
