    "word": "\\n     With the follower of Christ the love of money will not be all-absorbing. For Christ's sake he will labor for it, deny self, cut off every needless expenditure, that the means which come into his possession may be used in the great work of saving souls who are without Christ and without hope in the world. Thus he will cooperate with the world's Redeemer, who for our sake became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich. The Commander of the angelic host laid aside His royal robes and crown of honor. He left the royal courts of heaven, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that humanity might touch humanity, and that divinity might lay hold of the power of God in behalf of the fallen race. The love of ease and pleasure and self-exaltation did not characterize the life of Christ. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed. All who make an unreserved surrender of themselves to God will share in the self-denial of Christ, and will have fellowship with Him in His sufferings.",
