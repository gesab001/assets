    "word": "With the follower of Christ the love of money is not all absorbing. For Christ's sake he will labor for it, deny self for it, cut off every superfluous want, bind about every needless expenditure, that the means which come into his possession may be used in the great work of saving souls who are without Christ and without hope in the world. Thus he cooperates with the world's Redeemer, who for our sakes became poor that we through His poverty might be made rich.",
