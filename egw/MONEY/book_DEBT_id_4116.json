    "word": "\\n     The plain testimony must be borne upon the necessity of self-denial. Through extravagant, selfish indulgence, the Lord's money is embezzled to gratify unsanctified imaginations, and this needless expenditure binds about the work of God. Messengers cannot be sent into missionary fields without money. The expenditure of their traveling expenses, the outlay for food and simple clothing, for shelter and life's necessities, must be met. Satan is continually suggesting ways whereby men can invest their means to get honor and glory to themselves. They build when the Lord does not say build. They will bind up thousands of dollars when the Lord has warned them not to do this, and the result is that missionary interests must suffer. Mere ambitious enterprises swallow up money that the Lord designed should be invested to set in operation the work in new fields, to aid the missionaries already started, that need encouragement and advancement, that the work should not be lost. Those who have the cause of God at heart, will suffer some inconveniences that the work may go forward. If every institution is to be made all that it might become, and we work to that end exclusively, we shall rob some other field, where missionaries for lack of help are not able to find a standing-place, to exert the influence the Lord would have them exert. We need to think more deeply, and to keep the glory of God constantly in view, and not mingle self in the superintending of the Lord's instrumentalities, thus bringing upon the cause of God a burden that it ought not to carry.",
