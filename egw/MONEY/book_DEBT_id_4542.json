    "word": "\\n     By indulgence in little extravagances men become careless in the use of money and form spendthrift habits, while self-denial in little things leads to self-denial in greater things. If moments are carefully treasured and put to a wise use, hours will not be wasted. If small opportunities are improved, greater opportunities will not be neglected. If limited talents are employed, larger usefulness will come; and by patient continuance in well doing, you will gain power to do well and patiently. Our work may not be noticed by men, and no credit may be given to the faithful soul; but God marks the diligent servant, and gives wisdom to do a larger work. It is faithfulness in little things that makes a man great in the sight of God.",
