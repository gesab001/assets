    "word": "\\n     It is the duty of every church to feel an interest in its own poor. God has left a work to do in caring for his poor, in comforting the desponding, in visiting the sick, and dispensing to the needy. None whose names are on the church books should be left to suffer year after year from sickness, when a few months at the sanitarium would give them relief and a valuable experience to take care of themselves and others when sick. When a worthy child of God needs the benefit of the sanitarium, and can pay but a small amount toward his expenses, let the church act a noble part and make up the sum. Some may not be able to pay anything themselves, but do not let them continue to suffer. Send them to the sanitarium, and send your pledges and money with them to pay their expenses. In doing this you gain a precious blessing. It costs something to run such an institution, and it should not be required to treat the sick for nothing.",
