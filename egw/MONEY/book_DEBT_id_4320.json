    "word": "\\n     Never was there a more important time in the history of our work than at present. The message in the third chapter of Malachi comes to us, holding up before us the need of honesty in our relations to the Lord and his work. My brethren, the money that you use to buy and sell and get gain will be a curse to you if you withhold from the Lord that which is his. The means entrusted to you by the Lord for the advancement of his work should be used in sending the gospel to all parts of our world.",
