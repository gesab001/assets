    "word": "\"Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come now.\" Taunts such as these have always been made, and will continue to be made. Those who make this are inspired by the same spirit that led the priests to taunt Christ as he hung upon the cross, saying, \"He saved others, himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God.\" There hung the world's Redeemer in his dying agony, put to open shame by his own people. What power was working on the minds of these teachers and leaders?- The same power that today is stirring the whole world with intense hatred against those who refuse to confederate with evil, but who reprove, rebuke, and exhort the wrong-doer, even to his face. The very same power has been working upon you, A.R. Henry, leading you to betray Christ as verily as it led Judas to sell him for money. You are selling your Lord, and betraying his cause to his enemies irrespective of consequences; and thus reproach is brought upon the truth. By so \n                                                                           1666\ndoing you demonstrate the truth of the warnings and admonitions that have been given you. You have just that measure of love and interest in the cause of God that you have revealed by your attitude toward it. Connected with others, you have made every effort to bring things under your control, and failing to do this, you would ruin the cause you professed to serve. Thus you show that you are doing the very work that the Lord revealed to me you would do.",
