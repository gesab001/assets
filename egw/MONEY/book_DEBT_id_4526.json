    "word": "\\n     The attractions of this world must be eclipsed by the glory of the world to come, and our powers severed from its interests, and devoted to the interests of Heaven. Let us contemplate the eternal consequences of rightly employing our talents of influence and money for the purpose of saving souls. We shall store up treasures in Heaven, and receive the commendation of God, and enter into the joy of our Lord, who shall \\\"see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.\\\" But how few realize this and use their talents for God with the same energy and perseverance that they have manifested in the service of the world!",
