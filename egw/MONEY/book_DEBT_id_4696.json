    "word": "\\n     The world's policy is to acquire money and advantages in any way that they can be obtained. An accumulation of this world's treasure is the ambition of worldlings. But the object of the followers of our Lord Jesus Christ is to become Christlike by self-denial and self-sacrifice. They keep their eyes on the eternal riches, which they can obtain by renouncing earthly treasure. They heed the words, \\\"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\\\" They keep Christ in view, following where he leads.",
