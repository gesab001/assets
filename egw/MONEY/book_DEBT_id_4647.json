They are opening the door to a thousand evils. Many, absorbed in their interest in worldly treasures, become insensible to the claims of God and the needs of their fellow men. They regard their wealth as a means of glorifying self. They add house to house, and land to land; they fill their homes with luxury, while all about them are human beings in misery and crime, in disease and death.",
