    "word": "\\n     How is the Lord the portion of His people? He can be such to them only when they choose Him above everything earthly and temporal. But there are very many who prefer every other portion rather than the heavenly treasure. This is not appreciated. They prize more highly the selfish pleasures that minister only to the gratification of self. They consider the possession of lands, of houses, and of money, the most desirable prize they can gain: for they know that when once these are in their hands, they will receive the esteem and favor of the world. The standard of the world estimates a man according to his money value. This certainly can raise him to position and honor as far as the world is concerned, but it can never give him true value of character.",
