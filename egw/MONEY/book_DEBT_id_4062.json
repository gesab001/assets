    "word": "\\n     No man can have Christ abiding in his heart, and at the same time separate his influence and his intrusted capital of means from the cause and work of Christ. Those who are Christ's at heart, will make most earnest efforts to send the light of truth into all the highways and by-ways of life. The lover of money, through the greater love he has for Jesus, overcomes his covetousness, and by his gifts and offerings declares, \\\"Of thine own we freely give thee;\\\" the indolent man, through his love for Christ, becomes an active working agent with Christ; \\\"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\\\" The lovers of pleasure, who have lived for their own gratification, will, through the sanctifying power of the truth, repent of their wrong influence, and will live in harmony with the truth they profess.",
