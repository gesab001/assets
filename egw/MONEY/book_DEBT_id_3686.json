    "word": "\\n     My dear brethren and sisters, do not spend in selfishness one dollar of the Lord's money. You have no money but his. All you have is the Lord's. You have been bought with a price, therefore you are bound to enter the service of your Redeemer. You must give an account to God of all that you have. At the last great day, God will ask, \\\"What did you do with the money I intrusted to you.\\\"",
