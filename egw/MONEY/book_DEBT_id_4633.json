    "word": "\\n     It is Satan's studied plan to keep God out of men's thoughts, and in carrying out this plan, he has great success. He is constantly bringing forward plans that keep their minds absorbed in pleasure and money-making. The minds of the great majority of men are so taken up with the things of time, with worldly interests, that the things of eternity find no place in their lives. Irrespective of the warnings in the Word of God, they show a most surprising indifference to the laws of His kingdom.",
