    "word": "\\n     Such men as this should be employed in our work in America. They should be men who are devoted to God, men who know what the principles of heaven are, men who have learned what it means to walk with God. If such men as this had superintended the financial business of our Conferences, there would today be plenty of money in the treasury. A few men in our institutions would not have grasped all they could in wages. Our institutions would now stand as God declared they should stand, helping the work by self-denial and self-sacrifice.",
