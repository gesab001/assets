    "word": "\\n     When this man, whose great debt had been forgiven, met another, inferior to him in position and office, who owed him but a small sum, he was filled with anger, and with threats and violence claimed the money due him. Then when the poor debtor fell at his feet and used the very same prayer which he himself had uttered before his lord, he was merciless. He accused the man of not meaning to pay him, and disregarded his prayers and tears. He who had been forgiven so much would himself forgive nothing. He claimed his rights, and taking advantage of the law, afflicted the distressed debtor by casting him into prison.",
