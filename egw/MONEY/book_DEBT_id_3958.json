    "word": "\\n     The poorer class of people were obliged to borrow money to pay their tribute to the king; and the wealthy, who loaned this money, exacted high rates of interest. They took mortgages on the lands of the poor, and finally added them to their own large possessions. Thus some became very wealthy, while others were in deep poverty. But the rich felt no compassion for their poorer brethren, not even when they were obliged to sell their sons and daughters into bondage, with no hope of being able to redeem them. Nothing but accumulating distress, perpetual want and bondage, seemed to be before them. There appeared to be no prospect of redress, no hope of redeeming children or lands. Yet these men were of the same nation and faith as their more wealthy and prosperous brethren; they too belonged to the chosen people of God.",
