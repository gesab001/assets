    "word": "\\n     The desire to obtain money is a snare of Satan, and one that is most popular in these last days. The selfishness which the desire for gain begets, removes the favour of God from the church, and deadens spirituality. To live for self is to perish. Covetousness, the desire for benefit for self's sake, cuts the soul off from life. It is the spirit of Satan to get, to draw to self. It is the spirit of Christ to give, to sacrifice self for the good of others. Wherefore He says \\\"Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.\\\"",
