    "word": "\\n     It was the custom in Judea for men to wait at the market-places for some one to come and employ them; and in Europe this custom is still in vogue. Those who need help go to the market-place to find servants that they may employ. The man in the parable is represented as going out at different hours to engage workmen. Those he hired at the earliest hour, agreed to work for him for a stated sum of money, while those who were hired later left the wages they were to receive wholly to the discretion of the householder.",
