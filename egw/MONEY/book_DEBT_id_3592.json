    "word": "\\n     The principles of Christ's love demand action. When this appeal shall come to you, let no one show his lack of faith by objecting to send the money raised to the place where it is most needed. Let no one raise an unbelieving hand to say that money shall not be sent to the Sydney Sanitarium. Do not conspire to quench the spark of benevolence; rather unite to fan it to a strong, steady flame.",
