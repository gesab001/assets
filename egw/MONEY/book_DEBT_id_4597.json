    "word": "\\n     Salvation is a free gift, and yet it is to be bought and sold. In the market of which Divine Mercy has the management, the precious pearl is represented as being bought without money and without price. In this market all may obtain the goods of heaven, which are lent on trust. The treasury of the jewels of truth is opened to all. \\\"Behold, I have set before thee an open door,\\\" the Lord declares, \\\"and no man can shut it.\\\" No sword guards the way through this door. Voices from within and at the  door say, Come. The Saviour's voice earnestly and lovingly invites us: \\\"I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed; and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see.\\\"",
