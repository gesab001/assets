    "word": "MR No. 552 - Letter to M. B. Czechowski\n\n     In the vision given me at Roosevelt I was shown something in regard to your case. I saw that your moving to New York was wrong. There were those in N. York ready to counsel you, who had not the least foresight or judgment, and who were not capable of taking care of themselves. And again it was very expensive for you to live in a city where the money must be paid for everything necessary to support a family. Your own lack of judgment, with poor calculation and miserable counselors to help you, consumed much means, which would have made your family comfortable and saved you from much suffering and privation.",
