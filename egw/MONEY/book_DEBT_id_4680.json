    "word": "\\n     The same lesson of unfaithfulness is presented in the parable of the talents, where the servant to whom was entrusted the one talent went and dug in the earth, and hid his Lord's money. When his Lord returned, and inquired for his own with usury, this man made charges against God, just as many are doing today,--making charges against those who are bearing burdens and carrying responsibility in the cause of God. It was the unprofitable servant who made charges against his Lord. He said, \\\"Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed: and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. His Lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed: thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\\\"",
