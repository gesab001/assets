    "word": "\\n \\n                              An Appeal to the Aged. \\n     We wish that all who are becoming old and feeble would make a wise disposition of their means, giving freely back to God that which is His own. Some need the interest on their money to support them while they live. These can lend their money at reasonable interest to our publishing or medical institutions, and make arrangements that it shall be used in missionary work after their death. Wise and faithful men should be chosen as their stewards, and clear and thorough work done to ensure the use of their means in the very way that they wish. Then they will know that their treasure is to be used to warn the world of its coming doom. We have no time to delay.",
