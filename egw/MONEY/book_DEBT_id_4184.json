    "word": "\\n     The whole universe is under the control of the Prince of life. Fallen man is subject to him. He paid the ransom money for the whole world. All may be saved through him. He calls upon us to obey, believe, receive, and live. He would gather together a church embracing the whole human family, if all would leave the black banner of rebellion, and place themselves under his banner. Those who believe on him, he will present to God as loyal subjects. He is our Mediator as well as our Redeemer. He will defend his chosen followers against Satan's power, and subdue all their enemies. Through him, they will be conquerors, and more than conquerors. Writing to the Ephesians, Paul says: \\\"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward, who believe according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.\\\"",
