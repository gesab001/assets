    "word": "When we learned that we were not going to be able to secure the Sonoma property, an assurance was given to me that a better place was provided for us, where we could have many advantages over our first selection. As I have looked over this property, I pronounce it to be superior in many respects. The school could not be located in a better spot. It is eight miles from St. Helena, and is free from city temptations. The entire cost is sixty thousand dollars \n                                                                           341\n($60,000.00). $40,000.00 of this money has been raised, and we hope the balance will soon be forthcoming. Our people see that this property is much better than we hoped to be favored with. It is situated only six miles from the Sanitarium where Dr. Rand is head physician. The leading workers of these two institutions can cooperate in their work to carry forward the work of sanitarium and school solidly.",
