    "word": "\\n     Trials are also God's appointed means to separate the chaff from the wheat. Satan never sleeps. He is watching to lead souls away from Christ. He suggests worldly principles. The \\\"good seed\\\" is choked in many hearts, because it is overgrown with unnecessary cares and needless anxiety--with love for the worldly pleasures and honors that riches give. Meetings are neglected; the heart is not strengthened by these religious privileges, because time and energy are absorbed in money-getting. In other cases there is no depth and stability of character. Principle does not reach down deep, underlying the springs of action. When such persons are tested and proved by the heat of trial and temptation, when the pruning-knife of God is applied, that they may bring forth fruit unto perfection, their zeal dies, their piety withers.",
