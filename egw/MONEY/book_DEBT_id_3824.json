    "word": "\\n     Often it is in this way that our institutions are tempted to needless outlay in the erection of large and expensive buildings. Through lack of a definite knowledge of the real financial condition at home and of the necessities of the work in other fields, money has been selfishly invested where it was least needed. Some parts of the field have been supplied with facilities that were wholly uncalled for, while in other parts the workers have lacked that which was absolutely essential to success. Buildings and other facilities for the use of schools, sanitariums, and churches could not be supplied when they were sadly needed. Thus the efforts of the workers have been crippled, and the message of truth in its onward course has been retarded.",
