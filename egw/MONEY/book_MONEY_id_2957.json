    "word": "What a terrible action was this, both on the part of Judas and of the priests. The rulers of Israel had been given the privilege of receiving Christ as their Saviour without money and without price. But they refused the precious gift offered them in the most tender spirit of constraining love; they refused to accept that salvation of more value than gold and silver, and bought their Lord for thirty pieces of silver. Judas was to find an opportunity of betraying Him in the absence of the multitude, for the priests knew that the people were Christ's friends. Had it not been for this, they would, they thought, have accomplished their purpose long before.",
