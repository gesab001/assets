    "word": "\\n     But while some trade upon the talents that God has given them, others seem to think that they are placed in the world to please themselves, and they are dissatisfied when others do not help them to get all possible selfish enjoyment out of the world. They spend their money, they spend their precious time, they employ their influence, in teaching, by precept and example, that the chief end of life is selfish amusement. They do not grow in grace or in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. They make no advancement. They have but limited knowledge, and are dwarfed in the Christian life; when if they had used their influence and employed the talents entrusted them of God for wise improvement, they would have increased in power and usefulness. The apostle adds: \\\"What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\\\" All praise and glory are to be rendered to God; and we are so to employ every entrusted capability that praise may be ascribed to God. \\n                                                            Mrs. E.
