    "word": "\\n     Our greatest burden should be, not the raising of money, but the salvation of souls; and to this end we should do all in our power to teach students how to lead souls to a knowledge of the third angel's message.

When we labor diligently for the salvation of our fellow men, God will prosper our every effort.",
