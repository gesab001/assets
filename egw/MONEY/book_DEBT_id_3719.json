    "word": "\\n     \\\"I do not urge any one to change their location to please their own ideas, for Christ lived in our world, all seared and marred with the curse, that humanity might touch humanity, to save souls from eternal ruin. Jesus did not leave the royal throne, the royal crown, and his high command, and come to our world to please himself. \\\"For our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich.\\\" What is the character of these riches? Is it houses and lands and bank stock in this world? Or is it that the unsearchable riches of Christ may be presented before their minds, that they shall attract them, their hearts, that they shall accept them, and shall count all things but loss and dross that they may win Christ? We join the Lord's army, fight the battles with the power of darkness, set up the standard of the cross of Calvary in every place where we can possibly find access. My heart is pained when I think how little our churches sense their solemn accountabilities to God. It is not ministers alone, but every man and woman who have enlisted in Christ's army, are soldiers; and are they willing to receive a soldier's fare, just as Christ has given them an example in his life of self-denial and sacrifice? What self-denial have our churches as a whole manifested? They may have given donations in money, but have withheld themselves.",
