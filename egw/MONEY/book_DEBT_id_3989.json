    "word": "\\n     We have tried to set before the workers here the necessity of strict economy. We are sorry that all our missionary workers at home and abroad do not realize the value of money. When the lesson of frugality is not learned early in life, it is difficult to weave into one's experience the self-denying, self-sacrificing part of religion. What is needed now is not preachers merely, but laborers, those who will give themselves heartily to the work of the Master; those who will visit from the house to house, and bring the truth home to the hearts of the people. Here is a vast field which our sisters can enter. If devoted to God, women can do fully as much good by opening the Scriptures in families as the ministers can.",
