    "word": "I wish I could impress on every mind the grievous sinfulness of wasting the Lord's money on fancied wants. The expenditure of sums that look small may start a train of circumstances that will reach into eternity. When the judgment shall sit, and the books are opened, the losing side will be presented to your view--the good that you might have done with the accumulated mites and the larger sums that were used for wholly selfish purposes.",
