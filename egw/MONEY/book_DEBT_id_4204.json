    "word": "\\n     As stewards of the grace of God, we are handling the Lord's money. It means much, very much, to us to be strengthened by his rich grace day by day, to be enabled to understand his will, to be found faithful in that which is least as well as in that which is great. When this is our experience, the service of  Christ will be a reality to us. God demands this of us, and before angels and men we should reveal our gratitude for what he has done for us. God's benevolence to us we should reflect back in praise and deeds of mercy. Please read the eighth and ninth chapters of 2 Corinthians. These words show the impression made on those for whom we work when we act as Christ would have acted in our place: \\\"He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: . . . being enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; and by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you. Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.\\\"",
