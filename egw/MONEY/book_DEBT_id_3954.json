    "word": "\\n     As the Sabbath drew on, we were left for two hours at Wells, Nev. We again assembled in one car for a prayer and social meeting. Twenty-six testimonies were borne, and the blessing of the Lord rested upon us. Some of the residents of the place looked in at the door to see what was going on, and seemed amazed as they saw us quietly holding a religious service, apparently as much at home in the car as in a church. There were several Chinese houses in this small place in the desert. Although it was still daylight, candles were burning before the door of one house and in another, and several Chinamen were bowing in reverence before their idols. How grateful we should be that we have not been left in the darkness of heathenism to worship hideous idols of wood, the work of men's hands. The living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all created things, is our God, and he is worthy of all honor. I was led to inquire, Have I set up idols in my heart? Have I allowed anything to come between myself and God, that he should not be supreme in my affections? We need individually to make close investigation on this point. The love of money, pride in dress and display,--anything that diverts the attention from God,--becomes an idol.",
