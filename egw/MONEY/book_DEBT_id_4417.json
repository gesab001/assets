    "word": "\\n     Had the money and labor that have been given to the cause in other lands been confined to the work in the home land, the church would have lost materially in spiritual life. God has been honored by the work that has been done for the people in distant lands. We must increase our liberalities to missions. And while we increase our labor and gifts for foreign fields, we must not neglect the work that needs to be done at home.",
