    "word": "\\n     The Saviour presents for our consideration something higher than what we shall eat and drink and wherewithal we shall be clothed. In our days, eating and drinking and dressing are carried to such excess that they become sinful. They are among the marked sins of the last days, and constitute a sign of Christ's soon-coming. Time, money, and strength, which belong to the Lord, but which He has entrusted to us, are wasted in superfluities of dress, and in luxuries for the perverted appetite, indulgences which lessen vitality and bring suffering and decay.",
