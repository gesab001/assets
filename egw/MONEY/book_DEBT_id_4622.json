    "word": "\\n     The sad history of Judas is a lesson for all. Judas was blessed with wonderful opportunities. He was with Christ during the entire period of the Saviour's ministry. Day by day for three years he listened to His instruction and witnessed His marvelous works. Had he been willing to renounce all selfishness, the Lord would have used him to advance His kingdom.

Stronger and stronger grew his covetousness, till at last he sold his Master for thirty pieces of silver.",
