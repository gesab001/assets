    "word": "\\n     A great famine arises, he begins to be in want, and he joins himself to a citizen of the country, who sends him into the fields to feed swine. To a Jew this was the most menial and degrading of employments. The youth who had thought to make the world his servant, now finds himself its slave. The glitter and tinsel that enticed him have disappeared, and he feels the cruel burden of his chain. He has boasted of his liberty, but he is the servant of corruption. He is in the worst of bondage,--\\\"holden with the cords of his sins.\\\" Proverbs 5:22. Sitting upon the ground, in that desolate and famine-stricken land, with no other companions than the swine, he would fain have filled himself with the husks on which the beasts were fed. Among all the gay companions who flocked about him in his prosperous days, and ate and drank at his expense, there is not one left to befriend him. Where now is his riotous joy? Stilling his conscience, benumbing his sensibilities, he thought himself happy in scenes of revelry; but now, with money spent, with hunger unsatisfied, with pride humbled, with his moral nature dwarfed, with his will weak and unreliable, with his finer feelings seemingly dead, he is the most wretched of mortals.",
