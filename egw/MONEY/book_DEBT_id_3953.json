    "word": "\\n     Means can now be used to advance the cause of God, but those who wait till some future time will be too late. The cause has waited years for men to get ready to do, and work that ought to have been done years ago is not done yet. How many more years will God wait the convenience of moneyed men, who are doing their best to lay up treasure on earth, in direct opposition to the command of Christ? He says, \\\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.\\\" God has lent men strength to plant, to sow, to build, and to engage in various enterprises to accumulate means; and they most entirely lose sight of the great loss they sustain by not laying up treasure in Heaven. He has intrusted to individuals means to be used in advancing his cause. Will they unselfishly fulfill this trust? or will they wait until the Lord shall be obliged to curse the fruit of their grounds and their possessions, because they will rob him by appropriating his means to their own use?",
