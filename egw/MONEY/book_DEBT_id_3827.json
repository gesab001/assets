We can not be clear before God unless we make every reasonable effort in this matter, and that without delay. There are some among us who will not see the necessity of this move, but their opposition should have no influence with us. Those who purpose in their hearts to be right and do right should move steadily forward for the accomplishment of a great work, a work which God requires to be done. There are many who are at their ease, who have postponed the work of doing good with their substance, but shall it be so longer? Shall we love money so well that we shall bury it in the earth?",
