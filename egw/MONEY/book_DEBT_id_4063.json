    "word": "\\n     What offerings of gratitude have you daily given to God for this great gift, his only begotten Son? Have you felt that you are \\\"not your own,\\\" but that you are \\\"bought with a price,\\\" even the precious blood of the Son of God; and that you must \\\"glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's\\\"? How many times have you grieved the Spirit of God by your selfishness, by indulging inclination, by investing for your own selfish advantage the money which he lent you to trade upon? You have called that your own which was only intrusted to your keeping.",
