    "word": "\\n     All the money is the Lord's, and we now call upon our people in Australia to unite in carrying to a successful completion the work on the Sydney Sanitarium. The light given me is that this work can and must be done. Let not the work on the Sanitarium be hindered for lack of means. Let not this institution stand unfinished, as a reproach to our churches. Let those to whom the Lord has given the talent of means help to accomplish this work. Carry the work through in the name of the Lord. Let all our people arise and see what they can do. Let them show that the Spirit of God is moving them to action.",
