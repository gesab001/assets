    "word": "Now the fact that you hold credentials from the Conference, and are receiving pay from the money brought in by the tithing, makes the Conference responsible for your influence among the flock of God.

Unless you change your course, I advise the brethren to withdraw your credentials and not let you carry their influence to sanction your proceedings.",
