    "word": "\\n     Poverty abounds in this world; and why?--Because of selfishness. Many are made poor by the dishonest stewardship of those who are trading on their Lord's goods. Today, crime of every kind is practised in order to obtain money. Selfishness, deceit, robbery, and bloodshed are making this world a veritable Sodom, and its inhabitants as the inhabitants of the antediluvian world. In the greed for possession, God's law is transgressed. But retribution will overtake the wrong-doers. Riches can not save one soul from death. He who gives himself up to work the works of Satan creates a force of evil that he can not repress.",
