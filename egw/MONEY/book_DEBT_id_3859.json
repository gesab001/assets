And as there are cases of destitution continually arising, and one new one recently, I thought it would be well for those who have clothing, bedding, or money, to spare, to send on here immediately. We hope there will be no delay, for we are going to assist some that are needy as soon as we get things together. Send your donations to Sr. Uriah Smith, or myself.                    Ellen G. White. \\n                                                                -\\n",
