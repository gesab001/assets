    "word": "\\n     \\\"Brethren and sisters, I plead with you to help forward our sanitarium work. The Paradise Valley Sanitarium is in need of assistance. We have evidence that the money expended there has been used wisely and well. The strictest economy has been shown in all that has been done; an advantage has been taken of every opportunity to save means. I know that the work of this sanitarium must be carried forward.",
