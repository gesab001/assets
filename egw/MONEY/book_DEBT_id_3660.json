    "word": "\\n     The necessities of the work now demand a greater outlay than ever before. The Lord calls upon his people to make every effort to curtail their expenses. Again I plead that instead of spending money for pictures of yourself and your friends, you should turn it into another channel. Let the money that has been devoted to the gratification of self, flow into the Lord's treasury to sustain those who are working to save perishing souls. Let those who have houses and lands give heed to the message, \\\"Sell that ye have, and give alms.\\\" \\\"Bring ye all the tithes into the store-house, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\\\"",
