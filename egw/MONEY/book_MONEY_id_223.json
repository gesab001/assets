    "word": "Many are the temptations and besetments on every side to ruin the prospects of young men, both for this\n77\nworld and the next.

Alcohol and tobacco inebriates would, at times, give any amount of money if they could by so doing overcome their appetite for these body-and-soul-destroying indulgences. And they who will not subject the appetites and passions to the control of reason will indulge them at the expense of physical and moral obligations.",
