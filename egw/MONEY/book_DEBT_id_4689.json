    "word": "\\n     There is a great dearth of men and women of solid experience and moral worth in this our day. How many do not appreciate the value of their blood-bought privileges, and do not improve the opportunity that has been purchased by the price of the life of the Son of God! They do not estimate the worth of every precious endowment by the light reflected from the cross of Calvary, or they would make use of every capability by consecrating it to the service of Jesus Christ. A large revenue might be brought into the treasury of God if people made a right use of their money. These matters require our thoughtful study.",
