    "word": "\\n     The prophet Isaiah, speaking by divine inspiration, exclaims, \\\"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\\\" Want of faith in God and love for our fellow-men are the great sins of the present time. Selfishness, self-love, and love of display are withholding means from the Lord's treasury, and crippling the work that must be done. Satan is a sharp financier, and he manages with subtlety to keep in his service every dollar that he can; and money is invested in houses and lands and spent for selfish gratification that ought to be used in sending the light of truth to all parts of the world. Practical faith will lead to greater consecration. If a man believes present truth, his works will testify to the fact. The character of our work encourages the strongest faith; we have the treasury of Heaven to draw upon. Our large cities are to be entered by making beginnings, however small, and then working by faith. The Lord has committed to his followers the work of giving the message of warning, and those who have means should give financial aid. May the Lord move upon hearts to do this.",
