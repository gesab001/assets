    "word": "At the second coming of Christ it will be made apparent whether or not we have made a wise use of the Lord's goods. When He returns, He will call His servants to account, and reckon with them. They will be required to give an account of the use to which they have put the money that He has entrusted to their care, and whether they have used it for the extension of His kingdom.",
