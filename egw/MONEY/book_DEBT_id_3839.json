    "word": "\\n     Our churches have shown much liberality, but they have not done all that they are able to do. Some have carried very heavy burdens, but there are others who are not willing to deny self. I appeal to every family of believers in our land to consecrate themselves to the work of soul-saving, pledging' themselves to advance the Lord's work by every means within their power. Let the older ones repress the desire to gratify self, and let the children be taught to save their pennies for the Lord. Let parents take up the cross of self-sacrifice, which lies so plainly in the pathway to holiness. Let the young men and young women who are tempted to expend means to gratify self, say, \\\"No! I will not rob the cause of God by spending money for that which is useless.\\\"",
