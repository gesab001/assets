    "word": "\\n\\nJanuary 8, 1895 Followers of Christ Will Be Missionaries.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     Those who love Christ will be imbued with the Holy Spirit, and whether they be at home or afar off, they will do missionary work. It is essential to devise plans, to advance money for the progress of the cause of God, but even more than this is required. Personal effort must be put forth to interest souls in the church, to attract the children and the youth. Missionaries must visit families, and become acquainted with every member of the home-circle, so working that they will awaken an interest in every one to love the truth. This kind of work will not be in vain, but will leave results that will be as lasting as eternity. This is true home missionary work.",
