    "word": "Extravagance and Fashions. The lives of nine tenths of the befrilled, trimmed devotees of fashion are a living lie. Deception and fraud are their daily practice. They appear what they are not. Nobility of soul is gone. Gentleness and generosity have been bartered away to gratify their lust after evil things. Thousands sell virtue to obtain money with which to gratify their desire to follow the fashion. Such madness upon these things should call forth an army of reformers to take their position for reform.",
