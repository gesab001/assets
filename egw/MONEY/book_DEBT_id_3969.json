    "word": "\\n     Dear brethren and sisters, your hearts must be humbled before God. You need divine grace, not merely for your own enjoyment, but that you may help others also. All your powers belong to God. He asks the whole heart. He asks your physical and mental strength; for it is his own. He asks your money; for every dollar of it has been intrusted to your keeping, and you are his stewards. Will you rob God of your service! Will you rob him in tithes and offerings, and let his treasury be empty? Will you use the time, talents, and strength he lends you in serving your own selfish interests?",
