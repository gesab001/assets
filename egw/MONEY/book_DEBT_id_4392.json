    "word": "\\n     But the hearts of men become hardened through selfishness, and, like Ananias and Sapphira, they are tempted to withhold part of the price, while pretending to fulfil God's requirements. Money is spent lavishly in self-gratification, men and women consult their pleasures and gratify their tastes, while they bring to God, almost unwillingly, a stinted offering. They forget that God will one day demand a strict account of how his goods have been used. While they unhesitatingly gratify their supposed wants, and withhold from God that which is his, he will no more accept the pittance they hand into the treasury than he accepted the offering of Ananias and Sapphira.",
