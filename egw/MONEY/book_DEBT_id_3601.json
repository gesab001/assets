    "word": "\\n     I am made sad when I see how much of the Lord's money is spent for dress and selfish indulgence,--money that God designed should be spent in saving souls who are perishing in ignorance of the truth and of God. Those who are thus tempted to extravagance and selfish indulgence should consider the words of Christ, \\\"Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.\\\" \\\"Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.",
