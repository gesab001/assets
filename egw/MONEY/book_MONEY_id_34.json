    "word": "A Parent Reproved for Extravagance.--You do not know how to use money economically and do not learn to bring your wants within your income. . . . You have an eager desire to get money, that you may freely use it as your inclination shall dictate, and your teaching and example have proved a curse to your children. How little they care for principle! They are more and more forgetful of God, less fearful of His displeasure, more impatient of restraint. The more easily money is obtained, the less thankfulness is felt.",
