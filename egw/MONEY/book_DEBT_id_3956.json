    "word": "\\n     We make progressive movements; but at every step prejudice and false ideas must be removed. This has been the case with every reformatory movement the world has ever seen. To some of small faith and selfish, money-loving disposition, each advance move has portended general disaster and an extravagant outlay of means. They have felt as did that poor man Judas when the ointment was poured upon the head of Jesus. Why this great waste? said he; this ought to have been sold, and the money given to the poor. Again and again, when some advance step has been taken, the selfish, cautious one have thought that everything was going to ruin; but when the battle has been fought against all odds, they have hailed the victory as a token that God was in the movement. When it has been so fully demonstrated that the work was of God that unbelief has had to yield, the men who led out, whose foresight was greater than that of others, who worked against all opposition, are hailed as men raised up for the time, and led by the Spirit of God. Do those men who blocked the way realize the work they have done? Do they see that the addition of their money, their strength, their faith, and courage, might have made the work stronger and more influential, and that their neglect to do what they could is sin? Many of these pioneers have become gray and enfeebled in making mighty efforts to advance the cause of God and the work of reform, while their brethren stood ready to wound them with their weapons of unbelief. There are graves in churchyards that would not now be there, had it not been for this very work of unbelief. Men of wisdom, mighty men of God, after having years added to their lives, and pressing through many obstacles, have failed, and gone to rest; and now we need their help.",
