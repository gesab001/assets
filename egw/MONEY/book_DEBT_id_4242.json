    "word": "\\n     The Lord calls for workers who will deny self and follow in His footsteps. He calls for a faithful tithe, and for gifts and offerings, that there may be money in His treasury for the advancement of His work. Our money is His, and is to be returned to Him. Christ is the light and life and joy of His self-denying people. Because He lives, they shall live also. When He comes, it will be to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all them that believe.",
