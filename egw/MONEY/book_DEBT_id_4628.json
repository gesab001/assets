    "word": "\\n     Deny yourself, take up the cross, and follow more closely in the Saviour's footsteps. Before you spend money, ask yourself, \\\"Can I not save this money? I will deny myself for Christ's sake. He gave His life to purchase eternal life for me. It was by the sacrifice of Himself that He placed at my command the riches of His grace. He was under no compulsion, no obligation, to grant me His favor. Had He withheld all from me, it would have been no more than I deserved. The rich treasures of grace that are the expression of His love for me were purchased by infinite sacrifice and unparalleled humiliation. These treasures are the tangible proofs of a love abundant and unmeasured. How deep is my indebtedness to my Saviour? How shall I express my appreciation of His bounty, my thankfulness for what He has done for me?\\\"",
