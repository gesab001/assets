    "word": "\\n     Money has power, and sways a mighty influence, while excellence of character and moral worth are often overlooked. But what does God care for money, for property? The cattle upon a thousand hills are his, as are also the world and all that is therein. The inhabitants of the earth are as grasshoppers before him; men and property are but as the small dust of the balance. He is no respecter of persons.",
