    "word": "\\n     The leaven of truth, hidden in the heart, will not produce the spirit of rivalry, the love of ambition, the desire to be first. Thousands upon thousands of those to whom God has intrusted talents become slaves to their earthly possessions. They abuse their intrusted capabilities, and scheme and plan to obtain those things which have no value with God. They buy and sell, and get gain, but they neglect to secure the precious things that are placed within their reach,--the bread of life, the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. Money is of value only as it is used as the Lord's intrusted means, only as we hold it in trust as a precious gift of heaven with which to bless humanity. If it is used to indulge and glorify self, it becomes a curse, and an incumbrance and a constant temptation.",
