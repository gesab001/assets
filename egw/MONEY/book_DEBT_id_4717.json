    "word": "\\n\\nApril 12, 1904 Read and Heed\\n\\n     The world is flooded with books that might better be consumed than circulated. Books upon Indian warfare and similar topics, published and circulated as a money-making scheme, might better never be read. The heart-sickening relation of crimes and atrocities has a bewitching power over many youth, exciting in them the desire to bring themselves into notice by the most wicked deeds. There are many works more strictly historical whose influence is little better. The enormities, the cruelties, the licentious practices, portrayed in these writings, have acted as leaven in many minds, leading to the commission of similar acts. Books that delineate the satanic practises of human beings are giving publicity to evil works. The horrible details of crime and misery need not to be lived over again, and none who believe the truth for this time should act a part in perpetuating their memory.",
