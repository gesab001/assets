    "word": "\\n     There never was a time when we needed to begin to understand our duty to God as now. Let the questions be asked in sincerity, Am I a Christian (Christ-like)? Am I showing my loyalty to God, and interestedly engaged in his service? Am I doing his word as well as hearing it? Let every one, young and old, feel the responsibility of his stewardship. All are in their Master's service. If those who profess to be Christians expend money needlessly when there are so many missionary enterprises that demand all the means that can be spared by every one of us, they are unfaithful servants. When about to purchase some article that is not essential, remember that the means thus invested, if not necessary for health or comfort, is so much retained for selfish purposes that ought to have been invested in the cause of God. It might have added some really necessary article of food or apparel to the needy poor around us. Cannot we, upon the coming celebration of Thanksgiving, make a thanksgiving for others through our thoughtful sympathy and deeds of love and kindness? We may bring rays of sunshine into many a heart that has long been desolate.",
