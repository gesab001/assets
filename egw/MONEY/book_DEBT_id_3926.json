    "word": "\\n     Take the last six commandments, specifying the duties of man to his fellow-men. Here are shown solemn obligations which are trampled upon every day by professed commandment-keepers. Those who have been enlightened by the grace of God, who have been adopted into the royal family, ought not always to be children in the work of the Lord. If they use, to the best of their ability, the grace given, their capacity will increase, and their knowledge become more extensive, and they will be intrusted with a still greater measure of divine power. In putting forth earnest, well-directed efforts to bring their fellow-men to a knowledge of the truth, they will become strong in the Lord; and for working righteousness on the earth, they will receive the reward of eternal life in the kingdom of Heaven. This is the privilege of our sisters. And when we see them using God's time and money in needless display of dress, we can but warn them that they are breaking, not only the first four but the last six commandments. They cannot make God the supreme object of their worship, neither can they love their neighbor as themselves.",
