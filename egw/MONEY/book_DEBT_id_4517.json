    "word": "\\n     Those who, like Judas, have set their hearts on their earthly treasure, will complain as he did when calls are made for the cause of God. His heart coveted the costly ointment poured upon Jesus, and he sought to hide his selfishness under the disguise of a pious, conscientious regard for the poor. \\\"Why,\\\" he asked, \\\"was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?\\\" He wished that he had the ointment in his possession; it would not thus be lavished upon the Saviour. He would sell it for money, and apply it to his own use.",
