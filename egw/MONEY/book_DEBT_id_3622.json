    "word": "\\n     Children should be disciplined to good works. Many of them would deny themselves indulgences, if a motive for so doing were placed before them. The money that they would be inclined to spend on selfish gratification, on things not essential to comfort or happiness, might be saved for some good or benevolent purpose. Children who have sound health; who have been trained in habits of industry, economy, and benevolence; and who have well-balanced minds, capable of mental and moral improvement, receive from their parents a legacy of price-less worth. Barriers and safeguards are thrown around them which will not be galling chains of restraint, but helps to a well-ordered life and a love of sacred things. \\n                                                                -\\n",
