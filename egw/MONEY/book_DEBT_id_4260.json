    "word": "\\n     I speak as I am instructed. I have a message for every family that has been robbing God in smaller or larger sums. Repent! Humble your hearts before God. Crucify self and selfishness. No longer use your intrusted means for selfish indulgence. Do all in your power to redeem the past. Show your friends and neighbors and your children that you regard money as too precious to be used for selfish purposes. Give for the advancement of the Lord's cause the money you would otherwise spend for photographs.",
