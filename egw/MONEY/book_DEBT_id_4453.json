    "word": "\\n     Mary had offered her gift in the grateful homage of her heart, and Jesus explained her motive and vindicated her deed. \\\"Let her alone,\\\" he said. \\\"Why,\\\" he asked, \\\"trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.\\\" He justified her work to all present as evincing her gratitude to him for lifting her from a life of shame to one of purity, and teaching her to believe in him. Said he, \\\"Against the day of my burying hath she kept this.\\\" The ointment so sacredly kept to anoint the dead body of her Lord she had poured upon his head in the belief that he was about to be lifted to a throne in Jerusalem. Jesus might have pointed out Judas to the disciples as the cause of such severe judgment being passed on Mary. He might have revealed to them the hypocrisy of his character; he might have made known his utter want of feeling for the poor, and his embezzlement of money appropriated to their relief. He could have raised their indignation against him for his oppression of the widow, the orphan, and the hireling; but he refrained from exposing the true character of Judas. He reproached him not, and thus avoided giving him an excuse for his future perfidy.",
