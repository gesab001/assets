    "word": "\\n     Money, houses, lands, and merchandise, all sink into insignificance when compared with the importance of properly educating and directing the mental, moral, and physical forces of our children. It is of little consequence whether we leave them large or small possessions, compared with the importance of giving them well-developed characters, unswerving rectitude, and noble purpose. Such a legacy is more precious than treasures of gold, and will never depreciate in value. No accident, nor time, nor change can affect it. Property may be swept away; but this sacred legacy remains untarnished, and will win for its possessor untold riches in the eternal future.",
