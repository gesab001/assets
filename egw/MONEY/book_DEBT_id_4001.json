    "word": "\\n     When the Master comes to make an investigation of his servants, in confusion the unwise servants acknowledge, \\\"I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed; and I was afraid [afraid of what?--That the Lord would claim some portion of the small talent intrusted to him.], and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou has that is thine.\\\" His Lord answered, \\\"Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed; thou oughtest, therefore, to have put my money to the exchangers, and then, at my coming, I should have received mine own with usury. Take, therefore, the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath, shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\\\"",
