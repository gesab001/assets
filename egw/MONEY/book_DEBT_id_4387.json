    "word": "\\n     God has provided for every one pleasure that may be enjoyed by rich and poor alike,--the pleasure found in cultivating pureness of thought and unselfishness of action, the pleasure that comes from speaking sympathizing words and doing kindly deeds. In order to find this pleasure, it is not necessary to have a supply of ready money. Through those who perform such service, the light of Christ shines to brighten lives darkened by many shadows.",
