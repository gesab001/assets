    "word": "\\n     Christian parents, never allow your children to dress as worldlings dress. You may say, \\\"My children do not profess to be converted, and therefore I can not refuse them;\\\" but this reason does not excuse you. Let them understand that your money is the Lord's money, and must not be used in indulging them in the fashions and pleasures of the world. Dress them neatly and tastefully, but refuse to sustain them in any effort to follow the fashions. Do not allow their minds to control yours.",
