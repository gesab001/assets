    "word": "\\n     Money is a talent, which is to be placed in God's treasury, for investment in his cause. But many are robbing God in tithes and offerings. \\\"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me,\\\" God declares. \\\"But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\\\"",
