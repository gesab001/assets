    "word": "\\n     When Simon Magus offered to purchase of the apostles the power to work miracles, Peter answered him, \\\"Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.\\\" But Tetzel's offer was grasped by eager thousands. Gold and silver flowed into his treasury. A salvation that could be bought with money was more easily obtained than that which required repentance, faith and diligent effort to resist and overcome sin. They could sin as they pleased, and money would purchase their pardon.",
