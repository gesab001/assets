    "word": "\\n     My Brethren and Sisters:--Why is so little being done to sell \\\"Christ's Object Lessons?\\\" Have you become weary in well-doing? Let this work advance, for there is great need that it be carried steadily forward. The school at Berrien Springs needs the money that the sale of these books will bring. This school is making advancement as fast as possible, but it is in need of funds with which to erect buildings. The Lord is pleased with the way in which the school has been conducted, and with the education that is being given to the students gathered there. Will you not remember that in doing your best to bring in means for the advancement of this school you are co-operating with Him? There is much that needs to be done before the winter sets in. Buildings must be erected, and other lines of work carried forward.",
