    "word": "\\n     Why is it that there is so little genuine love for Christ in the church?--It is because the love of self has taken the place of love for Him who died on Calvary's cross for the sins of the world. Let us be of one heart, of one mind, and let us draw near to God, that he may draw near to us, and fill us with his intense love for perishing souls. Let every heart beat in unison, in interest for the cause of Christ. New fields of work must be opened, souls are to be added to the faith, new names will appear on the church records,--names that will appear in the immortal records in heaven. O that we might realize what might be done with the money expended for the gratification of self!",
