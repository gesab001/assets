You have endeavored to make this work as presentable as possible, in order to show those who knew scarcely anything about your work, what has been accomplished in so short a time, and with so small an outlay of means. You wished all to see that needless calls for means had not been made, and that the money received had not been used in vain. You desired the work done in Nashville to be a sample of what could be done in other cities.",
