    "word": "\\n     As a people, we are not deficient in talent. There are men and women among us whose labors God would accept if they would offer them to him, but there are so very few who have the spirit of sacrifice. Some will hand out readily of their means, and feel that when they have done this, there is no more required of them. They make no special sacrifice in thus doing. Money is good as far as it goes, but, unless accompanied by personal effort, will go but a little way toward converting souls to the truth. Not only does God call for your money, brethren, but he calls for you. While you have given of your means, you have selfishly withheld yourselves. One earnest worker in the vineyard is worth more than a million of money without men to do the work. This giving of yourselves will be a sacrifice if you have a correct estimate of the work, and realize its claims. Christ our pattern was an earnest worker. He not only left the royal courts of Heaven, and for our sakes became poor, that we might have infinite riches, but took human nature, and by personal labors he came close to man, that he might reach him where he was, in his error and blindness. He withheld not himself. He gave all. He suffered deprivation, and reproach, and hatred of those whom he came to bless and save, and finally sacrificed his life in the work. And now, says Christ, I have done all this for you, what are you willing to do for me? I have given you an example.",
