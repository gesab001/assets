    "word": "\\n     The law of God is inexorable, and abates not a claim upon any human soul. It holds to its demands upon every sinner, and makes manifest his need of penitence for sin, of faith in a crucified and risen Saviour. It daily urges upon him the necessity of cooperation with Jesus Christ, that he may be found guiltless through the merits of his substitute and surety. In the judgment you will think it has indeed been at your soul's peril that you have turned from light and evidence, that you have educated the mind to cast contempt upon the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world. A faithful record is made of the thoughts, words, and deeds of every soul, and they are weighed in the golden balances of the heavenly sanctuary. God is not to be trifled with. In the parable of the talents, he who hid his Lord's money, and returned it to him without usury, is termed \\\"wicked and slothful.\\\"",
