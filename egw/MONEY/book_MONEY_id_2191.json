    "word": "But in view of the terrible crisis before us, what are those doing who claim to believe the truth? I was called by my Guide, who said, \"Follow me,\" and I was shown things among our people that were not in accordance with their faith. There seemed to be a bicycle \n\n\n                        -8- \n\ncraze; money was spent to gratify an enthusiasm in this direction that might better, far better, have been invested in building houses of worship where they are greatly needed. There were presented before me some very strange things in Battle Creek. There seemed to be a bewitching influence which was passing as a wave over our people there, and which will be followed by other temptations. Anything that can absorb means in meeting supposed wants in any direction, Satan will use with intensity of purpose to induce our people to invest their time and money. It is all a species of idolatry. The example will be followed, and while hundreds are starving for bread, while famine and pestilence are being seen and felt, because God cannot, according to his own name's glory, protect those who are determinedly working contrary to his will, shall our people who profess to love and serve God, be acting as did the people in the days of Noah, following the imagination of their own hearts?",
