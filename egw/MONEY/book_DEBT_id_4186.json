    "word": "\\n     But too often those who are enjoying the gifts of God add house after house, and farm after farm, to their possessions. Some even build for their dogs, homes that are like palaces, and keep hired attendants to take care of them, while their fellow beings are left to misery and crime, to disease and death. How long, O Lord! how long, shall this state of things exist? God will judge the world in righteousness by that man Jesus whom he hath ordained to judge the quick and the dead; and those who have long neglected to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to give relief and comfort to suffering humanity, will have to render an account to God for the misapplication of his entrusted talents. What a record will then appear of money spent on pleasures and the gratification of appetite in wine and liquor and rich dainties, for extravagant houses and furniture and dress, while human beings received not one pitying look, one word of sympathy.",
