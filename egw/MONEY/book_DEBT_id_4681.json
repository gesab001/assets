    "word": "\\n     The youth might become an army of young soldiers, to go forth as missionaries for God, but they cannot do this while their ideas of what constitutes religion are so far below the standard. Too often they make it manifest that they do not feed upon the word of God; they have a knowledge of the theory, but no realization that it is necessary to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. They live to please self, to enjoy their own way, to indulge in their own habits and customs, to seek pleasure in holiday festivities, and if they have earned a little money, to spend it upon things to gratify themselves. They study self, they glorify self. Many names on the church record are not on the record of heaven--not in the Lamb's book of life. These youthful persons who profess to be Christians, are not living for Christ. They are not bringing their will into subjection to Christ.",
