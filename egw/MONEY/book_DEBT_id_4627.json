    "word": "\\n     No sacrifice is too great to make for the truth, for heaven. Not a farthing of the money that we handle is our own. All is the Lord's, entrusted to us to test us, to see if we will make a right use of the Lord's goods. He who in this life does not prove true and faithful will have no second trial. Those who choose the world will perish with the world. A cloud of heavenly witnesses is watching the conflict between good and evil. Those who live for their own pleasure must one day answer to the Judge of all the earth for their misspent privileges and neglected opportunities. They will lose an eternity of bliss and the riches of everlasting life. God forbid that any should delay until it is too late, and should at last have to say, \\\"The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.\\\"",
