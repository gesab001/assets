And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria.\\\" Having humbled Israel by making it tributary to his empire, \\\"the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.\\\" 2 Kings 15:19, 20.",
