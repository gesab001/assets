    "word": "\\n     Those who love and serve God should feel the deepest interest in all that concerns the glory of His name. Who could see the institutions where the truth has been magnified, where the Lord has so often revealed His presence, where instruction has been given by the messengers of God, where the truth has been sent forth in publications that have accomplished great good,--who could bear to see these institutions passing into the hands of worldlings, to be used for common, worldly purposes? God would certainly be dishonored if His institutions were allowed to fall into decay for want of the money which He has intrusted to His stewards. Should this happen, men would say that it was because the Lord was not able to prevent it.",
