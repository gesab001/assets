    "word": "I was very much surprised at the remark you made to Brother and Sister Maxson, referring to your mistakes in Healdsburg. You told them that Sister White said, \"Stop just where you are, or you will meet with disappointment and failure.\" And when you presented the interest that you had in real estate and in the mine, you said Sister White did not advise you to have nothing to do with them, but said, \"Yes, it will prove a success.\" And it has proved just as she said. Have you forgotten, my brother, that I urged many reasons why you should not connect yourself with these financial speculations? But you presented the matter with so many words, and said so much about its being no tax \n\n\n                          [23] \n\nso you, as you claimed to be only a figure-head in the real-estate business; you had nothing special to do, your brethren did the work, and it was through the interest they had to help you that you were induced to engage in it, hoping to make money, that I concluded to say no more just then; but I thought that when I was rested, I would lay it open before you, just as I viewed it from a Bible standpoint.",
