    "word": "\\n     No pains or money should be spared to secure perfect sewer arrangements in connection with our schools and sanitariums. Message after message in regard to this matter has been given to those bearing responsibilities in our institutions. I have been plainly instructed that carelessness or neglect in regard to sanitary conditions, in home or in public buildings, means a withdrawal of the blessing of God. Special directions in reference to sanitary arrangements were given to the children of Israel. Every one was charged to keep his premises clean, within and without, lest the Lord, passing by, should see uncleanness, and should remove his presence from those who were careless and indifferent in this respect.",
