    "word": "\\n     The heavenly intelligences watch with intense interest the struggle between tempter and tempted. It is a life-and-death question that is being settled. Christ knows this, and before those whose souls are trembling in the balance, he holds up the sure test of obedience or disobedience, saying, \\\"He that loveth his life\\\"--his good name, his reputation, his money, his property, his business--\\\"shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.\\\" He who hates the life which is lived in transgression of God's law, he who accepts the divine requirements, leaving God to take care of the consequences, will gain eternal life. \\\"If any man serve me,\\\" Christ declares, \\\"let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.\\\" \\n\\n                                               -\\n",
