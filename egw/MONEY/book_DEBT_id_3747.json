    "word": "\\n     I ask the children to show an unselfish interest in the work in the South. Will they not give their mites to help in this work? There are many ways in which they might earn money for this purpose. One of our brethren bought wall pockets, and sold them to our sisters at cost price. Those who bought them sold them to their friends and neighbors at an advance, and gave the proceeds to the Southern work. My son has often written me how much the means thus raised helped in the first establishment of the work. Can not the children make simple, useful household articles, and sell them, telling those to whom these things are offered of the work to which the money thus raised is to be devoted?",
