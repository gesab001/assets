    "word": "\\n     From their abundance the great men of the world often give large sums of money to colleges and societies, that their names may be extolled; while close to their stately mansions the widow and the fatherless are destitute of food and clothing. Christ teaches that our gifts should be made quietly and unobtrusively, from a heart of pitying tenderness for the unfortunate and the suffering. We should give kindly words with our gifts. Hearts are drawn together by words of kindly sympathy and genuine sorrow for the sufferer. There was no virtue in the gift of the Pharisee. Through it no blessing came to the heart of the receiver. He had given because he desired to be praised for his benevolence.",
