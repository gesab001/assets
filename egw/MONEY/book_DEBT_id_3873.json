    "word": "\\n     \\\"AT A FASHIONABLE PARTY IN FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, A FEW EVENINGS SINCE, A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN TURNED SHARPLY UPON AN ELDERLY DOWAGER WHO WAS PROSING ABOUT THE MAGDALENS, AND THE HOPELESSNESS OF DOING ANYTHING FOR THESE 'LOST WOMEN,' WITH THE ASSERTION: 'I KNOW A CLASS MORE HOPELESSLY LOST THAN THEY. WE FASHIONABLES, WHO MURDER TIME AND SQUANDER MONEY, AND LEAD WOMEN TO BECOME MAGDALENS THAT THEY MAY DRESS LIKE US, WHY DOES NOBODY SEND MISSIONARIES TO US?' THE INTENSITY OF THE UTTERANCE WAS ELOQUENT OF BETTER POSSIBILITIES. NO DOUBT THERE ARE MORE WAYS THAN ONE OF BEING LOST. THE SIRENS ARE NOT ALL OF ONE CLASS, OR CONFINED TO ONE LOCALITY.\\\"",
