    "word": "\\n     \\\"I thank God that we have this school. We are not in the school work to make money; we are here to give the youth a well-balanced education. To this end they must educate their muscles as well as their minds for service. The physical powers should be brought into exercise, that the brain powers may not be overtaxed. We want this school to stand forth as an example in every way. You may have a large school; but if you would have its work a success, you must co-operate with the Lord and with one another.\\\"",
