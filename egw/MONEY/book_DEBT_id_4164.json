    "word": "\\n     The great lesson we are daily to learn is that we are stewards of God's gifts,--stewards of money, of reason, of intellect, of influence. As stewards of the Lord's gifts, we are to trade upon these talents, however small they may be. Many neglect this work because they think their talent too small to honor God. But you should not thus estimate the talents God has given you. Because you do not seem to be so highly favored as some others, you should not underrate your entrusted gifts, hiding them in the earth. We cannot place an accurate estimate upon our powers. However small your talent may appear, use it in God's service, for he has need of it. If it is wisely used, you may bring to God one soul who also will dedicate his powers to the Master's service. That soul may win other souls and thus one talent, faithfully used, may gain many talents.",
