There would not be a feather on their bonnets, and they would wear no needless ornaments; neither would there be any extravagant houses built, or money laid out in costly furniture. They should bear in mind that it is God's money that they are using,--money that could be invested in saving souls for whom Christ died. Any needless expenditure of this money is blocking up the way; for the means thus used would send publications and the living preacher to those who have not the truth.\\\" \\n                                                                -\\n",
