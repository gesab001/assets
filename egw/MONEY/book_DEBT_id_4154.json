    "word": "\\n     The fulfilling of the plan of salvation was a mighty achievement; but the rich man who has lost eternity out of his reckoning, has no appreciation of its value. The rich do only those things that suit their convenience. One rich person tries to outdo others in display. They are actuated by the same spirit that possessed Satan in the courts above. He has worked on the same line through all the ages, and rejoices at the transformation he can work in the character by implanting in the heart the love of riches. By pride of display and position he has caused the ruin of thousands and ten thousands. He has even led those who have placed their names on the church books to follow the fashion of the world, and seek to outdo their friends and neighbors in display. This has led to the committing of forgeries and robberies. In many cases wives have been tempters to their husbands, and have forced them to steal money in order to keep up the extravagant habits in which they have indulged. When frauds have been discovered, the perpetrators have often either fled from justice or put an end to their own lives. But the extravagance of the rich, and of those who would make a great display, reacts on the poor, and compels many to be ignorant, depraved, and destitute of the necessities of life. Thousands of talented men who have moral worth, and who, if they had a chance, could take a high position in society, are compelled to serve the rich and powerful, and to receive from their hands whatever they are pleased to bestow. If those they serve are selfish and avaricious, it will be made manifest in the way in which they deal with their servants.",
