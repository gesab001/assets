    "word": "\\n     Christ understood the danger of the love of money; for he said, \\\"How hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!\\\" He looked with sorrow upon the enthusiasm shown for the things that perish, and, lifting the curtain that veiled eternity from view, he declared, \\\"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.\\\" \\\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.\\\" Today he calls upon us to give close attention to our eternal interests. He would have us subordinate every earthly interest to his service. \\\"For what shall it profit a man,\\\" he asks, \\\"if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\\\"",
