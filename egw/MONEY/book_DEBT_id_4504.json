    "word": "\\n     If we appreciated what Christ has done for us as we should, what we do for him would not be done reluctantly. Here is the means which has been intrusted to us. Our Saviour directs: \\\"Provide yourselves bags which wax not old \\\" These \\\"bags which wax not old\\\" are the treasuries of Heaven. Are we putting our means into them? Are we cutting down, or adding to, our earthly possessions? If we sell a farm now and another by and by, and put the proceeds into the bank of Heaven; we may not be able to embellish our homes so elaborately; but it will not be like putting money into the banks of this earth. We shall have a treasure \\\"that faileth not,\\\"and it will be something to rejoice over when we reach Heaven.",
