    "word": "\\n\\nDecember 5, 1899 The Need of Self-Surrender.\\n-\\nMrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     Our work here, every step has had to be made in faith. We have advanced step by step, pressing our way by camp-meetings. But our movements are now bound about for want of means. We have the assurance that in this age of the world the Holy Spirit will work with mighty power, unless by our unbelief, we limit our blessings, and thus lose the advantages we might obtain. After one place has been entered, the word comes, add new territory. Press the triumphs of truth. Uplift the cross in the regions beyond. The vineyard is the world. Much money has been wasted by colonizing, when the work of annexing new territory should have been going forward, and the Lord's message sent forth as a lamp that burneth.",
