    "word": "\\n     I plead for this object of our interest,--the Sanitarium. Send in your offerings without delay. We do not want a heavy debt on our institution. With a Christlike spirit, in earnest, courteous terms, ask those who have means to give to the cause of God in this emergency. Deny self. Take up your cross, and follow Jesus. Let your work of self-denial bear witness to the influence of the truth in human hearts. You who have donations to make, make them now. Read the eighth and ninth chapters of second Corinthians, and follow the example of the Macedonian church. Loan your money, and make a donation of the interest, and you will receive a blessing.",
