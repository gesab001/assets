    "word": "\\n     Many to whom God has intrusted wealth do not consider that they are working against their own eternal interests by selfishly retaining their money. The apostle shows them that by being rich in good works, they are working for themselves. They are providing in Heaven an enduring treasure, and laying hold on eternal life. In helping the cause and relieving the wants of the needy, they are faithfully doing the work that God has assigned them; and their self-denial and generous, loving acts will be written in the book of Heaven. Every deed of righteousness will be immortalized, although, the doer may not feel that he has done anything worthy of notice.",
