    "word": "\\n     However large the income or the possessions of any person, any family, or any institution, let them remember that they are only stewards, holding in trust the Lord's money. All profit, all pay, our time, our talents, our opportunities, are to be accounted for to him who gives them all. The Lord would not have the first thread of selfishness woven into the fabric of his work: he is constantly proving us to see if our work is free from selfishness and pride. Those workers will have the richest reward, who prove that they love God supremely and their neighbors as themselves.",
