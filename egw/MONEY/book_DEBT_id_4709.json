    "word": "\\n     Time is fast passing. Let us remember that while life is ours, we are under the solemn responsibility of working for God. Let us throw aside our narrow, selfish plans, and do our very best to accomplish the work God desires to have accomplished. Let us give the invitation, \\\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.\\\" Let us think of the sacrifice Jesus made to obtain our redemption. Let us study how we can most intelligently work for him. We have been bought with a price; therefore let us do all in our power to glorify him who has purchased us. God calls upon us to go to those in error, and point them to the right way. It is not only the ordained ministers who are to do this work. Ministering angels will co-operate with all who will labor unselfishly for the Master. \\n                                                            Mrs. E. G.
