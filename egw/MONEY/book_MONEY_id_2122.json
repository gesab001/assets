    "word": "\"'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,' said Christ. This is the positive requirement of God. But this, the simplest, plainest injunction contained in the word of Him who is judge of every man's actions, has been deliberately set aside. Men connected with the Review and Herald Office have departed from Christian principles, to carry out a system of sharp dealing in contracts and practise. They have flattered themselves that it was the cause of God to be advantaged at the loss of others, therefore they would gather from every source possible to bring money into the treasury. But God declares, I hate robbery, for burnt-offering. Systems and rules have been made that bear not the signature of God; for they militate against the principles of the law of God. Men have managed things in a selfish, egotistical manner. After making laws, they have treated them as did the Jews, as of more consequence than the laws of God, the principles of which they were breaking every day. They laid burdens upon men's shoulders grievous to be borne, and then carried out to the letter their presumptuous rules and regulations which dishonored their Creator. It is these things that turned the face of God from the Review and Herald Office.",
