    "word": "\\n     The present time is presenting opportunities for doing God service. Let nothing stand in your way. Make use of the present to do liberally. God calls upon each to do his best in giving donations; for unless this is done the profits which should be spent in providing facilities and putting the institution into running order, will be consumed in the payment of interest money. Then will not my brethren to whom these words shall come make their donations as large as possible, that there may be no delay? There are some who cannot give sums of money. These can make their donations in time, by working extra hours. And let them work these hours faithfully as in the sight of all the heavenly universe. Others can help the cause by reducing their price of labour; and thus each day small sums will be sent in by the different workmen. Brethren, let us practise self-denial at this special time, which calls for all, old and young, to help. There must be no failure to meet the demand, that the building may advance. Let those who engage in the work remember that they are to render to God their powers each day. Lay your business before God, and have faith to believe that He will create openings. God will accept your willing service.",
