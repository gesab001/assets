    "word": "\\n     At the feast of the Passover Jesus appeared as a stranger, clad in the humble garments of a Galilean peasant, with no outward badge of authority. His eye took in the scene of the desecrated temple. The lowing of the oxen, the bleating of the sheep, the cooing of the doves, the jingling of the money, the sharp and angry contentions over the merchandise and in the traffic, drowned the voice of prayer in the temple. He looked upon them and, with indignant sorrow, he poured out the money of the changers; he overthrew the tables, and with a whip of small cords, drove the cattle and people out of the court. With majestic authority he commands, \\\"Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.\\\" It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\\\"",
