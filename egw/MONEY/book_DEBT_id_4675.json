    "word": "\\n     What are you doing, dear youth, to make known to others how important it is to take the word of God for a guide, to keep the commandments of Jehovah? Are you by precept and example declaring that it is only by obedience to the word of God that men can be saved? Do you realize that you have a work to do for those who have not had the light, who have not been granted the privileges and opportunities that have been granted to you? You can now do a work for their souls that you cannot do for them after they are dead. It is while they are living that you must present to them the word of life. Then why do you manifest such hesitancy in presenting to them the reasons of our faith? You should show them that you are not a fanatic, that there is a foundation for your practice of observing the seventh day as the Sabbath, and that foundation is the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. Are you not chosen of God to be a vessel unto honor, to convey light and truth to those who are in error and darkness? The saving message of truth has come to you, and if you receive of the spirit of Christ, you will have a love for the souls who are in peril. If you love Christ, appreciating something of the sacrifice he has made for you, you will deny yourself for his sake, turn from all selfish pleasures, and use money, time, and influence to win souls for whom Christ has died. As you willingly devote your powers to the winning of souls, you will be \\\"not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving [not self, but] the Lord.\\\"",
