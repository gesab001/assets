    "word": "\\n     The youth are not authorized to do just as they please with their means, regardless of the requirements of God. With David, they should say, \\\"Neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing.\\\" Quite an amount of means has been expended to multiply copies of their pictures. Could all enumerate the amount given to the artist for this purpose, it would swell to quite a large sum. This is merely one way in which means are squandered. In this direction, much money is invested for self-gratification, from which no profit is received. They are not clothed or fed by this outlay. The widow and the fatherless are not relieved; the hungry are not fed; the naked are not clothed. Your stinted offerings are brought to God almost unwillingly, while in self-gratification means are spent lavishly. How much of the wages earned finds its way into the treasury of God to aid in the advancement of his work in saving souls? They give a mite each week, and feel that they do much. But they have no sense that they are each stewards of God over their little, as are the wealthy over their larger possession. God has been robbed, and themselves indulged, their pleasures consulted, their tastes gratified, without a thought that God would make close investigation of how they have used their Lord's goods. While they unhesitatingly gratify their supposed wants (which are not wants in reality), and withhold from God the offering they ought to make, he will no more accept the little pittance they hand in to the treasury than he accepted the offering of Ananias and his wife Sapphira, who purposed to rob God in their offerings.",
