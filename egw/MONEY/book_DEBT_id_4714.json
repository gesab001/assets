    "word": "\\n     Money is a curse unless it is used in the Master's service. With our means and our influence we are to work for him. God forbid that we should live for self, devoting time and means to selfish interests. When Jesus comes in the clouds of heaven, he will then have no use for the money he has intrusted to us. It is now that we are to give it to him. He calls upon us to bring him our tithes and offerings now, and he promises, if we do this, to pour upon us such a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.",
