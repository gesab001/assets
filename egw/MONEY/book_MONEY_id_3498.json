    "word": "God is the author of all that is good. He blesses the children of men with prosperity, and gives abundantly to them \n\n\n                                 -248- \n\nby causing the earth to yield her treasures. But what does He behold among the few educated and trained men of talent? - Not many are working after the divine order. Yielding to temptation, they rule the markets and control the merchandise in accordance with Satan's principles. They have the money which belong to the people, the money which would give them a fair chance. God's poor are left to suffer and perish, while man's cupidity grasps every advantage.",
