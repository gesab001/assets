    "word": "There lie the books scarcely touched on the shelves. They fall dead from the press and my money to reproduce books is tied up in these books unhandled. I thought I would have means coming in on the strength of large sales which were held up before me. I donated some fifteen hundred dollars the first year of labor in America after leaving Europe. All the money to meet these donations I hired at seven percent interest. I do not regret the donations because they were really needed. I have had to work every way to pay my helpers making books. I am going deeper and deeper in debt, and if this is the way the matters are to go I shall have to take my books in my own hands and see that the people have what God designs they shall have. I have given away copies of Vol. 4 that amount to above $100. I cannot go on in this way much longer. I must stop working in getting out books unless there is a different principle that moves our brethren to circulate them.",
