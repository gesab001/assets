    "word": "\\n     Then, again, let us consider prayerfully the subject of our possessions. How many are withholding from God his due? And how many, on the other hand, are letting the means which the Lord has lent them in trust, flow into the various channels of Christian liberality? Are not many moneyed men saying today. \\\"By my wisdom have I gotten me this wealth?\\\" Who gave you the intellect and ability to get wealth? You should consider that you are the Lord's property that you are dependent upon him for all your wisdom, and your ability to gain wealth. Then when the wants of home and foreign missions are presented, you will respond liberally, saying, \\\"it is only of thine own that we have given thee.\\\" All the riches, even of the most wealthy, are not sufficient to hide the smallest sin from God. Neither riches or intellect will be accepted as a ransom for the transgressor. Repentance, true humility, a broken heart, and a contrite spirit, alone will be acceptable to God.",
