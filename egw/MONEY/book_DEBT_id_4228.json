    "word": "\\n     Those who came at the eleventh hour were so thankful for an opportunity to work that they left the matter of payment with their employer. They were glad to work at any price. Their hearts were full of thanksgiving, full of love for the one who had accepted them, and they showed their faith in him by asking no questions in regard to reward. When at the close of the day the householder began with them, and paid them for a full day's work, they were greatly surprised. This was unlike any treatment they had ever received. They knew that they had not earned the money given them. The kindness expressed in the countenance of their employer went to their hearts, and filled them with gratitude. They never forgot the goodness of the householder, or the gracious compensation they received.",
