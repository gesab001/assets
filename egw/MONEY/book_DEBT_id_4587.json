    "word": "\\n     Divinity flashed through the garb of humanity. When Christ had made a scourge of small cords, \\\"he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; and said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.\\\" He drove out the sacrilegious robbers, saying, \\\"It is written, My house is the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\\\"",
