    "word": "\\n     The Lord is bidding his people in every place to sow beside all waters. It means much to obey his command. It means a continual imparting of the gifts we have received from Heaven. The cause of God needs consecrated workers, and it needs money. Shall we continue to spend our means for things that are unessential, while a neglected work remains undone? Shall we not rather repent of our indifference toward this work, and pray for spiritual discernment to see and understand, as we should, its urgent needs?",
