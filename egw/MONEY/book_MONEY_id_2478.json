    "word": "MR No. 325 - Confederacies, Etc.\n\n     There are men in the church and in the world who have educated themselves to practice fraud, and for this they will be brought into judgment. . . . Men have chosen to stand, not under the blood-stained banner of Prince Immanuel, but under the rebel flag to do the works of a rebellious prince. They may have sold their souls for money. They may have taken their Lord's money to purchase wheat and the facilities whereby poor men live, that they may extort from the Lord's creatures the highest prices. They make for themselves princely fortunes.",
