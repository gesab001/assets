    "word": "\\n     The work of God is to be carried on by us as a people. We know how it started. My husband said: \\\"Wife, let us take only sixteen shillings a week. We shall live very plainly and dress very plainly, and take the means that otherwise would come to us, and invest it in the publishing work.\\\" The publishing house was then a plain, square building, twenty-four by thirty-six. Some narrow-minded men, who wanted the money for themselves, said, \\\"This is altogether too large a building.\\\" They brought such heavy pressure to bear regarding this question that a meeting was called. I was asked to go and explain why, if the Lord was coming so soon, the publishing work should need such a large building. I said: \\\"You that have ears, I want you to hear. It is because the Lord is coming that we want a building as large as this is; and more than that, it will grow larger as the work progresses. The Lord has a work to do in the world. The message must go to all parts of the earth. It is because we believe this that we have started this work. We are going to deny ourselves.\\\"",
