    "word": "\\n     Money is a needed treasure. Do not lavish it upon those who need it not. Some one needs your willing gifts. There are those in the world who are hungry, starving. You may say, I can not feed them all. But by practising Christ's lessons of economy, you can feed one. \\\"Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\\\" These words were spoken by him whose power wrought a miracle to supply the needs of a hungry multitude.",
