White.\\n-\\n\\n     We read in the word of God that \\\"not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.\\\" The rich idolize their riches, and do the very things which Jesus has told them not to do. They lay up their treasure upon the earth, and they worship and serve their treasures. By their example they educate those who dwell with them or who are connected with them to think that money is the thing to live for, and thus they testify against Christ. What saith the world's Redeemer?--\\\"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.\\\" Every needed blessing will be given to those who serve God.",
