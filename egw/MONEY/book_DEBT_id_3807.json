    "word": "\\n     The help of every one is needed. The mites from every source are to be carefully treasured. The humble gift of the widow, the limited sum from the poorer class, is not, in the sight of God, inferior to the larger offerings; the Lord will add his blessing to the gift, making its errand of mercy fruitful in accordance with the whole-hearted cheerfulness with which it is bestowed. If the affluent give grudgingly, longing to have every dollar to invest in speculation, or other worldly enterprises, they will receive no reward. We urge that the money usually invested for picture-taking shall now be put to a higher and holier use. Seek to reach all souls within the sphere of your influence. The ardor of youth is needed. The young should put away vanity, and restrict their wants. In your expenditure consider that it is God's money that you are handling, and that you must render an account for its use.",
