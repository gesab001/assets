    "word": "A lot has been purchased on which to build a church here. I made a donation of twenty pounds but they must wait until I can obtain means. I must see if we can hire one hundred pounds to keep us until the Lord shall send us means. I have paid one hundred and five pounds toward the Stanmore church. After great hindrance, which we cannot explain, the land was bought and the building is up, but money does not seem to be in sight to pay the workmen and fully complete the work. But it will be dedicated next Sunday.",
