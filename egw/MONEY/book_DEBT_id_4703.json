    "word": "\\n     By the parable of the talents, Christ teaches us the relation that man sustains to God. \\\"The kingdom of heaven,\\\" he says, \\\"is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; and to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.",
