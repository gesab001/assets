    "word": "\\n     Paul writes to Timothy, \\\"Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.\\\" Who will take these words into the inmost soul, and for Christ's sake, for their soul's sake, awake to the perils that are threatening all who fail to find refuge in Christ?",
