    "word": "\\n     I saw that the Israel of God must arise, renew their strength in God by renewing, and keeping their covenant with Him. Covetousness, selfishness, and love of money, and love of the world, are all through the ranks of Sabbath-keepers. These evils are drying up the sacrifice of God's people. Those that have this covetousness in their hearts are not aware of it. It has gained upon them imperceptibly. And unless it is rooted out, their destruction will be as sure as Achan's was. Many have taken the sacrifice from God's altar, and they love the world, love its gain and increase, and unless there is an entire change they will perish with the world. God has lent them means. It is not their own; but God has made them his stewards. And because of this, they call it their own, and hoard it up. But, O, how quick, when the prospering hand of God is removed from them, it is all snatched away in a moment. There must be a sacrificing for God, a denying self for the truth's sake. O, how weak and frail is man. How puny his arm. I saw that soon the loftiness of man is to be brought down, and the pride of man humbled.  Kings and nobles, rich and poor, alike shall bow, and the withering plagues from God shall fall upon them. \\n                                                     Ellen G.
