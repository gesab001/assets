    "word": "Whatever may be the amount of means coming in, strictest economy is to be studied. Economy and care must be exercised in expending funds, not to please fancy, but to study the limited means. Care must be used, economy practiced from the very highest motives, linking all expenditures with God himself, for it is God's money \n\n\n                                    -119- \n\nwe are handling, and we can limit the supply by our want of foresight. It is not best to purchase the cheapest things, but the most serviceable and enduring. They may be more expensive at the time, but if they are treated carefully they will not be the dearest in the end. Those who realize that all money is the Lord's, will get into the habit of asking the Lord how it shall be used, as to what they shall purchase in the little things as well as in the large. This is the right principle to work upon. . . .",
