    "word": "To every laborer I would say, Let light shine forth in your home church. In the congregation assembled for worship, discharge every duty faithfully. And in all your official duties, let unselfish integrity characterize every act. All tithes, all moneys, entrusted for any special purpose, should promptly be placed where they belong. Let every penny that is received be entered carefully upon the books for the purpose specified. Money coming in for the cause of God should not be used in meeting a special emergency, with the thought that it can be replaced later on. This kind of unfaithful work the Lord forbids. It is a temptation coming from one who worketh evil. The enemy of our souls is constantly seeking to exercise a power that leads astray, and that, if unchecked, will prove the ruin of many.",
