    "word": "\\n     We have taken up the work in the foreign fields, where the people have never heard the truth, but the missionary work has not been advanced as it should have been. We could not go very far, because we had not the means. All that I have received from the royalties of the books I have written, I have invested in the work, and then I have said to my brethren, by faith, \\\"Lend me your means, I will pay you the interest, but the work can not stop here.\\\" I have tried to carry forward the medical missionary work and the gospel. These two are united, and should never be separated, because Christ did not separate them. Some institutions have been established in Australia, but not half what there ought to be, nor what there will be. After we had erected, with what help we could get there, eleven meeting-houses, and organized eleven churches, then the work was just taken hold of with the ends of our fingers. What was the matter?--There was no money in the treasury. We had no means to handle. I never want men sent to missionary fields with nothing to work with, as we were sent to Australia. They have sent some money to that field, and this is no more than they should have done. It was God's money.",
