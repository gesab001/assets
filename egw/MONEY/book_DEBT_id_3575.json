We are located where there is plenty of land, and the grounds near the church should not be occupied with private houses. Those who believe the truth for this time are not all transformed in character. They are not all proper object lessons, for they do not represent the character of Christ. There are many who would be pleased to get close to the church and the school who will not be helps, but hindrances. They feel that they should be helped and favoured. They do not appreciate the character and the situation of the work in which we are engaged. They do not understand how that all which has been done at Avondale has been accomplished with the hardest labour, and the use of money given with sacrifice, or which must be paid back again to those from whom it was borrowed.",
