    "word": "The Lord has not left anyone to do as he pleases with his goods, and to give as impulse shall dictate or as friends may demand. The money he handles is not his, and is not to be expended unnecessarily, for the vineyard of the Lord is to be worked, and its working requires the expenditure of means. Now is our day of trust, and the day of reckoning is yet to come.",
