    "word": "The Lord has given you your work, Brother Burden. He has not appointed Elder Reaser to tell you what your duty is. As superintendent of the sanitarium, your work is an important one. Elder Reaser is not to intrude himself upon that which God has given you to do. That there shall be no more money in the sanitarium until the institution shall have earned that amount required, is not for Elder Reaser to decide. Hire money, if this is necessary in order to perfect the work. \n\n                                               -",
