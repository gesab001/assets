    "word": "\\n     \\\"All natural gifts are to be sanctified as precious endowments. They are to be consecrated to God, that they may minister for the Master. All social advantages are talents. They are not to be devoted to self-pleasing, amusement, or self-gratification. Money and estates are the Lord's, to be used wholly to honor him; for he has pledged his word that if we use his entrusted goods as faithful stewards, we shall be rich in blessings, of which we shall have a supply to bless others. But if we regard the advantages given to us as our own, to be used according to our pleasure, to make a display and create a sensation, the Lord Jesus, our Redeemer, is put to shame by the characters of his professed followers.\\\"",
