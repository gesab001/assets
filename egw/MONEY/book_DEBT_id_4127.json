    "word": "\\n     We are in probationary time, placed here to develop character. We are to do good; for Christ went about doing good. He gave his life a ransom to save from ruin a wicked, fallen race. Let no one who has named the name of Christ, entertain the idea that selfishness and worldliness are in harmony with Christian character. Let no one imagine that he can live for self, spend money to please self, and yet have a place with Christ on his throne. \\\"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\\\" \\\"They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\\\" \\\"For this ye know, that . . . no covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.\\\" \\\"The wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.\\\"",
