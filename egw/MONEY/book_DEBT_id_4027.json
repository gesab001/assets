    "word": "\\n     How inclined is man to set his affections on earthly things! His attention is absorbed in houses and lands, and his duty to his fellow-man is neglected; his own salvation is treated as a matter of little consequence, and the claims of God upon him are forgotten. Men grasp the treasures of earth as tenaciously as if they could hold on to them forever. They seem to think that they have a right to do with their means just as it pleases them, no matter what the Lord has commanded, or what may be the need of their fellow-men. They forget that all they claim as theirs, has simply been intrusted to them. They are stewards of the grace of God. God has committed this treasure to them to prove them, that they may manifest their attitude to his cause, and show the thoughts of their heart toward him. They are not only trading for time, but for eternity, with their Lord's money, and the use or abuse of their talent will determine their position and trust in the world to come. If it is used to glorify themselves, they transfer their affections from God to his gift, and it becomes an idol. They will have to give an account of their work before the righteous Judge. All that you have and are, belongs to God, to be used in blessing humanity, and in advancing the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.",
