    "word": "\\n     Much missionary work is to be done in Oakland, and in the surrounding communities. We expect to stand by the brethren and sisters of the Oakland church; and we shall expect you to unite heartily with the conference laborers by rallying around the standard and by doing much personal work among your neighbors and friends. Money will also be needed for the maintenance of the laborers. Let every church-member deny self as Christ denied himself. Let us study the closest economy because of the many pressing calls for means to advance the message. As we sacrifice willingly, God will not fail us in time of need. The Source of all our blessings, he will not allow us to suffer because of our liberality.",
