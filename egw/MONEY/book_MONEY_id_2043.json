    "word": "Brother Church, you talk of independence, of one man's mind being all-sufficient to control institutions and churches; and you feel that that mind must be your own. But your mind, I have been shown, often comes to view things in a wrong light. Thus you make many mistakes. Your money does not give you any such prerogative as you have been inclined to claim. The Lord lives and reigns. When you are little in your own sight, he can use you to his own glory. When you walk softly before him, and in humility, he will guide you with his counsel; but when self becomes sufficient, and you put yourself where God has not placed you, then you are a channel of darkness. You have a disposition to want just what Israel wanted,-- a king to lead their armies and to judge them, that they might be \"like other nations.\" They were told, as I have been telling you, what would be the result if their desire was granted; but they were persistent to have their own way. They would have a king who pleased them, instead of being satisfied to have God for their ruler. God had ruled them through wise men,--men who had waited upon him for counsel. You are well acquainted with this history. God manifested his displeasure by thunder and lightning and hail. They could have retracted their decision, but were too proud to do it. God told Samuel not to oppose them, but to let them have just what they called for, \n\n\n                         [24] \n\nand all its consequences. They had not rejected Samuel, but the Lord God of Israel. He was the one who had been dishonored.",
