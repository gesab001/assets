    "word": "\\n     At this important moment of earth's history, there are mighty influences at work; for the enemy of God and man is seeking through many classes to thwart the purposes of God. All who profess to believe that the Lord is soon coming, should reveal their faith by corresponding works. It is well to raise money for home and foreign missionary work; but the time demands more than this. Work must be done that money cannot buy. Light must shine forth in vigorous effort, diligent zeal must be manifested to set the truth before the people by personal work. But the most enthusiastic zeal will accomplish nothing without the co-operation of God. Divine power must combine with human effort, and heart must meet heart as you intercede for the souls of men who are out of Christ. Deep, fervent piety at home, in the church, and in the neighborhood, will bring souls to behold wondrous things out of the law, and to see the glorious truth of Christ our righteousness.",
