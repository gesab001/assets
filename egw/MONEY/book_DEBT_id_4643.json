    "word": "\\n     Often those who are favored with wealth act as if they had a right to use with prodigality the gifts that God entrusts to them to be used wisely. They walk and talk as if riches entitled them to high honor. Sometimes the poor are favored by them, but more often the moneyed men waste their Lord's goods in selfish indulgence. They forget that all their treasures are entrusted gifts, and that they must render to God a strict account of the use they have made of His property.",
