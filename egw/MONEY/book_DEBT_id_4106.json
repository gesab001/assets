    "word": "\\n     We need more faith to work for those who are rich and in high position. For though Christ has said, \\\"How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God,\\\" every rich man who does yield himself to the converting power of God, and is an overcomer will find an abundant entrance into the kingdom of God. The rich who are truly converted to God, will understand that they are stewards of the Lord's property; and through the grace given unto them, they will discern that they have been intrusted with property, only that they may use it to advance the cause and kingdom of Christ in the world. There are many among the rich, who, were the truth presented to them as it is in Jesus, would be charmed with, and transformed through, the grace of Christ, and would see that money is of value only as it is devoted to doing good in the name and Spirit of Jesus. The wealthy man or woman converted to God, will begin to comprehend what good may be done with their intrusted capital. They will see that institutions are to be established for the education of the youth, and that they are to be sustained by gifts and offerings. They will know that many youth must be trained for the missionary field, and the wealthy will become agents in the hands of God to set in operation the instrumentalities whereby men and women may become enlightened, and turned from degradation and error unto the living God.",
