    "word": "Appreciate the Good Done by W.C.T.U.--Light has been given me that there are those with most precious talents and capabilities in the W.C.T.U. Much time and money has been absorbed among us in ways that bring no returns. Instead of this, some of our best talent should be set at work for the W.C.T.U., \n                                                                           164\nnot as evangelists, but as those who fully appreciate the good that has been done by this body. We should seek to gain the confidence of the workers in the W.C.T.U. by harmonizing with them as far as possible.... This people have been rich in good works.-- Manuscript 91, 1907.",
