    "word": "\\n     A mother cannot afford to be in bondage to opinion; for she is to train her children for this life and for the life to come. In dress, mothers should not seek to make a display by needless ornamentation. The fringes, ribbons, laces, and ornaments are not necessary, and in the purchase of these things the money God has intrusted to us is turned away from its proper channel; for it should flow into the treasury to supply the wants of God's cause.",
