    "word": "The Lord will come very near to the man of contrite heart. He will teach him wisdom. We cannot afford to walk apart from God. Unto Him is to be ascribed all the honor and the glory for the success we attain. He is the true Light of the world, whose words are to be received and practiced. Those who exalt Him above money, or praise, or glory, will gain precious victories.",
