    "word": "\\n     Brethren, use your influence to obtain a more extended circulation of the Review. You can do much more than you are doing in obtaining subscribers for the Review. If you would imitate, in this good work, the example of our enemies who publish error, or the example of Satan in his perseverance in circulating slander and falsehood, the list of subscribers would be greatly increased. Let every one go to work earnestly, perseveringly, to see what they can do in interesting others to read. Let all become missionaries; and you who have talents of money, put it out to the exchangers. Invest in the cause of God. Do not, I entreat you, continue to pursue a course of robbery with God.",
