    "word": "\\n     We should not devote this precious time to needless labor merely to gratify the appetite. We have not come here to indulge in feasting. Those who have taken charge of our restaurant at previous camp-meetings, have had the privilege of attending but few of the meetings. Much care and thought were given to the preparation of the food,--the cooking of meat, pies, cake, and a variety of other dishes to please the appetite. Was this really necessary? I think not. A few simple articles of food, prepared with care and skill, would supply all our real wants, and at the same time would do no injury to stomach or brain. The food should be abundant in quantity, and of good quality. We should not be compelled to live on a meat diet because nothing else is provided to supply its place. The money that is expended in buying meat, would purchase a good variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Meat is not essential for health or strength, else the Lord made a mistake when he provided food for Adam and Eve before their fall. All the elements of nutrition are contained in the fruits, vegetables, and grains.",
