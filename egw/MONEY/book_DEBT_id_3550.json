    "word": "\\n     Whenever the Lord brings destitute fields to our notice, and gives us opportunity to help, we are never to neglect the opportunity. To respond to the frequent appeals for money, may necessitate much self-sacrifice on our part; but by practicing Christlike self-denial in order to help our fellow men, we give evidence to the world of the power of the truth to transform and sanctify the character and to cleanse the heart from selfishness.",
