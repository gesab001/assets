    "word": "MR No. 1502 - Funds Needed for Avondale\n\n     (Written April 29, 1896, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N.S.W., to the Wessels brothers.) \n\n\n     I wish to write you a few lines, asking you to lend me 1,000 pounds. At the present time we are greatly in need of a building for school purposes. On account of the lack of means, we may not be able to carry out the plans designed by Brother Sisley, but if you will lend us the money I ask, we can commence at once to erect a plain, economical building. Without means, however, we can do nothing. We do not ask for this money that we may erect an expensive building, but that we may put up a plain, substantial building, suitable for the country. The brick for this will be made on the ground, and much of the lumber that is used will be sawed on the ground also.",
