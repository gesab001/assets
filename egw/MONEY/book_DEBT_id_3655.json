You try to content yourself with that which ministers to the carnal and earthly nature, but you know that you are spending money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which satisfies not. Alone in the far country you feel your wretchedness, and in despair you cry, \\\"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\\\" Romans 7.24.",
