    "word": "\\n     Time and strength and money have been frittered away simply for the gratification of taste, and yet all we have belongs to God, and is to be used for his glory. It is time that as families, and as a people, we should teach by precept and example how to be economical, self-denying, watchful and prayerful. We must lift the cross and follow Jesus. Our table should be a constant educator and enlightener to others, on account of its healthfulness and simplicity. We shall accomplish far more good in all lines of our work, if we live out the truth that we preach.",
