    "word": "\\n     Correctness in the keeping of accounts is especially required at a time when buildings are being erected. A faithful statement of every transaction should be made on the books. If this is not done, a great amount of money will be used, and no one will know exactly where it has gone. Great amazement will be felt. The bookkeeper is questioned, but if he has no written evidence to show for the money expended, suspicion rests on the transaction. And it may be that the truth in regard to the matter will not be known until the day when every man's work is brought in review before God.",
