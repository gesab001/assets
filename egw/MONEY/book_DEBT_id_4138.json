    "word": "\\n     The Lord has represented himself as a householder who left his goods with his servants, instructing them to trade upon them for his advantage. \\\"He called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. . . . And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.\\\" The Lord has given talents to his servants according to their several ability, and he means that they will be good stewards of their Lord's goods. In carrying out the principles of the law of his government, they will put their talents to good use in distributing to the poor, in manifesting the compassion and love of Christ to their fellow-men. Those who do this will hear from his lips the benediction, \\\"Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\\\" \\n\\n                                               -\\n",
