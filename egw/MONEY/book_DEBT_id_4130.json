    "word": "\\n     Judas undertook to follow Christ, and at the same time to carry out his selfish, covetous plans. He had the same privileges as had the other disciples. He had the same privileges of hearing the lessons of Christ, which plainly presented practical godliness; but he was not always pleased with the plain truth. It cut him, and instead of taking up personal labor with Judas Iscariot, he found fault with the words and works of Christ, and criticised his plain teachings. Instead of being transformed in character, he was cultivating self-love, self-esteem, and the love of money, and was becoming more and more greedy for gain. His love for Christ was not increasing; for he had not that faith which works by love and purifies the soul. Pure religion and undefiled is a religion that is of an experimental character, and brings forth practical results.",
