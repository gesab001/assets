    "word": "No persons should be placed as directors in the Office, or in any of our institutions, who have not a knowledge of the truth. Yet this will do far less harm than to put in as managers those who claim to believe the truth, and who do not manage under the influence of the Spirit of God; because these can do tenfold more harm to mislead the workers. Men who abide in the truth, who \n\n\n                         -6- \n\nhave a conscientious regard for the glory of God, who value the salvation of the soul as higher than money, position, or self-aggrandizement, who are conscientiously walking and working in the way of the Lord, should be trained to carry responsibilities. Men may have ever so much ability and knowledge; but if it is used in such a way as to administer to self, they will to the greatest damage to the work.",
