    "word": "For years, testimonies have followed you upon the subject of economy and the wise expenditure of means but neither yourself nor wife have made decided changes in your practices, if you could obtain money to use. You love display, you love indulgence of appetite, you love to gratify your taste; and the same traits of character shown in yourself are reproduced in your children, and you will reap that which you have sown. There never can be sufficient means granted you for your labors to sustain your indulgence of extravagant, spendthrift habits. Why do you not learn of those brethren who comfortably support themselves and their families on less money than you receive for your labors? The reason that you are in embarrassed circumstances is not because your wages are not enough to support you as a Christian, but you do not manage your means in such a way as to keep you from embarrassment. If you had twenty dollars a week you  would still complain of financial pressures, because your habits of expenditure would keep pace with your means.",
