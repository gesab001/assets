    "word": "\\n     The Lord desires His people to arouse. Word came from Colorado, asking me if the Southern field was closed. It was said, Word has come that the field is closed, and that we need send no more money there. But the evidence is that more means than ever should be sent there. The report that the work in the South was closed was started by the enemy. He saw what was going on, that work was being done for Christ in the South, and he stirred up his human agencies to hinder the work in one place.",
