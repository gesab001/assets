    "word": "\\n     Satan imparts to those who serve under his banner his own attributes, and causes men to lose control over themselves, so that he may lead them to do the very things they have despised. They will be led to talk loftily, and make a boast of things over which they should be ashamed. Those who are thus led into the delusion of Satan, do not know that they are in bondage. The bands have been broken that bind them to that which is good and pure and holy, and they leave their allegiance to God, and become apostates. They are led of passion and blind self-will, and they permit self-will to gain ascendency over reason and principle. Yet these are the men who call themselves free; but how deluded they are! They imagine that they have a very high standard; but O how shamefully low it is! They say, We want our own ways, not thy ways, O God. They do not realize the truth that Jesus uttered, \\\"Without me ye can do nothing\\\" to reach a high standard. I ask you, young men, Will you keep back from God that which is his own? Will you rob God, and misuse his time, misapply his talents, and refuse to give him the service he requires from each one of you? Will you lay yourselves, the purchased possession of Christ, upon the shrine of the world? Jesus, who has bought you with an infinite price, asks you to give him your heart. Will you give it to him? He asks your time, your money, your body, your soul. He has bought all there is of you; you are his purchased possession. O, do not yield yourselves to the service of Satan, to become a slave to the powers of darkness, and do the bidding of the prince of evil! \\n                                                           Mrs. E.
