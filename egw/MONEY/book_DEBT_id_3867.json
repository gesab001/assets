    "word": "\\n\\nJuly 19, 1870 The Camp-Meetings.\\n-\\n\\n     The Camp-Meetings in Iowa and Illinois have been meetings of deep interest to me. As we say those who had come, some from quite a distance, at the expense of time, and of money, I inquired whether all would return to their homes, having gained the object for which they came. The objects of these meetings, are, to separate from business cares, and burdens, and devote a few days of time exclusively to seeking the Lord. The time should be occupied in self-examination, close searching of heart, and penitential confession of sins, and renewing our vows to the Most High God. If any came to these meetings for less worthy objects, we hope the character of the meetings was such as to bring the minds of all to the proper objects of the meetings.",
