    "word": "\\n     This parable brings to mind the great day when every individual will have to give an account of the use to which he has put the talents entrusted to him. Christ likens his return for the investigation of every case to the return of a man from a long journey. The faithfulness of his servants during his absence is judged by the use to which every talent has been put. Every gift of mind, every physical capability, is God's entrusted talent, and let no one lightly regard his endowments of mind or body. We are to appreciate them as the gift of God, to cultivate and improve them, and place them at the service of God. This was the purpose for which talents were committed to us according to our ability to trade upon and cultivate these gifts. As we use our powers, we shall increase our ability to use them, and thus be enabled to do the highest kind of service. We shall be able to put our talents to a wise use; but if we do not use those qualifications of mind and body that God has given, however precious they may be, they will become valueless. The money that is locked up in worldly investments is no blessing, even to the one who claims to be its owner. The true owner of all our gifts is keeping a reckoning, estimating the good that might be done to suffering humanity if they were wisely used in the service of God, to build up his kingdom in the world. Money wisely invested in the enterprise of saving souls would yield a large return in the end. Not only would men have increased ability to gain wealth, but they would be laying up treasure in heaven.",
