    "word": "\\n     Missionaries are planting the standard of truth in foreign lands. Publications must be multiplied, and scattered like the leaves of autumn. These silent messengers are enlightening and molding the minds of thousands in every country and in every clime. As a people, we come far short of moving forward as fast as the providence of God opens the way. He gives the command, \\\"Go forward.\\\" Thousands are thirsting for living truth. The Macedonian cry is coming to us from every direction, \\\"Come over and help us.\\\" We look about us and inquire, \\\"Who will go?\\\" One and another may respond, \\\"Send me. I long to do something for my Master.\\\" But to do this requires money.",
