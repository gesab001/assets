    "word": "\\n     Let us, as stewards, do as Christ would do were he in our place. He did not spend money to please his fancy. From the least to the greatest, we are God's stewards. What are we doing with his goods? A blessing will come to those who use their God-given means to accomplish good, instead of spending it in self-gratification. Christmas will soon be here,--a season of the year when much money is spent in buying presents. Let us practise self-denial and self-sacrifice. Money is greatly needed to place our sanitarium in running order. Let us work intelligently and earnestly, and spend in self-gratification nothing that is needed in the work of saving souls. Buy books upon present truth for those who need them. It is not ministers alone who are entrusted with talents and the work of ministering. Every child of God is pledged to do his utmost by self-denial to save the pence, the shillings, and the pounds. Put your money into the Lord's treasury, that it may be invested in special lines of missionary work. We are to serve God with heart, and mind, and soul, and strength. Every capability is to be put into active exercise. Our talents are to be used to please God, not to glorify self.",
