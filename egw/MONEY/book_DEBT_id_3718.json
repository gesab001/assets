    "word": "\\n     In the Sabbath-school men and women have been accepted as officers and teachers, who have not been spiritually minded, and have had no live interest in the work committed to their care; but matters can be set in order only through the aid of the Holy Spirit. The same evil has existed for years as now exists in our churches. Formality, pride, and love of display have taken the place of true piety and humble godliness. We might see a different order of things should a number consecrate themselves wholly to God, and then devote their talents to the Sabbath-school work, ever advancing in knowledge, and educating themselves so that they would be able to train others as to the best methods to employ in the work; but it is not for the workers to seek for methods by which they can make a display, consuming time in theatrical performances, and musical display; for this benefits no one. It does no good to train the children to make speeches for special occasions. They should be won to Christ, and instead of expending time, money, effort to make display, let the whole effort be made to gather sheaves for the harvest.",
