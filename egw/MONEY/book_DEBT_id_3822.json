    "word": "\\n     In every business firm and in every institution the bookkeeper should make a plain record of every dollar received and every dollar paid out. Then there will be no uncertainty as to what has been done with the money. When accounts are handled in a hurried, haphazard manner, it is not known whether the bills are paid or not, the institution suffers losses, and there is room for suspicion that fraud has been practised by some one.",
