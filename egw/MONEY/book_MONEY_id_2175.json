    "word": "Robbing God. \n\n     \"Wherein have we robbed Thee?\" God answers, \"In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.\" The whole world is engaged in robbing God. With the money he has lent them they indulge in dissipation, in amusements, reveling, feasting, and disgraceful indulgences.",
