    "word": "\\n     I have freely used my own means to meet some of the many necessities of the work. Of all that has come into my hands, which I can call my own, I have withheld nothing. It is all the Lord's, and is freely spent in His service. And when we have come to a crisis, after using all we had in hand, I have borrowed money, to the amount of several hundred pounds, at a low rate of interest. We have also received several hundred pounds from our people without interest. When the necessity arises, I feel no hesitation about receiving these loans, either with or without interest.",
