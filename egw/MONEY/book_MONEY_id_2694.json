    "word": "I have something more written in regard to your case, which I will send you when I find it. You have not practiced economy in the use of means. Sometimes when you have wished to help certain ones, you have brought them things which struck your fancy, but which they were unable to use. In such matters your judgment has often been quite defective. It would have been better for you to have given them the money you spent for them. They could have purchased that which would have been of use to them. Our money is the Lord's and is not to be used with prodigality.",
