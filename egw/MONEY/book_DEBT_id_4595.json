    "word": "\\n     The meal in which the leaven is hidden represents the heart that receives and believes in Jesus. Christ works out the principles which He alone can work in. The world regards as a mystery the man who is imbued with these principles. The selfish, money-loving man lives only to eat and drink and enjoy his worldly goods. He loses the eternal world from his reckoning. But the man who receives and believes the truth will have that faith which works by love and purifies the soul. The world can not know him, for he is keeping in view eternal realities. A motive power is working within to transform the character. The love of Jesus with its redeeming power has come into the heart to conquer the entire being, body, soul, and spirit. When counter-influences work to oppose the grace of Christ which bringeth salvation, this love masters every other motive, and raises the human being above the corrupting influences of the world.",
