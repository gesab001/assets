    "word": "A Letter to Ellen White's Son, Thursday, December 18, 1890 \n\n     Dear son Willie: I received your letter and draft in the hall last evening, where we had gone to attend my appointment Wednesday evening in a pouring rain. I was glad to hear from you and glad of the draft. We had borrowed money from Elder Robinson to buy our tickets. . . . I had $20 of my own which I have had to use in traveling and in getting shoes and some little things for winter. . . .",
