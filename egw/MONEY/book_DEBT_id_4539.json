    "word": "\\n     There is now such a demand as never before for labor and money to sustain the cause of Christ, to send the gospel to the world. Everywhere there are doors open for the entrance of the word of life. Everywhere there are souls that sit in darkness, only waiting to receive the light from heaven. It is not in foreign lands alone that the need exists. Close beside your own doors there are souls that you might win for Jesus,--souls to whom your life may be the revelation of Christ. To these souls, God has set you as a light-bearer on the way to heaven. If your light burns dim, if it goes out in darkness, they may be lost. You cannot neglect these souls, you cannot refuse to become a partaker with Christ in his labor and sacrifice, and yourselves find entrance as redeemed sinners into the city of God. Those who fail to represent Christ, who have not his self-sacrificing love, and are not doing his work, give evidence that they themselves are not united to him. Whatever their profession, they do not belong to Christ.",
