    "word": "\\n     The world is not being warned as it should be. Thousands are perishing in their sins, and the last message of mercy to a fallen world is to be proclaimed. But how little is being done! Genuine benevolence will lead those who have been entrusted with the Lord's money to place this money where it will advance His work. Souls are perishing, and hundreds of workers are now needed. Men will be moved by the Holy Spirit to leave their ordinary employment; and enter fields that have never heard the last message of mercy. Many will be endued with power from on high. They will work wisely, not expending means lavishly, but studying how souls can be brought to a knowledge of the truth. They will work for the love of Christ, and success will crown their efforts.                                Mrs. E. G. White.",
