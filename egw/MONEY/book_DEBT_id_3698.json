    "word": "\\n     If it were possible, I would invest means in the Southern field, but I have no money to invest. I have put all I have into the work in various parts of the field. If I had money, I can assure you that it would be at once invested in the work in the South. In the name of the Lord I ask those who have means to do what they can to advance this work. In all the large cities in the South there ought to be places where the sick can be cared for, where the people can be taught to care for themselves. The people need sympathy and tenderness. In clear, simple lines the truth must be presented to them.",
