    "word": "God has said that the Southern Field is to be worked. In the very midst of us there are those who know not God. Their ignorance cries out against those who spend their money in building elegant mansions or in erecting costly monuments over the dead. What help are these monuments to the dead or to the living? What honor do they bring to God? The cries of souls hungry for spiritual food are ascending to God.--Ms 38, 1904, pp. 23-24. (\"Our Work in Washington,\" May 3, 1904.) \n\nReleased April 16, 1974.",
