    "word": "\\n     There are those among us who have a surplus of means, but they think they need it to sustain themselves. Let matters be arranged that these persons shall have interest on their money as long as they shall live, and let them donate the principal to the cause and work of God. Thus they will return to the Lord that which is His own. Carefulness should be manifested in this respect. Christians should not be negligent to place in the Lord's treasury the means which should carry forward His work while time shall last. His entrusted goods should reach the highest accumulation, for the kingdom of God is to be extended, and the interests of His kingdom increased by a wise disposition of His means to make known the unsearchable riches of Christ.",
