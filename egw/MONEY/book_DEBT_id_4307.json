    "word": "\\n     When I see our people spending money for needless trimmings, needless furnishings, I think of Jesus. He might have come to this world in the glory of his kingly power. But he chose to come to this world in the garb of humanity, and to live a life of self-denial and sacrifice. Those who follow in his footsteps will remember that every dollar they can spare is needed in the work that God has said shall be done in this world.",
