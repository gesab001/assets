    "word": "\\n     When brethren render to God a small portion of their time, money, or intellect, which are all his own, they are inclined to feel well pleased with themselves, and to think that they have placed the Lord under obligation to them. But why should Brn. Whitney, Smith, Brown, Haskell, or any of these ministers, give all their powers to the service of God, and bear burdens in his cause, and the hundreds of believers go free, carrying no responsibility of the work? Has God given these brethren faculties different from yours? No, my brethren and sisters; you have the very same reasoning powers that they possess, but you have allowed your farm or business to absorb all your time and energies.",
