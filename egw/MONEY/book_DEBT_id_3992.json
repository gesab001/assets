    "word": "\\n     There is a great work to be done, and individual workers can accomplish more by laboring in a humble way than by incurring great expense. There may be times when broader efforts may be in the order of God. If churches and halls are opened to any of the laborers, and there is a desire to hear, they should embrace the opportunity and do the best they can. But we have no great men among us, and none need try to make themselves what they are not, remarkable men. It is not wisdom for a single individual to strike out as though he had some great talent, as though he were a Moody or a Sankey, and make a great outlay of means. Our laborers must learn to use means prudently, not only in their efforts to advance the cause of truth, but in their own home expenses. They should place their families where they can be cared for with as little expense as possible. Donations and bequests do not come to our people as they do to others denominations; and those who have not educated themselves to live within their means will surely have to do this now or engage in some other employment. Their habits must be frugal. They must not expend money for things that are not absolutely necessary. Economy must be the rule of every laborer. If he has not economical habits he must learn the lesson at once. All should learn how to keep accounts. Some neglect this work as nonessential; but this is wrong. All expenses should be accurately stated. This is something that many of our workers will have to learn.",
