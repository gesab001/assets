    "word": "\\n     With the knowledge of this warning, with the understanding that this curse is hanging over the souls of those who violate the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, how is it that we have not shown greater interest, earnestness, and zeal in giving to the world the warning of the third angel's message? With such momentous events before us,--events which will decide the destiny of the world,--how is it that we have been so indifferent, so selfish, so engrossed in the things of this world? Have we entirely separated from Christ? Has the truth become too plain, too pointed, too close in its application to our souls? and like the disciples of old, have we turned from Christ, choosing rather the weak and beggarly elements of the world? How many spend money for the gratification of self, with no thought of the souls that are perishing without a knowledge of Jesus and the truth! How long shall this state of indifference continue? How long shall it be before those who profess to believe the present truth, will come into right relation with God? We must have living faith, which works by love, and purifies the soul. How ready are many to indulge self, how reluctant to do anything for those who are perishing for the bread of life! Let no one claim to be a member of the royal family above, unless he can show that he has a holy pedigree,--that he is a partaker of the divine nature.",
