    "word": "\\n \\n                        A Warning Against Centralization. \\n\\n     Christ embraced the world in His missionary work, and the Lord has shown me by revelation that it is not His plan for large centers to be made, for large institutions to be established, and for money to be gathered from all parts of the world to support these large institutions. Plants are to be made in many places. First one and then another part of the vineyard is to be entered, until all has been cultivated. Efforts are to be put forth first wherever the need is greatest. But we can not carry on this aggressive warfare, and at the same time make an extravagant outlay of means in a few places.",
