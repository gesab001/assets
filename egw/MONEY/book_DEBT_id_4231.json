    "word": "\\n     Seek conversion of body, soul, and spirit. Unfold your napkin, and begin to trade with your Lord's goods. In so doing, you will gain other talents. Every soul intrusted with talents is to use them to benefit others. Who in the great day of final reckoning will say, \\\"I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine\\\"? To such the Lord will say, \\\"Thou wicked and slothful servant: . . . thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\\\"",
