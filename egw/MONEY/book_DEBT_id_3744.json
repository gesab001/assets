    "word": "\\n     We are now in a special period of the earth's history. Let every one look unto Jesus and copy the example that He has given us. Means must come into the work just now when doors stand open on every side, and the voice is heard, \\\"Come over and help us.\\\" Shall the higher classes that are now interested be left without light, because it takes money to work in the large cities? The higher class halls are very expensive; the coal bill to heat a house or hall in winter is large: but shall lands be left unsold; shall the houses which could be sold beside the one we live in be retained? Shall it be left until the sweet voice of Mercy is no longer heard, and the door is shut? Now, we are to let our light shine forth to the world, opening the way.",
