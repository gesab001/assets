    "word": "Chap. 37 - Study And Labor\n\n\nThose who recognize science in\nthe humblest work will see in it\nnobility and beauty, and will\ntake pleasure in performing it\nwith faithfulness and efficiency.\n\nThe Dignity Of Labor\n\n     Notwithstanding all that has been said and written regarding the dignity of manual labor, the feeling prevails that it is degrading. Popular opinion has, in many minds, changed the order of things, and men have come to think that it is not fitting for a man who works with his hands to take his place among gentlemen. Men work hard to obtain money; and having gained wealth, they suppose that their money will make their sons gentlemen. But many such fail to train their sons as they themselves were trained, to hard, useful labor. Their sons spend the money earned by the labor of others, without understanding its value. Thus they misuse a talent that the Lord designed should accomplish much good.",
