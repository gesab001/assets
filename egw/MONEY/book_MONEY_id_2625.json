    "word": "Ellen White Urges Material Support of the Beldens--I thought that I had given special direction that Brother [S.T.] Belden was to receive two dollars a week from the Conference, and a good-sized box of flour and rice and other groceries every now and then. I have not heard from Brother and Sister Belden since coming to America, till a day or two ago, and I find that they have not received any money nor any groceries. Is this right? Who did you suppose was taking care of Brother and Sister Belden?",
