    "word": "There are those who with all the light of the Word of God will not obey his directions. They follow their own tastes and do as they please. These give the wrong example to the youth, and to those who have newly come to the truth, who have made it a practice to copy every new style of dress in trimmings that take time and money, and there is little difference between their apparel and that of the worldling. Let our sisters conscientiously heed the Word of God for themselves. Do not begin the work of reform for others until you do; for you will have no success; you can not possibly change the heart. The working of the spirit of God inwardly will show a change of dress outwardly. Those who venture to disobey the plainest statements of inspiration will not hear and receive, and no human efforts made will avail to bring these idolaters to a plain, unadorned, simple, neat proper dress, that does not in any way make them odd or singular. They will continue to expose themselves by hanging out their colors to the world.",
