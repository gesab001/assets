    "word": "\\n     As Christ took upon Him this work, He saw all it would bring,--His betrayal (because of envy, pride, and love of money) by a professed follower, His trial in the judgment-hall, the scourging, the cruel death. He had led the children of Israel from Egyptian bondage into the land of Canaan. He had now come to lead them from spiritual bondage into the city of God. But they rejected Him, and delivered Him up to death. He came to His vineyard to receive the fruit thereof, but those who should have welcomed Him, said, \\\"This is the Heir; come, let us kill Him, and let us seize on His inheritance.\\\"",
