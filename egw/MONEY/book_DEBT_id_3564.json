    "word": "\\n     We should now feel the responsibility of labouring with intense earnestness to impart to others the light we have received. We cannot be too much in earnest. Even those who have felt much have not felt enough. They must still feel more deeply. The heart of God is moved. Souls are very precious in His sight. It was for this world that Christ wept in agony; for this world He was crucified. He desires to see those who have had great light flashing that light upon the pathway of their fellow-men. One soul is of more value to heaven than a whole world of property, houses, lands, or money. \\n                                                                -\\n",
