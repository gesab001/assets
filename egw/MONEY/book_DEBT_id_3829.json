    "word": "\\n     We are living in solemn times. The world is to be warned. Workers are needed. The money God has entrusted to men of the world, is needed. The truth is to be taken to these men, that they may see the duty the Lord has placed on them. Those belonging to the class called moneyed men have been neglected. God says, \\\"Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that My house may be filled.\\\"",
