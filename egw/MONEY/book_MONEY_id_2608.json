    "word": "Give the Wealthy the Privilege of Assisting God's Work.--There are laymen who can do more in a quiet way than can the ministers. In our missions an interest may be awakened in the hearts of wealthy men who have the means \n\n\n                                    -201- \n\nto assist. Give them the privilege of helping if they will. Let them be asked. They have the Lord's money in their hands. If anything can arouse them to place that money where it can do good, let it be done. It will prove a blessing to their souls. What is done for other missions, who bear not the message of the seal of the living God, we may make efforts, more than we have made, to have done for us. God is warning the church of her fearful responsibility. Let means be gathered by wise, judicious men, from believers and unbelievers, for our school, for our churches, for our health institutions, for our medical missionary enterprises.--Manuscript 83, 1897, p. 7.
