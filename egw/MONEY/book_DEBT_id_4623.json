    "word": "\\n     On the books of heaven, the liquor-dealer is charged with the sins that those to whom he sold liquor were led to commit while under its influence. Look at the drunkard, you who place the bottle to your neighbor's lips. Look well at your work. That man gave you money, and in return you gave him that which placed him lower than the beasts. The luster has gone from his eye; his brain is paralyzed; and his muscles left without control. Reeling from side to side, he staggers along the street,--a specimen of your handiwork. If drunkenness were not so common, the indignation of the bystanders would be excited, and steps would be taken to stop the sale of liquor.",
