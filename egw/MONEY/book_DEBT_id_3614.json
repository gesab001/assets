    "word": "\\n     The worldly treasure is a lodestone to hold the thoughts and control the judgment. There are great pecuniary advantages to be gained by investing means in various worldly enterprises; and the great majority of Christian professors press on in this path. They pursue their own ends as eagerly as if to gain the world would entitle them to eternal life. They selfishly waste the substance entrusted to them, expending money needlessly for the gratification of pride. Worldly requirements,--eating, dressing, recreation, the embellishment of their houses,--use up their means. And when their tithes and offerings are called for, and their energies are needed in work for their fellow-men, they withhold from God this proof of a love that He is every way worthy to receive; for the vital energies and the impulses of the soul have been exhausted in the struggle after worldly gain.",
