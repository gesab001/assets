    "word": "\\n     In the parable of the talents we have two classes brought to view. One class is represented by the diligent servant, and the other by the wicked and slothful servant. They had both been intrusted with their Lord's money. One went to work with earnestness, seeking opportunities to use his intrusted gift in such a way that others would be blessed and benefited. He does not live simply to please himself, to gratify selfish desires, to delight in pleasure parties and in places of amusement, seeking for the gratification of his fleshly lusts, as though this were the object of life; but he thinks soberly, and remembers that his religious life is short. He says, \\\"I have but a short period in which to work; and do the best I can, it is but little that I can do for him who has died for me. I must make the most of my precious time, and see if I cannot by earnest, prayerful effort, lead the steps of some wandering soul from sin to righteousness, that he too may use his intrusted talents for the Master whom I love. No soul with whom I am brought in contact must charge me in the judgment with neglect and indifference as to his salvation.\\\"",
