    "word": "\\n     There are among us poor persons who need not have been thus if they had manifested wise forethought and careful Bible economy when they had opportunity and ability to earn wages. But they spent all as fast as it came, indulging in things they might have done without, and lacking nothing for their own comfort. Their desire to dress as richly as their relatives or friends, the desire to gratify their fancy so to provide for their tables as to make a good showing before friends or relatives who love not the truth, makes them very liberal to themselves, which results in their really doing injustice to themselves, to their families, and those whose capital they are using. Many need not be poor if they were self-denying and economical. When in possession of health, they should improve the opportunity when money comes in, to practice economy and lay by a certain sum weekly, resolving not to touch it even if for some meals they were obliged to eat salt and potatoes, or porridge and bread. This self-denial would be of the greatest advantage to the health. And if wages were low, or money scarce, it would be a gratification to know that there was something to fall back upon.",
