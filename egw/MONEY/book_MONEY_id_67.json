    "word": "It is peace that you need\u2014Heaven\u2019s forgiveness and peace and love in the soul. Money cannot buy it, intellect cannot procure it, wisdom cannot attain to it; you can never hope, by your own efforts, to secure it. But God offers it to you as a gift, \u201cwithout money and without price.\u201d Isaiah 55:1. It is yours if you will but reach out your hand and grasp it. The Lord says, \u201cThough your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\u201d Isaiah 1:18. \u201cA new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.\u201d Ezekiel 36:26.",
