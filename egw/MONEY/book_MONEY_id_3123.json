    "word": "I have this afternoon received a letter in response to the one written to Smouse, that we could have the use of the money loaned to me for one year longer, but as it was given for only one year, I had better renew the notes. He would let me have the money for seven percent although he could get more, but as it is to be used in the cause he was satisfied with it; and he says at the end of another year, he can extend the time, he thinks, if I wish. \n                                                              Mother.",
