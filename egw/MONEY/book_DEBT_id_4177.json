    "word": "\\n\\nJuly 13, 1897 God's Holy Sabbath.\\n-\\nBy Mrs E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     God's holy Sabbath is not to be used to obtain worldly advantages. But with too many, the world is an idol. They place worldly principles and worldly advantages before the Lord God of Hosts. They worship money. Before the heavenly universe, before the worlds unfallen, and before their fellow men, they show that in their eyes, gain is godliness. They accept fables invented to turn men from truth and righteousness. By choosing the world and its attractions, they divorce themselves from God.",
