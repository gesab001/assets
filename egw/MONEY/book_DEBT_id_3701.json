    "word": "\\n     God calls upon us to push the triumphs of the cross in Australia. New fields are opening. For want of workers and money the work has been hindered; but it must be hindered no longer. Of all countries, Australia most resembles America. All classes of people are there. And the warning message has not been presented and rejected. There are thousands of honest souls praying for light. God's watchmen are to stand on the walls of Zion, and to give the warning, \\\"The morning cometh, and also the night,\\\"--the night wherein no man can work. While the angels are holding the four winds, the message is to enter every field in Australia as fast as possible.",
