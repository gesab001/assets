    "word": "\\n     We want to say to you that God has the richest blessings to impart to his children, but no one can go to heaven on a casual faith. Many talk of faith, but it is only a lifeless faith. You must have faith that will claim Jesus as your Saviour today, that rests in the promises of God because they are the promises of God. You must be able to plant your feet on the eternal Rock, on the word of the great I AM. Brethren, there is light for us; there is light for the people of God, \\\"and the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\\\" The reason men do not understand is because they fasten themselves in a position of questioning and doubt. They do not cultivate faith. If God gives light, you must walk in the light, and follow the light. Light is flashing from the throne of God, and what is this for?--It is that a people may be prepared to stand in the day of God. You who have devoted time and money to the adornment of your apparel and to the decoration of your homes, I would ask you, \\\"Is Christ formed within you the hope of glory?\\\" It is too late in the day to be taken up with the frivolous things of the world,--too late for any superficial work to be done. It is too late in the day to cry out against men for manifesting too much earnestness in the service of God; to say, \\\"You are excited; you are too intense, too positive.\\\" It is too late to caution your brethren in studying the Bible for themselves, because they may be deceived by errors. We know falsehoods are coming in like a swift current, and that is just the reason why we want every ray of light that God has for us, that we may be able to stand amid the perils of the last days. Brethren, the Lord is coming! and it is time to lift up your \\\"voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\\\"",
