    "word": "\\n     Christ is to be our pattern and example in all things, and if we follow his example, we shall avoid following the spendthrifts, whose example is so contagious to both young and old. We should make it a rule to bind about our wants, remembering that every penny belongs to the Lord, to be used not for wantonness, not for display, not in extravagance; for this would be an abuse of the Lord's goods, but for actual necessities. There are obligations to the poor and needy laid upon us, and to spend money simply for the gratification of some extravagant taste is not in God's order; for it prohibits us from doing good to those who are in need. Those in moderate circumstances are to bind about their wants, that they may also give out their talents to the exchangers, and those who have been blessed with large talents, who have abundance, should lay upon themselves the same restrictions, and guard against the needless expenditure of means for selfish gratification. The Lord has made them stewards of his means, and he designs that they should bless the needy, care for the poor, help the widow and the orphan, and send the light of the truth to those who sit in darkness.",
