    "word": "\\n     Satan deals more guardedly with men than he did with the world's Redeemer in the wilderness of temptation. He lost his case, and retreated from the field of conflict a conquered foe. He does not approach men with a demand for homage by outward worship. All he asks of man is to be dazzled and allured by the presentation of worldly attractions which will, if he succeeds in obtaining them, engage the mind and affections, and lessen the value of heavenly things. All he wants of man is to fall under the influence of his deceptive power, to love the world, to love rank, position, and money, and to place his affections on the things of this world. If he secures this, he gains all that he failed to gain when in conflict with the Son of God.",
