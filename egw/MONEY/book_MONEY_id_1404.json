    "word": "When the master comes to reckon with his servants, the unwise servants will acknowledge with confusion: \"I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed; and I was afraid [Afraid of what? That the lord would claim some portion of the small talent entrusted to them], and went \n                                                                           666\nand hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.\" His lord will answer: \"Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed; thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming, I should have received mine own with usury. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"",
