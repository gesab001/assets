    "word": "\\n     I appeal to all who believe the truth, to all who can assist us in any line. Give us your help to advance the work just now. We need workers, and we need money; for there is a close relation between money and missions. You know something of what has already been accomplished in the different lines of our work. We have moved out by faith and have made large advancement, because we saw what needed to be done, what God was calling upon us to do, and we dared not hesitate. But we have not done the half of that which should be done. We are not yet on vantage-ground. There is a great work before us. All about us are souls longing for light and truth, and how are they to be reached?",
