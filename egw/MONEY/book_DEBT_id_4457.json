    "word": "\\n     Jacob was anxiously awaiting the return of his sons, and on their arrival the whole encampment gathered eagerly around them as they related to their father all that had transpired. Alarm and apprehension filled every heart. One of their number was imprisoned in a strange land as a pledge for the appearance there of the youngest and now the favorite son of the grief-stricken patriarch. There was something mysterious in the conduct of the governor of Egypt, and this mystery was increased in their minds when, as they emptied their sacks, each was found to contain the owner's bag of money at its mouth. In his distress the aged father exclaimed, \\\"Me have ye bereaved of my children; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.\\\" Reuben answered, \\\"Slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand and I will bring him to thee again.\\\" This rash speech did not relieve the mind of Jacob. His answer was, \\\"My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If mischief befall him by the way in which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\\\" \\n                                                                -\\n",
