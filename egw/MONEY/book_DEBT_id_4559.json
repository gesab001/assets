    "word": "\\n     What true satisfaction can persons have who load their bodies with costly jewels, while there are thousands destitute, shivering in their nakedness, crying to God in their hunger and distress! Oh, that those who deck themselves with jewels, and make idols of themselves, might see how they appear in the eyes of their Creator! Oh, that they might realize how the Saviour, who has died for them, looks upon them, witnessing every extravagance, and contrasting it with the destitution of the poor, who cry unto him, and who cry not in vain! Not one who decks himself with jewels and costly array will stand before God guiltless. No one can turn from the truth, violate justice, give up integrity, neglect the poor, and yet flatter himself that he has not forsaken God. All idolatry of self dishonors God, and he who dishonors God fails to benefit humanity. The eternal principles of right and wrong are violated. Needless expenditure of means, indulgence in extravagances, the putting on of gaudy trappings, and decking the body with flashing jewels, is an evidence that the soul has turned from God to self, and at the last day the poor will rise up in judgment and condemn those who have lived for the gratification of selfish desires. The sentence will be passed that, while many were in nakedness and starvation, the rich sinners were squandering money to gratify pride and ambition, and by so doing degraded themselves.",
