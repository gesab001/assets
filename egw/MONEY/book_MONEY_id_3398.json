    "word": "What self denial have our churches as a whole manifested? They may have given donations as a whole in money, but have withheld themselves. The heavenly agencies are waiting to cooperate with human agencies in a grand work of reflecting light to the world. Wherever there is even one soul converted on earth, there is a response of joy circulated through-heaven. Whenever one soul is snatched from Satan's hand and given as a trophy to Jesus Christ, there is joy in the presence of God, Jesus Christ and Holy angels, because the lost is found. I send my appeal to the churches to \"Arise, shine, for the light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" \"Ye have not,\" said Christ, \"chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whosoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.\"",
