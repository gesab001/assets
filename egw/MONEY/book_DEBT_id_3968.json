    "word": "\\n     The Lord has paid an infinite price for Sr. M. She belongs to him and should do his work and should honor and glorify his name in the earth. The Master is saying to her, \\\"Follow me. There are souls to save for whom I gave my life,--souls more precious than fine gold, even the golden wedge of Ophir.\\\" Here is something of permanent value. As a servant of Jesus, she can trade on her intrusted capital; she can put his money out to the exchangers. She can employ her power of intellect in making known to others the matchless depth of a Saviour's love; and when the shadows of evening begin to enshroud us, her life-work will not be seen to have been on the losing side. The life and its work stand daguerreotyped in heaven, and the close of the day is the proof of the picture. When the day of life is over, we can see and estimate human character at its true worth. We hope to meet this sister when the people of God shall be gathered around the great white throne, with many souls saved through her instrumentality to shine as stars in her crown of glory. \\\"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.\\\"",
