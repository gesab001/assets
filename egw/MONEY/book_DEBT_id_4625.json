    "word": "\\n     As Christ took upon Him this work, He saw all that it would bring,--His betrayal, because of envy, pride, and the love of money; His trial in the judgment hall, the scourging, the cruel death. He had led the children of Israel from Egyptian bondage into the land of Canaan. He had come now to lead them from spiritual bondage into the City of God. But they rejected Him, and delivered Him up to death. He came to His vineyard to receive the fruit thereof, but those who should have welcomed Him, said, \\\"This is the heir; come, let us kill Him, and let us seize on His inheritance.\\\"",
