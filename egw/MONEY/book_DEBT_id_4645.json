    "word": "\\n     How much means is expended for things that are mere idols, things that engross time and thought and strength, that should be put to a higher use. How much money is wasted on expensive houses and furniture, on selfish pleasures, luxuries, and unwholesome food. How much is squandered on gifts that benefit no one. For things that are needless, often harmful, professed Christians today are spending more, many times more, than they spend in seeking to rescue souls from the tempter.",
