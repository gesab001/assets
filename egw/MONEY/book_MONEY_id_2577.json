    "word": "It is of no use for men to purchase large volumes of history, supposing that by studying these they can gain great advantage in learning how to reach the people at this stage of the earth's history. As I see the shelves piled up with ancient histories and other books that are never looked into, I think, Why spend your money for that which is not bread? We do not need ancient lore to tell us the things we must know now, just now.--Letter 164, 1899, p. 8. (To J. E. and Emma White, October 20, 1899.)",
