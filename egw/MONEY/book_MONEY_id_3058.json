    "word": "When over in Oregon, Elder Loughborough made an appeal to the conference in Upper Columbia that they should donate to that conference. The conference needed it very much. The power of the Spirit of God circulated through that meeting. It was all light in the Lord, and they were so lifted up that they said they would do it. After that meeting passed, I do not know how it came in, whether somebody proposed it to them or not, but they said, We need all this money in our conference. I do not know who put it \n\n\n                                    -167- \n\ninto their minds, but it worked just like leaven.
