    "word": "\\n     If Christ is to you as a valuable treasure, if you find in him your greatest satisfaction, if he is prized and cherished above all others, if you regard everything else as loss that you may win him, you are eating of his flesh and drinking of his blood, and are becoming conformed to his image. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness will be filled. The invitation is: \\\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me; and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.\\\"",
