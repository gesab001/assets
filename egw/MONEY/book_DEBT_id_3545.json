    "word": "\\n     \\\"Many who have been educated in our schools are heedless. They do a little somewhere else, but they show they have not been educated for practical work. Students should remember that the first interest is to make themselves practical, all-round, useful men and women, who in an emergency can do the work necessary to be done. When students are given this kind of education, it will not be necessary to spend money to transport men thousands of miles to plan schools, meeting-houses, and colleges. Students should be encouraged to combine mental and physical labor. The physical powers should be developed in proportion to the mental faculties. This is essential for an all-round education. They will then be at home in any place. They should be prepared to teach others how to build, how to cultivate the soil. A man may have a brilliant mind, he may be quick to catch ideas; but this is of little value to him and to others if he has no knowledge of practical work, if he does not know how to put his ideas into execution. Such a one is only half educated.",
