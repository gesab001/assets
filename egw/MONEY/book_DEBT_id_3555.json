    "word": "\\n     \\\"Let every mother teach her children lessons in self-denial. O, how much money we waste on useless articles in the house, on ruffles and fancy dress, and on candies and other articles we do not need! Parents, teach your children that it is wrong to use God's money in self-gratification. Tell them of the poor colored people, and their needs, and encourage them to save their pennies wherever possible to be used in missionary work. They will gain rich experiences through the practice of self-denial, and such lessons will often keep them from acquiring habits of intemperance.",
