    "word": "\\n     Some of the brethren who are intrusted with the larger talents, have failed to improve upon them as they should have done. Some have talents of influence, some have talents of means, and others have both talents of influence and money. Upon such, rest weighty responsibilities. We profess to be servants of Jesus Christ. As servants, to us is committed a work. It is not our own means intrusted to us for investment. Were it ours, we might study our pleasure in its use. The capital is the Lord's. We are responsible for its use or abuse. If we bury our talents of influence or money in the earth, and allow them to lie dormant, withholding them from his cause, we shall be condemned when the Master comes to reckon with us, and to require his own, not ours, with usury. He has purchased us with his own sufferings and blood, to secure from us willing servitude; yet we withhold from him that which is his own. There is a failure upon the part of ministers and people. They withhold from God. They do not use their talents of influence and means to the glory of God. Ministers have not interested themselves in the prosperity of the Review as was their duty. Here is an opportunity to speak to thousands. Those engaged in active labor in the gospel field should understand that all are interested in their mission. They should feel it a privilege and duty to report their meetings, and communicate matters of interest, which would be for the encouragement of God's people scattered abroad.",
