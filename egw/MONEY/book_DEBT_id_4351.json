    "word": "\\n     All that we have is lent us by God, to be used in his service. Were this more faithfully remembered, the selfishness which exists in so many hearts would be uprooted. But men refuse to give themselves to God. They forget that they have been bought with the blood of his only begotten Son; forget that they are indebted to him for every breath they breathe, for every dollar they possess. They use his money in building houses and adding acre to acre, solely for self-gratification. A just God will call them to account for misapplying his means, robbing his needy children of the necessaries of life in order to gratify their expensive tastes.",
