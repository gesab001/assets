    "word": "\\n     I advise my brethren and sisters to supply themselves the coming year with a home missionary box, wherein to deposit small bits of money for offerings to God, besides the regular tithe. Whenever there is an extra outlay for the gratification of the appetite, let an equal amount also be dropped into this savings-bank. The sisters should have a separate box; and for every needless expenditure for ribbons, ruffles, or ornaments of any kind, they should drop the same amount into this receptacle. Let parents prepare a box for each of their children, and after explaining the principle, leave them with their conscience and their God.",
