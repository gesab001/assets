    "word": "It is God who gives men power to get wealth, and he has ordained that this ability shall be regarded, not a means of gratifying self, but as a means of returning to God his own. With this object, it is no sin to use our capabilities in acquiring means. Money is to be earned by labor. Every youth should be educated in habits of industry. The Bible condemns no man for being rich, if he has acquired his riches honestly. It is the love of money that is the root of all evil. Wealth will prove a great blessing to its possessor if he realizes that it is not his own, but the Lord's, \n                                                                           10\nto be received with thankfulness, and with thankfulness returned to the Giver.",
