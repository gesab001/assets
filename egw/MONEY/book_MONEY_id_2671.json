    "word": "I have a request to make of you. Will you and your son visit Cooranbong and the place where the new sanitarium is being erected? May the Lord help you to help the men who are trying to do their best for the advancement of His cause. I am glad that you have invested some of the Lord's money in the sanitarium; but it will be a hard pull if our brethren and sisters in Australia do not do more than they have done. All should do their best. There should be no failure in the work of erecting the sanitarium on the land purchased for it.",
