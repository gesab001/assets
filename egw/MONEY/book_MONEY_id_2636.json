    "word": "A Word of Warning--I wish to speak decidedly. It is not the plan of God for His church to arrange at any time to make a grand display in our cities on any occasion. The Lord is displeased and dishonored when His entrusted means is used in such displays. I was permitted to have the recent display presented to me, and I was instructed that the money used thus should have been used to relieve the situation of some who have lent means to our institutions and now need that means. There are those who lent their means in good faith, but who, though they have called and pleaded for their money, have not been able to obtain it. Means borrowed from our people is to be returned when called for. I have borrowed money from my brethren and sisters to invest in the cause of God, but in every instance when this means has been called for, I have returned it. Often I had not the money in hand to do this, but I borrowed from someone else who wished to invest means in the work. Never have I failed to respond to a call for means that I had borrowed.--Ms. 162, 1905, pp. 1-3,7. (\"Our Work,\" Dec. 25, 1905.) \n\n\n                                 -231-",
