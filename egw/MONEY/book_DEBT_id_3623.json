    "word": "\\n\\nAugust 16, 1897 Following the Fashions.\\n-\\n\\n     No mother can afford to be in bondage to fashion. She is to train her children both for this life and for the life to come. In dress, mothers should not seek to make a display by needless ornamentation. The extra fringes, ribbons, laces, and ornaments are not necessary, and in the purchase of these things the money God has intrusted to us is turned away from its proper channel. It should flow into the treasury to supply the wants of God's cause.",
