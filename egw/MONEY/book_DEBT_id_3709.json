    "word": "\\n     Earnest efforts must be put forth to raise means to sustain our workers. God does not approve of sending men to the most difficult fields, and then not giving them enough to sustain them. God calls for equality. The workers in our institutions have no right to grasp for high wages while there are those laboring in the field who are suffering because there is not sufficient money in the treasury to sustain them.",
