    "word": "\\n \\n                               The Talent of Means. \\n\\n     Often the talent of means is laid away, hidden and unused. Money lying idle in banks is regarded by the Lord as a buried talent. God desires his followers to use the talent of means in his service. We should do our part in helping to carry forward the different lines of his work in all parts of the earth. A great work is to be done in the cities. Camp-meetings are to be held in many places. Those who have means may multiply their talent by using it to help support laborers in proclaiming the message of truth for this time. When through this instrumentality some one is led to accept the truth, our talent is doubled. And when this convert brings others into the truth, there is still further increase of talents. Those who double their talents in the work of saving souls, bring joy to the angels and call forth songs of praise from the heavenly choir.",
