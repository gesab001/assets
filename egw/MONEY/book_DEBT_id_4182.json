    "word": "\\n\\nOctober 12, 1897 Judas.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     The love of money grew in the heart of Judas with the exercise of his shrewd abilities. His practical financiering ability, if exercised, enlightened, and molded by the Holy Spirit, would have been of great service to the little church; and by the sanctification of his spirit, he would have had a clear insight, a correct discernment to appreciate heavenly things. But worldly policy plans were constantly cherished by Judas. There was no outbreaking sin on his part; but his sharp scheming, the selfish, parsimonious spirit that took possession of him, finally led him to sell his Lord for a small sum of money.",
