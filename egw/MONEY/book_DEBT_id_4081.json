    "word": "\\n     The unfallen universe looks with amazement upon the church-members who are not lively stones in the spiritual building. They see the covetousness which leads men to use God's intrusted means for their own gratification and enjoyment. They see the Lord's goods diverted from the true channel to please fancy, to gratify selfishness, because it is in the user's power to do it. If professed Christians lived by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, they would study the living oracles diligently, to know what is the will of God, to be doers of that will, irrespective of the world's standard. I am pained as I go into the homes of church-members, and see a multitude of pictures of themselves and their friends. How must the holy angels look upon these pictures adorning tables and mantel-pieces--pictures, pictures, everywhere? All these things cost money, sums taken from the treasury of God, from the capital which the Lord has given us to be used for his glory. But many have used it to please themselves. That money which they expended, whether it was a trifle or a large sum, was the Lord's money; for they themselves are Christ's purchased possession, and hence all they have belongs to him. All the means they have which is not necessary for their own comfort, should be put into the treasury of God, where it may be used to help the needy, to clothe the naked, and to assist in the various departments of the cause.",
