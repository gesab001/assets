    "word": "\\n     It is a sad thing when parents grow cold in their spiritual life, and, because of waning piety and want of devotion to God, they do not realize the high responsibility that devolves upon them to patiently and thoroughly train their children to keep the way of the Lord. Parents should not permit business cares, worldly customs and maxims, and fashion to have a controlling power over them, so that they neglect their children in babyhood, and fail to give their children proper instruction as they increase in years. Children need to be trained to do useful things, and their duties should be made as pleasant as possible. Parents should give them pleasant words of instruction and approval in useful work, but they could not do a worse evil to their children than to gratify their selfish desires, and leave them to follow their inclinations, thus giving them the impression that they are to live to please and amuse themselves. They should not be left to choose their own society, and be given money to spend according to their youthful wisdom. Children need parents who shall educate and discipline them, pruning away the natural and selfish tendencies. Children need parents who do not feel they have the right to govern their children by impulse and passion. Children are the heritage of the Lord, and unless parents give them such a training as will enable them to keep the way of the Lord, they neglect solemn duty. It is not the will or purpose of God that children shall become coarse, rough, uncourteous, disobedient, unthankful, unholy, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. The Scriptures state that this condition of society shall be a sign of the last days.",
