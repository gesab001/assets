    "word": "\\n     God would have us lift ourselves above the world. Jesus, the world's Redeemer, presents before us the eternal inheritance, the immortal riches, saying: \\\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.\\\" He takes the world from its position of boasted supremacy, placing it where it should be, subject to spiritual and eternal world. \\\"The love of money is the root of all evil,\\\" writes Paul. While money is of value if rightly used, it is not to be worshiped. Christ tells us that we are not to please ourselves, but that we must weed our lives of all vanities. He commands us to cultivate those attributes which will make every moment of our lives fragrant with good works.",
