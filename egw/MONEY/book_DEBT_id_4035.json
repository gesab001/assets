    "word": "\\n     There are today a large number who are not rendering to God the things that are God's. Opportunities, precious beyond price, of doing good to those around us, are being lost, because our eyes are not single to the glory of God. Satan has his devices to divert the mind to selfish purposes, so that the pressing needs of the cause, both for personal effort and means, shall be lost sight of. Not only your tithes, which belong to God by a special contract between him and his people, but your free-will offerings, are lost to his cause. One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars will be at some future period. The Lord tests his people with prosperity, to see if they will consider souls of more value than money, or houses, or lands. If you cling to the means with which he intrusts you, and do not consider the wants of the cause in its various branches as more important than any temporal gain, you do not give evidence that you appreciate the gift of God's dear Son, whose life was the price of your redemption. Souls are perishing in the very shadow of your own doors, and many of you are too indolent and indifferent to make an effort to bring them to a knowledge of the truth.",
