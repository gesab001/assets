    "word": "\\n     God help us to wipe out the terrible stain that is upon our work because of the neglect of the Southern field. Ten years ago the money that should have been sent to that field was withheld from it. What account will those give to God who have closed their eyes that they should not see and their ears that they should not hear. Our brethren should repent of that sin before God. We should enter the large cities in our country. Move out from Battle Creek, and make plants in other places. Lift up God's memorial,--the Sabbath of the Lord, in every city in this country. God will help you to do this. Then you will hear from his lips the words, \\\"Well done, good and faithful servant.\\\" The angelic hosts will help you in the work; as you impart to others, they will impart to you.",
