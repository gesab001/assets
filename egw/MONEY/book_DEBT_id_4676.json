    "word": "\\n     There are young men and young women who are very much opposed to order and discipline. They pay no heed to rules for rising and retiring at regular hours, but burn the midnight oil, and then lie in bed in the morning for one or two hours after daylight. At night they depend upon artificial light; for they regard the expenditure of money for artificial light as a trivial matter, and break up all the precious habits of order. They idle away their time in the morning hours, and thus make it necessary to stay up at night, and use fuel and light for which there must be extra expense, when, had they properly employed the early hours, there would have been no need of late hours. It is true they will make the excuse for their late hours, that they cannot get through their work. They will say, \\\"There are things that I must do before I can retire for the night.\\\" Would it not be well to break up the habit of turning the precious morning hours into night, and turning the hours of night into day by the use of artificial light?",
