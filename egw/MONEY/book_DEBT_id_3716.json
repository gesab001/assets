    "word": "\\n     I ask of you at the heart of the work in Battle Creek, while you have felt it a necessity to add to your facilities, expending large sums of money in various enterprises, have you considered that the Lord has in these countries a people who are just as precious to him as you are? All over the world there is great destitution of the knowledge of the truth. If the Lord is no respecter of persons, what, I inquire, is your responsibility, as churches and as individuals? Is it not to deny yourselves daily, to lift the cross, and follow Jesus where he has led the way? No means should be expended unnecessarily in dress, in houses, or in any other line; many supposed wants may be denied, and desired conveniences dispensed with, and God will bless you in your self-denial.",
