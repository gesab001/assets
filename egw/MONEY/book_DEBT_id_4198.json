We all desired to bring it to two hundred and fifty; and the students in the school, who had very little money to give, proposed to give a day's labor. This proposition was presented to the whole school; and it was arranged to suspend school the next day, that all the students might be free to give one day's labor to the cause of missions. The young men took a job of clearing, and the young women made one hundred and fifty pounds of granola. All united in the work, and worked with a will. When the results of this day's labor were turned into cash, we found that our united gifts had reached the desired amount,--two hundred and fifty dollars. We all wish it were a hundred times more; but we are glad to have had a part in doing this much for the cause we love. \\n                                                                -\\n",
