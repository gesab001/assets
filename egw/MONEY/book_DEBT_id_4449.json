    "word": "\\n     Jacob was greatly distressed. He knew not which way to turn. He carries his case to God, and intercedes for direction from him, and the Lord mercifully answers his prayer. \\\"Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\\\" Jacob now called his two wives to the field, where there could be a secret consultation without danger of being overhead, and said, \\\"I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.\\\" Jacob then related to them the dream given him of God, to leave Laban and go unto his kindred. Rachel and Leah replied, expressing their dissatisfaction with their father's proceedings, \\\"Is there yet any portion of inheritance for us in our father's house? Are we not counted of him as strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's; now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.\\\"",
