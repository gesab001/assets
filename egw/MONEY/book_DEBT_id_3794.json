    "word": "\\n     Money is not to be furnished for the carrying out of the work of the gospel in some mysterious way, and through unseen, mysterious agencies. God will not shower money from the windows of heaven to do his appointed work, to spread the truth in our world, and to save souls unto eternal life. He has made his people stewards of his means to be used for his glory in blessing humanity. He says, \\\"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\\\" God will not pour out gold and silver from the windows of heaven, but that which is of infinitely greater value. He says, \\\"I will pour out my Spirit upon you.\\\" The Holy Spirit of God will bless those who are faithful in the discharge of their duty. The Lord continues, \\\"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.\\\"",
