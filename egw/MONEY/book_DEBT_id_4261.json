    "word": "\\n     We have been chosen as laborers together with God. Then shall we not give the gospel plan our sympathy and co-operation? Shall we not, by denying self, advance God's enterprise of mercy? Shall we not refrain from spending money needlessly and selfishly, that we may bring to the Lord an offering in righteousness? Christ became poor, that through His poverty we might come into possession of eternal riches. Can we behold the suffering endured in our behalf by the Son of God without being filled with a desire to sacrifice something for Him? He left His home to die for us. Shall we not reveal to others His tenderness and compassion?",
