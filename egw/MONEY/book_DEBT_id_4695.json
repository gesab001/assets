    "word": "\\n     The idolatrous priests were alarmed as they saw that a new religion was gaining ground among the Egyptians, that the influence of the Israelites was making proselytes. The Egyptian priests were cunning. They ruled through craft and hypocrisy. They made gorgeous temples, and surrounded them with consecrated groves. Their temple courts were all that art and money could make them; their architecture was magnificent. But what was there within that enclosure? In the place of the God who made the heavens and the earth, they had chosen beasts as their objects of worship. By the priests and worshipers the living God, whom Joseph had magnified, was not regarded as an object of love and favor, but of intense hatred. They were like those whom the word of God describes, who say, \\\"Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us;\\\" \\\"for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.\\\"",
