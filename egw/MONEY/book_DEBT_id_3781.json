    "word": "\\n     Parents may learn a lesson from the history of Solomon. Their course of action in training their children for the duties of life, will remain as a living testimony of them when they are in their graves. There is no surer way to ruin children, both in body and soul, than to surround them with luxuries, provide them with plenty of money, allow them to frequent billiard tables, theaters, festivities, and other demoralizing scenes of amusement, to drink wine, and spend their time in delicate idleness. Reared in this way they do not feel the necessity of being able to support themselves, are devoid of energy in useful employment, avoiding systematic labor, having no respect for parents, or attachment for home. What will be the future of society and the State, if such men are chosen to offices of responsibility and trust? With no proper balance of conscience or principle, they will become the leaders and instigators of iniquity in high places, or the tools of other unprincipled and more daring men. The interests of community will not be held sacred by them; and they will sacrifice everything to their ruling desire.",
