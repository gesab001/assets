    "word": "\\n     Here also is given the parable of the talents. The man who hid his lord's money in the earth, was pronounced an unprofitable steward of his lord's goods, and the sentence was issued, \\\"Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\\\" And this is an illustration of the last general judgment, when each shall be dealt with according to the use he has made of his talents. The righteous alone will shine forth in the kingdom of God in that great decisive day when every character shall appear just as it is. They that have done good will have a part in the resurrection of life; they that have done evil will be awarded according to their works. The obedient and the disobedient decide the whole matter.",
