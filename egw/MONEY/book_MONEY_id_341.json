    "word": "Not to Be Supported in Idleness \n\n     The custom of supporting men and women in idleness by private gifts or church money encourages them in wrong habits. This course should be conscientiously avoided. Every man, woman, and child should be educated to practical, useful work. All should learn some trade. It may be tentmaking, it may be some other business, but all should be trained to use their powers to some purpose. And God is ready to increase the capabilities of all who will educate themselves to industrious habits. We are to be \"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" God will bless all who will guard their influence in this respect. --R. & H., March 13, 1900. \n                                                                           166",
