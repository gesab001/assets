    "word": "\\n     The mock trial of Christ shows how base the priesthood had become. The priests hired men to testify under oath to falsehoods. But truth came to the help of Christ. Pilate declared, \\\"I find in him no fault at all.\\\" Thus it was shown that the witness borne against the Saviour was false that the witnesses had been hired by men who cherished in their hearts the basest elements of corruption. It was God's design that those who delivered Jesus to death should hear the testimony of his innocence. \\\"I find no fault in him,\\\" Pilate declared. And Judas, throwing at the feet of the priests the money he had received for betraying Christ, cried out, \\\"I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.\\\"",
