    "word": "I have used the royalty on the foreign books to create a fund for the education of students. In the past I have allowed all the books sold in Europe to be used in Europe under the management of some one. This fund is now being used for the translation of my books into other languages. In the future I shall use these royalties in the work of entering new fields. The work in Europe was much farther advanced than the work in Australia. But when I had been in Melbourne a few months, Brother Lewis Johnson wrote me that they had in Europe a thousand dollars belonging to me as royalty. I wrote that I needed it to invest in the establishment of a school here in Australia. He wrote back pleading for a portion of this money: for they wished to educate promising young men for the ministry. I answered, If you need it so much, I will not \n\n\n                    -13- \n\nwithdraw it. Since then they have had all the royalties on the sale of foreign books, until about one year ago. Then I told them to use this money in translating my books into other languages, that the truth which the Lord has signified should go to every place, might be placed before the people.",
