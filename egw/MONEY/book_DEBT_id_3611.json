    "word": "\\n     In devoting time and money to the outward adorning and the gratification of perverted appetite, parents are cultivating vanity, selfishness, and lust in the children. Mothers complain of being so burdened with care and labour that they cannot take time patiently to instruct their little ones, and to sympathize with them in their disappointments and trials. Young hearts yearn for sympathy and tenderness, and if they do not obtain it from their parents, they will seek it from sources that may endanger both minds and morals. I have heard mothers refuse their children some innocent pleasure, for lack of time and thought, while their busy fingers and weary eyes were diligently engaged on some useless piece of adornment, something which could serve only to encourage vanity and extravagance in the children. Every act of the parents tells on the future of the children. \\\"As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined.\\\" And so as the children approach manhood and womanhood, these lessons bear fruit in pride and moral worthlessness. The parents deplore the children's faults, but are blind to the fact that they are but reaping the crop from seed of their own planting.",
