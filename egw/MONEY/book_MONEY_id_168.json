    "word": "Chap. 7 - Overburdened Housekeepers\n     With many, the all-absorbing object of life,\u2014that which justifies any expenditure or labor,\u2014is to appear in the latest style. Education, health, and comfort are sacrificed at the shrine of fashion. Even in the table arrangements, fashion and show exert their baleful influence. The healthful preparation of food becomes a secondary matter. The serving of a great variety of dishes absorbs time, money, and taxing labor, without accomplishing any good. It may be fashionable to have half a dozen courses at a meal, but the custom is ruinous to health. It is a fashion that sensible men and women should condemn, by both precept and example. Do have a little regard for the life of your cook. \u201cIs not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\u201d [Matthew 6:25.]",
