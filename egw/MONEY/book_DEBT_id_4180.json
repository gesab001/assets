    "word": "\\n\\nSeptember 14, 1897 The Great Controversy.\\n-\\nBy Mrs. E. G. White.\\n-\\n\\n     Through dissension and alienation, Satan reaps his harvest of souls. He leads those who are ambitious for money, ambitious to be first, too proud to be anything but the highest, to murmur and complain. These poor souls have not overcome their natural and cultivated tendencies, and they are deceived by Satan, and led into sin. Satan must deceive in order to lead away. \\\"In vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.\\\" Underhand work must be done; a deceptive influence must be exerted; pretenses must be set forth as truth; suspicion must be lulled to sleep. Satan clothes temptation and sin with the garments of righteousness, and by this deception he wins many to his side. Christ pronounced him a liar and a murderer. O that unwary souls would learn wisdom from Christ!",
