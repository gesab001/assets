    "word": "You are too self-indulgent. Deny yourself, take up the cross, and follow more closely in the Saviour's footsteps. Before you spend money, ask yourself, \"Can I not save this money? I will deny myself for Christ's sake. He gave His life to purchase eternal life for me. I must imitate His self-denial. It was by the sacrifice of Himself that the Saviour placed at my disposal the riches of His grace. He was under no compulsion, no obligation to give me His favor. Had He withheld all from me, it would have been no more than I deserved.\" . . .",
