    "word": "Moderation in Work \n\n     In order to gain a little money, many deliberately arrange their business matters so that it necessarily brings a great amount of hard work upon those laboring out of doors, and upon their families in the house. The bone, muscle, and brain of all are taxed to the utmost: a great amount of work is before them to be done, and the excuse is, they must accomplish just all that they possibly can, or there will be a loss, something will be wasted. Everything must be saved, let the result be what it may.",
