    "word": "\\n     The people had departed from the word of the Lord, and were following the inclination of their own hearts. And the rulers in Israel, the very ones who should have carried out the expressed will of God in dealing compassionately with the needy, who should have seen that no wrong was done, were themselves the worst oppressors. Nehemiah rebuked the rulers and the nobles for their unjust exaction. He set before them their course and its consequences, and their guilt in disobeying the command of God. He inquired, \\\"Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn; I pray you, let us leave off this usury. Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the Lord. And the people did according to this promise.\\\"",
