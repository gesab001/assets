    "word": "\\n     The sons of the wealthy are generally more difficult to restrain than the sons of poor men. Rich men's sons frequently say, by their deportment, \\\"You must be careful how you deal with me. I am a rich man's son, and shall do as I please.\\\" But in reality those students who feel that their importance is increased by the money and lands of their fathers, are continually developing the fact that they need an education in refinement and common politeness. Money, houses, and lands cannot purchase for them well developed, refined characters, which will raise the possessors in moral value in society, and elevate them in the estimation of God. It is not wealth nor standing that makes the man; it is moral worth.",
