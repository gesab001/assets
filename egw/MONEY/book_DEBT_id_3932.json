    "word": "\\n     Conformity to the world is a sin which is sapping the spirituality of our people, and seriously interfering with their usefulness. It is idle to proclaim the warning message to the world, while we deny it in the transactions of daily life. I have received letters of inquiry concerning some of these things. One brother states that a few years ago he had money to build a new house, but a call came for means to sustain our institutions. He felt that these institutions were the Lord's and he said to his wife, \\\"It is true that our house is old and decaying; we need a plain, healthful house; but if you will agree to it, I will send this money to meet the call for means, and we will live on as we have done. Our house is inconvenient, and not always comfortable, but Jesus had not where to lay his head. If the Lord of glory could leave the royal mansions for a life of toil and poverty, those for whom he suffered and died should not complain of hardships. We have far more than he had.\\\"",
