    "word": "\\n     A call now comes to us from Australasia. I am familiar with the needs of the work there. I am closely joined to that field by the most tender associations. By our experience while there, we know what it means to have a great work before us, and to be bound about for lack of means, while at the same time the word of the Lord is coming to us, saying, \\\"Annex new territory; lift up my standard of truth in new fields.\\\" In Australia we had not the facilities that we should have had to carry forward the work that the Lord directed us to do. Although some help came to us from America, an abundance of means was expended in the home field, while we were striving, studying, and praying, but bound about, unable to advance for lack of the money which we might have had, but which, instead of being sent to us, was used in America.",
