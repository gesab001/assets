{"word": "Amid Confusion of Last Days.--The words of Jesus Christ are spoken to us living down here in the close of this earth's history. \"When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.\" The nations are in unrest. Times of perplexity are upon us. The waves of the sea are roaring; men's hearts are failing them for fear and for expectation of those things that are coming upon the earth; but those who believe on the Son of God will hear His voice amid the storm, saying, \"It is I; be not afraid.\" . . . We see the world lying in wickedness and apostasy. Rebellion to the commandments of God seems almost universal. Amid the tumult of excitement with confusion in every place, there is a work to be done in the world.--Manuscript 44, 1900.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 18}
