{"word": "Morose Disposition Injures Teacher's Efficiency.-- Above all others, he who has the training of the youth should beware of indulging a morose or gloomy disposition; for this will cut him off from sympathy with his students, and without sympathy he cannot hope to benefit them. We should not darken our own path or the path of others with the shadow of our trials. We have a Saviour to whom to go, into whose pitying ear we may pour every complaint. We may leave all our cares and burdens with Him, and then our labor will not seem hard or our trials severe.--CT 233 (1913).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 617}
