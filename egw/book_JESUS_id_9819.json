{"word": "Disposition of a Christian\n     We are to realize that the divine Presence is constantly by our side. Christ has said, \\93Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\\94 Remember that He hears every unkind word, every harsh, cutting expression. Could you see Jesus standing by your side, would you speak such words? Then guard carefully every word and action. Walk in all lowliness of mind, cherishing a spirit of meekness and kindness. Live so that others may see that there is a difference between the disposition of a Christian and the disposition of those who make no claim to be Christ's followers.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PCP", "page": 27}
