    "word": "Chap. 60 - The Tract Societies\n\n     In my last vision I was pointed back to the rise and progress of the cause of present truth.

But when calls for help were made many came nobly forward and aided the cause by taking stock in the publishing work. The Lord was well pleased with the spirit of sacrifice manifested.",
