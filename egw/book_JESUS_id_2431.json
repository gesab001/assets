{"word": "Women  Can Reach a Class That Men Cannot Reach \n     Women Can Do a Work Men Cannot Do in the Homes. --Discreet and humble women can do a good work in explaining the truth to the people in their homes. The Word of God thus explained will do its leavening work, and through its influence whole families will be converted. . . . In the home circle, at your neighbor's fireside, at the bedside of the sick, in a quiet way you may read the Scriptures and speak a word for Jesus and the truth. Precious seed may thus be sown that will spring up and bring forth fruit after many days.--9T 128, 129 (1909).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 103}
