{"word": "Law of Service.--Christ's followers have been redeemed for service. Our Lord teaches that the true object of life is ministry. Christ Himself was a worker, and to all His followers He gives the law of service--service to God and to their fellowmen. Here Christ has presented to the world a higher conception of life than they had ever known. By living to minister for others, man is brought into connection with Christ. The law of service becomes the connecting link which binds us to God and to our fellowmen.--COL 326 (1900).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 566}
