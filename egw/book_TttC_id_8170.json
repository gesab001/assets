    "word": "The days will come when the righteous will be stirred to zeal for God because of the abounding iniquity. None but divine power can stay the arrogance of Satan united with evil men; but in the hour of the church's greatest danger most fervent prayer will be offered in her behalf by the faithful remnant, and God will hear and answer at the very time when the guilt of the transgressor has reached its height. He will \"avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them.\" They will be jealous for the honor of God. They will be zealous in prayer, and their faith will grow strong.",
