{"word": "Avoiding Long Committees at Night.--A minister cannot keep in the best spiritual frame of mind while he is called upon to settle little difficulties in the various churches. This is not his appointed work. \n                                                                           663\nGod desires to use every faculty of His chosen messengers. Their mind should not be wearied by long committee meetings at night; for God wants all their brain power to be used in proclaiming the gospel as it is in Christ Jesus.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 662}
