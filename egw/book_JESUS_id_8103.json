Human learning cannot qualify any one for the heavenly kingdom. The subjects of Christ's kingdom are not made thus by forms and ceremonies, or by long study of books. \"This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\" . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 189}
