{"word": "Exercise that faith which works by love and sanctifies the soul. Let none now make the Lord ashamed of them because of their unbelief. Sloth and despondency accomplish nothing. Entanglements in secular business are sometimes permitted by God in order to stir the sluggish faculties to more earnest action that He may honor faith by the bestowal of rich blessings. This is a means of advancing His work. Looking unto Jesus, not only as our example, but as the author and finisher of our faith, let us go forward, having confidence that He will supply strength for every duty.--RH, May 6, 1902.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 302}
