    "word": "The closer we keep to Christ, and the more meek and lowly and self-distrustful we are, the firmer will be our hold on Christ, and the greater will be our power, through Christ, to convert sinners; for it is not the human agent that moves the soul. Heavenly intelligences co-operate with the human agent and impress the truth upon the heart. Abiding in Christ we are able to exert an influence over others; but it is because of the presence of Him who says: \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Matthew 28:20. The power we have to overcome Satan is the result of Christ working in us to will and to do of His good pleasure. \n                                                                           400",
