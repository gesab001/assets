    "word": "The Church Qualified for Service \n\n     Christ has empowered His church to do the same work that He did during His ministry. Today He is the same compassionate physician that He was while on this earth. We should let the afflicted understand that in Him there is healing balm for every disease, restoring power for every infirmity. His disciples in this time are to pray for the sick as verily as His disciples of old prayed. And recoveries will follow, for \"the prayer of faith shall save the sick.\" James 5:15. We need the Holy Spirit's power, the calm assurance of faith that can claim God's promises. --Review and Herald, June 9, 1904. \n\n\n                                                   (211)",
