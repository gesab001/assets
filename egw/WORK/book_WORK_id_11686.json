Then our last efforts will have been made to work with Christ, and advance his kingdom. Some who have stood in the fore-front of the battle, zealously resisting incoming evil, fall at the post of duty; the living gaze sorrowfully at the fallen heroes, but there is no time to cease work. They must close up the ranks, seize the banner from the hand palsied by death, and with renewed energy vindicate the truth and the honor of Christ. As never before, resistance must be made against sin \u2014 against the powers of darkness. The time demands energetic and determined activity on the part of those who believe present truth. If the time seems long, wait for our Deliverer to come; if, bowed by affliction and worn with toil, we feel impatient to receive an honorable release from the warfare, let us remember \u2014 and let the remembrance check every murmur \u2014 that we are left on earth to encounter storms and conflicts, to perfect Christian character, to become better acquainted with God our Father, and Christ our elder Brother, and to work for the Master in winning many souls to Christ. \u201cThey that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever.\u201d [Daniel 12:3.] \u2014Vol. 1, p. 112.",
