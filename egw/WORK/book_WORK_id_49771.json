    "word": "The devil has been working for a year to obliterate these ideas--the whole of them. And it takes hard work to change their old opinions.

And we worked there for one week. It was after one week had passed away before there was a break and the power of God, like a tidal wave, rolled over that congregation. I tell you, it was to set men free; it was to point them to the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world.",
