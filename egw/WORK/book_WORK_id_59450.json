    "word": "It is the part of a medical missionary to minister to the needs of the soul as well as to the needs of the body. The precious truth of Christ's power to save, spoken in season, will give hope and courage, and may save both soul and body. The Lord waters and watches over the seed thus sown. The promises of the Bible, repeated to those who are sick and discouraged, will be the means of saving many souls. The Holy Spirit cooperates with the worker who labors in the fear and love of God. (79) God gives such workers wisdom and success.",
