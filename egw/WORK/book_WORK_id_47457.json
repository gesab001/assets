    "word": "MR No. 387 - Personal Evangelism\n\n     In the Spirit of Christ, with a heart all aglow with His love, seek to win the hearts of those in the family. Give faithful admonitions and instructions from the Word of God. There is appropriate and applicable scripture that needs to be presented, and to be presented in the love of Christ and in love for the souls for whom Christ has died. \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" But many souls have had no personal labor. Words of kindly instruction in the application of scriptures have not been spoken to them.",
