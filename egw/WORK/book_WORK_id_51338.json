    "word": "Elder Simpson pleads for someone to unite with him in his work. Elder Owen has been a great help to him here, but Elder Owen is appointed to act as Bible teacher in the Fernando school, and there seems to be no one else who can help Brother Simpson in his line of work. There are devoted men who can teach the Bible in the school, but there are very few who can work as Elder Owen can in evangelistic work in the cities. Someone else should be chosen to help in the college, that Elder Owen may be free to unite with Elder Simpson in evangelistic work in the large cities.",
