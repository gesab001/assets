    "word": "\u201cThe mass is a bad thing. God is opposed to it. It ought to be abolished, and I would that everywhere the supper of the gospel were established in its stead. But let none be torn from it by force. We must leave results to God. It is not we that must work, but his Word. `And why so?\u2019 you will ask. Because the hearts of men are not in my hand as clay in the hand of the potter. We have a right to speak, but none whatever to compel. Let us preach; the rest belongs to God. If I resort to force, what shall I gain? Grimace, fair appearances, cramped uniformity, and hypocrisy. But there will be no hearty sincerity, no faith, no love. Where these are wanting, all is wanting, and I would not give a \n190\nstraw for such a victory. God does more by the simple power of his Word than you and I and the whole world could effect by all our efforts put together. God arrests the heart, and that once taken, all is won.\u201d",
