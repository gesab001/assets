Farnsworth, \n                  from \"Elmshaven,\" Sanitarium, California.) \n\n\n     I have received many letters from you, and I wish to express my thanks to you for them. I shall not be able to write much to you in this mail. I have much writing to do before General Conference, and I have come up to the time for the Australian mail unfitted for letter-writing. Sometimes my head is too weary to be taxed further.",
