    "word": "Giving Wholehearted Service \n\n     The Lord would have teachers in the Sabbath school work who can give wholehearted service, who will increase their talent by exercise, and make improvement on what has already been attained. The Lord would have working Christians in His church; for the worker has fewer temptations than those who have little to do. Those who truly believe in Christ will become laborers together with God. They will be governed by His Spirit; their affections will be purified, their passions will be controlled, and precious fruits will appear in their lives for the glory of God; for those who truly believe in Christ will reflect light.--TSS 53.",
