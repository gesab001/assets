    "word": "Satan came to Adam and Eve with the suggestion that in forbidding them to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, God was defrauding them of rich blessings, of honor and exaltation that were theirs by right. They listened to him, accepted his suggestions, and fell. \n\n                                     -12- \n\nToday Satan is carrying forward zealously his work of temptation, and he will make many conquests over those who are not watching unto prayer.",
