    "word": "It is now urged that only one book at a time should have a place in the canvassing field, - that all the canvassers should work for the same book. I do not see the force or propriety of this. If the Lord has light for his people, who shall venture to put up barriers so that the light shall not reach them? One book is published at little expense, and is therefore sold cheaply; \n                                                                           655\nother works that present truths essential at this time, have involved greater expense; shall they therefore be kept from the people? Bible Readings is a good book to occupy its own place, but should not be permitted to crowd out other important works, which the people need. The presidents of our conferences have a duty to do, our board of directors should have something to say in this matter, that the different branches of the work of God may receive equal attention.",
