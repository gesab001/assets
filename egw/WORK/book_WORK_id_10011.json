    "word": "The apostle James saw that dangers would arise in presenting the subject of justification by faith, and he labored to show that genuine faith cannot exist without corresponding works. The experience of Abraham is presented. \"Seest thou,\" he says, \"how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?\" James 2:22. Thus genuine faith does a genuine work in the believer. Faith and obedience bring a solid, valuable experience.",
