    "word": "Man's capabilities and talents are all to be held in trust. They do not originate with the one who is commissioned to preach the gospel. These gifts are to be looked upon as coming from God. They are to be used as wholly His. They are to be consecrated to His service. To the one who does this, the Lord can give higher gifts. If he is called to do a work that demands self denial, the spirit of consecration and entire self-surrender leads him to deny self.",
