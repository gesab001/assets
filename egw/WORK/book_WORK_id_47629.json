    "word": "The Lord has put it into my mind to give the book on the parables [Christ's Object Lessons] to do a work which at this crisis should be done. The Lord has wrought upon the minds of the brethren to work up this matter nobly. Any changes in the school at Battle Creek at this time would be premature. You are now to tarry, and hold the fort. Do not do anything out of the Lord's order. Let the plan devised by the Lord be fully carried out. Do as your first work all that it is possible to do to free the school from the heavy debt upon it. This movement is in the order of God, and you will know from the great General of armies what is to be done next. Let the Lord devise and plan. This will be better than any human devising.",
