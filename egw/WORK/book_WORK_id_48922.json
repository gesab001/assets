    "word": "Harmony Among Brethren.--It is not the number that you gather into the truth, but it is the quality, the pith of those who take hold of the truth, that counts. In order for this work to go forward as God would have it, we want the Spirit of the Divine upon it. We want to see that God is attending us in all our efforts. Our object is not to put our mold upon the work and carry out our ideas, but it is to so present the truth that all who will take hold of it will feel that they have something to do, not that they are to lower the standard, but they must lift the truth.",
