    "word": "Wrong to Steal Away Confidence in Others.--Several weeks ago I was instructed by the Lord that Brother A was doing a work that God had not appointed him to do. This message I sent to the recent council held in Battle Creek. Brother B was not appointed of God to unite with Brother A in doing such a work. These brethren have not been instructed by the Lord to leave upon the minds of the workers in South Africa the impression that the Echo Publishing Company [Australian publishing house] was selfishly endeavoring to take unfair advantage of the South African brethren. Men must be very careful in regard to leaving upon the minds of their brethren the impression \n\n\n                                                123 \n\nthat the Lord's workers in a certain place are dealing unfairly and dishonestly. Such impressions mean a great deal. When some of our brethren accuse the brethren in charge of a publishing house, a reflection is cast upon the managers of the institution.--Lt 212, 1902.",
