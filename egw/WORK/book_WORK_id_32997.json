    "word": "Personal Effort in Connection With \n                       Camp Meetings \n\n\n     The work at our camp meetings should be conducted, not according to man's devising, but after the manner of Christ's working. The church members should be drawn out to labor. Angels of God will direct in the opening of fields nigh and afar off, that the work of warning the world may be quickly accomplished. God calls upon believers to obtain an experience in missionary work by branching out into new territory and working intelligently for the people in the byways. To those who will do this, openings for labor will come.",
