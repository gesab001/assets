    "word": "\"The one who is placed in the position of business manager,\" he said, \"must daily be managed by the Lord. He occupies a very important place and he must possess the necessary qualifications for the work. He should have dignity and knowledge, blended with a clear sense of how to use his authority. Christ must be revealed in his life. He must be a man who can give religious instruction and exert a spiritual influence. He must know how to deal with minds, and he must allow his own mind to be controlled by the Spirit. Wisdom is to come forth from his lips in words of encouragement to all with whom he is connected. He must know how to discern and correct mistakes. He must be a man who will harmonize with his fellow-workers, a man who possesses adaptability. He should be able to speak of the different points of our faith, as occasion requires. His words and acts should reveal justice, (130a) judgment, and the love of God. He who gave the Israelites instruction from the pillar of cloud, and led them through the wilderness into the promised land, is our leader today. We are under divine guidance, and if we are obedient to God's commands, we shall be in perfect safety, and will receive distinguished marks of His favor.",
