    "word": "Recently a letter was published in the Melbourne Age, from a New York correspondent, giving an account of the wonderful meeting held in Battle Creek on the occasion when so much jewelry was donated. And the work was said to have been done \n\n128. \n\nafter the reading of a vision given by Mrs. White, a prophetess, urging the people to sell and give away their property. How can you think I feel, to be at work here in this new field, and just as the interest is ripening off, souls deciding for the truth, to have some of the productions of Anna Phillips brought in, to be received and to go out as my testimony? Will my brethren please make no reference to the testimonies of Sister White in connection with Anna Phillips? In the name of the Lord I protest against this mixing up work, for it will result in making the testimonies God has given me responsible for the influence and effect of Anna Phillips' words. I beg my brethren just to come to the people with the evidence from the Bible, and not strengthen the opposition which is so strong against us, and is intensified by the falsehoods of Grant and Canright.",
