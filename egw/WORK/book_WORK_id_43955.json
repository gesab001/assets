    "word": "If ministers in New York wish to help the church, they can do so in no better way than to go out in new fields and labor to bring souls into the truth. When the church see that their ministers are all aglow with the spirit of the work, feeling deeply the force of the truth, and seeking to bring others to the knowledge of the truth, it will put new life and vigor in them. Their hearts will be stirred to do what they can to aid in the work. There is not a class of people in the world that are more willing to sacrifice of their means to advance the cause than Seventh-day Adventists.",
