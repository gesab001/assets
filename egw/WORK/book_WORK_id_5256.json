    "word": "We have none too many sanitariums. There is in our world a great field for true medical missionary work. Our sanitariums are to be as lights shining amid the moral darkness. In them the sick and suffering are to behold the miracle-working power of Christ as revealed in the lives of the workers. \"Let your light so shine before men,\" says Christ, \"that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:16. Let the lamp of light from the word of God shine forth unmistakably.",
