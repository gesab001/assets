    "word": "Judas was given every opportunity to receive Christ as his personal Saviour, but he refused this gift. In many respects he acted as Christ's disciple. He manifested an interest in His work, and in a certain sense believed on Him. But Christ read beneath the surface. He saw the true inwardness of the heart. He knew that Judas was not converted. John says, \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\" Judas had never received Christ; he was not a true son of God. He had not lost something once possessed. He had never experienced the soul cleansing, the change of character, that constitutes conversion.",
