    "word": "I hope you will never in any place you go act over the same. I am distressed when I reflect upon it. Your lack of respect and reverence were painful. We deserved something better of you. We felt a great relief when you left, for the spirit you carried with you was oppressive. I have not the least fellowship or sympathy with that spirit, for I believe it to be the spirit of darkness. May the Lord help you to see that you had climbed above your calling and the simplicity of good, humble religion. You were both self-righteous and self-sufficient, exalted too high in your own opinion. You have a work to do in governing your child, which you have sinfully neglected.",
