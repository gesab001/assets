    "word": "Those who, so far as it is possible, engage in the work of doing good to others, by giving practical demonstration of their interest in them, are not only relieving the ills of life in helping them to bear burdens, but are at the same time contributing largely to their own health of soul and body. Doing good is a work that benefits both giver and receiver. If you forget self in your interest for others, you gain a victory over your own infirmities. The pleasure of doing good animates the mind, and vibrates through \n103\nthe whole body. If thou clothe the naked, and \u201cbring the poor that are cast out to thy house,\u201d and \u201cdeal thy bread to the hungry,\u201d \u201cthen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily.\u201d",
