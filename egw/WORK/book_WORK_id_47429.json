    "word": "The gospel is not properly represented by the course Elder Franke has pursued. God does not want any such example given to his workers; for it is entirely contrary to Christ's example. If Elder Franke persists in following the course which he has followed in the past, he should not be sustained by the Conference. The means which he has drawn from the people and used so extravagantly would support three workmen in the field who would work with economy.--Letter 150, 1901, p. 1. (To Brother and Sister Haskell, October 2, 1901.)",
