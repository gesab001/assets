    "word": "While God was working in Daniel and his companions \u201cto will and to do of His good pleasure,\u201d they were working out their own salvation. Philippians 2:13. Herein is revealed the outworking of the divine principle of co-operation, without which no true success can be attained. Human effort avails nothing without divine power; and without human endeavor, divine effort is with many of no avail. To make God\u2019s grace our own, we must act our part. His grace is given to work in us to will and to do, but never as a substitute for our effort.   Prophets and Kings, pp. 479-487.76",
