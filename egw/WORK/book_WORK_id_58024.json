    "word": "I am more and more impressed that my work is in this country. We dare not leave the work in Australia and New Zealand at its present stage. You can see the way W.C.W. is situated, and I cannot consent for him to continue to do as he has done. If no one else sees the necessity of relieving the situation, I shall certainly bring decided influence to bear in reference to my son. I wish I could see so decided a reformation in Bro. Henry that I could regard with satisfaction the confidence you seem to repose in him. I know the spirit that has controlled the man in a large degree, and I am much depressed at the thought of your linking up with him as your companion to visit Europe. How many seeds of unbelief will be sown in regard to the messages God gives? How many twistings and turnings will his voice and influence give to the work, counter to the mind and will of God? I am not a little surprised, and not a little afraid for yourself. I do not feel that assurance in your case I would be glad to feel. I do not want you to err in judgment. I do not want you to displease God. I would not say one word to discourage you, but I must warn you. \n                                                                           1263",
