    "word": "I am pained at heart when I see those who claim to be Christians carry so little burden for souls. Oh, what can I say to those who are idle and careless and indifferent in regard to the work of the Master. Jesus has bought us with His own blood. Whatever may be our ability or calling, God has committed to us our individual responsibility, and to every man He has given His work. This work cannot be transferred to another. Individual effort is to be made to seek and save the lost. As he is God's workman, he is required to become more and more efficient, by practice better qualified to work the works of God, educated and trained in the science of spiritual husbandry.",
