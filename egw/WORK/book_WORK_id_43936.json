    "word": "Bro. Gage has cultivated an almost ungovernable propensity for sight-seeing and trips of pleasure. And time and expense are wasted to gratify his desire for pleasure \n                                                                           32\nexcursions. His selfish love of pleasure leads to the neglect of sacred duties. Bro. Gage loves to preach, but he has never taken up this work, feeling the woe upon him if he preach not the gospel. He frequently left his work in the Office which demanded his care, to comply with calls from some of his brethren in other churches. If he had felt the solemn sense of the work of God for this time, and gone forth, making God his trust, practicing self-denial, and lifting the cross of Christ, he would have accomplished good. But he frequently had so little sense of the holiness of the work, that he would improve the opportunity of visiting other churches, in making the occasion a scene of self-gratification, in short, a pleasure trip. What a contrast in the course pursued by the apostles, who went forth burdened with the word of life, and in the demonstration of the Spirit, preaching Christ crucified. They pointed out the living way through self-denial and the cross. They had fellowship with their Saviour in his sufferings, and their greatest desire was to know Christ Jesus, and him crucified. They considered not their own convenience, nor counted their lives dear unto themselves. They lived not to enjoy, but to do good, and save souls for whom Christ died.",
