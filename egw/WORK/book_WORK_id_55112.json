    "word": "Sunday, August 10, 1902, Elmshaven, St. Helena, California, EGW to her sister Mary \n\n\n     My dear sister Mary [Foss]: . . . Now, my sister, do not think that I have forgotten you; for I have not. You know that I have books to make. My last effort is a book on true education. The writing of this book has been very trying to me, but it is nearly finished. I am now completing the last chapter. This book will not have in it so much matter as there is in some of my larger works, but the instruction it contains is important. I feel the need of help from God continually. \n\n\n                               -44-",
