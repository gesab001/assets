    "word": "The ministerial evangelist who engages in the canvassing work is performing a service fully as important as that of preaching the gospel before a congregation Sabbath after Sabbath. God looks upon the faithful evangelistic canvasser with as much approval as He looks upon any faithful minister. Both workers have a light, and both are to shine in their respective spheres of influence. God calls upon every man to cooperate with the great Medical \n\n16. \n\nMissionary Worker, and to go forth into the highways and byways. Each man in his particular line of service, has a work to do for God. Such laborers, if converted, are true missionaries.",
