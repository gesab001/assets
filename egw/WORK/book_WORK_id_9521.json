    "word": "Removing Prejudice.--The instruction given to the patients in our sanitariums is not to be presented in the form of laws that must be obeyed. The word was spoken: \"Everything that can be done is to be done to bring the sick and afflicted to the way of truth and righteousness. Medical missionary work is one means of doing this. We do not know how much prejudice is removed as people are brought in contact with true medical missionary workers. As physicians and nurses strive to do for the suffering the work that Christ did when He was upon this earth, the truth for this time will find access to minds and hearts.\" . . .",
