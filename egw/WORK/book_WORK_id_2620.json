    "word": "Presidents to Select Helpers--At the Jackson meeting, Brother ----- says, \"I will take the Presidency of the Michigan Conference.\" And then I sat down before him and laid it out as plain and distinct as I was capable of, what the Lord would have the men in responsible positions do. They should select helpers.  He needed one right by his side; and if there were two or three that could work right in with him, and he not do the work, but try to educate them, it would be better, and they would thus be trained for the work.",
