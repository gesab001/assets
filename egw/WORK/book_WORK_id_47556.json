    "word": "We are altogether too narrow in our plans. We need to be broader minded. God wants us to carry out in our work for Him the principles of truth and righteousness. His work is to go forward in cities and towns and villages. What we need is a deeper understanding of the word of God. We need to keep the principles of that word in mind, that we may proclaim them in their purity.",
