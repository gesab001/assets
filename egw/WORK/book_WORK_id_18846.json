    "word": "That which will bless humanity is spiritual life. He who is in harmony with God, will constantly depend upon Him for strength. \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d It should be our life work to be constantly reaching forward to the perfection of Christian character, ever striving for conformity to the will of God. The efforts begun here will continue through eternity. The advancement made here will be ours when we enter upon the future life.",
