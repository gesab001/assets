    "word": "In the Pacific Press an objectionable class of work has been taken in,-- novels and story books, which absorbed the minds of those who handled them, diverting their attention from the word of God. Some of the workers have become so infatuated by this cheap literature that they are mentally inebriated. The introduction of this class of matter destroys the spirituality of the office. The Lord has instructed me that the practice of reading many story-books means death to spirituality.--Letter 140, 1901, pp. 1, 2. (\"To the Managers of our Publishing Houses,\" October 16, 1901.)",
