    "word": "Many are readily satisfied with offering the Lord trifling acts of service. Their Christianity is feeble. Christ gave Himself for sinners. With what anxiety for the salvation of souls we should be filled as we see human beings perishing in sin! These souls have been bought with a price.

Every one would be standing at his post of duty, working with heart and soul as a missionary of the cross of Christ. The Spirit of God would abide in the hearts of the laborers, and works of righteousness would be wrought. The workers would carry with them into their service the sympathies and prayers of an awakened church. Messages would come from lips touched with a live coal from the divine altar.

With one hand the workers would take hold of Christ, while with the other they would grasp sinners and draw them to Christ.",
