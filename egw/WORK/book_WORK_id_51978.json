    "word": "The humblest child of God may act a part in this grand work. They should have the privilege, even if it requires self-denial and self- sacrifice, to contribute according to their ability. The education of youth should be of a different order than that which has been in the past. The word of the Most High, who is infinite in wisdom, will, if carefully studied, become enlarged and continually enlarging in light and interest. The welfare of children and youth in all parts of the world demands far more in their interests and welfare than has been given them.",
