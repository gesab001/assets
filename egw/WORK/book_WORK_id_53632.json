    "word": "MR No. 1444 - Rebuke for Self-seeking and Self-exaltation; Warning Against Criticizing Church Leaders\n\n     (Written July 7, 1890, from Battle Creek, Michigan, to a layman in Fresno, California.) \n\n\n     The Lord, whose I am and whom I serve, has given me a message for you. You have thought much upon certain subjects which you deem of great importance, and have exercised your mind in order to bring your theories into logical shape so that you could present them to others; but the Lord has not been your guide in all this work. From books you have read you have conjured up ideas and high sounding words whose meaning you did not know but have searched out, and you have written and talked as though you knew much about the theories you advance, when in reality you knew little.",
