    "word": "The high and holy work set before God's workers is to love their fellow-workers, who are just as honest and righteous as they themselves, although they may be tried with fire. He requires them to put self out of sight, and with pure hearts and clean hands work earnestly to help those who are working in hard places, and who are worthy of help. This is the Christian service appointed us. And by doing it, we show to the world, which knows not the truth, the riches of God's goodness and mercy.",
