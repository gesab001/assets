    "word": "When ministers enter the desk, they should do so feeling their dependence upon God, that they may work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, and all the glory should be given to God; for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. This is the co-operation that God requires. What is the trouble that the flock of the Lord is sickly and ready to die? Why is it that spiritual food is not supplied? Are the ministers of the Lord eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God? Jesus says, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. . . . It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" My heart is drawn out to the hungry flock in Michigan, and you who have not fed on the living Bread, who have not drank of the healing streams of salvation, and do not know where to lead the flock of God that they may find refreshment, for Christ's sake, do not try to minister in the sacred desk, until you have an experience in the things of God. Jesus prayed, \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\" When the word of God is in the heart, it exerts a sanctifying influence over the character, and men are brought into harmony with God. If truth and light are in the heart, you will bring love and light and blessing to the churches. You will not be as shadows casting the gloom of unbelief and darkness upon the people. Jesus wants to take your hand, and lead you, and will you not give yourselves to him? Talk of what Jesus did, how he left his glory, and came to seek and to save that which was lost.",
