    "word": "When God grants us His protection, and says of us, \"Ye are labourers together with me,\" if you keep the way of the Lord you are safe in the midst of the greatest dangers. When Satan seeks to deceive the child of faith and trust, God lifts up a standard against the enemy in behalf of those who are conscientiously working in harmony with Him. The standard which He uplifts is His law. Those who work righteousness have an ever-present Friend to help them. In every time of need and trouble and perplexity He is near them. When they are tempted He presents Himself as their defense, saying, \"I will guide thee with Mine eye. I will deliver thee from perplexity, and be a covert for thee against the strife of tongues.\"",
