    "word": "Oh, I beseech those who are holding forth the word of life to present to all the necessity of individually searching the Scriptures for themselves that they may know the expressed will of God. There is need of a firmer, closer connection with God, and to all who have this connection there will \n\n\n                                   -199- \n\nbe imparted wisdom, caution, farseeing discernment, and executive ability which will make them far more efficient than are mere worldly businessmen. Let there be no blundering work; every soul must look deeper than the surface. God does not generally lay out in His revelations the minute transactions of life. His Word, the Guidebook, deals with great and elevated themes, opening up the principles which should underlie all our actions, and presenting them in language of such simplicity that all may comprehend them.",
