    "word": "From the case of Cornelius we may learn a lesson that we would do well to understand. The God of heaven sent His messengers to the earth to set in operation a train of circumstances that would bring Peter into connection with Cornelius, that Cornelius might learn the truth. It was with reluctance at every step that Peter undertook the duty laid upon him by divine command. When relating his experience, he does not defend his action on general principles, but as an exception, done because of divine revelation. And the \n\n\n                                   -329- \n\nresult was a surprise to him. When Cornelius had related to him his experience, and the words of the angel who had appeared to him in vision, Peter declared, \"Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.\" The conversion of Cornelius and his household was only the first fruits of a harvest to be gathered in from the world. From this home a widespread work of grace was carried on in a heathen city.",
