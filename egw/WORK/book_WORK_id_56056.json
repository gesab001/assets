    "word": "Those who come to the sanitarium on this hillside should see in the helpers of the institution the highest exemplification of true Christianity.

Their hearts should be drawn out in love for the salvation of those who have no hope. They should carry a burden of soul for the afflicted ones, praying with them to help them overcome the lust of appetite.",
