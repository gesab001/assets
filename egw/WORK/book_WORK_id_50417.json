    "word": "Go out, young men, and with persevering energy do something. Industry and economy will place you in possession of homes. Toil in the name of the Lord. Study, work in literary lines. Keep the physical and the mental machinery equally taxed. Give yourselves a chance for your life. I would say to students, teachers, physicians, ministers, that the health is preserved only by combining physical and mental labor.",
