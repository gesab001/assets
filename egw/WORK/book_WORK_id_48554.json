    "word": "There are hundreds and hundreds of ways in which a little is lost, and this makes a large loss in the end. If the little wastes are all thoroughly looked after, there will be some margin in the institution to work on. But many of the girls of California know not what economy means. They are not educated to save the little things. Girls go out to work, and they cook well if they can have the privilege of going to a large supply, and using freely and extravagantly the things provided. In the place of saving, of gathering up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost, much is lost that must be purchased again.",
