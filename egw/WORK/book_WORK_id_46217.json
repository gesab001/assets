    "word": "The prayer of Christ for His people, just before His humiliation and death, is as much unheeded as if it had never been made. The same spirit that controls the nations of the earth is working upon the minds of those who have had light. As the children of disobedience, irrespective of consequences, they act like the blind. They are drunken, but not with strong drink. They reveal [that] that which has allured and deceived them was an unholy ambition.",
