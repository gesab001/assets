THE INTEREST GREW AND DURING THE WINTER HE HELD SUNDAY NIGHT MEETINGS IN A THEATER WITH A LARGE ATTENDANCE, AND \n                                                                           229\nSOME ACCEPTED THE TRUTH. HE HAD THE CONFIDENCE OF THE CHURCH MEMBERS WHO WERE NATURALLY MUCH ENCOURAGED, AND SO, AS HE HAD TO DEVOTE MUCH OF HIS TIME TO TAKING CARE OF THE INTEREST (HE IS AN INDEFATIGABLE WORKER), THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE VOTED HIM $8 A WEEK TO ASSIST HIM. OF COURSE HE CANNOT LIVE ON THAT, AND HE THINKS THE INTEREST DEMANDS FULL TIME, AND HE IS REALLY LOOKING TO THE RESTORATION OF HIS CREDENTIALS AND COMPLETE RECOGNITION AS A MINISTER OF THE CONFERENCE. HIS PRESENT EXPERIENCE NO ONE DOUBTS, BUT THE PAST HAS MARKED HIM AND HIS FAMILY.",
