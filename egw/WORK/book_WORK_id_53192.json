Daniells.] \n\n\n     I have received your letters regarding the council held in New York, and the efforts that are being made in behalf of the multitudes in the large cities. I have also read your letters of August 4 and 5 to W. C. White. I intended to answer your letters immediately, but I have been carrying so heavy a burden that I thought I must wait till I could write you clearly.",
