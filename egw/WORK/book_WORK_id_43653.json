    "word": "What God promises he is able at any time to perform, and the work he gives his people to do, he is able to accomplish by them. If this people will live according to every word he has spoken, in so much every good word and promise is fulfilled toward them. If they come short of perfect obedience, the great and precious promises are afar off, and they cannot reach the fulfillment.",
