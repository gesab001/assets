    "word": "When Christ called His ministers He did not go to the \"school of the prophets\" but to fishermen. He took those men that He could bring into connection with Himself, so that He could place His mold upon them. And this is the kind of workers the Lord wants--men who are willing to sit at His feet, men who can work anywhere and do anything for the Lord, and who will not be constantly striving for the supremacy.",
