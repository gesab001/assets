    "word": "Christ desires all to become His students. He says, Yield yourselves to My training; submit your souls unto Me. I will not extinguish you, but will work out for you such a character that you shall be transformed from the lower grade to the higher school. Submit all things to Me. Let My life, My patience, My longsuffering, My forbearance, My meekness, My lowliness, be worked out in your character, as one that abides in Me and I in Him. Then you have the power. Not only, \"I will give,\" but, \"You shall find rest to your souls.\"",
