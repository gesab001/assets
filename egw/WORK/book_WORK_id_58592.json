    "word": "God wants us to love one another. He says, \"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another,\" \"as I have loved you; that ye also love one another.\" This is the new commandment. It was new because Christ had not, before it was spoken, given the evidence of how much he loves us. \"As I have loved you,\"-- that makes it a new commandment. He wants you to consider his love, manifested in dying for our sinful race; and consider what you can do in order to extend the knowledge of that love. Every believer in the truth has a relation to another soul, and that soul to still another, and through these lines of influence we may extend the blessings of God's grace. Thus we may diffuse heaven's atmosphere in place of the malarious atmosphere which has surrounded so many souls; and by means of which God's work has been hindered and his name dishonored.",
