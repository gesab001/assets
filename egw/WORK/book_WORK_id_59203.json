    "word": "All the way along from the beginning, we have found it necessary to educate, educate, educate. God desires us to continue the work of educating the people. We are not to neglect this work because of the effect we may fear it will have on the sales of the goods prepared in the health food factories. That is not the most important matter. Our work is to show the people how they can obtain and prepare wholesome food, how they can co-operate with God in restoring His moral image in themselves. In the effort to help them, difficulties will arise. Some have written to me about the recipes for using the nut preparations, saying that the foods as prepared do not agree with them, and that they have written to the Sanitarium and to others, but have not learned the cause of the difficulty. In replying to such inquiries, I have suggested that they use only one-fifth part of the nut preparations called for in the recipes. This is the instruction given me. It would be a blessing if our cookbooks were pruned of some of the recipes appearing in them.",
