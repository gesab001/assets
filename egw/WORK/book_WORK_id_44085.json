    "word": "It is necessary for the healthful development of mind that each quality be properly employed. If one faculty is suffered to remain idle while others are over-worked, the design of God is not accomplished, because the balance of the mind is not preserved. The over-taxed organs become irritated, when, if all the faculties, especially those that are the weakest, should be cultivated, the pressure would not be extreme upon any one. All would bear their part of the labor, and minds would then be properly balanced.",
