    "word": "The light given me is that the schools in Graysville and Huntsville make these towns places of special interest. In both of these places there are excellent opportunities for giving the students manual training. I mention these places particularly because they have been presented to me by the Lord as places in which we should make persevering efforts to build up and strengthen the work. In these places there is much to be done, and the efforts of the laborers should be specially directed to this work until something is completed that will be an object lesson of what can be done. Let not the means at your disposal be spent in so many places that nothing satisfactory is accomplished anywhere. It is possible for the workers to spread their efforts over so much territory that nothing will be properly done in the very places where, by the Lord\u2019s direction, the work should be strengthened and perfected.",
