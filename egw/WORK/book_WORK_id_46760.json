    "word": "Ministers and physicians are both to work with earnestness to save the souls who are being bound up in Satan's snare. They are to speak words which point men and women to Jesus, their righteousness, their strength, and the health of their countenance. Continually they are to watch for souls. . . . This work belongs just as surely to the doctor as to the minister. The Lord designs that the influence of doctors and ministers shall harmonize. By public and private efforts the physician is to seek to win souls to Christ.--Ms 159, 1899, pp. 1, 9, 10. (\"The Privileges and Duties of a Christian Physician,\" December 13, 1899.)",
