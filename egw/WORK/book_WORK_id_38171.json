    "word": "But let us not forget that as activity increases, and we become successful in doing the work that must be accomplished, there is danger of our trusting in human plans and methods. There will be a tendency to pray less, and to have less faith. We shall be in danger of losing our sense of dependence upon God, who alone can make our work succeed; but although this is the tendency, let no one think that the human instrument is to do less. No, he is not to do less, but to do more by accepting the heavenly gift, the Holy Spirit. The world in its own wisdom knew not God, and every human power is naturally, to a greater or less degree, opposed to God. We are to look to Jesus, and cooperate with heavenly agencies, offering our petitions to the Father in Jesus' name.--Review and Herald, July 4, 1893.",
