    "word": "We are to believe and love the truth for Christ's sake. We must rise higher and higher in purity [and] knowledge. We are Christ's witnesses.

By beholding Him, studying and talking of Him, we become transformed into His image.--Letter 119, Aug. 13, 1899, to a husband-and-wife team working in the Southern States.",
