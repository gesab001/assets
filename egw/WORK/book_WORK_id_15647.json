    "word": "God fixes no limit to the advancement of those who desire to be \"filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding\" (Colossians 1:9). Through prayer, through watchfulness, through growth in knowledge and understanding, they are to be \"strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power\" (verse 11). Thus they are prepared to work for others. It is the Saviour's purpose that human beings, purified and sanctified, shall be His helping hand. For this great privilege let us give thanks to Him who \"hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son\" (verses 12, 13) (The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 477, 478). \n                                                                           265",
