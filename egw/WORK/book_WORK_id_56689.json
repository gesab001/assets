    "word": "God has different sets of workman for the different branches of his cause. When those whom he has called to do a certain work, have carried that work along as far as they can with the ability he has given them, the Lord in his providence will call and qualify other men to come in and work with them, still making advance moves, that together they may carry it \n                                                                           108\nfarther, and lift the standard higher. He will never allow his work to diminish in strength or efficiency, if those to whom he has given their work will act their part with unswerving fidelity. There must be no [belittlling] the men who God has accepted as his workmen.",
