There was a large congregation, and several of the business men of Healdsburg were present. When Elder Waggoner had finished speaking, Mrs. White said, \"Help me onto my feet.\" Sister Ings and her son lifted her up, and she was led to the desk. Laying hold of the pulpit with both hands, she began, in a feeble way, to tell the people that this might be the last time they would hear her voice at camp meeting.
