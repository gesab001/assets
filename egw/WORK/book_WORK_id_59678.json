    "word": "September 6: I just came across this letter unfinished. You can read it and act I think. Dr. Holden better be secured and you prepared to work. I will send you copies of letters today if I can, if not, the first of the week. I shall not send the letter I had written to Dr. Holden. Make your terms with him for we must have someone to educate nurses for our Sanitariums. Please do your best. I have written early and late without rest and now this morning am admonished that I must rest. Be sure and call Dr. White without delay. I hope you have done this, and that her capabilities may be secured. Keep up good courage in the Lord, Brother and Sister Burden. \n\n\n                           Ellen G. White. \n\n                                               -",
