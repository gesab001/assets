    "word": "Christ asked who touched Him. His disciples were astonished that He should ask such a question when He was surrounded by a great multitude. They said, \"Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?\" But Jesus knew that somebody had touched Him with no casual touch, but with the touch of faith. A longing soul had reached out to Him for help which no one but He could give. Jesus said, \"I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\" And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing,\" and when the woman knew she was not hid, she acknowledged the good work that had been wrought in her. She told the story of her suffering and her hopeless condition, and her act of faith in touching His garment. He said unto her, \"Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole.\"--ST, June 10, 1889.",
