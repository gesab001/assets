    "word": "Devotion, piety, and sanctification of the entire man comes through Jesus Christ our Righteousness. The love of God needs to be constantly cultivated. Oh, how my heart cries out to the living God for the mind of Jesus Christ! I want to lose sight of self. I want to work with all the powers I am capable of exercising to save souls for whom Christ has made the infinite sacrifice of His own precious life. I must seek wisdom daily to know how to deal with souls that are entrapped in Satan's snares. There are many erring, well-beloved souls that, if imbued with the Spirit of Christ, we may win back to God. Notwithstanding their sins and follies, the Lord loves them; He gave His only beloved Son to save them; and it was because He loved them that He sent His Son into the world that whosoever believeth in Him, should not perish but have everlasting life. We must ever keep close to Jesus Christ that we may be constantly partaking of the divine nature, having a deep personal interest in others who have once been our best friends but in time of temptation have lifted up the heel against us. The love of Christ must not be extinguished in the soul.",
