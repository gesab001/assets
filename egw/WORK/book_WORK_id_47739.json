    "word": "Let a people boast themselves in their own wisdom, let them exalt self and indulge pride, and the result will surely follow. As surely as the sun shines by day, so surely does pride go before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. Let a church become proud and boastful, and that church will be laid low. Let those in charge of any institution become presumptuous, \n\n\n                                    -70- \n\ntaking to themselves the credit for the success that has come to them in certain lines, let them glory in their wisdom and their efficiency, and they will certainly be brought to humiliation.--Letter 114, 1903. (To \"The Leaders in Our Work,\" May 23, 1903.) \n\nReleased May 23, 1975.",
