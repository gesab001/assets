    "word": "The end came on Friday, July 16, 1915, at 3:40 P. M., in the sunny upper chamber of her \"Elmshaven\" home where she had spent so much of her time during the last happy, fruitful years of her busy life. She fell asleep in Jesus as quietly and peacefully as a weary child goes to rest. Surrounding her bedside were her son, Elder W. C. White, and his wife; her granddaughter, Mrs. Mabel White Workman; her long-time and faithful secretary, Miss Sara McEnterfer; her niece and devoted nurse, Miss May Walling; another of her untiring bedside nurses, Mrs. Carrie Hungerford; her housekeeper, Miss Tessie Woodbury; her old-time companion and helper, Mrs. Mary Chinnock Thorp; and a few friends and helpers who had spent many years in and about her home and in her office.",
