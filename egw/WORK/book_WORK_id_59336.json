    "word": "With the opening of the College in the fall of 1910, the most advanced class of medical students were to enter upon their third year; and in order to conform to the requirements of the State, it was necessary to provide them facilities for thorough laboratory work. A laboratory \n\n\n                               -22- \n\nbuilding was therefore erected and is well equipped with the essential appliances.  {LLM 21.10}  \n     During the year 1911 steady progress was made in the work at Loma Linda. The various departments were strengthened. Twenty-four students entered the medical course, and twenty the nurses' course. The patronage of the sanitarium increased, and notwithstanding the expense of maintaining the educational departments, there was a profit in the operating expenses for the year, of $5,795.41. The expenses of erecting the girls' dormitory and laboratory building, and providing the facilities that were necessary, were heavy; yet the present worth of the corporation increased from $27,650.00 in 1910 to $61,892.34 in 1912.",
