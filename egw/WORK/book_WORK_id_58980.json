    "word": "The union of the branch to the vine is no more essential to the life and fruitfulness of the branch than a union with Christ is essential to the life and fruitfulness of the believer. Receiving Him by faith and trusting in Him, true believers become partakers of the divine nature. They not only bear testimony for Him with their lips; they witness for Him by their works. \"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you,\" He says, \"ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.\"",
