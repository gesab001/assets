    "word": "I have been surprised to see how many families are blinded by Satan, and have no sense of his workings, his wiles, and deceptions, practiced in their very midst. Parents seem to be stupefied by the paralyzing influence of Satan, and yet think they are all right. I have been shown that Satan engages in the work of debasing the minds of those who unite in marriage, that he may stamp his own hateful image upon their children. Because they have entered into the marriage relation, he deceives them, and leads them to pervert the marriage institution, which is sacred. Many think that because of the marriage relation, they may permit themselves to be controlled by animal \n                                                                           64\npassions. They are led on by Satan. He is well pleased with the low level their minds take; for he has much to gain in this direction. He knows that if he can excite the baser passions, and keep them in the ascendency, he has nothing to be troubled about in their Christian experience; for the moral and intellectual will be subordinate while the animal will predominate and keep in the ascendency, and by exercise these baser passions will be strengthened and the nobler qualities of the mind become weaker and weaker.",
