    "word": "As we listen to words of instruction that fell from His lips when He was instructing His disciples, we are to appropriate these words as if spoken directly to us, and He will purify us from vain ambition that has a desire to please and glorify self. Our individual selves must not get in the way. The Lord Jesus will purify our motives if we will let Him do this by working out our own salvation with fear and with trembling.--Manuscript 182, 1897, pp. 1-4.
