    "word": "PH004 - An Appeal for Missions (1898)\n\n\n\tTo our Churches in America:-- \n\n     There is a burden upon my soul in regard to the destitute mission fields. There is aggressive work to be done in the missions near you; in the Southern field, which has been sadly neglected; there is great need of funds to advance the work in foreign fields. Our foreign missions are languishing. The missionaries are not sustained as God requires they should be. For want of funds, workers are not able to enter new fields.",
