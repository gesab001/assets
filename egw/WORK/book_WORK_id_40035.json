    "word": "Our sanitariums should be attractive places, and the surroundings of this sanitarium correspond more closely to the representations that have been given me by the Lord, than anything else I have seen up to the present time. This place, and several other places, were presented to me some time ago. This place was pointed out as a most desirable sight for the sanitarium work that should be carried on near Boston. It has the attractiveness that will bring to it wealthy people from Boston. It has been reserved for us, that we may reach the people \n                                                                           5\nof that city. I have been instructed that it is in the providence of God that the New England Sanitarium is here; and we should appreciate the advantages thus placed within our reach.",
