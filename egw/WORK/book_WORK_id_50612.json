    "word": "If men could see the tender love of Christ, there would be no lifting up one over another. The Lord Jesus came to our world, you may not say, to save them only, but to save us. In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. He came to seek and to save that which was lost. He traversed every path where souls were straying. He reached to the very depths of human woe and misery. What right, then, has one fellow laborer to give the cold shoulder to another fellow laborer because he presumes to think that he has not in all things done as he should have done? O man, remember that thou art only a man! What account will those in New Zealand render for their Phariseeism, for standing apart from their brother, leaving him to the devil's temptations? Satan works to rob man of his integrity toward God.",
