    "word": "The family of Bro. Rumery are, most of them, in the downward road. Maria lives an aimless life. She is full of folly, vanity, and pride. Her influence does not tend to ennoble, does not lead to goodness and holiness. She does not like the restraint religion imposes; therefore she will not yield her heart to its sacred sway. She loves self, she loves pleasure, and is seeking for her own enjoyment. Sad, sad indeed will be the result unless she now turns square about, and seeks for true genuine godliness. She might exert an influence over her brothers \n                                                                           30\nwhich would be softening, ennobling and elevating in its tendency. God loves these children; but they are not Christians. They can become children of the light, and be missionaries in their own family, and among their associates. They could be workers for God, if they would try to live humble Christians.",
