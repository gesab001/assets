    "word": "Do Not Deny Innocent Pleasures.--For lack of time and thought many a mother refuses her children some innocent pleasure, while busy fingers and weary eyes are diligently engaged on work designed only for adornment, something that, at best, will serve only to encourage vanity and extravagance in their young hearts.

The mother grieves over her children's faults but does not realize that the harvest she is reaping is from seed which she herself planted.",
