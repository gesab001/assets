    "word": "Those who hold weighty responsibilities in the office have a very indistinct sense of the justice, mercy, and love of God. Therefore God calls upon you to make the most of every opportunity for securing a preparation for His work. He expects you as His employed workers to put forth all your energies in its performance, and to keep your souls alive to its sacredness and fearful responsibilities. God's eye is upon you. It is not safe for any one of you to bring into [the] divine presence a marred sacrifice, a sacrifice that cost neither study nor prayer, for God will not accept it at your hand.",
