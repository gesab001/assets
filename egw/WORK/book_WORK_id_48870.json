    "word": "One who spake with no uncertainty, laid his hand upon Elder_____'s shoulder and said, \"God hath given to every man his work. Will you please leave God room to work with His individual workers. He has not left this burden of work upon your hands. He has never placed upon one man, or upon any board of men, the burden of entering into the minutiae in regard to how workers shall carry on their work. He has never laid upon any one the burden of making rules of action which will bind about and restrict the work, and confine the workers to a certain course of action.\"",
