    "word": "The Signs of the Times may be made more perfect; but take away and divert the interest to a new paper [JAMES WHITE WAS AT THIS TIME CONTEMPLATING THE PRINTING OF A NEW JOURNAL, AND IN THIS LETTER ELLEN WHITE DISCOURAGES THE PLAN FOR SEVERAL REASONS--ONE BEING THE LACK OF TALENTED EDITORS TO MAKE THE PAPER A SUCCESS.] and it will decrease the interest in those already established, and it will be a trial enterprise. It will not be kept alive. It will dwindle out after a time. Let all the talent and all the means be employed in building up our offices now in operation and making the papers now printed a perfect success. Do well what is on hand to do, and God will help if the workers are devoted, God-fearing, self-sacrificing men.--Lt 49, 1876.",
