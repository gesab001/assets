    "word": "Agents of Righteousness \n\n     Students are in no case to cheapen and decrease their value in Christian endeavor lines. They are to prepare to go forth as missionaries to warn the world. They should have their seasons of prayer. From them earnest, fervent prayers should ascend to heaven for the president of the school, that God may bless him with health, and give him moral power, clearness of mind, and spiritual discernment. They should pray that the teachers may be blessed and qualified by the grace of Christ to do their work with fidelity, with an active, fervent love that is in harmony with the mind of the Saviour. They are to be His agents through whom He works that good may prevail over evil. May God give the students who attend our institutions of learning, grace and courage to act up to the principles revealed in the laws of God.",
