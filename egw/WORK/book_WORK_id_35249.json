    "word": "Satan's work today is that of a deceiver and an accuser. The Lord declares him to be an accuser of the brethren day and night. By long practice Satan has become well skilled in his trade of fault-finding, and will educate every man whom he can use to unite with him in this work. By him many are being deceived, and are moving blindfolded into paths of Satan's opening.",
