    "word": "Will the workers now submerge self in Jesus? Let not self appear, but lift up Jesus. With the fire of God's love burning upon the altar of your hearts, melt down the barriers, and make every advance move that is possible. But bear in mind that you are only God's agents; all your works, all your means, are of little account unless you are imbued with the Spirit of Christ.",
