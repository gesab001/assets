    "word": "Youth Work \n     What would I give for a minister that goes into the desk and preaches a discourse with the solemn truths that we bear at this time, and then goes out and his conversation is light, trifling, and narrow? His words carry no weight. . . . You should preach less; teach the Bible in the family; read and explain. You can do more at the family circle than in all the sermonizing.-- Ms 10, 1891, pp. 10, 11.
