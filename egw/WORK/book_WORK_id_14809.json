    "word": "\u201cI saw that those who moved to the West should be like men waiting for their Lord. \u2018Be a living example,\u2019 said the angel, \u2018to those in the West. Let your works show that you are God's peculiar people, and that you have a peculiar work\u2014the last message of mercy to the world. Let your works show to those around you that this world is not your home.\u2019 I saw that those who have entangled themselves should break the snare of the enemy and go free; that they should not lay up treasures upon earth, but show by their lives that they are laying up treasure in heaven. \n329\nIf God had called them to the West, he had a work for them to do\u2014an exalted work\u2014to let faith and experience help those who had not a living experience. The attraction should not be to this poor, dark world, but upward to God, to glory, and to Heaven. They should not let the care and perplexity of farms here engross the mind, but contemplate Abraham's farm. We are heirs to that immortal inheritance, and should wean the affections from earth, and dwell upon heavenly things.",
