    "word": "Those who are ready to do service are those who feed most on Christ. Read and study his word, drink in the inspiration of his spirit, and receive of his grace, not to hoard, but to give to others. In order to instruct others, the teachers must first be learners of Christ. There are Marthas in every church, they are intensely busy in religious activities, and they do much good; but we need also Mary's side of character. The most zealous workers need to learn at the feet of Jesus. \n                                Mrs. E. G. White.",
