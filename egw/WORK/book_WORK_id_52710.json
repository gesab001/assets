    "word": "When a man takes control of any other man's conscience, he is entirely out of his place. The Lord has not delegated to any man the work of ruling his brother. There are times when workers pass through strait places. They are depressed. They want to do the will of God, and they long to clasp a friendly hand. Brethren differ in ideas; for their temperaments are unlike. One is more speculative then practical; another thinks his position gives him authority to say what the next man should and must do, without any argument on the point. \"All ye are brethren.\" Let each resolve that he will not, under any provocation, show a cheapness and littleness of spirit, that he will speak no words in bitterness.",
