    "word": "The grace that bringeth salvation would no longer be heard in the city. This was the cause of the Saviour\u2019s intense sorrow. . . . The tender tears He shed over Jerusalem were the last tears of rejected love. . . . The glad throng could not understand the cause of the Saviour\u2019s sorrow. They did not know that the iniquities of Israel were bringing her final calamities upon her. But a mysterious awe falls upon the procession, and calms in a degree its enthusiasm. . . . A large number in that throng bear in their own bodies the evidence that divine power is among them, and each has a story to tell of the merciful works of Christ. The relation of those wonderful works increases the fervor of their feelings until it reaches an intensity that is indescribable. Disciples and people join in the songs of praise.",
