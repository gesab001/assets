Healey\n\n-Aug. 25, 1901-6- \n\n\n                                                  H-116-1901 \n\n\n             Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 21, 1901. \n\nElder Healey, Dear brother,-- \n     I cannot sleep after one o'clock. I have words to speak to you. For many years I have been instructed that you are in danger of looking at things in a wrong light. This places you where you are not a wise counsellor. You have traits of character which need to be entirely changed, else you will be a hindrance to the work, leading some to entertain suspicions, and to strike out in independent lines of action. Such a course of action is surely a mistake, and if followed will bring difficulties not easily managed.",
