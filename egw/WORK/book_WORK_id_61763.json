    "word": "Tuesday afternoon I met with the stockholders of the Paradise Valley Sanitarium. Their council-meeting was held in the bowling alley. In coming out, we had to pass through the assembly room, where there was a large audience. Brother Burden asked me to stay, as they were speaking of the work of higher education that should be carried on in medical lines, but I thought it best not to do this. After I had climbed the long flight of stairs to my room on the third floor, which was the third time for that day. I found an article that I had written about a year ago, in reference to the establishment of a school of the highest order, in which the students would not be taught to use drugs in the treatment of the sick. With this I went down stairs again, and returned to the meeting.",
