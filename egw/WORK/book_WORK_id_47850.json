    "word": "This is the great peril of woman's work in Christian temperance lines. The Lord does not bid you separate from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. They need all the light you can give them. You are not to learn of them, but of Jesus Christ. Flash all the light possible into their pathway. You can agree with them on the ground of the pure, elevating principles that first brought into existence the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. \"I,\" said Christ, \"send you forth as lambs among wolves.\" If he sends his disciples on such a mission, will he not work through you to open the Scriptures to those who are in error? Cherish the fragrance of that love that Christ has revealed for fallen humanity, and by precept and example teach the truth as it is in Jesus.",
