    "word": "Now in regard to Edson, I presented the matter to Brother Olsen. I tried to lay before him my situation in connection with Fannie, but Fannie, I think, had considerable talk with him, as she does to every one, in representing the great difficulty in preparing the articles from my pen.

I am sure he was very dull of comprehension in regard to my relation to the work and in regard to Fannie's connection with me. The way she represents matters is so misleading. She will say with such pathos, \"Sister White does not understand me. My motives are misapprehended.\" \n                                                                           62",
