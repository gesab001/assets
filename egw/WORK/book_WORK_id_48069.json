    "word": "MR No. 512 - Use of the Tithe\n\n     He [Kellogg] says if no means is allowed to carry the message by medical missionary laborers into the churches, he shall separate the tithe that is paid into the Conference, to sustain the medical missionary work. You should come to an understanding, and work harmoniously. For him to separate the tithe from the treasury would be a necessity I greatly dread. If this money in tithe is paid by the workers into the treasury, why, I ask, should not that amount be apportioned to the carrying forward of the medical missionary work?--Letter 51a, 1898, p. 1. (To Uriah Smith and G. A. Irwin, June 6, 1898.)",
