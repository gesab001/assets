    "word": "Brethren, we need the Spirit of God in our midst and when God puts His Spirit upon us, this seeking for the supremacy will cease. May God help us to reach a higher standard. What we want is to put self out of sight. I never felt it so much as of late. It is not the theory of the truth, it is not your argument that is needed, but what we want is religion--practical godliness--to teach the people and to weave into our own lives. We want to show in our actions the impress of the Divine and show that Christ is working for us, and with us, and that God is in our midst. We want to be a channel for good. \n\n\n                                    -256-",
