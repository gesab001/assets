    "word": "The health food business, in which a few have planned certain food combinations, has been allowed to take from the family cooks much of the work they should do. I am instructed to say that there should be a reformation in the restaurants, and a reformation in the homes of our people. Every cook should understand the art of preparing wholesome and palatable food. The knowledge of healthful cookery has been neglected in the home, and our people have learned to depend too much upon the expensive food preparations. Let us arouse ourselves and see what we can do individually, without leaning so heavily upon the food companies.",
