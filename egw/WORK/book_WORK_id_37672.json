    "word": "A Telling Influence-Counsel to a Sister.--I hope, my sister, that you will have an influence in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.... Get the oil of grace in the conscious and unconscious influence of words spoken, revealing the fact that you have the light of life to shine forth to others in a direct, positive testimony upon subjects where you can all agree, and this will leave a telling influence. My heart is with your heart in this work of temperance. I speak upon this subject most decidedly, and it has a decided influence upon other minds.--Manuscript 74, 1898.",
