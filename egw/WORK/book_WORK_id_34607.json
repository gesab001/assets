    "word": "1 T.--680-686 \n     During the last seven months we have been at home but about four weeks. In our travels we have sat at many different tables, from Iowa to Maine. \n\n92 \n\nSome whom we have visited live up to the best light they have. Others, who have the same opportunities of learning to live healthfully and well, have hardly taken the first steps in reform. They will tell you that they do not know how to cook in this new way. But they are without excuse in this matter of cooking, for in the work, \"How to Live,\" are many excellent recipes, and this work is within the reach of all. I do not say that the system of cookery taught in that book is perfect. I may soon furnish a small work more to my mind in some respects. But \"How to Live\" teaches cookery almost infinitely in advance of what the traveler will often meet, even among some Seventh-day Adventists.  {TSDF 91.10}  \n     Many do not feel that this is a matter of duty, hence they do not try to prepare food properly. This can be done in a simple, healthful, and easy manner, without the use of lard, butter, or flesh-meats. Skill must be united with simplicity. To do this, women must read, and then patiently reduce what they read to practice. Many are suffering because they will not take the trouble to do this. I say to such, It is time for you to rouse your dormant energies and read up. Learn how to cook with simplicity, and yet in a manner to secure the most palatable and healthful food.",
