    "word": "There is a medium position in these things. O that we all might wisely find that position and keep it. In this solemn time let us all search our own hearts, repent of our sins, and humble ourselves before God. The work is between God and our own souls. It is an individual work, and all will have enough to do without criticizing the dress, actions, and motives of their brethren and sisters. \"Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought His judgments; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.\" Zephaniah 2:3. Here is our work. It is not sinners who are here addressed, but all the meek of the earth, who have wrought His judgments, or kept His commandments. There is work for everyone, and if all will obey we shall see sweet union in the ranks of Sabbathkeepers.",
