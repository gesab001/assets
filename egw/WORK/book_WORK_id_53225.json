    "word": "A terribly unjust course has been pursued in the past. A want of principle has been revealed. But in pity to His people God has brought about changes. I think that when I took my writings out of my satchel to give you something in regard to the Southern work, I must, by mistake, have given you that which I did not mean should fall into the hands of you or anyone else. When the Lord takes hold of the work as He did at our last conference, your mother can stand back and not be brought so prominently into matters. And, oh, how pleased I am when this can be so.",
