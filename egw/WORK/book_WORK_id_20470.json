    "word": "PRAYER WITHOUT EARNEST ACTIVITY FOR OTHERS LEADS TO FORMALISM.\u2014God does not mean that any of us shall become hermits or monks, and retire from the world to devote ourselves to acts of worship. The life must be like Christ\u2019s life,\u2014between the mountain and the multitude. He who does nothing but pray will soon cease to pray, or his prayers will become a formal routine. When men take themselves out of social life, away from the sphere of Christian duty and cross-bearing; when they cease to work earnestly for the Master, who worked earnestly for them, they lose the subject matter of prayer, and have no incentive to devotion. Their prayers become personal and selfish. They cannot pray in regard to the wants of humanity or the upbuilding of Christ\u2019s kingdom, pleading for strength wherewith to work.\u2014(Steps to Christ, 101.)",
