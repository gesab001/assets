    "word": "Good portions [of land of Avondale] are adapted for fruit, especially peaches, apricots, nectarines, and other fruit, while other portions of land are favorable for vegetables. The twenty-five acres pronounced worthless because [of] swampland, would, they thought, prove [to be] the most valuable land. They have cut through drains, and a boat will float up one of the deep cuts [carrying] the produce and any boatloads of cargo directed to the school grounds. They can raise vegetables on this land if [it is] properly worked.",
