    "word": "There are many who have for years been rejoicing in the light of truth; let them now practice the lessons they have learned. They have the word of God, and the precious experience. Let them use the knowledge to a purpose. In all humility of mind seek to learn ways and methods of reaching those who are still in error and darkness. God calls; shall we hear His voice? God calls upon the lay members of His church to enter the field and do what they can by individual effort. All are to work for perishing souls, laying hold by faith upon the power of faith to work with them. Moments are precious.",
