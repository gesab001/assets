    "word": "Jesus said, \"No man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.\" John 6:65. Man does his part, as God's human agent, to reach humanity; but Jesus, not man, does this work of transforming man's character. His Spirit is diffused through all the capabilities and entrusted powers of men, shedding light into the understanding and bringing under His own control the heart that has been serving sin.",
