    "word": "We call loudly for help to build a house of worship in Melbourne. They have the expense of a school, and unless help comes from the conference we shall not be able to continue meetings in Melbourne to call out the people to hear the truth. The halls are untidy, yes, dirty, and the out-buildings without sewerage, and closely crowded up to the rear of the hall that every available foot of land may be utilized. This creates an odor which is dangerous to health, and almost completely shuts me out of these halls. I do venture sometimes, but it is under protest, and sickness is always the result. In London they need a house of worship, and there are great necessities here in New Zealand, which must be relieved if we would bring souls into the truth. We cannot delay the work for years. One year of advance now means two years or more in the future.",
