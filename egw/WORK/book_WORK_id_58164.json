    "word": "Did your devising in regard to the Gospel Primer meet the approval of God? No; the principle upon which you acted was wrong. Individual service is to be rendered to God, not to be controlled by men or by any set of men. Movements have been made which mean much in their outworking. An example has been given by men who are serving where they should not be, which is leavening your conferences. The Presidents of Conferences are being imbued with a spirit to rule, to require men to bow to their judgment, if any refuse, the course pursued toward them is such as to fill heaven with indignation.",
