    "word": "You strike too low, my brethren. Set your mark high. Let your works be in harmony with the works of Jesus Christ. It is the privilege of all to grow up to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. \"This is the will of God, even your sanctification\" [1 Thessalonians 4:3]. Is it your will also? With intensity of desire, long after God; yea, pant after Him, as the hart panteth after the water brooks. Press to the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.",
