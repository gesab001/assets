Jan. 18, 1889 \n\nR. A. Underwood, \n\n\n     Dear Brother:-While at General Conference in Oakland, some things were brought forcibly to my mind which I must place upon paper. I am very sorry that you have taken the leading active part that you have in establishing an institution in Ohio, for I cannot think that the Lord has led you in this matter. I have been considering your statement in regard to Bro. Gilmore's unwillingness to invest his means in any enterprise of the cause of God excepting in this sanitarium which he designs to control largely himself, and I have concluded that his position is not a correct one to take. God is willing to bless us, but we are to be perfectly passive in his hands. We are to earnestly inquire that we may know and do the will of God. If you had been in a condition to have directed Brother Gilmore with wise counsel he might have made a far different use of his money, time, and talent. He has ability which could have been employed with profit in the work and cause of God instead of being used in this uncertain enterprise.",
