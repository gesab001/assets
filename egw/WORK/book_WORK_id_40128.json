    "word": "No physician is secure who stands in his own strength. Physicians must not enter upon their work with careless irreverent thoughts. Moment by moment they are to trust in Him who gave His life for fallen humanity, and who respects his purchased inheritance. Thus doing, they will rightly regard the purchase of the blood of Christ. They will gird on every piece of the heavenly armor, that they may be protected from the assaults of the enemy. This is a safeguard against sin which the physician must avail himself of if he would be successful in his work. \n                                                                           18",
