    "word": "Never, never build mammoth institutions. Let these institutions be small, and let there be more of them, that the work of winning souls to Christ may be accomplished. . . . The sick are to be reached, not by massive buildings, but by the establishment of small sanitariums, which are to be as lights shining in a dark place. Those who are engaged in this work are to reflect the sunlight of Christ's face. They are to be as salt that has not lost its savor. By sanitarium work properly conducted, the influence of true, pure religion will be extended to many souls. \n\n                                               -",
