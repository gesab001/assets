    "word": "God wants men of clear discernment, men whose eyes have been anointed with the golden oil from the golden tubes, which empty themselves, according to the order of God, into the vessels prepared for the reception of the sacred oil. Talent is best developed where it is most needed. At this time in our history God has a place for every worker, and reward will be given to those who have respect for the laws of demand and supply. Every pure, sincere worker sees that there is something better than mere wages.",
