    "word": "Our Saviour did not seek to make a great display, or to undertake a work that called for a large outlay of money. He will not sanction self-exaltation. Those who seek to honor themselves will not be honored by Him. He desires men to place themselves where they may receive His precious grace, and be sanctified through belief of the truth. Let every one empty himself of the spirit of self-importance and receive the meekness of Christ.",
