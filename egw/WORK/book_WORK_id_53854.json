    "word": "Grand Lake, Colorado, Thursday, September 25, 1873. We worked busily nearly all the day in getting settled. We have at last got fixed very convenient. I have two ticks made of woolen blankets which we filled with hay and made very nice beds. We have boards arranged for shelves, and we look very cozy here. Brother Glover went fishing. He caught a few fish. He shot a duck in the morning, but it was lost in the water.",
