    "word": "Teach our sisters that every day the question is to be, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do this day? Each vessel consecrated to God will daily have the holy oil emptied into it, that it may be emptied out into other vessels. Every day we may be advancing in the Christian character, waiting and watching for opportunities to do the will and work of God. Every word uttered, every work performed in Christ's lines, will have an enduring pre-eminence. Speak the words that are given you of God, and the Lord will certainly\n131\nwork with you. Do not fail nor be discouraged, although you may see many things which you do not approve. I hope and pray that you may be clothed with the righteousness of Christ daily.--RH May 9, 1899 (written to Mrs. S.M.I. Henry Mar. 25, 1899).",
