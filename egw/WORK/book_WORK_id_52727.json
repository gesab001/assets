    "word": "We, as a people, profess to believe sacred truths. Are we happier and holier, more earnest, self-denying, and fervent, because of our belief in these truths, than are the people of other denominations? What evidence do we give to the world that our faith is above that of the ordinary religionist of the day? We can estimate the influence that advanced truth and increased light have on us, by the work that we do. \"By their fruits,\" Christ declares, \"ye shall know them.\" Our words, our works, are the fruit we bear. Do our works correspond to the sacredness of our faith?",
