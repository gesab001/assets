    "word": "The poor must have the gospel message preached to them. It is as necessary to them as to those who are in good circumstances. The brethren are purchasing land somewhere in Melbourne upon which to build a church. Since the close of the camp meeting in Auckland, a church has been erected in one of its suburbs for those who have lately accepted the truth. In all probability we shall have \n\n\n                                    -274- \n\nto have a place of worship erected in Hobart. It is very difficult to secure a place in which meetings can be held on Sunday and Sunday evenings. The church in which the brethren now meet on Sabbath was built by a dissenting minister of the Wesleyan order. He preaches independent of the conference, and is free to do as he pleases about letting us have his church. How long he will be generous enough to permit the Seventh-day Adventists to occupy his church is rather uncertain. You can see that a great work is to be done in every part of the colonies.",
