    "word": "Bro. Andrews was acquainted with the reasons of my husband's objection to his settling in Rochester. In view of the past, God bade us flee from Rochester, because \n                                                                           77\nhis blessing would not prosper his work there. The persuasion of friends and relatives drew Bro. Andrews to Rochester, while my husband sought to draw him away from Rochester. This has led Bro. Andrews to feel very sensitive of censure in reference to his remaining in Rochester.",
