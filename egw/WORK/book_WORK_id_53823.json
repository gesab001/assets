    "word": "For eight miles before reaching Mount Vincent the road was quite rough and hilly. For many months workmen have been at work opening up a new road by the side of the old one over the mountain, only many feet lower down. This leaves the old road very narrow and perilous, unless the horses are reliable. I walked over the most dangerous part of the road. Willie walked and held the lines. We have passed over this dangerous road no less than ten times. In rainy weather the bullock teams cut deep channels in the road, and we have to manage to keep out of these else we might upset. We always feel much relieved when we leave this perilous road behind us.",
