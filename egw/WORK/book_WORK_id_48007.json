    "word": "\"The Bible is to be the educating book; its directions are to be faithfully followed. I AM the great Healer of disease. Let the workers labor in harmony with My word. Let the physicians learn of Me out of the Scriptures, and regard My instruction in all their work. Then these agencies will not depart from Me, but will cooperate with Me in giving light and salvation to men. They will not lust after the world's indulgences, but will prepare foods that will not in any way defile the human body. They will provide fruits and grains, simply prepared foods, unmixed with wine or strong elements that confuse the brain and make the way easy for Satan to lead into sin.\"",
