    "word": "I awoke, and fell asleep the same night, and dreamed that my husband was trying to right matters in the church at Battle Creek. There was \n\n\n                                       -2- \n\ndifficulty. There were two or three that thought they had wisdom to bring the church into good working order.

Every one must keep his or her hand employed on his or her own machine, and then the larger machinery worked beautifully and every revolution of the great wheel was exact and harmonious. If any neglected this machine which was connected with the great machinery, every revolution of the large wheel made a disagreeable noise which disturbed not only the building it was in, but the building across the road jarred and shook.",
