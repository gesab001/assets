    "word": "The Final Conflict Will Be Short but Terrible \n\n\n     We are standing on the threshold of great and solemn events. Prophecies are fulfilling. The last great conflict will be short, but terrible. Old controversies will be revived. New controversies will arise. We have a great work to do. Our ministerial work must not cease. The last warnings must be given to the world. There is a  special power in the presentation of the truth at the present time. How long will it last? Only a little while. . . .",
