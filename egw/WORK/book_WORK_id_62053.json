    "word": "\u201cWork out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\u201d You are to fear lest you make a mistake, and lead others to follow a wrong example. All that you do is to show the fidelity which God acknowledges. God has given to every man his work, and He puts His stamp on all work that is genuine. But spurious work is of no value in His sight. Everything is to be done with thoroughness. There is to be no sham work. If you will do thorough work here, your education will be worth double to you in after life than if you should leave school with a superficial education, not having done thorough work.",
