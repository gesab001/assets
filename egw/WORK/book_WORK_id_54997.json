    "word": "There are opportunities and privileges to help in the church those who are ready to die, and inspire the church with zeal but not to tear the church to pieces. There are plenty of opportunities in the church to walk in Christ's lines. If the heart is full of zeal to press on to a deeper sanctification and holiness, work in that line in all humbleness and devotedness. The church needs freshness and the inspiration of men who breathe in the very atmosphere of heaven, to vitalize the church, notwithstanding the tares are among the wheat.--Manuscript 21, 1893, (Published in Review and Herald, November 8, 1956.) \n                                                                           14",
