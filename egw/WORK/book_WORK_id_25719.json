Let every one work for God and work for souls; let each one show wisdom, and never be found in idleness, waiting for some one to come around and set him to work. The \"some one\" who could set you to work is overcrowded with responsibilities, and time is lost in waiting for his directions. God will give you wisdom in reforming at once; for the call is still made, \"Son, go work today in my vineyard.\" Some may still be undecided, yet the call is still heard, \"Go work today in my vineyard.\" \"Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\" The Lord prefaces the requirement by the use of the word \"son.\" How tender, how compassionate, yet withal, how urgent! His invitation to work in his vineyard is also a command. \"What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
