    "word": "Frequently I do not anticipate saying the things I do say when I am speaking before the people. God may give me words of reproof, of warning, or encouragement as He sees fit, for the benefit of souls. I shall speak these words, and they may cut across the track of my brethren whom I sincerely love and respect in the truth. To have these words distorted, misapprehended by \n\n\n                                   -151- \n\nunbelievers, I expect, and it is no surprise to me. But to have my brethren who are acquainted with my mission and my work, trifle with the message that God gives me to bear, grieves His spirit. It is discouraging to me to have them pick out portions in the testimonies that please them which they construe to justify their own course of action and give the impression that the portion they accept is the voice of God, and then when other testimonies come that bring rebuke upon their course, when words are spoken that do not coincide with their opinions and judgment, they dishonor God's work by saying, \"Oh, this we do not accept--it is only Sister White's opinion, and it is no better than my opinion or anyone's else.\"--Letter 3, 1889, pp. 3, 4, 5. (To Brother Underwood, January 25, 1889.)",
