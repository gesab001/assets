    "word": "We entreat the heralds of the gospel of Christ never to become discouraged in the work, never to consider the most hardened sinner beyond the reach of the grace of God. Such may accept the truth in the love of it and become the salt of the earth. He who turns the hearts of men as the rivers of water are turned can bring the most selfish, sin-hardened soul to surrender to Christ. Is aught too hard for God to do? \"My word,\" He says, \"shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\"",
