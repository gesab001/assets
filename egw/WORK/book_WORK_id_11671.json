    "word": "368\n     We should learn to honor those whom God honors. Those who have toiled long and unselfishly for his cause should ever be treated with respect and tenderness, even though it may be evident that they cannot perform the work which they once could, or that they sometimes err in judgment. Notwithstanding their imperfections, these very men may be far more useful in the work of God, than those who would criticise and reject them.",
