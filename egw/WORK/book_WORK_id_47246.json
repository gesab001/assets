    "word": "I have heard men and women who have been engaged in the work in the publishing houses and Sanitarium complain of having to work over hours. If they cannot stop work after eight hours labor, they become dissatisfied. But these very ones, when they enter business for their own private benefit, will work on fully ten hours as they do in America and often extend their labor to twelve hours. They make no complaint because it is in their own personal interest. It makes every difference whether the time is to be employed to their own special advantage or for the service of God or their neighbor. If the extra time could be called the recreation hours, working from a sense of duty to benefit the oppressed, poverty stricken cause of God, I believe those who are able would find more advantage from this than from the hard, trying, taxing labor they often engage in in order to amuse themselves.",
