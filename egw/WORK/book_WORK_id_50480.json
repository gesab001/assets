    "word": "I think that a mistake has been made in erecting so large a building at first. You will remember that I pleaded with the brethren to begin work with a smaller building. It would have been much better to add other buildings as the patronage increased, instead of putting so much means into one large edifice at the beginning. I speak of this because I realize that the erection of so large a structure has been very trying to you, especially during the long time when no money was in sight with which to complete it.",
