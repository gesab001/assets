    "word": "In regard to this school here at Huntsville, I wish to say that for the past two or three years I have been receiving instruction as to what it should be, and what those who come here as students are to become. All that is done by those connected with this school, is to be done with the realization that this is the Lord's institution, in which the students are to be taught how to cultivate the land, and how to labor for the uplifting of their own people. They are to work with such earnestness and perseverance that the farm will bear testimony to the fidelity with which this donation of land has been cared for. This is the Lord's land. \n                                                                           10\nand it is to bear fruit to His glory. Those who come to this school to receive instruction on the farm or in the school-room, are to be taught in right lines, and are to live in close connection with God.",
