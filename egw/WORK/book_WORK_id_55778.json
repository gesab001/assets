    "word": "There are men, wholehearted men, whom God wants to engage in His work, and He wants every one of them to be abiding in Christ. Many claim that they are abiding in Christ and preach the truth of heavenly origin. Yet if their words and works reveal that they are suspicious and envious of their brother ministers, they are not trying to build up the work but are trying to work one against another. One wants to be a little ahead of the other--not in meekness, in lowliness of heart, but in the estimation of others.",
