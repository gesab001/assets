    "word": "Canvassing a Preparation for the Ministry\n     There are more difficulties in this work than in \n42\nsome other branches of business; but the lessons learned, the tact and discipline acquired, will fit you for other fields of usefulness, where you can minister to souls. Those who poorly learn their lesson, and are careless and abrupt in approaching persons, would show the same want of tact and skill in dealing with minds, should they enter the ministry.",
