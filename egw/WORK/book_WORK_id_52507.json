    "word": "Those who are children of God will work the works of God. But he who shuts the Holy Spirit away from his life should not be brought into connection with the sanitarium. The workers are to be carefully chosen and then tried. Those who cannot bear the test should not be encouraged to stay. Workers who are loath to fulfill the requirements of God's Word will be vacillating, sometimes serving the Lord and sometimes serving the wicked one.",
