    "word": "Walling's Mills, Thursday, September 4, 1873. Willie took Mr. Parker and Brother and Sister Downs to Black Hawk. Brother Downs has decided to go to Oregon and settle. Mr. Parker is to remain for the present at Central. We are too tired to do anything with comfort. We had Sister Downs cook her food for her journey to Oregon. We felt that it was a privilege to supply them with material for cooking. We prepared dinner for them all before they went. A young man took dinner with us. My husband employed him to work for us today.",
