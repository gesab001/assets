    "word": "In the words addressed to Peter the responsibilities of the gospel minister are set forth. I have had the matter presented before me that a wrong mould has been given to the work in Australia. Though the Lord does not require that his ministers labor beyond their physical ability, still, if they had, like wise generals planned to make every stroke tell for the future as well as for the present influence of the work, there might have been many more believers than there are today. It is not wise to open up more fields than can be thoroughly worked. If from the first selfishness had been eradicated from the hearts of the laborers, if the love of Jesus and the love of souls for whom Christ died, had controlled the workers, what a strong company might have been raised up. Jealousies, evil surmisings, envyings, have built up barriers between you and God, making it impossible for the Lord to do his work, his precious work, of bringing souls to the knowledge of truth. If many had been converted, who would have been able to care for these lambs, these newly come to the faith? What lessons they would have learned of envy, jealousy, and evil surmising. Wherein would inquiring souls find the right kind of instruction? Who would educate and train them for the work of the Master? The very men who are presenting the truth to them had need to learn the first lessons as to what constitutes the work devolving on a gospel minister. It is not sermonizing. \n                                                                           10",
