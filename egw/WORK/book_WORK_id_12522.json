    "word": "The papists had failed to work their will with Wycliffe during his life, and their hatred could not be satisfied while his body rested quietly in the grave. By the decree of the Council of Constance, more than forty years after his death his bones were exhumed and publicly burned, and the ashes were thrown into a neighboring brook. \u201cThe brook,\u201d says an old writer, \u201cdid convey his ashes into Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into the narrow seas, and they into the main ocean; and thus the ashes of Wycliffe are the emblem of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the world over.\u201d Little did his enemies realize the significance of their malicious act.",
