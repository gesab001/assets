    "word": "Preserve the Health. \n\n     Far too little attention is given to the preservation of physical health. Nothing is gained by robbing nature of her hours for rest and recuperation. To allow one man to do the work of four, or of two, or three, will result in irreparable loss. There is need of physical vigor in order to produce healthful thought. Fewer committee meetings should be attended by men who are employed to write and to speak the word. Many minor matters should be adjusted without keeping one or two men on the strain constantly. Under such a strain the mind loses its vigor. Its action cannot be as healthful and all-sided as if it were allowed proper periods of sleep and refreshment. An abundance of physical exercise is required to keep the machinery in healthful action.",
