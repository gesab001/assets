    "word": "The Lord has shown me what can be done for the younger children of our people, if they are educated in the fear and love of God. Let every church school established be conducted with such order that Christ can honor the schoolroom with his presence. There is much work to do for the Master. He will accept no cheap, shoddy service. Let teachers be learners, putting the whole mind to the task of learning how to do service for the Master. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" Let the one who is preparing to labor as a church school teacher learn to work on correct principles.",
