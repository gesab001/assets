    "word": "God pledges his most holy word that he will bless you if you will walk in his way, and do justice and judgment. \"Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small: thou shalt not have in thine house divers \n                                                                           415\nmeasures, a great and a small: but thou shall have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteousness, are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when we were come forth out of Egypt; how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindermost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary: and he feared not God.\" Notwithstanding that the children of Israel had often grieved the Lord by departing from his counsel, he still had a tender care for them. The Lord Jesus Christ saw their enemies taking advantage of their circumstances, to do them an injury; for that work was to bring suffering against the weary, who were journeying under God's leading. Hear the judgments which God pronounced: \"Therefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.\"",
