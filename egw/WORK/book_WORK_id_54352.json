    "word": "MR No. 1518 - Locate Sanitariums Away From the Cities\n\n     (Written May 10, 1906, from Sanitarium, California, to the Doctors Kress. Selections from this manuscript have appeared in Manuscript Releases 435, 714, and 787.) \n\n\n     We have your recent letter. I need not wait for reflection before saying that I believe the best plan is that of first strengthening the work in Adelaide. The climate is more healthful, and the spiritual atmosphere much more favorable than that of Melbourne. This is the way that the matter has been presented to me, but I hoped you would decide the matter from your own judgment. I believe that after placing the whole matter before the Lord, the brethren will come to a harmonious decision. The Lord understands all our necessities.",
