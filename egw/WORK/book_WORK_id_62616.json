    "word": "As the colored people have not been educated to read and have not been uplifted, their religion is more of bodily exercise than inward piety. There can not be anything like the kind of labor pursued toward them as that bestowed upon the people whose religion is not outward workings. The Lord will look upon this poor, neglected, downtrodden race with great compassion. Everything of a character to set them in a position of opposition to authorities, as working on Sunday, would cause the colored people great suffering, and cut off the possibility of white laborers going among them; for the workers that intended to do them good would be charged with raising insurrections.",
