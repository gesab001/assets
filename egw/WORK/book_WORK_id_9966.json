    "word": "He who is imbued with the Spirit of Christ abides in Christ. The blow that is aimed at him falls upon the Saviour, who surrounds him with His presence.

Nothing can touch him except by our Lord's permission, and \"all things\" that are permitted \"work together for good to them that love God.\"",
