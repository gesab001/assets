    "word": "Clothed with humanity, Christ performed a work that revealed the invisible Father in order that His disciples might understand the meaning of the prayer, \"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.\" But how many \n\n\n                                  -110- \n\nwho claim to be His followers concede to a worldly policy! This is because their hearts are not filled with a love for the truth. They are not pursuing uncorrupted principles. God's purpose in committing to men and women the mission that He committed to Christ is to disentangle His followers from all worldly connivings and policy, and to give them a work identical with the work that Christ did, that they might continually be Christ's representatives in character (John 17:18, 20, 23).",
