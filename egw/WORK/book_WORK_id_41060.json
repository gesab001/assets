    "word": "Students should be willing to work under Dr. Kellogg, heed his suggestions, follow his advice, go as far as possible in thought, training, and intelligent enterprise, but never infringe upon a rule, never disregard one principle, that has been interwoven in the upbuilding of the Institution. The dropping down is easy enough; the disregard of regulations is natural to the heart inclined to selfish ease and gratification. It is so much easier to tear down than to build up. One man with his careless ideas, may do more in this work of letting down the standard than ten men with all their efforts can do to counteract and stay the demoralizing influence. This easy-going, convenient religion is a cheap affair, unacknowledged of God. It is as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.",
