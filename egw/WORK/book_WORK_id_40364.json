VII, VIII.]\n\n\n                  In Times of Adversity \n\n     The publishing work was founded in self-denial, and should be conducted upon strictly economical principles. The question of finance can be managed, if,  when there is a pressure for means, the workers will consent to a reduction in wages. This was the principle the Lord revealed to me to be brought into our institutions. When money is scarce we should be willing to restrict our wants.--Volume VII, p. 206.",
