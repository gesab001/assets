    "word": "Jesus requires of the parents in Los Angeles a thorough change of their attitude in the home. He has entrusted them with the responsibility of training their children for Him. These children are His property, and by diligent training of their capabilities, they are to be carefully improved, that not one of them shall be lost. This responsibility no father or mother can safely neglect. If they shirk the God-given work which they should do in the church in their own house, God will be robbed of the influence which should be exerted for Him in the home and out of the home. By failing to bring their children up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, parents rob God of His entrusted talents.",
