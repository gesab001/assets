    "word": "We have before us in the Word of God instances of heavenly agencies working on the minds of kings and rulers, while at the same time Satanic agencies were also at work on their minds. No human eloquence, in strongly-set-forth human opinions, can change the working of Satanic agencies. Satan seeks continually to block the way so that the truth shall be bound about by human devising; and those who have light and knowledge are in the greatest danger unless they constantly consecrate themselves to God, humiliating self, and realizing the peril of the times.",
