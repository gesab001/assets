When they saw the beasts come from the forests to the door of the ark, and Noah take them in, they had so long resisted, so long denied the message that God had given them, that they had educated themselves to resist; reason was perverted by gratification of appetite and low, carnal amusements; they denied the Lord God that bought them, and conscience had become unimpressible.",
