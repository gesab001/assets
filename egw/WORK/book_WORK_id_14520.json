The leaders are concealing the true issue, and many who unite in the movement do not themselves see whither the undercurrent is tending. . . . \n                                                                           126\nThey are working in blindness. They do not see that if a Protestant government sacrifices the principles that have made them a free, independent nation, and through legislation brings into the Constitution principles that will propagate papal falsehood and papal delusion, they are plunging into the Roman horrors of the Dark Ages.--RH Extra, Dec. 11, 1888.",
