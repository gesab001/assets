    "word": "The workers in the Southern California Conference need to be minute men. No one is to exalt his own judgment or entertain the thought that he can carry the work in his own way. My (592) brethren, when difficulties arise, do not leave the Lord out of your councils. Self-ruling will bring no strength to the church. A worker may magnify self to large proportions, but in doing so he will bring embarrassment to the work, and give an example to the church that God never designed it should have.",
