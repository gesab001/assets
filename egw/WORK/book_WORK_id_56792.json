    "word": "Growth in grace will give Brother Morrison increased ability to comprehend the deep mysteries of the gospel. Those who are in so great a degree unacquainted with Christ are ignorant of the spirit they cherish. They will be dry and Christless. The knowledge of Christ and His Word is the foundation and fullness of all knowledge. Many workers are not now fitted for the position of trust they occupy. They must be transformed by the grace of Christ. God wants to give our brethren another spirit. Without this change they will carry the spirit of irreverence for God and His living Oracles into their work; and if this mold is put upon the work, it will dishonor God. The subduing, softening influence of the grace of Christ must fashion and mold character; then it will be a pleasure to deal justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.",
