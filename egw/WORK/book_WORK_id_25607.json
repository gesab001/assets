    "word": "Mere indolent musing, idle contemplation, is not religion. God requires us to appreciate our varied endowments, and to multiply them by constant, practical use. His people are to be models of correctness in all the relations of life. To every one of us he has given a work to do, according to our ability; and it is our privilege to enjoy his blessing while devoting strength of body and mind to its faithful performance, with his name's glory in view.",
