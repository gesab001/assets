    "word": "In regard to the book on Christian temperance, that portion that was expressed in reference to drug medication as though it was recommended by me is not according to the light that I have been given to present to the people. I must, if I made this statement, have done so in expressing the idea of working away from the use of all drugs concocted at the apothecary. We have no use for them. We should not vindicate the use of drug medication. I did not wish to prejudice the medical fraternity that I could not in my writings approach them, therefore have kept quite silent in reference to the sharp points which I can express. If it is thought that the sentence will not misstate my position, let it stand. But if, knowing of my true position in reference to drug medication, any statements in the book contradict it, would be making me to say Yea, and Nay. I do not know as that expression will do any particular harm, but would rather it would have been left out. This is a reform which will be made by Seventh-day Adventist practitioners. I feel deeply over every matter on which warnings have been given us.",
