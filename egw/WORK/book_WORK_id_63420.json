    "word": "From the light given me by the Lord, I know that the teachers connected with the Berrien Springs school walked out by faith, depending wholly on God's promises. They have made mistakes, it is true, but they have not allowed these mistakes to stop their work; instead, they have turned their mistakes into victories, by learning wisdom from their errors, and by avoiding them there after. The Lord helped them, gave them courage, and increased their faith.",
