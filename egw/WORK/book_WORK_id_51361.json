    "word": "Matters of disunion have been managed in a reckless way, and as a result the church has become weak, and that love that should exist between brethren has died out of the heart. There has been so much pride of heart and stubbornness of will among those who professed to be the followers of Christ, that He has been dishonored. Shall not self be crucified? Shall not Christ abide in the heart by living faith? Oh, that God would imbue His church with His Holy Spirit; but He cannot do this without the cooperation of the church. He who would have the Lord work for him, must yield his will wholly to the will of God. He must become as a little child. It is impossible to do this unless the heart is yielded to God.",
