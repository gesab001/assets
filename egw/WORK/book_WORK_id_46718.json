    "word": "After you left us we began to enquire of the Lord what He would have us to do, or where we should publish, and it was shown me in vision that James must lay his hand to the work and strive to open the way, and if the way should bend before him, he must remain; but if it was shut up and did not open, we must go elsewhere. James has been doing as God showed me he must do, and the way has opened before him so that the first paper will be off today, and will be folded and in the office tomorrow morning. He does his publishing at Saratoga, nine miles from here. We have not yet got a house. We shall get one as soon as possible near the Springs, where it will be only a few miles from the printing office. We expect our friends this week from Maine, and in about three weeks shall be entirely settled, if not before.",
