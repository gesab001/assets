    "word": "It is God's design that His name shall be honored before the heavenly universe. The whole earth is to show forth His infinite glory. He is gathering from this earth a people for Himself. His will is the law of the universe. He calls upon every human being to cooperate with Him. But He forces no one. He has placed man's destiny in His own hands, telling him that his future welfare depends on his choice. To be saved, he must cooperate with God in His work of restoration.",
