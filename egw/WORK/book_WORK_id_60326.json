    "word": "When it came to the purchase of the Loma Linda property, Sister White again led out in urging that quick action be taken-- exceedingly quick action, in fact. There were a few men whose faith led them to wish to act; but the greater portion of the men in responsibility (714) in the Southern California Conference, and some counselors in the Pacific Union Conference, refused to act. The president of the Southern Calif. Conference, after consulting with some of his associates, even instructed the others not to act, save on their own individual responsibility. But, in this instance, the counsel of the Spirit of Prophecy to act, prevailed, after that memorable meeting in Los Angeles, when Elder Irwin held up before the Conference brethren the situation that the brethren in Australia had had to face when Sister White counseled them to persevere in an effort to build up a thoroughly-equipped training school for Christian workers, \n\n\n                               -400- \n\nnotwithstanding their inability to see light in all that was outlined before them. As Elder Irwin recounted the special providences connected with the establishment of the Cooranbong school, and how every specification that had been outlined regarding the future work and prosperity of that school, had been met, the hearts of the brethren in responsibility in Southern California gathered courage, and the Loma Linda enterprise was recognized as a Conference enterprise.",
