    "word": "Elder Andrews, our first missionary to Europe, was a self-educated man. I do not think he was in school a day after he was eleven years old. He almost always kept in his pocket a book treating on some language that he desired to understand, or on some historical or scientific subject; and as he went about his daily work, he would keep referring to this book. Whenever he had a little spare time, he would take out the book and improve his leisure moments by studying.",
