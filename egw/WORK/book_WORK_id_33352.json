    "word": "The Lord would have teachers in the Sabbath-school work who can give whole-hearted service, who will increase their talent by exercise, and make improvement on what has already been attained. The Lord would have working Christians in His church; for the worker has fewer temptations than those who have little to do. Those who truly believe in Christ will become laborers together with God. They will be governed by His Spirit; their affections will be purified, their passions will be controlled, and precious fruits will appear in their lives for the glory of God; for those who truly believe in Christ will reflect light. New light will ever be revealed on the Word of God to him who is in living connection with the Sun of Righteousness. Let no one come to the conclusion that there is no more truth to be revealed. The diligent, prayerful seeker for truth will find precious rays of light yet to shine forth from the Word of God. Many gems are yet scattered that are to be gathered together to become the property \n54\nof the remnant people of God. But light is not given simply to be a strength to the church, but to be shed upon those who are in darkness. The people of God are to show forth the praises of Him who hath called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. Christ has said of His people, \u201cYe are the light of the world,\u201d and it is the mission of light to shine out and illuminate the darkness.",
