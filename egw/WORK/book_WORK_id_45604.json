    "word": "Our ministers must cease to dwell upon their peculiar ideas, with the feeling, \"You must see the point as I do, or you cannot be saved.\" Away with this egotism! The great work to be done in every case is to win souls to Christ. Men must see Jesus on the cross; they must look and live. It is not your ideas they must feed upon, but it is the flesh and blood of the Son of God. He says, \"My flesh is meat indeed.\" \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" John 6:55, 63. The soul that accepts Jesus places himself under the care of the Great Physician, and let men be careful how they come between the patient and the Physician who discerns all the needs of the soul.",
