    "word": "We, Willie and his mother, can see at present no light to leave this country for America. We cannot see any light in leaving the work unfinished.

We must see the school buildings erected--buildings plain, substantial, economical, appropriate for the place. We shall work to this end until the Lord calls us to another location.",
