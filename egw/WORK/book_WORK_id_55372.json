    "word": "Danvers, Massachusetts, Sabbath, December 13, 1890 \n\n     Meetings commenced in the church at half-past ten o'clock. Brother Robinson preached, then Sabbath school. I spoke at half-past two o'clock from 2 Corinthians 3:18 and 2 Corinthians 4:17. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon me and upon the people. I then called for all to come forward who were convinced that they must have a deeper work of grace in their hearts. Everyone in the house responded but two. . . . I went to four young men and I pleaded with them to make a decided effort to make this move and say, I will give myself to Jesus. Three went forward; one did not go. We had a very earnest season of prayer.-- Ms. 51, 1890, p. 9 (Diary 16, p. 386). \n\n\n                                     -44-",
