    "word": "It becomes us to search our hearts carefully and have every wrong purged away from us that we may be pure and holy, and stand in the clear light of God, where we can shed a holy influence. We love you as we ever have; should be pleased to hear from you, but much more pleased to see you. I hope and pray that the enemy may make no more inroads. Strive hard to preserve union \n\n\n                                    -224- \n\namong you. Where there is union there is strength, and God will work among you, by you, and through you, if you will only strive to be wholly consecrated to God and be at peace among yourselves, and each one strive with all his might to keep the victory over self and over every besetment, every wrong word and action.--Letter 1, 1851, p. 1. (To Brother and Sister Preston, October 19, 1851.)",
