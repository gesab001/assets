    "word": "\"Every moment of the life of a Christian should be one of high-souled integrity. The speculations that have been entered into are a shame to the cause and work of God. We have a most solemn message to give to the world. The Lord is coming. The end of all things is at hand. Everything connected with the Review and Herald Office should be clean and pure, holy and undefiled. In every action we perform we are to keep the eye single to the glory of God. All dishonest intriguing, all secret plans to obtain the advantage in the dealing with the writers of books [there is the point], wraps up a curse in the heart of the one who entertains such suggestions; and the larger the advantage gained, the more decided will be the disapproval of God.",
