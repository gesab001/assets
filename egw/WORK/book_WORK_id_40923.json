Shine. \n\n\n             Fernando, California, April 21, 1907. \n     If ever there was a time when we needed to understand our spiritual condition and our present duty it is now. As we look about us we see that truth is fallen in the streets, and equity can not enter. Satan has come down in great power, to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish. Everything that can be shaken will be shaken; that those things which can not be shaken may remain.",
