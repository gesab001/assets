    "word": "You are handling sacred things, and the spirit and word and influence you carry are making impressions upon the minds of others. The atmosphere which surrounds the soul, if it is evil, will be like a spiritual malaria, which will be poisoning to those around. But it is profitable for the soul to have an atmosphere that will be as a savor of life unto life to others. When the soul is weighted with the truth which works by love and purifies the soul, a heavenly atmosphere will pervade the soul. \"He that walketh with wise men, shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.\" Every one who claims to believe the truth should manifest uprightness of character, devotion to God, steadfastness of purpose, and represent the character of Christ in a well-ordered life and godly conversation, you should render service to God with an eye single to his glory. You should cultivate true respect for every soul with whom you come in contact, because the soul is of great value with God. Saints and sinners are to be treated with courtesy, with kindness, with love, that Christ has manifested for all souls. He died that we might live.",
