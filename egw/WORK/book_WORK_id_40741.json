    "word": "Loving Labor for the Master. \n\n     Our Redeemer is to see of the travail of His soul, and be satisfied; how is it with those who profess to be His followers? Will they be satisfied when they see the fruit of their labors? What are the members of the church doing, to be designated \"laborers together with God\"? Where do we see travail of soul? Where do we see the members of the church absorbed in religious themes, self surrendered to the work and will of God? Where do we see Christians feeling their responsibility to make the church prosperous, a wide-awake, light-giving people? Where are those who do not stint or measure their loving labor for the Master?",
