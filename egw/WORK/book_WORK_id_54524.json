    "word": "God would have all your idols abolished. Begin the work of sowing while you are continually gathering up the seed to be sown, ever educating your God-given powers that they may do better service. Sow beside all waters. Illumination must be given; religious inculcation of ideas is essential through our schools, through the press, for this is a most important instrumentality proportioned to the extent of its far-reaching knowledge communicated. Work, work with brain and with strength and with heart, and God will open the way and bless every effort. Press the work, urge it forward. Let self die. Let Christ live in you in every effort made.",
