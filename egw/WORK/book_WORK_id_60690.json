    "word": "Many girls from sixteen to twenty years of age are unskilled in cookery or in any other kind of domestic labor. These girls can eat, sleep, and dress; they can use their fingers in doing fancy-work; but they claim that labor over a washtub makes them sick. Cooking they do not understand. \"Mother prefers to cook,\" they say. Why does she?--Because her daughters have not chosen to help her. They have not been trained to enjoy the doing of home duties and are as unfitted to become wives as are babies.",
