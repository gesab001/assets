    "word": "A Training for Bible Work \n\n     The great work of opening the Bible from house to house in Bible readings gives an added importance to the Sabbath school work, and makes it evident that the teachers in the schools should be consecrated men and women, who understand the Scriptures, and can rightly divide the word of truth. The idea of holding Bible readings is a heaven-born idea, and opens the way to put hundreds of young men and women into the field to do an important work, which otherwise could not have been done. \n                                                                           84",
