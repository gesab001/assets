    "word": "The Melrose Sanitarium has come into our possession in the providence of God. It has excellent water privileges, and is located in a beautiful park, which is kept up by the city without expense to us. The advantages of this institution have been kept before me. I desire that the mind of the Lord in regard to it may be met, and that its influence may extend as a light to the city of Boston. Time is rapidly passing, and the enemy is pleased to see the work for these large cities delayed.--Letter 106, 1910, p. 2. (To Dr. D. H. Kress, October 23, 1910.)",
