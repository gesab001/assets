    "word": "The Lord sees that great reforms are needed in this country. The people must be educated in right lines. In this work trials will come, but everything that possibly can be done must be done to keep our special work among ourselves, as far as the outlay of means is concerned. We are not to place ourselves as the helpless prey of the powers of darkness. Those who believe in Christ will be tried. Their faith and love, patience and constancy, will be proved. But God is their helper.",
