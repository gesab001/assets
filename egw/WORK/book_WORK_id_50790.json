    "word": "Everything that can be devised will be devised to hinder the work to be done in the Southern states. Let us not put any hindering hands on those of God's workers who are seeking to accomplish a work for the people in that field. The Lord has laid no such burden as this on any of His people. Let us not devote our talents to hindering the work by our criticisms, but let us seek to advance the work in every line possible.",
