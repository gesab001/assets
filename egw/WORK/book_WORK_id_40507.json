    "word": "Devoted service is to be shown in saving the souls for whom Christ died. We are to be unsparing in our efforts for those who are perishing out of Christ. He, the Redeemer of the world, can and will save the souls of all who will come unto him. We can never imitate Christ in this work, but we can co-operate with him in his great plan.",
