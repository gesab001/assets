    "word": "Parents should teach their children to speak ill of no man. Insinuations, words that hurt the reputation of one who is doing the Lord's work, grieve and dishonor the Saviour. And God's word declares, \"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\" Matthew 12:37. To those who have educated themselves to speak unadvisedly, I am instructed to say: \"Unless you cease encouraging evil-speaking, unless you guard as Christians should the reputation of your fellow-workers, you will endanger your own soul and the souls of many others. No longer talk about the wrong that some one is doing. Never, never, repeat a scandal. Go to the one assailed, and \n                                                                           85\nask him in regard to the matter. God has not appointed any man to be the judge of another man's motives and work. He who feels at liberty to dissect the character of another, he who intentionally detracts from the influence of a fellow-worker, is as verily breaking God's law as if he openly disregarded the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.\"",
