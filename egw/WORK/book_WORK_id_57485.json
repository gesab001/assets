    "word": "God has given the messages of Revelation 14 their place in the line of prophecy, and their work is not to cease till the close of this earth's history. The first and second angel's messages are still truth for this time, and are to run parallel with this which follows. The third angel proclaims his warning with a loud voice. \"After these things,\" said John, \"I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory.\" In this illumination, the light of all the three messages is combined.",
