    "word": "Our brethren in charge of our sanitarium work must not be left destitute of sufficient means to carry on the medical missionary work in an acceptable way. And just now, when our people in Southern California are struggling to build up a strong work in that important missionary field, we should study ways and means of strengthening their hands. I would therefore urge our brethren and sisters to whom the Lord has entrusted the talent of means, to consider the advisability of loaning money to the Paradise Valley Sanitarium, at a low rate of interest, or without interest, so that this institution can be in a position to do, without embarrassment, a thorough work, to the honor and glory of God.",
