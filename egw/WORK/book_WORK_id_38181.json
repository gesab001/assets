    "word": "I ask Thee, heavenly Father, to let Thy Holy Spirit come to this people. May Thy salvation be revealed. Touch their hearts, and make them very tender. Soften them by Thy Holy Spirit, and help them to see the work to be done for their neighbors, and for souls that are perishing all around them. Oh, awaken them to their responsibilities! May they wash their robes of character, and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Wilt Thou encircle them in the arms of Thy mercy? Plead with them through the impressions of Thy Holy Spirit, that they may try to let their light shine to those that have not known the truth. Put Thy church in order, O Lord, that they may labor for souls.",
