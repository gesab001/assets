    "word": "When I learned that Brother [H. E.] Robinson and his wife had been sent to England, I said, It is a mistake. He has not the qualifications that would be of use and benefit in Europe; for unless he can rule, he would ruin. Then his wife's influence would be a very wrong one. There is no light in her. She is a body of darkness, a channel through whom the enemy works, and that continuously. Who placed him in power? Why did they place him in that position? He has left his mark where it has done harm that will not be easily effaced. The Lord help and strengthen you against all such influences.",
