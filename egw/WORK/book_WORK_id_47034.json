    "word": "From age to age Christ had delivered His treasures to the church, and from one generation to another His faithful servants have improved the talents lent them. The gifts that eighteen hundred years ago He placed in the hands of His chosen ministers, the twelve apostles, have descended to His workers in this age. Yet how few of us realize our high privileges, and our true position as ministers of His grace.--Letter 206, 1907, p. 1, 2. (To Elder G. C. Tenney, June 3, 1907.)",
