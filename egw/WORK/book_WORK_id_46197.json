    "word": "Three mornings ago I laid my hand upon several papers, exchanges from America, sent me about two years since. In the New York Observer of August 6, 1896, I saw your name, and the heading, \"Dr. Kellogg's Work, The Workingman's Home, and Medical Missionary Work in Chicago.\" There followed an account of the work then going forward, and the large amount of means required to sustain it. Since that time the work has greatly extended, and of course a much larger amount is required for its support. As I read the article, and thought of these things, I could understand the light given me by the Lord as to what the principles of truth and righteousness would lead the sanitarium supporters and workers to do; that they should make it their first business to aid the work in this country, where the Lord has sent experienced workers fitted to carry forward His work. . . .",
