    "word": "I am now looking over my diaries and copies of letters written for several years back, commencing before I went to Europe, before you [Mabel] were born. I have the most precious matter to reproduce and place before the people in testimony form. While I am able to do this work, the people must have these things to revive past history, that they may see that there is one straight chain of truth, without one heretical sentence, in that which I have written.--Letter 329a, 1905, pp. 1, 2. (To Mabel White, November 16, 1905.)",
