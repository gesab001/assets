    "word": "With the work of scattering our publications and advocating the truth, you have mingled scheming, buying, and selling. This makes a poor combination. As you labor to obtain advantages for yourself, you are allured by the \n\n280 \n\nprospect of buying things below their value and selling them above their value. Therefore the world regards you as a sharper, a man who will gain advantage for himself without considering the case of others. You do not keep the commandments of God, for you do not love your neighbor as yourself. If you had loved God with all your heart, you would not have had these dishonest principles to contend against. This greed for advantage is greatly to your spiritual injury. By indulging it you are placing yourself where poverty will come to you unless you are thoroughly converted.--Lt 3, 1878.",
