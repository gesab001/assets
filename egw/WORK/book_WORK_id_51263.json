We met him in Stanmore at our camp meeting. This meeting was indeed a meeting of great interest, and the interest is being followed up as well as can be done to bind off the work here in Sydney. There must be no lax movements done, after an interest has been created in any place. There has been a house selected as a home in every way appropriate for the workers. Some are engaged in selling papers, small books, and pamphlets, and others who are experienced--Brother and Sister Haskell, Brother and Sister Starr, and Brother Baker--are engaged in meetings and holding Bible readings, and calling on the people as they are invited.",
