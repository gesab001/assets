    "word": "God would have His workers treat their vocal organs with special care, as a precious gift from Him. These organs are not to be abused by over-taxation. Let great care be shown in their use. Then the discourses given will be more impressive, and those who speak will be enabled to do more work for the Master. There are men who have gone down to the grave because they did not take pains to be in harmony with nature's laws in their use of the vocal organs.",
