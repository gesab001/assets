    "word": "When Ministers and Their Wives Work Together, Both Should Receive Remuneration--Again and again I have repeated the instruction the Lord has given me concerning the opening of new fields, that our large cities might hear the truths of the third angel's message. Yet with all the urgent calls that have been made our brethren are not yet turning their attention to this work with the determination and earnestness that the importance of the case demands. A great work will be done in our cities when more earnest plans are laid for the furtherance of the cause of present truth in these places.",
