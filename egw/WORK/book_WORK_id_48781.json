    "word": "Humility \n     God needs all-sided men, men who will keep the windows of their soul open heavenward, and let His light shine into the chambers of the mind. The Lord has a large interest in His servants, and especially in those who are lowly in heart. He makes impressions upon the minds of the humble workers. They are just as precious in His sight as those who carry large responsibilities and who look with superiority upon those who do not stand in such exalted positions.--Manuscript 115, 1899, p. 5.",
