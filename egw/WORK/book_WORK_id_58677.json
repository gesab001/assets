    "word": "I speak to all who have any part to act in the work of the Nashville Publishing-house: Be converted. When you are converted, your tongue and your lips will be used to the glory of God. The value of the talent of speech will be fully recognized. Those in Nashville who desire to sit in heavenly places with Christ must be soundly converted in their ministry. Brethren and sisters, sweeten up. Be bright and shining lights, whatever your position. I bear this message to all the workers in the Office. Christ's presence must be manifested in your spirit, your words, your deportment.",
