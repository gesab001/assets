    "word": "\"When we began our work at this school, eight years ago, the students were earning about $2,000 a year in the industrial work; that is, they were working sufficient to receive a credit of $2,000 a year. That work has steadily grown from that day to this, until, when our last statement was drawn, Sept. 30, \n                                                                           378\n1908, it was shown that the students, during the preceding year, had earned $20,000 on their education.\" [NOTE.--AT THE 1913 GENERAL CONFERENCE, PROFESSOR MACHLAN REPORTED CONTINUED PROSPERITY IN THE INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS AT AVONDALE. \"THE INDUSTRIAL FEATURE OF THE COLLEGE,\" HE DECLARED, \"IS A MOST INTERESTING AS WELL AS A MOST VALUABLE ONE. LAST YEAR FIFTY-FIVE PER CENT OF THE STUDENTS PAID THEIR ENTIRE EXPENSES IN LABOR, THIRTY-FIVE PER CENT PAID ONE HALF THEIR SCHOOL FEES, WHILE ONLY TEN PER CENT WERE FULL-PAYING STUDENTS.\"] (BULLETIN, 1913, P. 154.) . . . Since the inauguration of the 'Christ's Object Lessons' work, we have never called for a penny of donations from the field. We believe that when the Lord says that an industrial school can be conducted successfully, financially as well as otherwise, the only thing for us to do is to take hold and prove that what He has said is true.",
