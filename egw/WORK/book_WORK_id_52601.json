    "word": "Candid consideration is to be given to the matter of establishing a sanitarium in southern California. One thing is certain: This sanitarium is not to be established in the city. This I have said repeatedly. Establish it where there is ground for cultivation, where the patients can have opportunity for healthful exercise. Outdoor exercise, combined with hygienic treatment, will work miracles in restoring health to the sick. It is not according to the Lord's will to establish our sanitariums in the city. It may sometimes be necessary to begin the work in the city, but in such cases it should be carried on in rented buildings until a suitable location can be found outside the city.",
