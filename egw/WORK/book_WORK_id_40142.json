    "word": "Young girls who have not been properly educated at home, and who are wanting in reserve, modesty, and decorum, come to the institution to receive treatment. . . They have practiced evasion and deception and will continue the same \n                                                                           3\ncourse at the institute if they can do so without being discovered. They are ready to flirt with young men; and some who are bearing responsibilities, who should have set them a better example, because of their long Christian experience, engage in the same folly. Some of the young ladies belonging to the health institute accept the attentions of strangers who are of as little worth as themselves--men who are corrupted. This familiarity will be carried on, if allowed, until the influence of the institution is injured. Even if the parties go from the place a secret correspondence is often kept up between them, while the parents of the girl are in ignorance of the matter. The guardians of the institution must maintain a high standard, and watch carefully the young entrusted to them by their parents, whether as patients, as helpers in the various departments, or as learners. When young men and women work together, a sympathy is created among them which frequently grows into sentimentalism. If the guardians are indifferent to these matters, lasting injury will be done to these souls, and the high moral tone of the institution will be compromised. If any, patients or helpers, continue their deception after having judicious instruction, they should not be retained in the institution, for their influence will affect those who are innocent and unsuspecting; young girls will lose their maiden modesty, and will be led to act deceptively because their affections have become entangled. . . .",
