    "word": "It is impossible to estimate the power of a praying mother\u2019s influence. She acknowledges God in all her ways. She takes her children before the throne of grace and presents them to Jesus, pleading for His blessing upon them. The influence of those prayers is to those children as \u201ca wellspring of life.\u201d These prayers, offered in faith, are the support and strength of the Christian mother. To \n197\nneglect the duty of praying with our children is to lose one of the greatest blessings within our reach, one of the greatest helps amid the perplexities, cares, and burdens of our lifework.",
