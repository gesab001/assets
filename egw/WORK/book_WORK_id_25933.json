    "word": "John, so far from being jealous of the prosperity of Christ's mission, rejoices as he witnesses the success of the work he came to do. He assures his disciples that his special mission was to direct the attention of the people to Christ. \"He must increase; but I must decrease. He that cometh from above is above all. He that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth. He that cometh from Heaven is above all. And \n                                                                           69\nwhat he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.\"",
