    "word": "The workers God sends into his field will if they have the true missionary spirit be more anxious to do their work than to get the wages. But because of this, they should not be neglected. The work of those in missionary fields calls for more self-denial than the work of those employed in our institutions, who are not obliged to travel from place to place. Many calls are made upon those who begin work in a new field, and these workers are to be supported in accordance with their work. There should be more equality between the wages of those in our institutions and those who in missionary fields where there is no resources to draw from, are wrestling with difficulty, doing the hardest and most laborious work. \n                                                                           119",
