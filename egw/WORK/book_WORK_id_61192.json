    "word": "It is not safe to place men in the position God should occupy; for men cannot be trusted. If they do not constantly live as in the presence of God, if they do not walk humbly before God and their brethren, they will diverge almost imperceptibly, and by slight degrees, from the straight line of God's work. Trusting to their own wisdom, they will deceive themselves and their fellow-men. Their ideas become so confused that they offer strange fire before the Lord.",
