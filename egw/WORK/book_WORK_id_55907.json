    "word": "There are men who lie in their graves today who ought to be alive, and there are those who are going there--and what is the reason that God does not raise them up to health? The Lord wants us to learn our lesson, that we cannot use up the vital energies unreasonably and exhaust them just as though we had to do the work and there was not any God in heaven, and we are determined to make a success even at the cost of our lives. But I tell you we must believe that God does the work, and we should enlist Him in our work. Say to Him, Your Word has said it, that you will be with us always. I do not feel that animation I would like to feel, but God has said it and it will be done. Then, in a straightforward manner, give the practical lessons of Christ for which the people are starving to death.",
