    "word": "The High Standard for the Conference President \n     You need sanctifying grace. I tell you, my brother, you need to reach a higher standard. Your position and work require you to be a guide and example to others in patience, longsuffering, kindness, and compassion. You need to be closely connected with God. In order to bear your responsibilities aright, you must be an ever-growing Christian. Your faith must be strong, your consecration complete, your love perfect, your zeal ardent. You must make steady advancement in the knowledge and the love of Christ that you may witness in those under your charge the precious fruits of the Spirit. You need spiritual discernment. Keep the eye single to the glory of God, that your profiting may appear unto all.",
