    "word": "When Dr. Paulson showed me the location that had been secured for sanitarium work at Hinsdale, I was thoroughly pleased; for this place answered to the representations that had been given me of places that would be obtained by our people for sanitarium work outside of the large cities. Time will show that such properties as this can be used to a far greater advantage than buildings in Chicago; for the wickedness of Chicago is as the wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah. It was also represented to me that there were other places near Chicago, but away from the city, which the Lord would have His people secure. There are souls to be reached. The message must be proclaimed. This is the light that has been given to me. \n                                                                           52",
