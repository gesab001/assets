    "word": "Those placed in positions of responsibility should patiently seek to make others familiar with all parts of the work.  This will reveal that they do not desire to be first, but that they are glad to have others become acquainted with details, and to become as efficient as they are.  Those who faithfully fulfill their duty in this respect, will, in time, have standing by their side a large number of intelligent workers whom they have trained.  Should they shape matters in accordance with narrow, selfish conceptions, they would stand almost alone.--Review and Herald, December 4, 1904.",
