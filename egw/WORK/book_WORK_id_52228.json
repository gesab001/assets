They will seek to pacify their conscience by some substitute of their own contrivance; but the books of heaven tell the story. The large wages they accepted for themselves and vindicated the acceptance of for others, they no more earned or needed than did some of those whom by their decisions they were limiting to a certain sum without a word of inquiry as to whether this would cause suffering or not. Is this doing as they would be done by? Is it loving their neighbor as they love themselves?",
