    "word": "Transplanting Requires Wise Nurserymen \n\n     Prepare workers to go out into the highways and hedges. We need wise nurserymen who will transplant trees to different localities, and give them advantages, that they may grow. It is the positive duty of God's people to go into the regions beyond. Let forces be set at work to clear new ground, to establish new centers of influence wherever an opening can be found. Rally workers who possess true missionary zeal, and let them go forth to diffuse light and knowledge far and near.--Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 118.",
