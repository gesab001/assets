I saw that all have something to learn, an experience to obtain for themselves, and if the servants of God stand ready to reprove for all these little things they will try to please the servants of God, and yet they have not learned by their own convictions that these things are wrong. Their experience depends upon the one that reproved them. They look to and depend upon him to have an experience for them. Their trust and dependence is taken from God.",
