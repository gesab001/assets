    "word": "The world is now realizing the sure results of transgression of the law of God. His work of Creation completed, the Lord rested on the seventh day, and sanctified the day of His rest, setting it apart as the day which man should devote to His worship. But today the world is largely disregarding the law of Jehovah. Another day has been instituted in the place of God's day of rest. The human agent has set his way and his will against the positive teachings of the word, and the world is plunged in rebellion and sin.--Ms 117, 1908, p. 2.
