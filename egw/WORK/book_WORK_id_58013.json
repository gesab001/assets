June 10, 1894. \n\nDear Brother Olsen:- \n     I am much worried over Willie's case. He has altogether too much to do. He has to prepare communications to go to America and to the various fields here in this country; he must give counsel in regard to the foreign work; he must give counsel in regard to important movements here, sitting in committee meetings late at night; he is forced to neglect his writing, and then must sit up till mid-night to run the type writer, the work constantly urging and pressing him. Now if you have a desire that he shall be preserved to the cause of God, I request you to furnish him a man to help him. If the cause cannot afford to do this, I shall, as his mother, demand of him to change his course of work decidedly. He needs far less to do, but he has no thought for himself.",
