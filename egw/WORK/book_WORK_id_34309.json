    "word": "You are indeed labourers together with God, and will you seek most earnestly to answer the prayer of Christ that you may be one as He is one with the Father? Let there be no dissensions among you. When each wants to have his own way, disparaging the methods of others, the tendency is to bring great confusion into the work. Each becomes discouraged, and this leads to the discouragement of others who are quick to discern any variance. This is a bad example to set, especially in a new field, where everything should move like well-regulated machinery, the work of one matching the work of another, thus manifesting that you are \n22\nGod's instrument. If you fully realize the importance of God's work, you will not work in opposition one to another.",
