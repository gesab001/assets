    "word": "I was urged to send Sister Houlder to Battle Creek. My purse paid her expenses, for her soul was in peril. Then I have paid, I do not know just how much, for Brother Lacey to go through his studies. Sister Caro has carried Brother Pomare, which has consumed large sums of money. I promised her I would help her bear the burden of expense, not expecting that he was to be kept years in gaining an education to work among his own people. Willie, now in New Zealand, states that he has sent for drafts from London and Battle Creek, for sixty pounds to be paid to Sister Caro to relieve her of embarrassment.",
