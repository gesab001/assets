    "word": "God wants intelligent workers, doing their work not hurriedly but carefully and thoroughly, always preserving the humility of Jesus. Those who put thought and painstaking into the higher duties, should put care and thought into the smaller duties, showing exactitude and diligence. Oh, how much neglected work is done, how much leaving things at loose ends because there is a constant desire to take on greater work. The work is slurred over that relates to the service of God, because they pile so much work before them that there is nothing done thoroughly. But all the work must bear the scrutiny of the Judge of all the earth. The smaller duties connected with the service of the Master assume importance because it is Christ's service. --Letter 48, 1886.",
