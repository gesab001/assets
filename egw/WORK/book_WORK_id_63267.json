    "word": "In connection with the Southern work, transactions have taken place that never should have been permitted. Money that was called for to use in breaking up the ground in places that have never been worked, was appropriated to places where work has been carried forward for some time. It was wrong not to allow the means given for opening new fields, to be used where the people supposed it would be. Every facility, every advantage, should be given to the men whom the Lord has appointed and fitted to enter new territory. Men who by past experience know how to plan and devise methods for doing a work similar to the work that has already been done in several places. Every hand should be outstretched to encourage the workers and to prepare the way before them. Liberal gifts should be made in response to the calls for means to advance the great work that must be one in this field, a field where the greatest difficulties must be met and overcome.",
