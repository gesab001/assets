    "word": "In educating the children and youth, teachers should not allow one passionate word or gesture to mar their work, for in so doing they imbue the students with the same spirit which they themselves possess. The Lord would have our primary schools, as well as those for older students, of that character that angels of God can walk through the room, and behold, in the order and principle of government, the order and government of heaven. This is thought by many to be impossible; but every school should begin with this, and work most earnestly to preserve the spirit of Christ in temper, in communications, in instruction, the teachers placing themselves in the channel of light where the Lord can use them as His agents to reflect His own likeness of character. The teachers may know that, as God-fearing instructors, they have helpers every hour to impress upon the hearts of the children the valuable lessons given. \n                                                                           171",
