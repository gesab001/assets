    "word": "Take the case of a man who claims to know the truth, but who neglects the duty plainly specified in the Word of God. He does not watch and pray. He does not make the Lord his Counsellor. He becomes self-sufficient, acting as if his wisdom and strength and knowledge were sufficient for his needs. He fails to improve his talents, disqualifying himself for the sphere of usefulness he might have filled in the Lord's work.",
