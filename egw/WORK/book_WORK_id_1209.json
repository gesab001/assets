    "word": "To Convert Worldly Youth.--Years ago school buildings should have been erected in other places besides -----, not large buildings, but buildings suitable for church schools, in which the children and youth could receive a true education. The lesson books used should be of a character to bring the law of God to the attention. The Bible should be made the foundation of education. In this work the light and strength and power of the truth will be magnified. Youth from the world, whose minds have not been depraved by habits of sensuality, will connect with these schools and will there be converted. . . . This kind of missionary work, I am instructed, will have a most telling influence in extending the light and knowledge of truth.",
