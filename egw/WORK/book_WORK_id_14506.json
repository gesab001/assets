    "word": "Madison, Tennessee \n\n     I was surprised when, in speaking of the work they wished to do in the South, they spoke of establishing a school in some place a long way from Nashville. From the light given me I knew that this would not be the right thing to do, and I told them so. The work that these brethren [E. A. Sutherland and P. T. Magan] can do, because of the experience gained at Berrien Springs, is to be carried on within easy access of Nashville, for Nashville has not yet been worked as it should be. And it will be a great blessing to the workers in the school to be near enough to Nashville to be able to counsel with the workers there.",
