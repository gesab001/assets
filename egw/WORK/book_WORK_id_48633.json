    "word": "We should bring God into all our counsels, and not make moves unless we have the enlightenment of God. Plead with God. Importune Him for light, for wisdom, and for counsel, that every move may be made in God. If this is so, less haphazard work will be done. There will be less to tear down, less to go to pieces, more steady, firm, thorough work done, and more power in what is done. We do not pray in humble dependence one half as much as we should. We cannot afford to make a mistake in this matter where eternal interests are involved.--Letter 9, 1884, pp. 1,2. (To S. N. Haskell, cir. 1884.)",
