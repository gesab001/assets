May 1, 1906. \n\n\n     I am now charged to write out the straight testimony which was given to me Monday night. I am to withhold none of it. I am to say to ministers and physicians, We must have a work done among us who bear the gospel message. We need the power of the truth in the soul. The close of this Earth's history is drawing near, and our work has not extended into the highways and byways as it should have done. In very many places the gospel message must be given in all its power, and in such a way that souls will be aroused. A spirit of self-sacrifice must take possession of ministers and physicians; every one must do a self-denying work. Souls are perishing in their sins.",
