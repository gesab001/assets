    "word": "In Balaclava I had great freedom in speaking to the people. I spoke to them eight times, to the church in Geelong twice, to the North Fitzroy church three times, to the Office workers once, and to the managers. We had most solemn seasons reading to the responsible men the principles to be maintained in the Echo Office. In every branch there was much that needed to be separated from the Office and commercial work brought in of a character that will not belittle the mind and give it food that will be as a poisonous malaria. This labor was very severe upon me.",
