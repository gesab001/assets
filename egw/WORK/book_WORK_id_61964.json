    "word": "When Brother Chadwick was connected with the office at first, he needed a decided change in his character; he needed the gentleness of Christ. His connection has not been to his advantage, or to the benefit of those with whom he was connected; but the atmosphere he has breathed, the words, the precepts, and the example of strong minds and firm wills, sat in the wrong way, brought to the front objectionable traits in his character. He has become sick at heart and desperate in impulse when opposed, and he is man with another spirit. Saul became another man, because the Spirit of the Lord rested upon him, and he had another heart given him. But in the case of Brother Chadwick, the change is of a different character, and from a different source. I have no words to speak individually, to the men from whom this influence has come; my words must be spoken to them as a whole. It is not to be left to them to repeat my words as they have done, interpret them as they please, and thus transmit them to others. I wish to present the matter to them from my own lips as God has presented it to me. How long shall blindness be upon men who have evidence piled on evidence that the Testimonies are indicted by the Spirit of God to his people? How long shall men in positions of trust fail to discern how and where God is working? Eyes have they but they see not, ears have they but they hear not, understanding have they, but they understand not the things of God. Reproofs should not harden you, for \"Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty; for he maketh sure, and he bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands maketh whole.\"",
