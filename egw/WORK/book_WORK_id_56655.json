    "word": "I believe that Jesus is interested in all this assembly. He is here today. He says, \"Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\" He is with you and that to bless. We want the blessing, and why should we not have it? We are to meet the moral darkness that is in the world, and we must meet it as Christ did. We must reveal Christ to all who are around us. When we do this work we are abiding in Christ and Christ is abiding in us, not only when we speak of Him, but He is with us all the time to help us on every point, to press back the power of moral darkness.",
