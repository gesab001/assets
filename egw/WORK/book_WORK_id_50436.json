    "word": "I want to say that from the light the Lord has given me, we must remove temptation. We have come out of the Bible order. The women in Bible times were to take care of the women, and in childbirth cases they should be educated to take their position. We want to be fitting for heaven. We do not want to open any door of temptation. We do not want to do this, but to take the position that right is right, and that we can manage this matter if we will. We should have the women educated to do their work intelligently, and we need not speak of the men because they are already provided for. But \n\n\n                                   -116- \n\nthen men should not take what belongs to the women's work, and that was God's plan.",
