    "word": "I was shown that a larger work could be accomplished if there were gentlemen physicians of the right stamp of mind, with proper culture, and thorough understanding of every part of the work devolving on a physician. The physicians should have a large stock of patience, forbearance, kindliness, and pity; for they need these qualifications in dealing with suffering invalids, diseased in body, and many diseased both in body and mind. It is not an easy matter to obtain the right class of men and women fitted for the place, who will work harmoniously, zealously, and unselfishly, for the benefit of suffering invalids. Men are wanted at our Institute who will have the fear of God before them, and who can administer to a sick mind, and keep prominent the health reform from a religious standpoint.",
