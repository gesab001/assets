    "word": "I have some things to say to you. Do not exhaust your strength by giving long discourses. Search the Scriptures. Seek God in earnest prayer, that when you stand before the people, you may realize the solemn weight of the message which you are about to bear. Talk to the people in simplicity. Let your discourses be short. Handle only a few points, saving your vitality for house to house work.",
