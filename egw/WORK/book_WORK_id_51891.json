    "word": "It is very strange that some of our brethren should feel that it is their duty to bring about a condition of things that will bind up the means that God would have set free. God has not laid upon them the responsibility of coming in conflict with the authorities and powers of the world in this matter. This business is not to close up the avenues. Let the Lord work in that line. The restraining hand of God has not yet been withdrawn from the earth. The four angels are holding the four winds. Let the leaders in the work bide their time, hide in Christ, and move and work with great wisdom. Let them be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves. I have repeatedly been shown that we might receive far more favors than we do in many ways if we would approach men in wisdom, acquaint them with our work, as though we had a right to expect them to help in the best and greatest enterprise in our world, and give them an opportunity of doing those things which it is our privilege to induce them to do for the advancement of the work of God. --Letter 11, 1895. \n\nEllen G. White Estate, Washington, D. C. September 2, 1986. Entire Letter.",
