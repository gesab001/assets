    "word": "A. T. JONES--HERE IS THE POINT, AND IT IS MADE MORE FULLY AFTERWARD: THAT THEY WORK UNTIL THE BOOK IS BROUGHT UNDER THEIR CONTROL, AND THEY MANAGE TO ABSORB ALL THE PROFITS THEMSELVES. THAT WAS DONE WITH BROTHER SMITH AND \"THE MARVEL OF NATIONS.\" AND FOR YOU BRETHREN TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE--I DO NOT NEED TO SPECIFY THE PARTICULAR BOOKS. I HAVE SPECIFIED ONE. I CAN GIVE YOU AN ITEM ON ANOTHER AS I RECEIVED IT. I REFER TO SISTER STUTTLE'S BOOK, \"MAKING HOME HAPPY.\" SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE RECEIVED $150 FOR THAT AT PUBLICATION; $50 MORE WHEN FIFTEEN THOUSAND HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED OR SOLD, WHATEVER IT MAY BE; $100 MORE WHEN TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND ARE SOLD; $100 MORE WHEN THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND ARE SOLD; $100 MORE WHEN FIFTY THOUSAND ARE SOLD; THEN AFTER THAT NOTHING. NOW I WANT TO KNOW (AND YOU NEED NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION; BECAUSE THERE IS NO ANSWER TO IT), WHY SHOULD SHE RECEIVE SOMETHING UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND BOOKS, AND AFTER THAT GET NOTHING? JUST AS CERTAINLY AS TEN CENTS A COPY IS HER DUE UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND, SO CERTAINLY TEN CENTS IS \n                                                                           24\nHER DUE AFTER FIFTY THOUSAND, AND NOT YOURS. THE SCHEME ON THAT BOOK GIVES YOU AFTER FIFTY THOUSAND \"COMPLETE CONTROL\" AND \"ALL THE PROFITS,\" THE VERY THING THE TESTIMONY SAYS IS WRONG.",
