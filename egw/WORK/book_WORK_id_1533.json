    "word": "There have been times when a crisis has determined character. . . . There are workers who have put out their spiritual eyesight. They cannot distinguish between the sacred and the common. Their voice is the loudest when they are in the enemy\u2019s service. It will be greatly to their credit to keep still. This is their strength. Silence is their eloquence. It means very much to every person whether he or she is on the Lord\u2019s side of the question or on Satan\u2019s side.",
