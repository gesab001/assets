    "word": "\"I appeal to all who have means to make a determined effort to carry out the instruction God has given regarding the establishment of a sanitarium in Takoma Park. Let our people rally to the support of this important enterprise. Let the churches in every State act their part, that the work in Washington may not come to a standstill. Let us make liberal gifts to this work, and the Lord will bless us in it. We can not see this work coming to a standstill while it is but half done. It need not come to a standstill if all our people will come up to the help of the Lord.",
