    "word": "Satan has come down with great power to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish. The powers of deception are working upon minds in every country to gain a foothold. Satan is seeking to hedge up our way in this country. The night of trial, the night of weeping, the night of persecution for the truth's sake is not far distant. It is through much tribulation that we shall stand as faithful sentinels for God, not swerving one hair from truth and righteousness. Famines will increase; pestilences will \n\n\n                                    -383- \n\nsweep away thousands. Danger are all around us from the powers without and satanic workings within, but the restraining power of God is now exercised.",
