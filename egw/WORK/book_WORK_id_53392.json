    "word": "All who have taken knowledge of Jesus Christ will imitate Him in their manner of instruction. They will not have hard words, difficult to understand, but will aim to do no surface work, be short in every address, and not labor to exhibit themselves but to come directly to the point to inculcate ideas which are of value, and every word used should be so plain that the children need not go home and get a dictionary and search out the meaning of the words used by teachers and superintendents. The strength of the educator is in being understood, that he shall not need an interpreter. The less there is of machinery and forms that are really not necessary, the better it will be for the school.",
