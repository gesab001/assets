    "word": "I would be pleased to have you come here to Australia. This seems to be a new world. Great changes have been made here since we first broke the soil three years ago this coming September. We have had very close work in regard to means, and still have. We are hoping, eagerly hoping, that the Lord will hear our earnest prayers and furnish us means to build a hospital in Cooranbong. We need it so much. The poor people here know not how to take care of themselves. Sara McEnterfer is called out quite frequently to treat the sick. It is a great tax on her, and we can ill afford to have her away so much.",
