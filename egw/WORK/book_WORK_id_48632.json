    "word": "Much Prayer to be Offered Before Decisions Are Made.-- Many men are better off to take care of their little families [and] do what they can by home influence than to extend their efforts and influence in a broader capacity. They are far better adapted to move in a narrow sphere. To uproot them and send them adrift, because they flatter themselves they can do something, is a wonderful mistake. We must have sharp discriminating powers, and there must be much prayer offered \n\n\n                                     -10- \n\nbefore decisions are made. Things are accepted as in God's order that are not in His order. There must be much prayer in every move made, in every man chosen for a particular work. There are mistakes made. Finite judgment, without the counsel of God, makes sad blunders.",
