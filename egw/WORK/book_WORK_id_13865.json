    "word": "The work of the minister is not simply to preach, but it is to visit families at their homes, to pray with them, and open to them the Scriptures.  He who conducts the work outside the pulpit in a proper manner will  accomplish tenfold more than he who confines his labor to the desk. When  Christ was teaching on earth, he watched the countenances of his hearers, and  the kindling eye, the animated expression, told him in a moment when one  assented to the truth. Even so should the teachers of the people now study  the countenances of their hearers.",
