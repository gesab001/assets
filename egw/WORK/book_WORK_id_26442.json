    "word": "It is the privilege and the duty of every Christian to maintain a close union with Christ, and to have a rich experience in the things of God. Then his life will be fruitful in good works. When we read the lives of men who have been eminent for their piety, we often regard their experiences and attainments as beyond our reach. But this is not the case. Said Christ: \"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.\" \"As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.\" \"He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.\" [John 15:8, 4, 5.] The prophets and apostles did not perfect Christian character by a miracle. They used the means which God had placed within their reach, and all who will put forth a like effort will secure a like result.",
