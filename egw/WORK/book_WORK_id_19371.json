    "word": "Do not be troubled by what other people think or say,...but cling to the Lord; He will never fail you.... We must ever bear in mind that Satan is working hard to secure every soul. We must work on the Lord's side, not giving the least occasion which anyone can take advantage of. ...If words are spoken and charges made to provoke you, the very best reproof you can give is to remain silent, as though you heard not.... We are all to remember that we are under the yoke of Christ, and we must not disgrace our Saviour or the yoke He has invited us to wear. We will just as surely rule our spirit as we wear the yoke.",
