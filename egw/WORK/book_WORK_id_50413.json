    "word": "The Lord Jesus needs in His work men who will stand with their faces to the foe, men who will fight manfully in the aggressive warfare, men who understand that Christ is the Son of God, the Author and Finisher of their faith. The Lord calls for workers, and He will move upon them to go into places where there is promise of obtaining land and cultivating it. Go out in the name of the Lord and feel that as you have made an unreserved surrender, you may ask in faith for guidance.",
