    "word": "God is raising up a class to give the loud cry of the third angel's message. \"Of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them\" (Acts 20:30). It is Satan's object now to get up new theories to divert the mind from the true work and genuine message for this time. He stirs up minds to give false interpretation of Scripture, a spurious loud cry, that the real message may not have its effect when it does come. This is one of the greatest evidences that the loud cry will soon be heard and the earth will be lightened with the glory of God.--Letter 20, 1884, p. 2.
