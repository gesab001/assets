    "word": "You must be constantly learning, constantly advancing. No one can stand in our place and do our individual work. There is no such thing as making a groove for certain brethren to move in; no minister can embrace the work in his finite arms, and dictate how every other one shall labor. You must receive help through any channel by which God may send it. You who have had more experience must teach those of less experience how to work. Take them by your side, educate them, bear patiently with them. Never close the door of the heart by sharp words and unkind criticism. Let the love of God rule in your own hearts, and be communicated to your associate workers.",
