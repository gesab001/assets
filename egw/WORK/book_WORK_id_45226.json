    "word": "The Southern field is in need of humble, God-fearing workers. It is in need of means. Who will rally our people at this time, encouraging them to give all they possibly can for this work? God will be pleased to have not only our own people, but whosoever will, make liberal offerings. Who will teach our brethren to measure their gifts by the spirit of benevolence that led the Father to give His only begotten Son to make us the recipients of eternal blessings? When we allow the Spirit of Christ to guide us in giving, God's blessing will go with our gifts, and wisdom will be given to those who have the responsibility of the disbursement of means, that the best appropriation of the funds may be made.",
