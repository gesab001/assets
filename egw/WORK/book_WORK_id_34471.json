    "word": "9 T.--112 \n     Cooking schools are to be held. The people are to be taught how to prepare wholesome food. They are to be shown the need of discarding unhealthful foods. But we should never advocate a starvation diet. It is possible to have a wholesome, nutritious diet without the use of tea, coffee, and flesh food. The work of teaching the people how to prepare a dietary that is at once wholesome and appetizing, is of the utmost importance.  {TSDF 21.10}  \n                                                         7 T.--55 \n     Wherever medical missionary work is carried on in our large cities, cooking-schools should be held; \n\n22 \n\nand wherever a strong educational missionary work is in progress, a hygienic restaurant of some sort should be established, which shall give a practical illustration of the proper selection and the healthful preparation of foods.  {TSDF 21.11}  \n                                                       7 T.--126 \n     Some, after adopting a vegetarian diet, return to the use of flesh-meat. This is foolish, indeed, and reveals a lack of knowledge of how to provide proper food in the place of meat.",
