    "word": "The warning over the dearth of means shows that sin is upon the people, that selfishness and self-indulgence are eating out the vitals of the people of God. Where is the faith of the people of God? What are they doing? \"Sell that ye have and give alms\" will be proclaimed, and when the Lord sees that men and women are repentant and contrite of heart, that they are willing to be converted from their sins, God will work with them. Read Isaiah 57:13-20. \"For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid Me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart\" [verse 17]. When the people will humble their hearts by repentance and confession to God and the forsaking of sins which have stirred the wrath of God against them, then the Lord will fulfill His word.",
