    "word": "It would not be sensible or right that all the strength of the body should go into a hand. Neither would it be right for all the strength of the working agencies in the cause of the Lord to be used in the medical missionary work. The ministry of the Word must be sustained, and there must be unity in the movements of the whole body, all parts united in carrying out God's plan for the advancement of His work. All the members of the body are to be the Lord's working agencies, every part joined harmoniously with every other part. Letter 50, 1908, pp. 2, 3. (To James Edson White, February 5, 1908.)",
