    "word": "Some parents, because their children say, \"I am tired of the Bible,\" try in every way to manage so that they will have not have so much Bible. I say, Give children and youth the Bible as their study book. God will work with children and youth who give themselves to Him. Samuel was educated for the Lord in his youth, and God passed by the hoary-headed Eli and conversed with the child Samuel.--Ms. 99, 1899, pp. 7, 8, 10. (Talk given on July 20, 1899).",
