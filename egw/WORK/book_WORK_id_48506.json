    "word": "Angels of God are sent to minister to them that shall be heirs of salvation. Angels are co-workers with God's servants in preaching the gospel to their poor brethren. If all would heed the instruction given in the Word, there would be a development of high intellectual attainment and true spiritual refinement of sentiment and manners, for all these things follow in the great result of the renewal of the soul by the grace of Christ. The character is transformed and renewed after the divine similitude.--Letter 165, 1899, p. 7. (To F. E. Belden, October 22, 1899.) \n\nReleased June 21, 1978.",
