    "word": "The brethren in Olcott have been willing to give of their means for the various enterprises; but they have withheld themselves. They have not said, Here am I, Lord, send me. It is not the strength of human instruments; but the power and wisdom of Him who employs them, and works with them, that makes them successful in doing the work that is necessary to be done. The offering of our goods to the Possessor of Heaven and earth, while we withhold ourselves, cannot meet his approbation, or secure his blessing. There must be in the hearts of the brethren and sisters in Olcott a principle to yield all, even themselves, upon the altar of God.",
