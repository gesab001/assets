    "word": "Before a discourse we should take time to seek God by ourselves. That was our custom in earlier times. The ministers would often go away and pray together, and they would not cease until the Spirit of God responded to their prayers. Then they would come away with their faces lighted up; and when they spoke to the congregation, their words were with power. They reached the \n\n\n                     - 21 - \n\nhearts of the people, because the Spirit that gave them the blessing prepared hearts to receive the message. There is far more being done by the heavenly universe than we realise in preparing the way that souls may be converted. We are to work in harmony with the messengers of heaven. We want more of God; we are not to feel that our talking and sermonising is to do the work. Unless the people are reached through God, they will never be reached. We are to rely wholly upon God, pleading His promise, \"Not by might, nor by power; but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.\"",
