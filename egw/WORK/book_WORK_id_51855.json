    "word": "I feel certain that if all the Lord has spoken in reference to these things had been heeded, our institutions would occupy today a higher, holier position. But men have chosen a low level. They have not sought with all their might to rise in mental, moral, and physical attainments. They have not felt that God required this of them, that Christ died that they might do this very work. As the result they are far behind what they might be in intelligence and in the ability to think and plan. They could have added virtue to virtue, and strength to strength, and thus have become strong men in the Lord. But this they failed to do. Let each go to work now with a firm determination to rise. The present need of the cause is not more men, but more man.--Letter 63, 1886. \n\nEllen G. White Estate, Washington, D. C. August 7, 1986. Entire Letter.",
