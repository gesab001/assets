    "word": "After His resurrection, Christ met with His disciples, and for forty days instructed them concerning their future work. On the day of His ascension, He met with the disciples in a mountain in Galilee, where He had appointed them. And He said to them, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; go ye therefore, and teach all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:18-20). It is the privilege of every physician and every sufferer to believe this promise; it is life to all who believe.--Loma Linda Messages, p. 355.",
