    "word": "Count the Cost.--In the production of books containing valuable truth, men have failed to count the cost. They have failed to find out whether the illustrations provided under the representation of larger sales, were absorbing all the means, limiting the power to accomplish the work in other lines, work which needs to be done at once. Close examination should be made of the influence of this work upon the church and the world.--Letter 133, 1899.",
