    "word": "\"We are coming into a place where the enemy will use against our work every advantage that it is in his power to use. We must all depend wholly upon our God, and be in a position where we can follow on to know the Lord, that we may know His going forth is prepared as the morning. In the past, when this matter of large wages has come up for consideration, the Lord has overruled many times, and men have been saved from falling into a snare of the enemy. When men have urged their seeming necessities, we have dealt faithfully with the principles underlying rewards in God's service, and a blessing has attended our efforts. Our brethren have been led to see what the result to the cause would be in a little while, if we acceded to their requests, and they have wisely chosen a better way.\" Ms 14, 1913, pp. 1-4, 6.
