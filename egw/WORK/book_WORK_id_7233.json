    "word": "Deborah  celebrated the triumph of Israel in a most sublime and impassioned song. She ascribed to God all the glory of their deliverance, and bade the people praise Him for His wonderful works. She called upon the kings and princes of surrounding nations to hear what God had wrought for Israel, and to take warning not to do them harm. She showed that honor and power belong to God, and not to men, or to their idols. She portrayed the awful exhibitions of divine power and majesty displayed at Sinai. She set before Israel\n39\ntheir helpless and distressed condition, under the oppression of their enemies, and related in glowing language the history of their deliverance.--ST, June 16, 1881.",
