    "word": "Walling's Mills, Sunday, September 7, 1873. We had a special season of prayer in the log house. Sister Hall and I did a large, two weeks' washing. In the midst of the washing Mr. and Mrs. Laskey with their two children came to visit us. Mr. Walling also came. We laid aside the washing and visited and sewed on a sheet. I made an entire sheet by hand, hemmed three ends of sheet, made a pair of pillow cases. This was my day's work. I had quite a long conversation with Mr. Walling in reference to his children. Mr. Walling tarried with us overnight.",
