    "word": "We have received letters from some that we have never before heard from. There is a great call for publications. The work of the Lord is moving forward.

What we do must be done quickly and we must be very humble or God will not use us in His cause.--Letter 6, 1851, p. 2. (To Brother and Sister Loveland, April 1, 1851.) \n\n\n                                   -253-",
