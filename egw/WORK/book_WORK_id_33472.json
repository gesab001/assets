    "word": "God has a work to do, and I am using all the means that I can spare, and provide myself with home, livelihood, and common conveniences. There are others who gladly and willingly help me in this part of the Lord's vineyard. If all do their duty according to the measure of their responsibilities, the amount entrusted to them will be doubled. He who gives back to God His own will be honored for his fidelity and will hear the Master say, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant.\"  But it is not proper for persons to give just as the notion may strike them. Christ has a right to all that we have.",
