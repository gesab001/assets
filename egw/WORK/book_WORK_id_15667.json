    "word": "God has commanded us, \"Ye shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy\"; and an inspired apostle declares that without holiness \"no man shall see the Lord.\" Holiness is agreement with God. By sin the image of God in man has been marred and well-nigh obliterated; it is the work of the gospel to restore that which has been lost; and we are to cooperate with the divine agency in this work. And how can we come into harmony with God, how shall we receive His likeness, unless we obtain a knowledge of Him? It is this knowledge that Christ came into the world to reveal unto us.",
