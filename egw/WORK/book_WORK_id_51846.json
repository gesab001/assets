But while it is essential that economy be exercised in everything possible, it will be found that the efforts of some narrow minds to save means by employing those who will work cheap, and whose labor corresponds in character with the cheapness of their wages, will result in the end in their loss. The progress of the work will be retarded, and the cause belittled. You may economize, brethren, as much as you please in your personal affairs, in building your houses, in arranging your clothing, in providing your food, and in your general expenses, but do not bring this economy to bear upon the work of God in such a way as to hinder men of ability and true moral worth from engaging in it.",
