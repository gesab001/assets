    "word": "Ministers should understand how to keep their bodies in the best condition of health, so that they can recommend the truth to those for whom they labor, and so that when they are called to assemble together, they may know that they are prepared to go. They have no right to go if they are in such a condition of health that they will speak hastily and view matters in a wrong light. They should place themselves where they can judge righteously, where they can voice the words of God. They can thus advance the work more than by all the word-preaching they could do. Practical godliness is of great value.",
