    "word": "Every Pillar to Be Strengthened \n\n\n     The Lord has declared that the history of the past shall be rehearsed as we enter upon the closing work. Every truth that He has given for these last days is to be proclaimed to the world. Every pillar that He has  established is to be strengthened. We cannot now step off the foundation that God has established. . . .There is need now to rehearse the experience of the men who acted a part in the establishment of our work at the beginning.
