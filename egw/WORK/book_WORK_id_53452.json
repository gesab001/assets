Kellogg; Christ, the Great Medical Missionary; Physicians to Labor as Christ Labored\n\n     (Written Nov., 1903, from St. Helena, California, to \"My Brethren Laboring in Battle Creek.\") \n\n\n     I have been wondering why we do not hear from any of you. You must know that we are very anxious to hear regarding the spiritual interests of the work in Battle Creek. I do not understand why you are so silent.
