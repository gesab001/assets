    "word": "How this dependence pleases the Master! How He delights to hear the steady, earnest pleading! . . . With wonderful and ennobling grace the Lord sanctifies the humble petitioner, giving him power to perform the most difficult duties.

It invests with new dignity every word, every act, and links the humblest worker . . . with the highest of the angels in the heavenly courts. . . .",
