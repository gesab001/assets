    "word": "Where we have made a mistake, brethren, is in considering men infallible, no matter what their position, no matter how high a position they may have. It is in considering that men are infallible because the Lord has given them a work to do. Now, if these men were ever abiding in Christ, and Christ ever abiding in them, without any moment that they were separated from Christ, then we could have more dependence than we can today; but we know that frequently they make mistakes and errors. Then shall we judge them because they may make some mistakes and some errors? There is no more dependence to be placed in those than those you count infallible, because there are not any of us infallible. But I tell you what is infallible--the truth of the living God is infallible. And if we can get hold of the truth, and have the truth in us, abiding in us, we shall be sanctified through the truth, and we shall be drawing nearer and nearer to God.",
