W., \n                            August, 1896. \n\nConference Presidents and Counsellors:- \n\n     God gave to Moses special direction for the management of his work. He directed Moses to associate men with him as counsellors; that his burdens might be lightened. Through Jethro the message was given: \"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: be thou for the people to Godward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God. And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way in which they must walk, and the work they must do. Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And let them judge the people at all seasons; and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee. If thou shalt do this thing, and God command \n\n\n                       - 28 - \n\nthee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.\"",
