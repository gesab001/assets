    "word": "Christ came to our world with a consciousness of more than human greatness, to accomplish a work that was to be infinite in its results. Where do you find Him when doing this work? In the house of Peter the fisherman. Resting by Jacob's well, telling the Samaritan woman of the living water. He generally taught in the open air, but sometimes in the Temple, for He attended the gatherings of the Jewish people. But oftenest He taught when sitting on a mountainside, or in a fisherman's boat. He entered into the lives of these humble fishermen. His sympathy was enlisted in behalf of the needy, the suffering, the despised; and many were attracted to Him. . . . And to those who are longing for rest and peace today just as truly as those who listened to His words in Judea, He is saying, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Signs of the Times, June 24, 1897). \n                                                                           168",
