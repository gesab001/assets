    "word": "Our great need as a people is that we come into right relation to God. We cannot afford to let one day pass in which we have not laid hold by living faith on the God of Israel. We need the clear light of the Sun of Righteousness to shine upon us. This light is given to those who keep holy \n\n\n                                    -34- \n\nthe Lord's Sabbath; but we cannot keep this day holy unless we serve the Lord in the manner brought to view in the scripture: \"Is not this the fast that I have chosen, to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\" [Isaiah 58:6, 7]. This is the work that rests upon every soul who accepts the service of Christ.",
