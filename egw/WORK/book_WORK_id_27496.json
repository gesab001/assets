    "word": "Section XII - The Challenge of the Hour\n\nThe advocates of temperance fail to do their\nwhole duty unless they exert their influence by\nprecept and example--by voice and pen and vote--in\nfavor of prohibition and total abstinence.--Gospel\nWorkers, pages 387, 388.\n\n              1. The Present Situation \n\n     A Repetition of the Same Sins.--The same sins that brought judgments upon the world in the days of Noah, exist in our day. Men and women now carry their eating and drinking so far that it ends in gluttony and drunkenness. This prevailing sin, the indulgence of perverted appetite, inflamed the passions of men in the days of Noah, and led to widespread corruption. Violence and sin reached to heaven. This moral pollution was finally swept from the earth by means of the Flood. . . .",
