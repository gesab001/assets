    "word": "The work to be done is the Lord's, and He has entrusted this work to man. Our call to ministry is received from no human being. To every man God has given his work. How careful every one should be not to neglect his God-given work by devoting his mind, his tongue, his influence, to discourage another laborer of God's appointment, and to try to break up a good work. To do this is to fight against God.",
