    "word": "When the soul has been brought to Christ through this personal labor, leave the surrendered, humbled heart for God to work with; let God urge upon him just such service as He sees fit. God has promised that His grace shall be sufficient for every one who will come unto Him. \n39\nThose who surrender to Jesus, who open the door of the heart and invite Him in, will be in safe keeping. He says, \u201cI am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\u201d John 14:6. Possessing Jesus, they will possess truth. They will be complete in Him.",
