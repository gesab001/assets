    "word": "Many things will occur in this day of God's preparation that will be hard to comprehend. I have been shown that the workers will reveal the manner of spirit that moves them to action. Those who manifest the attributes that have been manifested by those who have triumphed over a mistake in their brethren, instead of seeking to encourage and heal, and strengthen those who have erred, reveal the fact that they are walking apart from Jesus, and encouraging the companionship of evil angels. We are bound to stand by those who have made a mistake, and who see it, and acknowledge it. The motives which the Lord Jesus Christ recognizes as pure and holy move us to take this position. If we have the Spirit of God, we will think right thoughts, utter right words, and keep the heart with all diligence lest by one unwise impulse, we shall grieve and distress one of the Lord's chosen messengers. \"Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.\"",
