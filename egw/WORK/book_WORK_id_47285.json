    "word": "The uncultivated, non-producing wastes in the Lord's vineyard are a sad testimony to unfaithful service. The Lord's voice is heard, calling, \"Go, work today in my vineyard.\" Self-denial and self-sacrifice are to be brought into the daily experience of those who work for the Master. Then the parts of the Lord's vineyard which are now so barren and unproductive will be sown with the seeds of truth. Souls will be won to Christ.",
