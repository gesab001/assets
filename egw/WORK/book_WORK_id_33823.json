God does not confine Himself to one man, or to a set of men, through whom to accomplish His work, but says of all, Ye \"are laborers together with God.\" This means that every believing soul should have a part to act in His sacred work, and every individual believer in Jesus Christ is to manifest to the world a symbol of Christ's sufficiency, to represent to His church the higher laws of the future immortal world, and in obedience to the mandates of  Heaven that are without a parallel, they should reveal a depth of knowledge independent of human inventions.",
