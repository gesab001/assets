You need not send Walks and Homes of Jesus when you send the books I laid out.-- Letter 27a, 1876, p. 1. (Written en route from Oakland, California, to Kansas Camp Meeting, to Mary Clough or Mary K. White, who was in Oakland, cir. May 22, [THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY, BY MRS. E. G. WHITE, WILL BE READY IN A FEW DAYS. THIS WORK IS A THRILLING DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST ADVENT, LIFE, TEACHINGS, AND MIRACLES OF CHRIST, AND WILL BE REGARDED BY THE FRIENDS OF MRS. W. AS A BOOK OF ALMOST PRICELESS VALUE.

IT COVERS THAT PORTION OF THE GREAT CONTROVERSY BETWEEN CHRIST AND SATAN, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE LIFE AND MISSION, TEACHINGS AND MIRACLES, OF CHRIST HERE UPON THE EARTH. MANY HAVE ENDEAVORED TO WRITE THE LIFE OF CHRIST; BUT THEIR WORK, AS COMPARED WITH THIS, SEEMS TO BE ONLY LIKE THE OUTER GARMENTS TO THE BODY. HERE WE HAVE, SO TO SPEAK, AN INTERIOR VIEW OF THE WONDERFUL WORK OF GOD DURING THIS TIME. AND IF THE READER HAS A HEART THAT CAN BE IMPRESSED, FEELINGS THAT CAN BE STIRRED, AN IMAGINATION THAT CAN RESPOND TO THE MOST VIVID PORTRAITURE OF THE MOST THRILLING SCENES, AND A SPIRIT TO DRINK IN LESSONS OF PURITY, FAITH, AND LOVE FROM CHRIST'S DIVINE EXAMPLE, HE WILL FIND IN THIS VOLUME THAT WHICH WILL CALL INTO LIVELIEST PLAY ALL THESE FACULTIES. BUT THE BEST OF ALL IS THE LASTING IMPRESSION IT MUST MAKE FOR GOOD UPON ALL WHO READ. IT SHOULD HAVE AN UNLIMITED CIRCULATION. POST-PAID, BY MAIL, AS PER PREVIOUS NOTICES, $1.
