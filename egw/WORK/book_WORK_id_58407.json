    "word": "I want to say something in regard to the work here. Souls are coming into the truth. Last Sabbath several were present at the meeting who have been attending bible readings held in several locations. Two young men by the name of Simons, have taken their position for the truth. Others are interested. But I must write no more now. It is about seven o'clock, and Maggie must copy this tonight, ready for tomorrow morning's mail. \n              Love to your family and to your niece, \n                                                    Ellen G. White. \n         (M. H. Sept. 1, 1896.)",
