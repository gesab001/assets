    "word": "Canvassers should not be taught that one book or one class of books is to occupy the field to the neglect of all others. Among the workers are always some who can be swayed in almost any direction. Those who have charge of the canvassing work should be men of well-balanced minds, who can discern the relation of each part of the work to the great whole. Let them give due attention to the circulation of health books, but not make this line so prominent as to draw men away from other lines of vital interest. It is my prayer that you may not move unadvisedly in this matter and exercise an influence that shall lead men to dishonor God by neglecting the very things essential to come before the people at this time. My brother, you are in danger of self-exaltation; I caution you to walk humbly with God. Seek wisdom from Him, that you may be guided in safe paths.",
