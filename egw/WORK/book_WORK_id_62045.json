    "word": "There are those who say, not only in their hearts, but in all their works, \"My Lord delayeth his coming.\" They show the effect of error upon them by smiting their fellow servants and eating and drinking with the drunken. As in the days of Noah, those who have had great light will show their inconsistency. Because Christ's coming has been long foretold, they conclude that there is a mistake in regard to this doctrine. But the Lord says, \"If the vision tarry, wait for it: for it will surely come. It will not tarry past the time that the message is borne to all nations, tongues and people.\" - Testimony To Elder A. G. Daniells, October 14, 1900.",
