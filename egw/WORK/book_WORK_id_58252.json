He was nearing the close of His ministry upon this earth, and was standing in view of the cross, with a full realization of the load of guilt that must be placed upon Him as the sin-bearer. Yet His greatest anxiety was for His disciples. He was seeking to find solace for them, and He told them, \"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.\" (John 16:7)",
