    "word": "But God's shepherds who are to watch as well as labor for souls, as they that must give an account, cannot work in this way. The chosen missionary must go forth under all circumstances, moving his family from place to place, \n\n\n                     -15- \n\nand from country to country. This moving is expensive. In order to exert a good influence, the wife of a missionary must set a proper example in neat and tidy dress. Her children must be educated and trained with much painstaking effort, for everything must be made to tell in missionary lines. The laborer who represents Christ must dress plainly and yet properly, as becoming a minister of Christ. The ministers of our Conferences can not say they have a home; for they are sometimes in this country and sometimes in that. The people for whom they labor are poor, but Christ came to preach the gospel to the poor. This is the work the Lord's shepherds are to do. Money is consumed in traveling from place to place, in settling and unsettling every few months, in buying household goods and selling them again or venturing transportation. The entire family have no release from their efforts; for they must always appear cheerful and fresh, that they may bring sunshine into the minds of those who need help.",
