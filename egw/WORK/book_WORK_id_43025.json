    "word": "In all the self-denial and self-sacrifice required of us in this work, amid all the unpleasant things that occur we are ever to consider that we are yoked up with Christ, partakers with him if his spirit of kindness forbearance, self-denial, and self-sacrifice. This spirit will open the way before us, and give us success in the work, because Christ is our recommendation to the people. If we meet with hardships in our work, let us look to him who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Then we shall not fail nor be discouraged; we shall endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.",
