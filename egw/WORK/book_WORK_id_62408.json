If true zeal and energy are manifested, this school may become a large educational institution for the colored people in the South. We trust there will be no falling off in the attendance. There should be many more students in the Huntsville School than there has been in the past. But it will be a difficult matter to bring the school up to a high standard and to regain that which has been lost in the past.",
