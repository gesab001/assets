    "word": "The false and the spurious are in the world, and we should closely examine our hearts that we may know whether or not we possess genuine charity. Genuine charity will not create distrust and evil work. It will not blunt the sword of the Spirit so that it does no execution. Those who would cover evil under false charity, say to the sinner, \"It shall be well with thee.\" Thank God, there is a charity that will not be corrupted; there is a wisdom that cometh from above, that is (mark it) first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy, and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. This is a description of heaven-born, heaven-bred charity. Charity hates the sin, but loves the sinner, and will warn him faithfully of his danger, pointing him to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world. Sin is not to be cloaked, but to be taken away. The love that is of heavenly birth is a resistless power, and it can be obtained only by a living connection with God. Would you move the hearts of men, you must come into actual contact with the God of love. God must first take hold of you if you would take hold of others.",
