    "word": "Holy and devout persons, both men and women, are wanted now to go forth as medical missionaries. Let them cultivate their physical and mental powers and their piety to the uttermost. Every effort should be made to send forth intelligent workers. The same grace that came from Jesus Christ to Paul and Apollos, which caused them to be distinguished for their spiritual excellencies, can be received now, and will bring into working order many devoted missionaries. Let not a large number fold their hands, saying, \"O yes, let such and such ones go into untried fields,\" while they themselves put forth no interested, devoted, self-denying labor, and expect the work the Lord has committed to them, to be done by proxy. There are those who, if they will deny self and lift the cross, will find that God will communicate with them as verily as he did with Paul and Barnabas. These are representatives of what very many should be. \"The Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call on him.\" \n\n\n                            Ellen G. White. \n\n\n     Auckland, New Zealand, Feb. 19, 1893.",
