    "word": "MR No. 304 - Spirit of Prophecy Emphasis Week Materials\n\n     Willie came in presenting the most urgent necessity to pay outstanding bills on the building for the Health Retreat. There was a bill for plastering, and the workmen demanded their money. They were outside parties, but had waited patiently. Our brethren were in dire distress, and almost sick, considering the financial dearth. I said to Willie, \"Yes, I will let the money go, and trust in the Lord.\" Well, this morning there was thunder and lightning and a heavy shower. It is still raining lightly. This will help the crops, and the sum was just what was needed. We thank Him for the money which was so much needed, and for the blessing of this long-needed rain. Some of the crops are beyond redemption, but some will be helped.",
