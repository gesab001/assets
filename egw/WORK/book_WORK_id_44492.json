    "word": "The school at Berrien Springs needs the money that the sale of \"Object Lessons\" in its territory will bring. This school is making advancement as fast as possible, but it is in need of funds with which to erect buildings. The Lord is pleased with the energy and zeal with which the school has been conducted, and with the practical education that is given to the students gathered there. Much needs to be done to provide comfortable quarters for these students. Buildings must be erected, and other lines of work carried forward. Will you not remember that, as you do your best to bring in means for the advancement of this school, you are laboring in harmony with Christ?",
