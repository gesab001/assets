    "word": "Concerning the manufacture and sale of health foods in the Southern field, I would say, If the Southern \n56\nUnion Conference will choose men of ability and strict economy to take up this work for the benefit of the cause in the South, it is well. But the greatest wisdom and economy will have to be exercised in order to make this work a success. If proper men are found to take up this work, then let the whole Union Conference take hold with unselfish interest to make their work a success. In this movement I can see that industries may be established which will help the cause in the Southern field. And centers of influence may be established in many places by the opening up of food stores and restaurants. All that men as missionaries for God can do for the Southern field, should be done.",
