    "word": "Chap. XLIX - Across the Pacific\n\n     In his reports and addresses to the General Conference of 1891, Elder S. N. Haskell made very earnest appeals for laborers to be sent to distant lands that he had recently visited; and he was especially urgent that provision be made for the establishment in Australia of a training school for Christian workers. He was profoundly impressed with the importance of having the young people in each great division of the world, trained in their own land for service as colporteurs, teachers, and preachers. He pleaded that teachers be chosen to open a school in Australasia; and also that Mrs. Ellen G. White and her son, W. C. White, spend some time in that field.",
