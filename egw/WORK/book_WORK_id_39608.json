    "word": "There is presented before me the work which has not been done, but which might have been done had those professing to be Christians been Christlike in character. I am bidden to say that all boasting is evidence that Christ's invitation, \"Come unto Me, and I will give you rest,\" has not been heeded. Those who boast show that they are not wearing His yoke, or learning of Him His meekness and lowliness. All pretense is self-deception. When Christlikeness is not revealed in the life, it shows that the Saviour has been excluded from the soul.",
