    "word": "The solemn work of the gospel minister is to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God. If one enters upon this work choosing the least self-sacrificing part of it, contenting himself with preaching, and leaving the work of ministering for some one else to do he need not expect that his labors will be acceptable to God. Souls for whom Christ died are perishing for well directed personal labor, and when the minister is not willing to be a servant of the people, as Jesus has directed in his word, then he has mistaken his calling. . . .",
