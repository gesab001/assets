    "word": "Educate members to be soulwinners.--There is not only danger that those in positions of trust will fail to encourage individuals in trading upon their talents, but there is also danger that those who do little or nothing themselves for Christ, will also seek to discourage some one who is trying to work in the Lord's vineyard. Keep your hands off. Educate every one who is drawing from Christ the streams of salvation. It is not necessary that the Word of God should be disseminated only by a few ordained ministers. The truth must be sown beside all waters.--Sowing Beside All Waters (Ph 78) 37.",
