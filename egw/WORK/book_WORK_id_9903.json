    "word": "Believing a lie will not put any one of us in the way of being sanctified. Should all the ministers in the world tell us that we were safe in disobeying a single precept of the holy standard of righteousness, it would not lessen our obligations nor make our guilt less, if we reject a plain \"Thou shalt\" or \"Thou shalt not.\" We need not think that because our fathers did a certain way and died happy, we may follow in their footsteps and be accepted in rendering the same service and doing the same works that they did.",
