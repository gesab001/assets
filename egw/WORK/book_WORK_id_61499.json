    "word": "Right around the Loma Linda Sanitarium there is a wide field for missionary effort. Redlands is only five miles from the institution, San Bernardino about the same distance, and Riverside a little farther away. These cities are all important places. Elder Simpson has done some work in Redlands and Riverside, and in each a neat little meeting house has been erected. But the Lord has a larger work to be done in these places. In the future I expect to spend a portion of my time at Loma Linda.",
