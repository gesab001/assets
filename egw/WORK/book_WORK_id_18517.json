    "word": "When the disciples related all their experience to Jesus, He understood their need. Their labor had greatly elated and encouraged them, but it had also worn upon them. . . . A desert place did not mean a waste and solitary wilderness, but a place of retirement and quiet, pleasant to the eyes and invigorating to the body. They sought such a place near a favorite resort on the sea of Galilee. . . . The Christian life is not made up of unceasing activity or of continual meditation. . . . He knew that a season of rest and recreation, apart from the multitude and the scene of their labors, would invigorate them, and He sought to withdraw them from the busy cities to a quiet resort where they might have a season of precious fellowship with Him and with each other. . . . The disciples of Jesus needed to be educated as to how they should labor and how they should rest. Today there is need that God's chosen workmen should listen to the command of Christ to go apart and rest awhile. \n                                                                           134",
