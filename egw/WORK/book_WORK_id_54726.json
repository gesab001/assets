    "word": "Nearly every night we supplicate the Lord in your behalf, calling you by name in our family devotions, and I have felt assurance that He who pleads in the courts of heaven in your behalf calls you by name in His work as your Advocate. I know the Lord is nigh; you only believe, and you will see the salvation of God. We have so little faith that I wonder how the Lord can be pleased with us or do much for us. I have been somewhat worn since I returned from Europe, but I am full of love to Jesus and of gratitude for His great goodness to me.",
