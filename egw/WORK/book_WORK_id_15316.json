    "word": "The divine Son of God was the only sacrifice of sufficient value to fully satisfy the claims of God's perfect law. . . . Upon Christ no requirements were laid. He had power to lay down His life, and to take it again. No obligation was laid upon Him to undertake the work of atonement. It was a voluntary sacrifice that He made. His life was of sufficient value to rescue man from his fallen condition.",
