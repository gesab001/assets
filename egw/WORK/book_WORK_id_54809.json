    "word": "Now when the wiseheads officiating in our schools study to run the school upon a sum wholly insufficient, year after year, they are engaged in a work that will bring debts; it cannot be prevented. They have begun this policy in Cooranbong, and the very same results will follow. There is no justice or requirement of God for them to make such loose calculations. They make it necessary to practice the closest economy, and it is not always wise to bring down the diet as a means of avoiding debt.",
