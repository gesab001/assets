    "word": "You tax yourself in writing as well as in speaking. God does not require this. Observe strictly the laws of health, and you will be fresh to do good work for the Master; you will have fresh manna to feed the sheep in Christ's pasture. Preach less; minister more. If one-half your time were given to preaching, and the other half to visiting or resting your vocal organs, you could generally do more good and leave a better impression.",
