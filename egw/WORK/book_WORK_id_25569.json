    "word": "As regards the principle that should guide our people in such matters, I have been instructed that wherever by self-sacrifice and urgent labor the work necessary for the establishment and advancement of the cause has been done and facilities provided, and the Lord has prospered, those in that place should give of their means to help God's servants who have been sent to new fields to go over the same experience, beginning at the A B C of the work. Those living where the work has been established on a good foundation should feel themselves bound to help those in need, by transferring even a great self-sacrifice and self-denial a portion or all of the means which in former years was invested by those living at a distance in behalf of the work in their locality. Thus the Lord designs that the work shall increase. The talents given to his servants are to be doubled by being put out to use in gifts and offerings and the bestowal of influence.",
