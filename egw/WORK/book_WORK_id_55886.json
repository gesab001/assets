    "word": "Many important interests demand attention from the president of the General Conference. He must have a care for the needs of the various branches of the work. Those who have never occupied such a position have faint conceptions of the perplexities upon his mind. Not only our institutions and the church throughout the United States, but the missions in foreign lands, require his thoughtful consideration and decision. If there are not men who will hold up his hands, as Aaron and Hur held up the hands of Moses, he will faint while pressed under the load as a cart beneath sheaves. Neither the mental nor the physical powers can long endure the strain brought to bear upon him.",
