    "word": "We may realize the special blessing of God if we will only believe and pray with living faith. We are too cold, too faithless. We expect too little. Let us draw [near] to God with full assurance of faith, and not be discouraged. We, every one, have an individual work before us, a personal effort to make for our own salvation and the salvation of our fellow men. \n\n\n                                     -321- \n\nWe can do nothing in the great plan of salvation without a living connection with God. We should not rest without the evidence that our ways please God. We have no time to lose. We must be in earnest in this matter; the work of overcoming is not child's play but a reality.",
