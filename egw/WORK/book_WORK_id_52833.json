    "word": "They have not the love of Christ in their hearts. They do not love God or their fellow beings; if they did, they would follow a course that would surround their souls with a sweet, pleasant atmosphere. Into their work they bring harshness and self exaltation, and unless they repent their candlestick will be removed, and their hearts will be as a dark room. The light of the Sun of Righteousness has shone on them, but they would not walk in the light, and it has become darkness to them. They walk in accordance with impulse, like a family of unruly children. They are not kind and considerate, but harsh and unChristlike.",
