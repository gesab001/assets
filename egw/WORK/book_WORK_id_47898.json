    "word": "\"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, and Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. . . . Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as unto Christ; (lest ye be unguarded, and be disrespectful of authority) not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart (working from principle and not from selfish motives or from impulse); \"With good will doing service, as to the Lord; and not to men: knowing that whatsoever good \n\n\n                                    -199- \n\nthing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with Him.\" (Ephesians 4:29-5:2; 6:5-9.) These words of inspiration are to be studied and obeyed. They cannot be ignored or disregarded, not treated with indifference. It is the doers of the Word that are to receive the reward.",
