    "word": "Let me tell you, you do not know Christ. You have not become acquainted with Him. If you would begin to study and labor to know what means you could use to bring souls to a knowledge of the truth, as diligently as you would devise means to work for your own selfish interests, you would be saving souls. Oh, the blood of souls will be upon many here in Battle Creek who have neglected their responsibility. May the God of heaven have mercy upon them.",
