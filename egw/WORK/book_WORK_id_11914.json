    "word": "\"Take Heed\" \n\n     To every young man who enters the ministry, Paul's words to Timothy are spoken, \"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine.\" [1 Timothy 4:16.] \"Thyself\" needs the first attention. First give yourself to the Lord for purification and sanctification. A godly example will tell more for the truth than the greatest eloquence, unaccompanied by a well-ordered life. Trim the lamp of the soul, and replenish it with the oil of the Spirit. \n                                                                           105\nSeek from Christ that grace, that clearness of comprehension, which will enable you to do successful work. Learn from Him what it means to work for those for whom He gave His life.",
