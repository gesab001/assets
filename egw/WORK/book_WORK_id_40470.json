    "word": "This is as true of temporal as of spiritual blessings. The Lord does not propose to come to this world and lay down gold and silver to advance his work. He supplies men with resources, that they may by their gifts and offerings keep his work advancing. The one purpose above all others for which God's gifts should be used is the sustaining of workers in the great harvest field. And if men will become channels through which God's blessing can flow to others, the Lord will keep the channel supplied. It is not returning to God his entrusted gifts that makes men poor; withholding them tends to poverty.",
