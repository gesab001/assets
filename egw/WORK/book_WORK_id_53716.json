    "word": "To every man is given work in the Master's service. Everything the Lord has given you--your time, your money, your influence--is under contribution to God, and is to be employed in the work of soul saving. Thus used, your gifts will increase in power and perfection. But those who refuse to place themselves in the ranks of service range themselves in opposition to Christ.",
