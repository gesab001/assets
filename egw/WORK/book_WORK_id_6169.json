    "word": "Christ points out the way in which those who have wealth, and yet are not rich toward God, may secure the true riches. He says: \"Sell that ye have and give alms;\" and lay up treasure in heaven. The remedy He proposes is a transfer of their affections to the eternal inheritance. By investing their means in the cause of God to aid in the salvation of souls, and by relieving the needy, they become rich in good works, and are \"laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\" This will prove a safe investment.",
