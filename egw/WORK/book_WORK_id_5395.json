    "word": "The Example of Christ [SPECIAL TESTIMONIES, SERIES B, NO. 19, PP. 37-40 (1903).] \n\nDear Brother: \n\n\n     At one time you made the suggestion that if the managers of our institutions offered higher wages, they would secure a higher class of workmen and thus a higher grade of work. My brother, such reasoning is not in harmony with the Lord's plans. We are all His servants. We are not our own. We have been bought with a price and we are to glorify God in our body and in our spirit, which are His. This is a lesson that we need to learn. We need the discipline so essential to the development of completeness of Christian character.",
