    "word": "A Work To Be Done. \n\n     There is a work to be done in the office and in the Sanitarium. There is a work to be done in the churches of California. A different testimony must go forth from lips touched with the live coal from off the altar. When you are in Christ, you can bear a living testimony. But throughout the churches there is selfishness and sin, dishonesty, unbelief, criticism, and faultfinding. It is high time now for you have to awake out of sleep. Believe with all your heart that Christ died for the world, that he died for you, and that you must have an abiding Christ, and carry a message inspired by the Holy Ghost. We read that in olden times holy men spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. This is what we need. This is what we must have. \n\n\n                        [9] \n\nIt is not a divided heart, a monotonous message that we have to bear; it is a living message to dying men. Then talk not of appropriating the tithe, that is to send forth ministers to preach the Word. Go to work, and see if you can not speak words that will melt and subdue hearts. I am terribly alarmed. I say again, put away your unbelief. You make the people selfish and unbelieving, because you talk and act selfishness and unbelief. You are to work now in an opposite direction, after seeking the Lord with all your heart.",
