    "word": "In Battle Creek, especially, should the power of God be felt. Here is the great heart of the work. Every pulsation is felt all through the entire body. If the heart is sound, it would impart health and vigor. If the heart is unsound, if the heart itself is paralyzed, how can its motions be vigorous, and a healthful current be sent through the entire body--through every branch of the work? The spiritual respirations of the heart and lungs of the cause must be deep and full. The life of God must sustain the heart, and through it vitalize the body, until it comes to the full measure of the stature of Christ.",
