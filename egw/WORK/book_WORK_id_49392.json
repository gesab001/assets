    "word": "The Lord requires every person who shall take up responsibility to carry into that work intelligent, trained capabilities and work out his ideas conscientiously according to his previous knowledge and service in schools. The Lord has not designed any one special, exact plan in education. It is the fear of the Lord that is the beginning of wisdom. When men with their varied traits of character shall take up their appointed work as teachers and follow a plan of teaching according to their own capabilities, they are not to suppose they must be a facsimile of those teachers who served before them, lest they spoil their own record. One who has been a teacher many years, if he has not become intelligent in regard to the best way to plan and to carry on the work, then let him thoroughly experiment until he is satisfied, after prayerfully reasoning from cause to effect, that he has the right way.",
