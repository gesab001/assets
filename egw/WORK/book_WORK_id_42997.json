    "word": "Let every one take time to consider carefully; not be like the man in the parable, who began to build, and was not able to finish. Not a move should be made until that movement and all it portends are carefully considered, everything weighed, and he feels that the Lord has something for him to do in educating and training himself to do a more spiritual work in imparting to others that which God has imparted to him. \n\n\n                             -16- \n\nTo every man was given his work according to his several ability. Then let him not move hesitatingly, but firmly, and yet humbly trusting in God.",
