    "word": "It is estimated that about eight thousand dollars will be needed to build, furnish, and equip this addition, including the treatment-rooms.

The treatment-rooms are a positive necessity to the best success of the institution. The main building is all that could be desired. It was in the providence of God that we obtained it at so low a price. Its original cost was about twenty-five thousand dollars. The grounds are well laid out, and beautified by ornamental trees. The climate is all that could be desired. There are no reasons why the sick can not be treated successfully at this institution, but the necessity must be provided.",
