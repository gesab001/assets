    "word": "What we want is to be empty of self. We want Jesus Christ to work in us and by us and through us, and then we shall see the salvation of God. You say, \"I am going to take just the men that are in Michigan.\" Is that the way God works? Not at all. You say, \"Lord, Thou knowest just the men that will help us the most; give them to us, and we will accept them and uphold them.\" That is the way to do, and God will help you in doing it.--Ms. 11, 1891. (MR 900.27)",
