R. Ruster, 2700 State St., Chicago, ILL. He has given me a short history of his conflicts and trials as a canvasser, and his inability to make a success of the business and sustain his family. He states that he has had deep convictions that it is his duty to labor for his own people (colored) but he has incurred debts, and brethren whom he has consulted have advised him to keep at the canvassing work until he gets out of debt.",
