    "word": "PH099 - Testimony for the Churches at Allegan & Monterey (1869)\n\n\n     Dear Brethren:--I have been shown that you are not in the light, as God would have you. In vision I was pointed back to the ingathering of souls at Monterey last spring, and was shown that your minds were not prepared for that work. You were not expecting or believing for the work which was then accomplished among you. This work was carried on, notwithstanding your unbelief, aside from the participation of many among you.",
