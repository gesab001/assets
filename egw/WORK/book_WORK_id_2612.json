    "word": "Drop Responsibilities on Others--I think I have laid out this matter many times before you, but I see no change in your actions.  We want every responsible man to drop responsibilities upon others.  Set others at work that will require them to plan and to use judgment.  Do not educate them to rely upon your judgment.  Young men must be trained up to be thinkers.  My brethren, do not for a moment think that your way is perfection, and that those who are connected with you must be your shadows, must echo your words, repeat your ideas, and execute your plans.--Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 302, 303.",
