Apparently this sister had a general concern for the welfare of Adventist efforts in other areas as well.  Mrs. White replies.\nJuly 22, 1904\nMy Dear Sister __________:\n     Today I received and read your very cheering letter. For the good news which it contained I praise our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Your description of the work being done in Los Angeles agrees with the representations that God has given me. The delay in beginning this work has been very painful to me; but if the work is now carried on in earnest faith, if the truth as it is in Jesus is magnified, if wise personal efforts are made, many souls will be brought from darkness to light. What a work might have been done many years ago! But I thank the Lord for the favorable beginning that has now been made.",
