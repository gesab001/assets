    "word": "There is need of each one in every school and in every institution to be as was Daniel -- in such close connection with the Source of all wisdom that his powers will enable him to reach the highest standard of his duties in every line, that he may be able to fulfill his scholastic requirements, not only under able teachers, but also under the supervision of heavenly intelligences, knowing that the all-seeing, the ever sleepless Eye is upon him. The four Hebrew children would not allow selfish motives and love of amusements to occupy the golden moments of this life. They worked with willing heart and ready mind. This is no higher standard than every Christian may attain. God requires of every Christian scholar more than they have given him. \"Ye are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.\" \n\n\n                                  (Signed) Ellen G. White",
