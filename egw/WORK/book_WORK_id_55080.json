    "word": "Saturday night, April 8, 1876, Oakland, California, Ellen White to Lucinda Hall \n\n\n     Dear Sister Lucinda: [LUCINDA HALL (1839-1929) WAS FOR A TIME EMPLOYED BY ELLEN WHITE AND CAME TO BE ONE OF HER BEST FRIENDS.] . . . My husband writes that an appeal is to be sent to me from the [General] Conference [Session], but I shall not be moved from that which I believe to be my duty at this time. I have a special work at this time to write out the things which the Lord has shown me. We progress finely, but I cannot write more than half a day. . . .",
