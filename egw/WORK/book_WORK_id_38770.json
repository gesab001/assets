They thought it best not to enter the large cities, but to begin work in small places, remote from the cities; here they would not meet so great opposition from the clergy, and would avoid so large expense. They reasoned that since our ministers are so few, they could not be spared to instruct and care for those who might accept the truth in the cities, and who, because of the greater opposition, would need more help than the churches would in small country places; thus the fruit of giving a course of lectures in the city would in a great measure be lost. Again, it was urged that with the little means we have, it would be difficult to conduct the work in such a way as to build up a church that would be a strength to the cause in a large city, where so many changes from moving might be expected. My husband was urging the brethren to make broader plans without delay, and put forth, in our large cities, extended and thorough effort, which would better correspond to the character of our message. One related incidents of his experience in the cities, showing \n\n\n                     - 3 - \n\nthat the work was nearly a failure, but said he could testify to better success in the small places.",
