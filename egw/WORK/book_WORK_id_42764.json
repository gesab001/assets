    "word": "Let men be estimated as men, and not as gods. God has given men the ability to use and increase their talents, and they are to cherish a sense of their moral responsibilities. It may be asked, What shall be done in reference to the work now? Work on correct principles. Let men and women who have a burden to produce books, work to bless the cause of God by the use of their pens. Let them work, and if they have an income from their work, let them make use of that income to do their part in uplifting the standard of truth where God shall direct. Let them seek counsel \n\n\n                      -17- \n\nfrom God. Let them believe the promise of Christ that he will send the Comforter to teach them all things and bring all things to their remembrance. Let them not allow themselves to be drawn into any snare.",
