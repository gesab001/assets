    "word": "God has instructed me to tell you and all His people to be very careful not to resist the working of the Holy Spirit,--the Comforter that Christ sends. Fear to take the first presumptuous step in resistance. When Christ spoke to the disciples of the Holy Spirit, He sought to uplift their thoughts and enlarge their expectations to grasp the highest conception of excellence. Let us strive to understand His words. Let us strive to appreciate the value of the wonderful gift He has bestowed on us. Let us seek for the fullness of the Holy Spirit.--Letter 155, 1902, pp. 5, 6. (To Brother and Sister Arthur, September 5, 1902.)",
