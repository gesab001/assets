    "word": "Home Schools.--If parents are not able to send their children to school, let them hire an exemplary, religious teacher who will feel it a pleasure to work for the Master in any capacity, who will be willing to cultivate any part of the Lord's vineyard. Let mothers and fathers co-operate with the teachers, and devote an hour daily to study, becoming learners with the children. Make the educating hour one of pleasure and importance, and your confidence will increase in the method of seeking for the salvation of your children. Your own spiritual growth will be more rapid as you learn to work for them. As you work in a humble way, unbelief will disappear. Faith and activity will impart to your experience ardor, assurance, and satisfaction that will increase day by day as you follow on to know the Lord, and to make him known. Your prayers will become earnest. You will have some real object for which to pray.",
