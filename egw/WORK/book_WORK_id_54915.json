    "word": "MR No. 1592 - Health Reform to Be Advocated; Great Controversy to Be Promoted Strongly\n\n     (Written September 8, 1889, from Denver, Colorado, to Brother Eldridge.) \n\n     The Lord gave us a prosperous journey. The rain commenced to fall as we reached Chicago, and we did not have much dust, for the rain extended nearly to Denver. We found a neat little encampment and about one hundred people on the ground. We had a good meeting Sabbath. Brother Owen spoke in the forenoon upon the coming of Christ, and I spoke in the afternoon from John 8:11; then we had a social meeting, and many excellent testimonies were borne, and my soul was refreshed. I think it would have been difficult to have spoken to thousands of people, for I was weak, but the Lord helped me to speak His word to the souls present. This is the workers' meeting. The camp meeting proper begins Monday.",
