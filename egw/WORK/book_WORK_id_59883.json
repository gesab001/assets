    "word": "Dr. M. Nicola, Hinsdale, Chicago, Ill. Dear Sister Nicola:- \n\n\n     I read your letter yesterday, and I would say in response, I want you to make straight paths for your feet. I would not have your husband placed where he will be overtaxed. This you must carefully guard against. In writing to you, I did so for the good of both yourself and your husband. Your husband must not take too many burdens upon himself, and you can help in arranging his work, so that this shall not be.",
