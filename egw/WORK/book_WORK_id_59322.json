    "word": "'We need not tie to men in order to secure influence. We need not think that we must have their experience and their knowledge. Our God is a God of knowledge and understanding, and if we will take our position decidedly on His side, He will give us wisdom. I would that all our people might see the inconsistency of our being God's commandment-keeping people, a peculiar people zealous of good works, and yet feeling that we must copy after the world in order to make our work successful. Our God is stronger than any human influence. If \n\n\n                              -15- \n\nwe will accept Him as our educator, if we will make Him our strength and righteousness, He will work in our behalf. . .",
