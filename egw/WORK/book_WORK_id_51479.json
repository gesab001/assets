    "word": "The Lord is to be the great Teacher. His Holy Spirit, if allowed to control, will bring in harmony among the different workers, and the building will be symmetrical in all its parts. And all the glory is to be given to the Lord Jesus, who has had supervision of the whole work. It is foolish for those who are but God's instrumentalities, to take glory to themselves. It is only by the wisdom that God imparts that they are enabled to do successful work. --Letter 227, 1903. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. November 7, 1985. Entire Letter.",
