    "word": "What a great mistake is made in the education of children and youth, in indulging, and favoring, and petting them. They become selfish and inefficient. There is a lack of energy exercised in the little things of life. The character has not been trained to acquire strength in the performance of the every-day duties, lowly though they may be. There is a neglect of doing willingly and cheerfully what lies directly before you to do, which some one must do. There is a great desire with us to find a more exalted, larger work.",
