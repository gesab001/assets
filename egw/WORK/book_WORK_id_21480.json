    "word": "The Call From Human to Divine Employment.--I have repeatedly been instructed that no one should be advised to pledge himself to spend two, three, four, five, or six years under any man's tuition [direction]. . . . Brethren, we have no time for this. Time is short. We are to hold out urgent inducements to the men who ought now to be engaged in missionary work for the Master. The highways and byways are yet unworked. The Lord calls for young men to labor as canvassers and evangelists, to do house-to-house work in places that have not yet heard the truth. God speaks to our young men, saying, \"What? Know ye not that . . . ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore, glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's\" (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20).",
