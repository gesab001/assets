    "word": "Do not preach just that part of the truth that pleases the people.--Paul exhorted Timothy, \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" We are to give the message of warning to the world, and how are we doing our work? Are you, brethren, preaching that part of the truth that pleases the people, while other parts of the work are left incomplete? Will it be necessary for some one to follow after you, and urge upon the people the duty of faithfully bringing all the tithes and offerings into the Lord's treasury? This is the work of the minister, but it has been sadly neglected. The people have robbed God, and the wrong has been suffered because the minister did not want to displease his brethren. God calls these men unfaithful stewards. The charge to his servants is, \"Be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.\" If the under shepherds do their duty with fidelity, when the chief Shepherd shall appear he will give them \"a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\" Daniel saw their reward, and he says, \"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever.\"--RH July 8, 1884.",
