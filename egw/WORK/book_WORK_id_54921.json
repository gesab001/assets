    "word": "It is a duty we owe to our people and to God to send every ray of light given me of God, demanded for this time, to every tongue and nation. I am not pleased with the existing state of things. I am sorry and distressed, and as Brother Belden declares he cannot alter this state of things in his work, I am compelled to see if I can do anything to improve the matter. To wait longer would be a neglect of my duty. I cannot with a clear conscience let the time pass as it is. Nothing scarcely having been done in the east in handling Vol. 4, I have talked with Willie in regard to the Review and Herald handling Vol. 1. He has, I think, set before you his reasons why the Pacific Press should handle it. The reasons are, I think, sound, and the experience that we have had in regard to Vol. 4, the present year shows that there is a consistency in this matter, and a principle which must be maintained.",
