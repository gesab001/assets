    "word": "In the army of Christ there is to be no division. All are to labor for the fulfillment of God's purposes. The work of God is to be carried forward in straightforward, sensible lines for the accomplishment of the will of the great Designer. God Himself has planned His work. Part is to act with part for the carrying out of the great design. All are to labor in harmony under the mighty General of armies. Each worker is to go to God for his orders.",
