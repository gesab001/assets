    "word": "The Madison School is in the very place to which we were directed by the Lord, in order that it might have an influence and make a right impression upon the people. The Lord has been dishonored by the indifferent treatment given to the workers in this school by their fellow workers. They need encouragement and good wholesome fellowship, and they are as verily deserving of it as are other workers in the Southern field. \n\n\n                                (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
