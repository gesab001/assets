    "word": "Early Experiences in Co-Operation \n\n     In our labors together, my husband and I always felt that it was our duty to demonstrate in every place where we held meetings that we were fully in harmony with the workers in the temperance cause.

Invitations would come to us to speak in different places on the temperance question, and I always accepted these invitations if it was possible.-- S-278-1907.",
