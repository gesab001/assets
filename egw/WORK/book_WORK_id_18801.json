    "word": "order versus impressions and feelings\n \n\n     There are many restless spirits who will not submit to discipline, system, and order. They think that their liberties would be abridged were they to lay aside their own\n52\njudgment and submit to the judgment of those of experience. The work of God will not progress unless there is a disposition to submit to order and expel the reckless, disorderly spirit of fanaticism from their meetings.",
