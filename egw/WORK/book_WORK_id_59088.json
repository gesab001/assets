    "word": "There are those claiming to be children of God whose course of action the Lord does not justify. Faithful work is to be done in giving reproof, as well as in giving encouragement. The cross is not to be shunned. No unchristlike course of action to your brethren is to be justified. The time is right upon us when persecution will come to those who proclaim the truth. Those who teach the truth, opening the word of God to others, must surrender self entirely to God. To them the truth will bring its own reward, filling the soul with joy.",
