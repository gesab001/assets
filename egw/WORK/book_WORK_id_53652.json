    "word": "The school at Madison not only educates in a knowledge of the Scriptures, but it gives a practical training that fits the student to go forth as a self-supporting missionary to the field to which he is called. In his student days he is taught how to build, simply and substantially, how to cultivate the land and care for the stock. All these lines are of great educational value. To this is added the knowledge of how to treat the sick and care for the injured. This training for medical missionary work is one of the grandest objects for which any school can be established. There are many suffering from disease and injuries who, when relieved of pain, will be prepared to listen to the truth. Our Saviour was a mighty healer. In His name there may be many miracles wrought in the South and in other conferences, through the instrumentality of the trained medical missionary. Therefore, centers for training must be formed.",
