    "word": "Ellen White Unclear as to Whether She Should Go to Australia--There is much talk in regard to our journey to Australia, but I cannot see my [way] clearly to go. Brethren say that Sister White will have no such burdens to bear as she has here in America, that she can write her books so much more readily without carrying so many responsibilities, but I know it is no use to tell them that all their flattering anticipations in my behalf do not lessen my ideas that going to Australia means work, responsibility to bear a message to the people who are not what the Lord would have them to be. If it were not thus, I would feel authorized to remain in America. As it is I dare not mention the state of things in the Office presented to me, for I am then sure they would firmly conclude I must go.--Ms 29, 1891, p. 1.
