    "word": "At bountiful tables men often eat much more than can be easily digested. The overburdened stomach can not do its work properly. The result is a disagreeable feeling of dullness in the brain. The mind does not act quickly. And when several kinds of food are eaten at the same meal, indigestion is often the result. Some foods do not agree with other foods. A disturbance is created by improper combinations of food, fermentation sets in, the blood is contaminated, and the brain is confused.",
