    "word": "\"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" The Saviour taught this principle to make mankind happy, not unhappy, for in no other way can happiness come. God desires men and women to live the higher life. He gives them the boon of life not to enable them merely to gain wealth, but to improve their higher powers by doing the work He has entrusted to mankind--the work of searching out and relieving the necessities of their fellow men. Man should not work for his selfish interest, but for the interest of everyone about him, blessing others by his influence and kindly deeds. This purpose of God is exemplified in Christ's life.",
