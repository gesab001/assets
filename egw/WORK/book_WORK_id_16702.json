    "word": "Willing to Take Counsel \n\n     No one in an institution, not even the superintendent, should take the position that he is free to follow his own judgment in all things. Let no one think that he knows so much that he no longer needs to learn. Unless we are constantly learning of Christ, and unless we are willing to take counsel and advice from our brethren, we shall fail in our work; for we shall become self-sufficient, and with those who are self-sufficient God cannot work. . . .",
