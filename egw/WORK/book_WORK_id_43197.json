    "word": "Again and again the Lord has pointed out the work which the church in Battle Creek and those all through America are to do. They are to reach a much higher standard in spiritual advancement. They are to awake out of sleep, and go without the camp, working for souls that are ready to perish. The medical missionaries are doing the long-neglected work which God gave to the church in Battle Creek,--they are giving the last call to the supper which he has prepared.",
