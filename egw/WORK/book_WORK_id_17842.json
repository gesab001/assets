    "word": "Let men be careful how they speak to their fellowmen. There is to be no egotism, no lording it over God's heritage. A bitter sneer should not rise in any mind or heart. No tinge of scorn should be heard in the voice. Speak a word of your own; take an indifferent attitude; show suspicion, prejudice, jealousy; and by mismanagement the work will be done for a soul.--Lt 50, 1897. \n\n\n                                                     577",
