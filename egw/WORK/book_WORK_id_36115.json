    "word": "Parents, gather the rays of divine light which are shining upon your pathway. Walk in the light as Christ is in the light. As you take up the work of saving your children and maintaining your position on the highway of holiness, the most provoking trials will come. But do not lose your hold. Cling to Jesus. He says, \u201cLet him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.\u201d",
