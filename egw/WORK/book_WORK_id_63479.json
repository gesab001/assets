    "word": "\"The Lord is grieved. The work can not possibly be adjusted and conducted to his glory unless the workers allow Him to be their helper. Show a loving, generous regard for those who, to advance the work, have taxed their powers of endurance to the utmost limit, laboring almost at the sacrifice of their lives. They have been sustained by the power of God. The Saviour of humanity recognizes the almost superhuman efforts made to press the work forward, while not a few were placing blocks before the wheels.",
