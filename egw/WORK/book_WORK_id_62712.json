    "word": "It is not in God's order that thousands of dollars shall be expended in enlargements and additions in institutions in Battle Creek. There is altogether too much there now. Take that extra means and establish the work in suffering portions of other fields to give character to the work. I have spoken the word of God upon this point.  There are reasons many do not see, that I have no \n\n\n                                 -72- \n\nliberty to open before you now; but I tell you in the name of the Lord you will make a mistake in your adding building to building; for there are being entered in Battle Creek responsibilities that are altogether too much for one location.",
