    "word": "A Letter to Elder Daniells \n\n\n     I send you this morning a letter written for America, and sent there yesterday morning, which will show you how I regard the tithe money being used for other purposes. [See Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 10, pp. 16-24.] This is the Lord's special revenue fund, for a special purpose. I have never so fully understood this matter as I now understand it. Having had questions directed here to me to answer, I have had special instruction from the Lord that the tithe is for a special purpose, consecrated to God to sustain those who minister in the sacred work, as the Lord's chosen to do His work not only in sermonizing, but in ministering. They should understand all that this comprehends. There is to be meat in the house of God, who believe the truth, to give a faithful tithe to the Lord, and ministers should be encouraged and sustained by that tithe. Letter 40, 1897, p. 1. (To Elder A. G. Daniells, March 16, 1897.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. August 22, 1951",
