    "word": "Brother Baker has visited us, and he has received the impression that ministers such as Elder Farnsworth and others coming to the union conference in Sydney must hasten back to their fields of labor to carry on the work in their special conferences. This is not wise calculation. Our ministering brethren are at great expense in coming, and should work together to have the camp meeting thoroughly manned with efficient workers. One or two must not do all the preaching and all the teaching in Bible lines. At times greater good can be accomplished by breaking up the large congregation into sections. Thus the educator in Bible truths can come closer to the people than in a larger assembly.",
