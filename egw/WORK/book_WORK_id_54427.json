    "word": "\"You, as a mother, have suffered much, but you have not failed nor been discouraged. The eldest son has been sorely tempted, and if he had closed his ears and heart to unwise counselors, he would have stood a strong man. Now, after he knows My purpose, the eldest must be transformed and the youngest must stand in the counsel of the Lord. He has borne his test wisely and the Lord will help him to continue the work appointed.\"--Ms 56, 1911. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nOctober 25, 1990.
