    "word": "The Responsibility of Managing \n\n\n     Dr. C has perseveringly worked to hold everything under his control. No longer is he to be allowed to select men to fill official positions in the institution. Only in pretense have the younger men acted as directors or managers. Dr. C is not pleased to have as managers any others than those who will work under him. No longer is the Sanitarium to be thus managed. This order of things is hurting the reputation of the institution, and must be changed. God cannot work through unconsecrated agencies.",
