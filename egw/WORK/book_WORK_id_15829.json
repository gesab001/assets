    "word": "God has ordained the canvassing work as a means of presenting before the people the light contained in our books; and canvassers should be impressed with the importance of bringing before the world as fast as possible the books \n6\nnecessary for their spiritual education and enlightenment. This is the very work the Lord desires His people to do at this time. All who consecrate themselves to God to work as canvassers are assisting to give the last message of warning to the world. We can not too highly estimate this work; for were it not for the efforts of the canvasser, many would never hear the warning.",
