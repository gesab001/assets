    "word": "Plants and Trees, Fruit-bearing, God's Miracle in.--There is the closest connection between God and nature. God works a miracle upon every plant and upon every tree that beareth fruit, and the Lord under the express necessity of the case, can work an instantaneous miracle and prepare food. Nature without God is dead. The continual life of men, of trees bearing fruit, of vegetables, and of every living substance in nature is dependent \n\n\n                                     -353- \n\nupon the active, living, working agency of God. God has a continual relation to this world and to all His people. We have evidence that when men acknowledge their allegiance to God and do their best, by the touch of His hand and the word of His power, the Lord Jesus can multiply a very meager supply of food, making it sufficient for all.--Letter 37, 1895.",
