    "word": "MR No. 362 - Looking to Jesus\n\n     The Lord has a work for each one to do. We are to find out for ourselves what this work is, that we may have the assurance that we are working under the authority of God, as his appointed agencies. No one is excusable for remaining in ignorance. Every man should know his post of duty. He should stand in his lot and in his place, working unselfishly, earnestly, devotedly, with an eye single to the glory of God.",
