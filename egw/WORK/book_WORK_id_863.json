    "word": "Where are the men who will work and study and agonize in prayer as did Christ? We are not to confine our efforts to a few places. \"When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\" Let Christ's plan be followed. He was ever watching for opportunities to engage in personal labor, ever ready to interest and draw men to a study of the Scriptures. He labored patiently for men who had not an intelligent knowledge of what is truth. While we are not awake to the situation, and while much time is consumed in planning how to reach perishing souls, Satan is busy devising and blocking the way.--Medical Ministry, p. 303.",
