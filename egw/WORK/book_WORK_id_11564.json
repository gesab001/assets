    "word": "In foreign fields especially, the work cannot be accomplished, except by well-considered plans. While you should endeavor to labor in harmony with the instructions of those at the head of the work, many unforeseen circumstances will arise for which they could make no provision. There must be something ventured, some risks run, by those on the field \n306\nof battle. There will be crises in which prompt action is necessary. The workers should not in every movement feel that they should wait to receive directions from head-quarters, but after counseling together, with earnest prayer, they should do the best they can under the circumstances. Wherever in the work of reform we can unite with others, in the countries to which we go, it is advisable to do this; but there are some things we shall have to carry forward by ourselves. While we should adapt ourselves to others wherever this is practicable and consistent, there are many things in which the laborers must work in their own way. Hence the greater necessity for union among themselves.",
