    "word": "The people in Battle Creek have not exercised their talents in planning and devising how they may plant the standard of truth in regions where the message has not been proclaimed, and where decided efforts should be made; and the Lord has moved upon Dr. Kellogg and his associates to do the work which belongs to the church, and which was offered to them, but which they did not choose to accept. Some in Battle Creek, instead of taking up the work given them of God, have, by following their own selfish way, blinded their spiritual eyesight and the eyesight of others; and God has placed his precious work in the hands of those who will take it up and carry it forward.",
