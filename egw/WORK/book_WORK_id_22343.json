    "word": "My dear sister, I beseech you to put away all feelings of suspicion and jealousy.  God's eye is over both of you. I am pained because I fear that this letter may possibly be misunderstood; but I am instructed to say to you, Know who your friends are, and appreciate them. When it is necessary for a work to be done in order to reform abuses that have crept into the church, thank the Lord that He has spoken.  And when the Lord speaks to you, thank Him for saving you from future sorrow.",
