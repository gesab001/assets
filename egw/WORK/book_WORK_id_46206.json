    "word": "Through the work of schools and sanitariums the light of the gospel, in clear, steady rays, would have penetrated far and near. The truth of God would have been as a city set upon a hill. If the ensign of truth can be lifted in educational institutions and in sanitariums for the sick, in the islands of the sea and in many countries, more would be accomplished in bringing souls into the truth than can be accomplished by all other methods that can be devised.",
