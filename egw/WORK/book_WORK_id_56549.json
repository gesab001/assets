    "word": "Into the hearts of many who have been long in the truth there has entered a hard, judicial spirit. They are sharp, critical, fault-finding. They have climbed into the judgment seat, to pronounce sentence on those who do not meet their ideas. God calls upon them to come down, and bow before Him in repentance, confessing their sins. He says to them, \"I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. \"They are striving for the first place, and by their words and acts they make many hearts sore.",
