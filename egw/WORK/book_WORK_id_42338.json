    "word": "Unless your heart is stayed upon God, and you are coworker with Christ Jesus, you will be filled with self-confidence, pride, self-sufficiency, and you will be given to the indulgence of self and the sin of unbelief, which so easily besets the soul, and thus you will become the captive of the enemy. You are to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of His own good pleasure. As God works man must cooperate in order that the result designed may be accomplished. But how long have the heavenly intelligences waited in vain for your cooperation, who ought to have been engaged most earnestly in the work of God for this time!",
