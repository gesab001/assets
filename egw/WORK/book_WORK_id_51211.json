    "word": "If a woman's life is connected with one whom God has chosen to be a laborer together with Him, let her consider that she can make her husband's heart tired and his soul sad by her unconsecrated course of action. If self clamors for attention, and unless great devotion is shown to her, she becomes unhappy; she may greatly hinder him in his work. She needs to learn of Christ, who lived not to please Himself. He is our example in all things.",
