Oakwood is not far from her mind.\nAugust 10, 1905\n     The school at Huntsville is greatly in need of help, that young colored people may be prepared to go forth to work as teachers for their own race. This is a great need in the Southern field of an orphanage for colored children. At Huntsville a beginning has been made on a building for this purpose, but the work has stopped for lack of means. A small sanitarium is also needed at Huntsville. Let those who desire to work place their zeal and their efforts where they will tell in supplying a genuine necessity.",
