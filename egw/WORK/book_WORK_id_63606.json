    "word": "I know that one thousand dollars was loaned to the brethren in Nashville to make the first payment on the church building. But I am instructed that the Lord would have been pleased had five thousand dollars been offered them, instead of one thousand. The workers in Nashville need encouragement that they have never received. The way in which the work there has been treated by some has made wounds that should now be healed. The Lord will not vindicate one vestige of selfishness. He calls upon men to act under his supervision.",
