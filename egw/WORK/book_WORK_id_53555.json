    "word": "We must bear a clear, decided testimony against the use of intoxicating drinks and the use of tobacco. In all our large gatherings we must bring the temperance question before our hearers in the strongest appeals and by the most convincing arguments. The Lord has given us the work of teaching Christian temperance from a Bible standpoint. The youth are to be taught the difference between right and wrong.

All wrongdoing leaves the soul open to the assaults of Satan.",
