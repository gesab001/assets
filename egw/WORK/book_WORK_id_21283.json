    "word": "Thus saith the Lord: \"Buildings will give character to My work only when those who erect them follow My \n\n190 \n\ninstruction in regard to the establishment of institutions. Had those who have managed and sustained the work in the past always been controlled by pure, unselfish principles, there never would have been the selfish gathering of a large share of My means into one or two places. Institutions would have been established in many localities. The seeds of truth, sown in many more fields, would have sprung up and borne fruit to My glory.\"--7T 100, 101.",
