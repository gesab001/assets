I was reading in Proverbs 18, \"He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is a folly and a shame unto him.\" I feel deeply [that] we must give most earnest labor through the grace of Christ to work to break up in the church the many words that tend to separate very friends. Let us represent this evil as it is.",
