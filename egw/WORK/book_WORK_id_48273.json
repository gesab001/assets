    "word": "MR No. 566 - Orphanages for Black Children\n\n     This work is not to be despised because the children are colored. Because they are colored, and because they are fatherless and motherless, they are to be brought up with kindness which is revealed in words and actions. There should be no scolding, no extravagant display; none should be treated with indifference, but all should be given respectful treatment, and this will win respectful attention and obedience from them in return.",
