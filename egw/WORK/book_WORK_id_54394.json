    "word": "The next Friday afternoon I drove with Edson and Sara to Napa. I spoke in the tent Sabbath forenoon to a large number. In the afternoon \n\n\n                                     -128- \n\nEdson spoke in regards to the Southern work, and I understand that the Lord gave him freedom, and enabled him to present his ideas with clearness. He spoke again at five o'clock, and left early the next morning for San Francisco. On Sunday morning I spoke for an hour and a quarter. Then after the horses were fed we started on our return journey. Brother McClure rode with us.  {21MR 127.10}  \n     The buggy was not my easy, comfortable carriage, and when we had gone half way, I became very weary and uncomfortable. My hip pained me. I could not sit in any position to relieve it. The pain became almost unbearable, and I changed my position again and again, but nothing gave me relief. I then put the cushions in the front part of the carriage and knelt down, and finally walked a short distance. When I reached the sanitarium, I was unable to stand or walk much.",
