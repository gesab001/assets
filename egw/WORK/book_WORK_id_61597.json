    "word": "For years the Lord has instructed us that we should have a sanitarium in the vicinity of San Diego, where many thousands of tourists come every year. A valuable property was secured at National City at a very small part of its original cost. There is an important work to be done in caring for the sick, and in reaching many with the light of truth. At the Paradise Valley Sanitarium also it was found necessary to add to the original building, and obligation have been made that must soon be met. The Lord has blessed this institution, and some have been converted to the truth as the result of the work already done.",
