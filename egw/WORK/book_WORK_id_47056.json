    "word": "There is a work of reform to be carried on in your family. Your children need to be taught lessons of self-denial. They are feeble children. They have \n\n\n                                     -386- \n\n[not] much constitution to draw upon; therefore the greatest pains should be taken with their diet. They should eat the simplest food at regular intervals. Their appetites and taste should not be consulted at the injury of their stomachs. This has been done too much, and they have been made more nervous and have had less patience and self-control. Their stomachs should be consulted instead of their taste. Digestive organs should not be overtaxed, for they have but little force of constitution to draw upon. Nature should be left unburdened to carry on her work.",
