    "word": "Some will acknowledge the truthfulness of what I have written, but will make no radical change; they cannot discern the deceitful workings of their own hearts, and because of their spiritual blindness they will be seduced by influences that corrupt and ruin the soul. The spell of temptation will hold under its charm those who see and feel not their danger. At every favorable opportunity the adversary of souls will use them as his agents, and will stir every element of depravity which exists in their unsanctified natures. They will manifest a continual tendency toward that which is wrong. Appetite and passion will clamor for indulgence. The habits of years will be revealed under the strong power of Satan's temptations. If this class were many miles from any of our institutions in Battle Creek; the cause of God would be far more prosperous.",
