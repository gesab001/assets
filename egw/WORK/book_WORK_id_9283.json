For years I have been shown that house-to-house labor is the work that will make the preaching of the Word a success. If those interested are not visited by our workers, other ministers get upon their tracks and confuse them by misquoting and wresting the Scriptures. These people are not familiar with the Word; they think that their ministers must be true and unprejudiced men, and they give up their convictions. But if our workers can visit those interested, to explain the word of truth to them more fully, revealing the truth in contrast to error, they will become established.",
