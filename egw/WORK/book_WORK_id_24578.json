    "word": "16-22. Paul Commends Titus to the Corinthians.--Titus has been so successful in raising gifts among the churches in Macedonia that Paul desired him to visit Corinth and continue in the same work. Another brother, \"whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches,\" and still another \"whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things,\" were sent to accompany Titus. Paul wrote a letter to the Corinthians commending to them these brethren who had so willingly undertaken such a difficult task. In this letter he reminded them of an effort that had been put forth a year previous to raise a contribution at Corinth (MS 101, 1906).",
