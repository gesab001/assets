He calls upon you to become humble seekers after Him, to receive the truth into good and honest hearts, and to reveal it in a decided change of character. Let every believer turn his attention toward seeking the Lord, that the church as a body may stand before God in true humility, the souls of the members cleansed from the defilement of sin.",
