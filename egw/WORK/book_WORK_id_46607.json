    "word": "Warnings have been given me that it is not wise to consolidate the Pacific Press with the R&H Publishing House. Time will convince all that this matter is too serious a thing to be trifled with. The Battle Creek \n\n\n                               -440- \n\nPublishing House is not to be the only power among Seventh-day Adventists. It must stand largely alone. The Pacific Press should not be made to fear the influence of the power invested in the publishing house at Battle Creek, . . . so that it shall absorb the Pacific Press, making them one organ. The Pacific Press must stand by itself. The two institutions cannot better advance the work of God in consolidation, as has been contemplated. It is God's will that they stand as independent bodies.",
