    "word": "Satan works every moment to find an opportunity for stealing in. He tells the physician that his talents are too valuable to be bound up among Seventh-day Adventists, that if he were free, he could do a large work. The physician \n\n\n                                   - 54 - \n\nis tempted to feel that he has methods which he can carry independent of the people for whom God has wrought that he might place them above every other people on the face of the earth. But let not the physician feel that his influence would increase if he should separate himself from this work: Should he attempt to carry out his plans, he would not meet with success.",
