    "word": "MR No. 1554 - Testimony Concerning the Work in Ohio; Church Leaders to Be Chosen Carefully\n\n               (Written May, 1863, from Battle Creek, Michigan.) \n\n     I have been shown some things in regard to Ohio. First I was shown the great importance of ministers who profess the truth being especially led and counseled of God, that in all their efforts they may advanced and build up the cause of God, and in order to do this they must be free in God themselves. They must not move from impulse but from principle and sound judgment, and by faithful labor and example lead on the church for whose benefit they are laboring to disinterested benevolence, brotherly love, devotedness to God, self-forgetfulness, and holiness.",
