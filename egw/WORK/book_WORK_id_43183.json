    "word": "You do not fear and love God; you do not tremble at his word; your consciences are becoming hardened and unimpressible; you have not been jealous of yourselves lest you dishonor your Redeemer; you have not been fearful of conformity to the world in your manners, your tempers, and your actions. You have lost reverence for the servants whom God has sent to you with words of counsel, reproof, and warnings. Did you not fear to treat God's messengers with disrespect? What means has God instituted to correct his people and instruct them but by men chosen of God to do his work? \n                                                                           16",
