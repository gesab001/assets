    "word": "But those articles in the Review to be given to the world seem to me a most terrible betrayal of our cause and work in to the hands of our enemies. Some of our people are moving under the control of another Spirit than that of God. The only safe course to pursue is to put in their place those that can give the trumpet a certain sound, and not have false alarms sounded that weaken, perplex, and confuse the people of God in these last days. At this time they now need every particle of energy and clean foresight to discern the wiles of Satan, to meet him firmly, decidedly, and to fight manfully the battles of the Lord. If men in the Review and Herald Office will permit such matter as that of Elder Littlejohn's to go abroad, let them be discharged, whoever they may be. My heart is sick and sore and faint.",
