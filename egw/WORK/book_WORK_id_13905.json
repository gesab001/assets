    "word": "From Frankfort we pursued our journey toward Hamburg, passing through a country diversified with hamlets and cities, mountains, rivers, forests, and cultivated lands. Many features of the landscape are quite unlike America. The farming lands are not divided by fences, and instead of our wide spreading fields much of the land is cultivated in narrow strips, each appropriated to a different crop. In summer the plains appear as if covered with ribbon work of almost every shade of green and brown, giving a very pleasing effect. There are few scattered farm-houses. From the open country we pass suddenly into the midst of high, square blocks, in which the people are crowded together almost as closely as in the most populous cities. The houses are usually large, each containing many families. They are expected to last for hundreds of years, and are built in the most substantial manner, of brick or stone plastered over on the outside. The partition walls and the floors are often of stone or brick, and tile or slate is used instead of shingles for covering the roof. There is little danger of fire passing from one story to another.",
