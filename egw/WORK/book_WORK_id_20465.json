    "word": "Divine grace is needed at the beginning, divine grace at every step of advance, and divine grace alone can complete the work. There is no place for us to rest in a careless attitude. We must never forget the warnings of Christ, \u201cWatch unto prayer,\u201d \u201cWatch, . . . and pray always.\u201d A connection with the divine agency every moment is essential to our progress. We may have had a measure of the Spirit of God, but by prayer and faith we are continually to seek more of the Spirit.\u2014(Testimonies to Ministers, 507, 508.)",
