    "word": "Parents, when difficulties arise in your families, do not speak severely. Often we may pass over the offense as unworthy of notice. If you have been in the habit of speaking in passion; if you have allowed your children to do as they please, you must give account for this to the Master. You must answer for the education you have given them, for the mold of character you have placed upon them. There are none who want to have judgment passed upon them because of neglect. God forbid that you should hear the words spoken to you, \"Depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.\" Rather let us strive that we may hear the blessed words of commendation pronounced upon the obedient.",
