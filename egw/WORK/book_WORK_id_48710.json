    "word": "This work requires money and workers. The tent remains two or three weeks, and then the camp is broken up to do work in other places. A tent must still be left, a mission home secured, Bible workers employed to go from home to home to those who become awakened, convicted, and converted. All classes of people should be labored for, the drunkard, and the tobacco devotee, and the tea drinker, and the coffee user, and all are to be educated in matters of temperance, and from the Word instructed in the law of God. This is the work that God's treasury must sustain. In this work sheaves will be gathered, \n\n\n                                    -87- \n\nsouls converted and baptized and added to the church as in the days of the apostles. No one is to be neglected.",
