    "word": "The trouble is, more men have their own ways and follow their own will instead of God's will and ways. They cripple God's work and have their own ways and customs. But God wants us to have new and increased light every day, and scatter this light upon the pathway of others. May God help us. When the spirit of Christ comes into our hearts this feeling will melt away like frost in the sun. What we want is the sweet, subduing influence of the Spirit of God, and we want self to die and Christ to live in us. We want to grasp the rich promises of God, take up the cross, and yoke up with Christ. He says, \"Take My yoke upon you.\" There is but one yoke for any of us and just as soon as we submit ourselves to Christ then the first song that will break forth from our lips is, \"The yoke of Christ is easy and His burdens are light.\" But if you manufacture a yoke of your own you will find it is heavy and grievous to be borne.--Manuscript 83, 1886, pp. 5-9. (\"Sermon,\" September, 1886.)",
