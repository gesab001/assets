    "word": "The first messengers of the gospel were sent forth with the word, \"The kingdom of heaven is at hand\" (Matthew 10:7). This is our message today. We are to remember that the work of reaching souls cannot be confined to any one method. Gospel medical missionary work is to be carried forward, not in the precision of one man's lines, but in Christ's lines. All that is done is to bear the impress of the Holy Spirit. We are to work as Christ worked, in the same practical lines. Then we shall be safe.",
