    "word": "While short subscriptions are accepted, some will not make the necessary effort to obtain them for a longer time. Canvassers should not go over the ground in a careless, unconcerned manner. They should feel that they are God's workers, and the love of souls should lead them to make every effort to enlighten men and women in regard to the truth. Providence and grace, means and ends, are closely connected. When His laborers do their very best. God does for them that which they can not do for themselves; but no one need expect to succeed independently and by his own exertions. There must be activity united with firm trust in God.",
