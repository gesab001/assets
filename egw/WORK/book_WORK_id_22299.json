    "word": "Your experience should not be ten, twenty, or thirty years old, but you should have a daily, living experience, that you may be able to give to each his portion of meat in due season.  Look forward, not backward. \n                                                                           40\nNever be obliged to tug at your memory in order to relate some past experience.  What does that amount to today to you or to others?  While you treasure all that is good in your past experience, you want a brighter, fresher experience as you pass along.  Do not boast of what you have done in the past, but show what you can do now.  Let your works and not your words praise you.  Prove the promise of God that \"those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.  They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; to shew that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him\" (Psalm 92:13-15).  Keep your heart and mind young by continuous exercise.  -- 2SM 221, 222.",
