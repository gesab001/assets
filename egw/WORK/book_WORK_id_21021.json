    "word": "Experienced Men for Positions of Trust.--It is wisdom to place in positions of responsibility and usefulness only those who give full proof of their ability, who show that they are able to fulfill in a proper way their weighty trusts. Positions have been given to young, inexperienced men, which ought to have been given to men who had an experience gained in the early history of the work. Let positions of trust be given to experienced, God-fearing, proven men, men who will bear the message of reproof sent by God.--Lt 35, 1900.",
