    "word": "Some may say, \"But we have so many trials and difficulties. How can we avail ourselves of this gift, and be overcomers?\" \"Tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.\" Why, then, should we not determine to fortify ourselves against every influence that Satan may bring to bear against us to hinder the formation of Christlike character? The enemy cannot gain possession of us unless we allow him to. If we are connected with the God of heaven, His protection will be over us. Let us, for Christ's sake, begin now to form characters that He can approve. Let us not put off this work until just before His appearing, when it will be too late for us to begin.",
