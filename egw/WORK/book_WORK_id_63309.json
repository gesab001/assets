    "word": "Let the teacher bring love and peace and cheerfulness into this work. Let him not allow himself to become angry or provoked. The Lord is looking upon him with intense interest, to see if he is being educated by the great Teacher. The child who loses his self-control is far more excusable than the teacher who allows himself to become angry and impatient. When a teacher has a reproof to give, let him give it in a soft, gentle voice. Let him be careful not to make the child stubborn by speaking to him harshly. Let him follow every correction with drops of the oil of kindness. His heart should be softened by love and kindness. He should never forget that he is dealing with Christ in the person of one of Christ's little children.",
