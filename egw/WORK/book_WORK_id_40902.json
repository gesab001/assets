    "word": "We may inherit the things prepared for God's people from the foundation of the world, if we will live in harmony with the righteous life of Christ. Let there be no contention, no strife. There is room enough in the world; there is opportunity for all to perfect a Christian character. Let us take hold of this work intelligently. Then when any change takes place in the working of the cause here, it will be seen, in the course taken by the workers, that their dispositions are being moulded by the Spirit of God, that the grace of Christ is sanctifying their characters.",
