    "word": "The word spoken to me by the angel of God was to observe and see that while worship was going on in the house of God on the Sabbath, and the Sabbath was being nominally observed by the people here; while the prayers were being offered to God for His blessing to rest upon the people, and while the minister was talking to the people, there was heard the sound of the hammer and anvil and \n\n\n                                  -90- \n\nchisel, and various sounds. Said the angel, \"This is an offense to God. How can God regard Himself as honored by a people who profess to worship Him, and let His blessing rest upon the people, while these things are going on?\" Well, now, I could not at the time understand what this meant; but since I have come right here upon the premises, I understand it. Here is a blacksmith right here upon the premises who carries his work on right while worship is going on here on the Sabbath day. And while these meetings have been going on I have heard the same sounds that the angel caused me to hear over in America. I have heard the sound of chisel and hammer while we have been worshiping God. And the angel said to me that God could not let His blessing rest upon a people who have so little respect for His Word. Again I was led into different places, and I saw accounts that were being settled up and business that was being done upon the Sabbath day because it was convenient for the people.",
