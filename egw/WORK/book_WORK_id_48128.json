    "word": "Elder Haskell, you and your wife are engaged in a most excellent work. The study of the Bible prepares the mind and judgment to submit to its claims. Humility of mind and heart is of great importance. We are cheerfully to submit to the will of God as expressed in His word. The mind and heart will be sanctified by the reception of truth. As self is surrendered, there will be a delight in doing the will of God. There will be a spirit of willing obedience.--Letter 320, 1906, p. 3. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, October 14, 1906.)",
