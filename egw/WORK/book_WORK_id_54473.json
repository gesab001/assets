    "word": "I am so sorry that you have acted the part of a traitor. You have been in communication with Brother B. You have represented the case of Brother G in such an objectionable light that he uses this to justify himself in his traitor's work. You have, while professedly working for the interest of the H. R., been working against it. You have strengthened the hands of Brother B in an evil course. You have been envious and jealous. You have been doing the work of the great adversary of souls by suffering yourself to be the accuser of your brethren.",
