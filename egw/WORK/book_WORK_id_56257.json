    "word": "Every minister of the gospel needs to understand that those whom the Lord chooses to carry forward a special work in needy fields are to have freedom to solicit means from their brethren. I would that there could be opened before the leading men of the conference that which the Lord has presented to me as the result of the spirit of suspecting and watching and binding about. It has brought hindrances to the work which need never have existed. There have been laborers who were working far beyond their strength and practicing economy in every possible way, who should have been encouraged and supported in their work. But the churches have had sown among them the seeds of suspicion and mistrust against these self-denying missionaries.",
