    "word": "The men who have been connected with the greatest interests upon this earth have tainted and corrupted the work of God. The instrumentalities which he designs shall be used in advancing his cause, have been used to forward unlawful schemes, which are indirect opposition to the work which God has specified as his and which he cannot vindicate. God has been forsaken by the men who have voiced decisions regarding his work, which has thereby become entangled. Men have seemed determined to place the mould and superscription of their human wisdom upon the work of God. They refused to be worked by the Holy Spirit, and brought in their own wisdom and devising. The result of this has been seen in various ways.

These men do not scruple to quote the word of God as their authority, but the god who is leading them is a false god.",
