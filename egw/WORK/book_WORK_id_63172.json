Let its sale go forward, that there may be money for the establishment of schools in this field. I can call upon the officers of the Southern Union Conference and of the Southern Missionary Society to be quick and earnest to take advantage of the present opportunities offered in the gift of \"Christ's Object Lessons\" to the educational work.",
