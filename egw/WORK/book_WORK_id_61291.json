    "word": "George's Terrace, February 6, 1894 \nMr. and Mrs. J. E. White \n\nDear Children: \n\n\n     Since the camp meeting we have settled down in the school building. We are very pleasantly situated in the second story of terrace no. 3. I have a very large room with three ample windows. I sleep in this room, and have plenty of air. The next apartment is the dining room, pleasant and roomy. May sleeps alone in that room. Sister Tuxford and May do the cooking in still another room. We go down a half-a-dozen steps from the dining room, then up two or three steps; first we come to the bath room, then to the kitchen with a gas stove, then to still another room, where Sister Tuxford and Emily sleep and Emily does her work. Our family consists of Sister Tuxford, Marian, Emily, May, and myself. Here we are, well settled, to remain only six weeks; then we must be emptied out, for the fall term of school begins.",
