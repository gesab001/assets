    "word": "Fresh Manna--You have been too anxious to present lines of thought that would bring glory to yourself. You have thought it was necessary to dwell upon subjects which do not enlighten minds in regard to vital truth, or make clearer the way to present salvation. For Christ's sake keep to the point. In every discourse break the bread of life, present fresh manna, lay upon souls the solemn responsibilities that God has placed upon them, and keep in view eternal realities. Call the attention of the people to vital questions, and keep them to the point of decision, asking them, \"What are you going to do?\" Cooperate with heavenly intelligences. When you allow your mind to be diverted from plain lines of truth and to be engrossed with subjects that please your fancy, you are simply losing time. The Holy Spirit does not work with you, and thus you make a mistake.--Lt 29, 1895. \n                                                                           322",
