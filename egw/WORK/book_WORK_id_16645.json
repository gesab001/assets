    "word": "\"How careful every person who claims to love and fear God should be in regard to the reputation of the institutions that God Himself has established according to His word!

Cannot men and women be made to understand that when they are constantly endeavoring to injure and tear down the reputation of the Lord's appointed physicians, to whom a special work has been given, these servants of God feel keenly the wounds made by their unsanctified utterances? Their hearts are bruised and made sore by the criticizing spirit, the disparaging remarks, the unchristian example and practices of those who should stand as supporters of the men acting as God's helping hand.",
