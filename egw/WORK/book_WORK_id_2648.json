    "word": "When the Master went away, He gave to every man in every age and in every generation, his work; and He says, to us all, \"Occupy till I come.\" Have ministers thought how much is comprehended in those words?

Misused talents, wasted hours, neglected opportunities, duties left undone, sickly churches, the flock of God not strengthened by having their portion of that in due season.",
