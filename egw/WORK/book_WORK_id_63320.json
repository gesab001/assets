I must tell you that some of your business transactions are not pleasing to God. Some of your ways of working He can not endorse. In order to secure advantages for certain lines of work, unsanctified, ambitious projects have been resorted to. But the carrying out of these projects will bring a heavy retribution to those responsible for them.",
