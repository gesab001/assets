    "word": "I charge you, Do not do half-hearted work. Some of you who in the beginning of your ministry were earnest and persevering, have grown weary of protracted effort and ceaseless turmoil, and you sigh for repose, and dream of leisure and fireside comfort. Some are greatly overworked, and are suffering in consequence; and others, by doing their work negligently, have brought double work upon these unselfish, thorough, God-fearing workers. Some are not willing to bear reproach for Christ's sake. Think what mighty truths God has intrusted to our keeping, and let earnest work follow your thoughts. Do mighty strokes for God. There are no compromises to be made with sin, nor any with timidity and cowardice. The Christian laborer knows no drudgery in his Heaven-appointed work. He enters into the joy \n456\nof his Lord in seeing souls emancipated from the slavery of sin; and this joy more than repays him for every self-denial.",
