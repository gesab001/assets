    "word": "Let Others Learn to Bear Responsibilities--I feel deeply over your constant wearing labor.  Please make others work and you do very much less.  God does not want you or Elder Haskell sacrificed.  He wants you to lay off work and be more a planner, a manager.  There will be times when your special labors will be positively a necessity but I protest against your taking up so much labor.  God does not require it of you and you must not do it.  Will you heed advice?  Will you let others learn to bear responsibilities even if they make blunders while you are a living man to show them how to work?",
