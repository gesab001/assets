    "word": "These words outline our appointed work, and we are to engage in this work as never before. Soul-saving is to be our object; Christ's words are our commission; and we are to lay hold of the Saviour by faith, and put all our capabilities to the task of learning the science of soul-saving. The fields that have been neglected call now for repentance on the part of those who have heard the truth; they call upon them to take up their appointed work. \n\n\n                              (Signed) \n\n\n                                            Ellen G.
