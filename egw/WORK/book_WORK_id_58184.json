Olsen, \n\nDear Brother,-- \n\n\n     For years I have carried a consuming burden for the cause of God in Battle Creek. I am now deeply troubled over the shape which matters are taking there, and the influence which is being exerted on the work everywhere. I ask you, my brother, how can you entrust A. R. Henry and Harmon Lindsay with so much responsibility in the work, and sent them hither and thither to all parts of the field? They are not by precept and example giving the third angel's message. The atmosphere which surrounds their souls, and which is revealed in spirit and influence, shows that they have lost the spirit of God out of their hearts and their experience. They are made responsible for many, many things, while they do not feel their accountability to God.",
