    "word": "15. Let not books be placed before the workers which, if they do not mislead and corrupt the mind, will still give to the mind a disrelish for the study of the Word of God, which brings to view matters of eternal interest. Let the truth of God be the subject for contemplation and meditation. The Bible is God's letter to man, in which is instruction as to how to become rich in heavenly graces, to secure for the believer the life that shall measure with the life of God. Read the Bible and regard it as the voice of God speaking directly to your soul. Then will you find inspiration, and that wisdom which is divine. There is no time for engaging in trifling, for amusement, for the gratification of selfish propensities. It is time that you were occupied with serious thoughts. And you can not dwell upon the self-denying, self-sacrificing life of the world's Redeemer, and at the same time be joking and jesting, and whiling away your time by indulging in foolishness. And yet those who have professed to be followers of Christ have been guilty of these very things. Sins of no light character have been committed by those who have been in the truth for years, who have had great light, great privileges and responsibilities. \"But turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?\" Make a complete surrender of yourselves to Him who has given Himself for you, that you should not perish but have everlasting life. \n                                                                           36",
