    "word": "He who judgeth righteously has said, \"Without Me ye can do nothing\" (John 15:5). All talents, great or small, have been entrusted to men by God, to be employed in His service, and when men use their ability simply for themselves, and have no special care to work in harmony with those in medical practice, who are of the same faith, they reveal that they are inclined to judge these men by themselves; they do not seek to answer the prayer of Christ, \"That they may be one as He is one with the Father\" (See John 17:11, 22). When they demand exorbitant prices for their services, God, the judge of all earth, will hold them to the measure of their own overrated estimation, and require of them to the full extent of the value they put upon themselves.",
