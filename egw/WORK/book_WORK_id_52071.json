    "word": "The Lord is ready to do a great work for every church in the Iowa Conference. In order that the world may be left without excuse, He desires His representatives properly to bear witness of Him. Will those who have named the name of Christ be as clay in the hands of the potter? Will they submit to be molded and fashioned into vessels unto honor? Thus they may be qualified to stand in their lot and in their place. By their unselfish lives they may give to the world an illustration of practical Christianity.",
