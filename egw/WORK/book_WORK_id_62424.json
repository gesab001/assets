    "word": "We say to the teachers in the Huntsville School, There must in the future be greater diligence and industry manifested than there has been in the past. Time is precious; the moments are golden. There is much to be done both indoors and out of doors. Meet together and counsel together as to how the work may be advanced, and offer up your petitions to God for wisdom. You are all to be producers as well as consumers.",
