    "word": "Every soul who really believes the Word of God will show the same by his works. The great goodness of God is displayed in His will. Whatever His will or Word requires them to do they cannot be Christians if they neglect to do this. The truth is able to save our souls, for God by His own Spirit is a continual agent in it, and the divine agency makes the truth a sanctifying power.--Letter 8, Feb. 11, 1887, to Brother and Sister Lockwood.",
