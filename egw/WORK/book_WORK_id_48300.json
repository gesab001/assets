    "word": "In every school Satan will try to make himself the guide of the teachers who are instructing the students. It is he who would introduce the idea that \n\n\n                                    -152- \n\nselfish amusements are a necessity. It is he who would lead students, sent to our schools for the purpose of receiving an education and training for the work of evangelists, ministers, and missionaries, to believe that amusements are essential to keep them in physical health, when the Lord has presented to them that the better way is for them to embrace manual labor in their education, and thus let useful employment take the place of selfish amusements. These amusements, if followed, soon develop a dislike for useful, healthful exercise of body and mind, such as would make students efficient to serve themselves and others.",
