    "word": "As a people, we have so often been reproved for doing so little, that we should not hinder with discouragement any reasonable effort to extend the influence of the truth. Be careful that the enterprise you speak of does not cripple other lines of work. Follow the convictions of the Spirit of God, in harmony with your brethren. Watch unto prayer, and then commit the keeping of your soul to God, as unto a faithful Creator. He will keep that which is committed to His trust. Look to Jesus. The enemy will seek to spoil your life, but trust in the Lord. Draw nigh to Him, and He will draw nigh to you.",
