    "word": "In regard to the distribution of the work on our publications among unbelievers, the light that has been given me is that it will cost us more in the end than it would to have done the work ourselves in the name and fear of the Lord. The Lord desires the workers in our publishing houses to become very proficient; for they will be taken to distant countries. Many who think they will never be moved from their homes, will be moved away unexpectedly; and unless they have improved their opportunities to obtain an education, they cannot stand upon the eminence that Christ desires them to stand upon.",
