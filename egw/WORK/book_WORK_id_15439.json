    "word": "True missionary work will furnish the churches with a sure foundation, a foundation having this seal, \"The Lord knoweth them that are his.\" Then God will be glorified in His people.

The workers will not seek to glorify self, but will praise God as the designer and organizer of every holy, ennobling work. They not only profess to be believers; they are believers. They are sanctified by the truth; for truth acted as well as preached has a purifying influence upon the character (Signs of the Times, Aug. 21, 1901). \n                                                                           124",
