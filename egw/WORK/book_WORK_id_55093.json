    "word": "Thursday, April 27, 1876, Oakland, California, Ellen White to Lucinda Hall \n\n\n     Dear Lucinda: . . . I am working to the very extent of my strength, and my prayer is for the Lord to help, strengthen, and bless me in this work. He does do this, or I could not do what I have done. My spirit yearns after God, and I dare not trust myself at all. I am glad my husband is so free. May God continue to bless him is our most earnest daily prayer.",
