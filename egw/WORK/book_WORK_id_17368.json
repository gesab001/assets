    "word": "Chap. 120 - Influence of Dress\n\n     We do not discourage neatness in dress. Correct taste is not to be despised nor condemned. Our faith, if carried out, will lead us to be so plain in dress, and zealous of good works, that we shall be marked as peculiar. But when we lose taste for order and neatness in dress, we virtually leave the truth; for the truth never degrades, but elevates. When believers are neglectful of their dress, and are coarse and rough in their manners, their influence hurts the truth. \"We are,\" said the inspired apostle, \"made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\" All heaven is marking the daily influence that the professed followers of Christ exert upon the world. . . .",
