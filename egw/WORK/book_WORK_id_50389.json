    "word": "Medical missionaries must be sent into all parts of the world to carry relief to suffering humanity. The president of our General Conference asks, Shall we build, or shall we not build? Shall we provide a building to accommodate our students who are being educated for medical missionary work? We answer, There will be no need of building in a short time. If our people \n\n\n                                    -71- \n\nwill heed the light that God has given them, and will move out of Battle Creek, ample room will be provided for our students who are connected with the Sanitarium. Too many responsibilities now center in Battle Creek. A shaking will take place there, and people will not crowd so constantly and so persistently into Battle Creek as they have done in the past irrespective of the warnings of God. We have not the men to fill positions of trust who will carry forward the work successfully; but let those who remain in Battle Creek be faithful sentinels in carrying the light to other towns and cities. They could do a work for the Master by letting their light shine forth.",
