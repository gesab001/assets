    "word": "Our School Work \n\n     Economy in regard to the outlay of means should be practiced in our school in Cooranbong, This must be done, or the same mistake will be made here that has been made in our schools in America. Those who stand at the head of the schools here need to guard carefully every point and bind about every needless expense, that the burden of debt may not fall upon the school. As colaborers with Christ, every student who loves God supremely will help to bear responsibility in this matter. . . .",
