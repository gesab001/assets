O. Palmer to do missionary work in the South. This field has been represented to me as a field sinfully neglected by those who believe the truth. God's people have not done the work that ought to be done there. The Lord accepted these two souls, brought from darkness to light, and put it into their hearts to do a work in the Southern field. The history of this work has revealed much that can not be repeated here. But the Lord has shown me that He has accepted Edson White's work, and has preserved his life when in perilous places. He has put His Spirit upon him, and has opened the way before him, and given him success.",
