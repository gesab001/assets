    "word": "Youthful Service \n\n     Children can be acceptable missionary workers in the home and in the church. God desires them to be taught that they are in this world for useful service, not merely for play. In the home they can be trained to do missionary work that will prepare them for wider spheres of usefulness. Parents, help your children to fulfill God's purpose for them.--Review and Herald, December 8, 1910.",
