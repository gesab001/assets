    "word": "The lack of true godliness was such that they were bodies of darkness and death, instead of being the light of the world. There were so many professing to love God, but in works denying him. They did not love him, serve, nor obey him. Their own selfish interests were primary. There seemed to be an alarming lack of principle with a large share. They were swayed by unconsecrated influence, and seemed to have no root in themselves. I inquired what these things meant. Why was there such a destitution of spirituality--so few who had a living experience in religious things? I was referred to the words of the prophet, \"Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them? Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God: Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols; that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.\"",
