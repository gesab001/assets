    "word": "Let us do our best to bring about unity.  I am in a position where I cannot change the past experience if I would; for the Lord has led me and has given me such evidence of His power in every advance movement of our work, that I have assurance, made doubly sure, as [to] every position we now hold as truth.

We now need clearly to define what is truth, and let not the enemy steal a march on us.",
