    "word": "The leading men in this conference seem to have no respect for the General Conference. The people have no respect for ministers or president. Brother Boyd was despised by them. Elder Van Horn was a pleasing speaker, and they despised the man because he could not speak as fluently as Elder Van Horn. They contrasted the gifts to his face in the assembly. Brother Boyd has felt [hurt] to the very depths of his soul, yet his love for the cause has made him cling to the work of God under discouragements that but few would have borne as nobly as he has done.",
