    "word": "Let us have an eye single to the glory of God. Let us not allow anything to interpose between us and Him. \"If we follow on to know the Lord,\" we shall know that \"his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\" If we are partakers of the divine nature, we shall reflect in life and character the image of our divine Lord. We cannot be indolent in seeking this perfection of character. We cannot yield passively to our surroundings, and think that others will do the work for us. \"Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\" We must be workers together with God. Life must become to us a humble, earnest working out of salvation with fear and trembling; and then faith, hope, and love will abide in our hearts, giving us an earnest of the reward that awaits the overcomer.",
