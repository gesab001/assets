    "word": "Christ called fishermen from their nets to do His work, and they left them and followed Him. He called Matthew, a publican, from his business to follow Him, and he obeyed the invitation joyfully. He may call men from their farms, from their merchandise, and from their various trades, and send them forth to warn the world.",
