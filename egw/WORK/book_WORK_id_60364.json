White before the General Conference \n                    Committee, June 11, 1909. \n\n\n     When Brother Burden was leaving for Southern California at the close of this Conference, he inquired of me, \"What shall we plan to do for Loma Linda?\" \"Go straight ahead,\" I replied; \"let the truth shine forth in every possible way. Continue to work with all your zeal in the territory surrounding your sanitarium. Help your students to learn how to labor, and keep sending them out into Redlands, and Riverside, and San Bernardino and the smaller towns and villages round about. Introduce \n\n\n                              -416- \n\nour publications, and do thorough work. Let your light shine as a lamp that burneth. Encourage the students to greater activity in missionary labor while taking their course of study.\"",
