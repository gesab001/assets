    "word": "Family worship should not be governed by circumstances. You are not to pray occasionally and, when you have a large day\u2019s work to do, neglect it.

Prayer means very much to the children of God, and thank offerings should come up before God morning and evening.\u2014Child Guidance, p. 520.",
