    "word": "He who does not climb the ladder of progress and add grace to grace \"is blind, and cannot see afar off,\" He fails to discern that without taking these successive steps in ascending the ladder round after round, in growing in grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, he is not placing himself in a position where the light of God above the ladder is reflected upon him. As he does not add grace to grace, he has forgotten the claims of God upon him, and \n\n\n                                    -351- \n\nthat he was to receive the forgiveness of sins through obedience to the requirements of God. He is in the position of a sinner before God. If he has the graces of Christ he will exercise and increase them, but if he does not bear fruit in good works to the glory of God he remains in a state of blindness and ignorance, self-indulgence, and sin. He \"cannot see afar off.\" His eyes are fastened upon the earth, not on God above the ladder.",
