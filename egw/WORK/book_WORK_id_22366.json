    "word": "Thus was given to the disciples a most precious trust.  They were to be the executors of the will in which Christ has bequeathed to the world the treasure of eternal life.  They realized the responsibility of their work.  They knew that they held in their hands the bread of life for a famishing world, and they went everywhere preaching the word.  The love of Christ constrained them, and they could not forbear breaking the bread of life to all who were in need.  The last words of the Saviour were constantly sounding in their ears.",
