    "word": "Monday afternoon we were taken by private conveyance to South Lancaster. This ride of seventeen miles was a rest, as were also the few days spent in the quiet home of Sister Harris, although much of my time while there was devoted to completing important writings that I was anxious to leave with the brethren before sailing.
