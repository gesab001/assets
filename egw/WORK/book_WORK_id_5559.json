    "word": "At the Camp Meetings [TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH, VOL. 6, PP. 110, 111 (1900).] \n\n\n     Every true reform has its place in the work of the third angel's message. Especially does the temperance reform demand our attention and support. At our camp meetings we should call attention to this work and make it a living issue. We should present to the people the principles of true temperance and call for signers to the temperance pledge. Careful attention should be given to those who are enslaved by evil habits. We must lead them to the cross of Christ.",
