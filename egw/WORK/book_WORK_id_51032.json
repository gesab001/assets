    "word": "The Lord has placed light, wonderful light, before His people. Walk in the light. It is not the burden the Lord has given you to explain and interpret the words, the works, the writings of Sister Phillips. If you do this you will mislead the people. Take your Bible and explain the revealed will of God, which is assurance forever. This is a snare which you do not observe, prepared to lead souls to be taught of this sister in the place of looking to God for themselves to learn of Jesus. He is just as willing to teach them as He is to teach Sister Phillips to teach them. Looking unto Jesus, trusting in Jesus, is the duty of every soul.",
