B-261-1905                      Sept. 14, 1905. \n\nTo the Executive Committee of the Southern California Conference: \n\nDear Brethren: \n     I am instructed to say that where an effort is made to open the gospel work in a new field, there should be not less than two speakers, to labor together in the ministry. When Christ sent forth His disciples on their missionary tour, He sent them out two by two. This is the Lord's plan.",
