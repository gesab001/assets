    "word": "The light that the Lord has given me at different times has been, that the Southern field, where the greatest share of the population of the colored race is, can not be worked after the same methods as others fields. They are excitable, and outward actions in bodily exercise is wrought up to a high strain of fanaticism, and exercises are more to them than inward piety and compose their religion. Should the colored people in the Southern States be educated as they receive the truth, that they should work on Sunday there would be excited a most unreasonable and unjust prejudice. Judges and Jurors, lawyers and citizens, would if they had a chance, bring decisions which would bind about them rites which would cause much suffering, not only to the ones whom they term guilty of breaking the laws of their state, but all the colored people everywhere would be placed in a position of surveillance, and under cruel \n\n\n                                 -27- \n\ntreatment of the white people, that would be no less than slavery. They have been treated as chattels, regarded as not much above the dumb animals, to do just as their masters told them to do. This has degraded all their powers, and different methods of labor altogether must be pursued toward them than where the colored people have had greater advantages of schooling, and have learned to read.",
