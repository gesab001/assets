    "word": "The Evils of Angry, Hasty Words.--When you speak angry words to your children, you are helping the cause of the enemy of all righteousness.

The work of teaching should begin in childhood, not accompanied by harshness and fretting, but in kindness and patience; and this instruction should be continued through all their years to manhood and womanhood.",
