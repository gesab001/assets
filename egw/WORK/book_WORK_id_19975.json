    "word": "Good shepherds seek wandering sheep diligently and welcome them home warmly.--I have a message to those who labor in the ministry. The Lord is not pleased with the work you have given Him, and He does not accept it at your hands, because you neglect the very part of the work that is most essential to the salvation of souls and to the health of the church. The minister is to be a shepherd. . . . He leaves the ninety and nine within the fold; however dark and tempestuous the night, however perilous and unpleasant the way, however long and tedious the search, he does not weary, he does not falter, until the lost is found. But when it is found, does he act indifferently? Does he call the sheep, and command the straying one to follow him? Does he threaten and beat it, or drive it before him, recounting the bitterness and discomfiture and anxiety that he has had on its account? No; he lays the weary, exhausted, wandering sheep on his shoulder, and with cheerful gratitude that his search has not been in vain, he returns it to the fold. His gratitude finds expression in melodious songs of rejoicing, and heavenly choirs respond to the shepherd's note of joy. When the lost is found, heaven and earth unite in rejoicing and thanksgiving.--RH Aug. 23, 1892.",
