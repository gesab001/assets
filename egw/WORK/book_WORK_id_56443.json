    "word": "When we bring into a garden a stream of water, to irrigate it, do we provide for the watering of one spot only, leaving the other parts, dry and barren, to cry, \"Give us water?\" This is a representation of the way in which the work has been carried forward in Battle Creek, to the neglect of other places. Shall the desolate places remain desolate? No! Let the stream flow through every place, carrying with it fertility and gladness.",
