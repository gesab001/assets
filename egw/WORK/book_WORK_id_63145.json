    "word": "As young men go out into this work, and in spite of many difficulties, make a success, let not propositions be made that they take up another work, and that the work they have started be given into the charge of men who are older and more experienced. This is not the way to encourage our young men. As they struggle with difficulties, they may make mistakes, but if they press forward perseveringly, their defeats will be turned into victories.",
