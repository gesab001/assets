    "word": "Very much of the success of a church school depends on the teacher chosen. Church school teachers, should not be children, who have not come to maturity, who are able to do only a cheap class of work. The one placed in charge of a church school should be of suitable age; and where the number of students is sufficient, assistants should be selected from the students. Thus the students can gain an experience of great value.",
