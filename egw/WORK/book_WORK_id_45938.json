    "word": "I am pained when I receive letters from mothers who have children inquiring, Shall I leave my children to do missionary work?  In the fear and love of God, I say, become a home missionary. Educate yourself in Bible ways and means that you may be a successful worker in your own home, for you see they need to be saved, for they are sinners. Do not forsake your post of duty because of the unpleasantness of it. There are many living martyrs today who suffer in silence, who trust in God when they are abused with the tongue and who are tantalized, who are hurt and wounded by coarse, harsh denunciations, whose lot seems to be to live and to suffer, receiving comfort only from Jesus, who is the source of their strength. Such souls are missionaries. They are Christ's noble ones, and their names are written in the Lamb's book of life.",
