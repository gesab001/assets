    "word": "We need just now articles from the pens of our most experienced brethren,--the best articles that they can produce. If enough of these articles are sent in for publication, there will be less room for common articles, which do not give any instruction regarding our faith. Some of our ministering brethren are doing enough work for two, but they are not working directly to the point. Deep, studied articles, which require considerable time for preparation, will be too late for the present need.",
