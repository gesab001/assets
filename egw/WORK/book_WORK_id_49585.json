    "word": "Church Urged to Adopt Correct Business Principles--It is essential that correct principles in business lines should be laid before the whole body of Seventh-day Adventists. I am instructed that this should have been done years ago. Our brethren and sisters are not to be led on blindfolded, not knowing what movements will next take place. If we are not in earnest in remedying this evil at the heart of the work, we shall give occasion to those who have been agitating the danger of organization, to justify themselves in their position.--Ms. 11, 1895. p. 12. (\"Publishing Houses,\" April 10, 1895.)",
