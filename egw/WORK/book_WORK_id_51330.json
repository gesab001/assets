    "word": "We are to walk and work in a spirit of humility and in self-control. One is our Master, even Christ. The history of the past, in which man has been led to seek the guidance of the human mind, is not to be repeated. There are those who suppose that they are set to guard the actions of their brethren and sisters, and if these souls step out of the line that they have marked out, they think that they must put on the restricting line. Oh, what a farce this is! Such a course is not after God's order. He invites, \"In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.\" Let no human agency seek to outline the duty of his fellows, or to force his opinions upon another, lest he get in the way of the Lord's counsel.",
