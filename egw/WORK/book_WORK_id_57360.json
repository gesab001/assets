    "word": "How long before Elder Haskell will go to California and do the work the conference demands? I suggest that there be no moves made until you know for certainty that you are helping California and not robbing the conference of the help they so much need. To take away Elder Loughborough and leave nothing in addition is not, it appears to me, just the way to work. I do not care to go to California unless it is my duty to do so. You will be in the East and to stand there against existing elements with no one who has sufficient influence to back me is poor policy. I believe I have had enough of it. If the Lord has a work for me to do He is willing I should have the assistance of my children. They should help me, else it is my duty to cease traveling.",
