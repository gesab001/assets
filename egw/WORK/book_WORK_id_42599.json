    "word": "God cannot display the knowledge of His will and the wonders of His grace among the unbelieving world, unless He has witnesses scattered all over the earth. [THIS WAS WRITTEN THREE YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST MISSIONARY WAS SENT BY THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST DENOMINATION TO A FOREIGN LAND.] It is His plan that those who are partakers of this great salvation through Jesus Christ, should be His missionaries, bodies of light throughout the world, to be as signs to the people, living epistles, known and read of all men, their faith and works testifying to the near approach of the coming Saviour, and showing that they have not received the grace of God in vain. The people must be warned to prepare for the coming judgment. To those who have been listening only to fables, God will give an opportunity to hear the sure word of prophecy, whereunto they do well that they take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place. . . .",
