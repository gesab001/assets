    "word": "Every neglect of God's suffering ones is written in the books of heaven as if shown to Christ Himself. Let every member of the church closely examine his heart, and investigate his course of action, to see if these are in harmony with the Spirit and work of Jesus; for if not, what can he say when he stands before the Judge of all the earth? Can the Lord say to him, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world\"? (Matthew 25:34)?",
