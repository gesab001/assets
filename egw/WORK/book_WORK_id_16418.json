    "word": "The Great Healer \n\n     God's healing power runs all through nature. If a human being cuts his flesh or breaks a bone, nature at once begins to heal the injury, and thus preserve the man's life. But man can place himself in a position where nature is trammeled so that she cannot do her work. . . . If tobacco is used, . . . the healing power of nature is weakened to a greater or less extent. . . . When intoxicating liquor is used, the system is not able to resist disease in its original God-given power as a healer. It is God \n                                                                           12\nwho has made the provision that nature shall work to restore the exhausted powers. The power is of God. He is the Great Healer.--Letter 77, 1899.",
