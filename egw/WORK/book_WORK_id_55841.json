    "word": "Now you are going to your homes. What has this meeting done for you? Has it brought you to where you can see the peril that your souls and other souls are in? Do you feel that you must get home and engage in this work as you have never done before? That you should train and discipline your children? That you should take the Bible into your homes and simplify its truths so that your children may see the grandness and goodness of the truth and the love of God? And as they see the importance of it in your home, you should bring them up in the service of God, for everyone may be a missionary, in the home and neighborhood. We may have the whole truth and we may believe every principle of it, but we do not want to keep it in the outer court; we want it to come into the sanctuary of the soul that it may take hold on our lives and that we may have Christ in our hearts.",
