    "word": "All the new enterprises that require a large outlay of means require also careful thought and well-disciplined forces to run them. In establishing a health institution it is not the greatest part of the work to erect a building in which to treat the sick. The heaviest part of the burden comes after this, in securing competent managers and in providing the facilities that the institution may be fully equipped. We know how difficult a matter this has been, in our experience with the health institutions at Battle Creek and at St. Helena. It takes years to fully equip an institution and place it in running order, and it is a heavy responsibility for someone to carry forward such an institution and to make it a success. We have not a Dr. Kellogg to manage all our sanitariums. If a health institution is not wisely managed it will work against the truth.",
