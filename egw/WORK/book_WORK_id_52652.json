    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has not magnified the holy principles God would present to His people. The Lord does not acknowledge the methods that he has brought into the medical missionary work. These methods are confusing to the minds of God's people. Let Dr. Kellogg step from between his fellow-physicians and the light of heaven for this time, then they will be able to see with anointed eyes how closely the medical missionary work is to be bound up with the proclamation of the message of this time.",
