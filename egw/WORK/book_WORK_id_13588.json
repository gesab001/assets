    "word": "Chapter IX. - Health Reform.\n\nLight Given. \n     109. The Lord has given his people a message in regard to health reform. This light has been shining upon their pathway for thirty years, and the Lord cannot sustain his servants in a course which will counteract it. . . . Can he be pleased when half the workers laboring in a place teach that the principles of health reform are as closely allied to the third angel's message as the arm is to the body, to have their co-workers, by their practise, teach principles that are entirely opposite? . . . The light which God has given upon health reform cannot be trifled with without injury to those who attempt it; and no man can hope to succeed in the work of God while, by precept and example, he acts in opposition to the light which God has sent.-- Special Testimony for Ministers and Workers, No. 7, p. 40.",
