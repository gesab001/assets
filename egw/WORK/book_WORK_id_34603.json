    "word": "U. T.--Nov. 19, '95 (H. L. para. 128) \n     This work we begin to comprehend better,--the light given years ago,--that health reform principles would be as an entering wedge to be followed by a religious influence. To voice the words of John, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\"  {TSDF 89.10}  \n                                                      K.--203--'05 \n     I have been instructed that we are not to delay to do the work that needs to be done in health reform lines. Through this work we are to reach souls in the highways and the byways.  {TSDF 89.11}  \n                               U. T.--Nov. 8, '96 (H. L. para. 114) \n     The principles of health reform have the highest \n\n90 \n\nauthority, and deserve a wider sphere than has yet been given them by many who profess present truth.  {TSDF 89.12}  \n                                                      9 T.--112-113 \n     The work of health reform is the Lord's means for lessening suffering in our world and for purifying His church. Teach the people that they can act as God's helping hand, by cooperating with the Master-worker in restoring physical and spiritual health. This work bears the signature of heaven, and will open doors for the entrance of other precious truths. There is room for all to labor who will take hold of this work intelligently.",
