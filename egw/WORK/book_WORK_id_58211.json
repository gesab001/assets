    "word": "Especially to every man who accepts responsibilities as a counsellor, every one who is dealing with human souls, is this grand, beautiful truth to be a bright and shining light. It is no credit to one who has the word of God in his possession to say, I have no experience. I do not understand these things. He will never be wiser until he becomes of much less consequence in his own estimation. \n                                                                           1450\nHe must learn his lesson as a little child. He must make it his first duty to understand the work of God in the regeneration of the soul. This change should take place in every man before he accepts a position as leader or ruler in connection with the sacred work of God. If one has not a vital connection with God, his own spirit and sentiments will prevail. These may well be represented as the strange fire offered in place of the sacred. Man has woven into the work of God his own defects of character, devices that are human and earthly, delusions ensnaring to himself and to all who accept them.",
