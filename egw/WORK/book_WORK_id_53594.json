    "word": "I have to say to our people in Battle Creek, The seeds of unbelief have been sown by one in whom I have always had an interest. I have prayed that he shall be entirely changed, and made a new man in Christ Jesus. I have seen the seeds he has been sowing in other countries, and his heart is set to do this work. Letters come to me that the work is being made hard because of the influence of G, and the ministers are working under great discouragement, because of the reports that have been circulated.",
