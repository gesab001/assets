    "word": "A Mother's Work for Her Children.--I have thought of the mothers. What a work there is before them! Here are children entrusted to their care. In educating them they educate themselves. If they have a patient temperament, the children will manifest the same, and therefore they should feel the need of representing the meekness and love of Christ in their families. These families can be representatives of the family above, but there is work for the mother. It is to be kind and patient and educate her children to become acquainted with Christ from their very babyhood. In doing this work the mother is doing the work God has given her to do. And she is doing her work for time and for eternity. The greatest power that is seen is a well-ordered and well-disciplined family, and when brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord this family will tell upon those around them.",
