    "word": "Elder Haskell conducts the Bible study, and he makes everything so plain and simple that every mind can take it in. How many times I have wished that you were here to listen to the precious words from the lips of the servant of God. All who listen to his presentation of the Word, as he places before their minds the truth in its simplicity, are conscious that they are favored. They are learning the \"It is written,\" and how to use the Word of God. \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.\"",
