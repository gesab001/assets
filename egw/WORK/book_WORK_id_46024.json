    "word": "Colored men are inclined to think that they are fitted to labor for white people, when they should devote themselves to doing missionary work among the colored people. There is plenty of room for intelligent colored men to labor for their own people. Let those colored men who are fitted for the position of superintendent in a Sabbath School remember that they may do a much-needed work by establishing Sunday Schools and Sabbath Schools among the colored people.",
