    "word": "Dr. Kellogg, there is a field that should be worked, but where are the workers? As locality after locality has been presented to me in different parts of the Lord's world vineyard, the words have been spoken, \"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye are entered into their labors\" [John 4:35-38].",
