    "word": "III. Physiology. \n\n     The youth should be taught to look upon physiology as one of the essential studies, and they should not be satisfied with the mere theory; they should practise the knowledge obtained from books on this subject. This matter has not yet \n\n\n                  -24- \n\nbeen patiently and perseveringly worked out. Those who neglect this branch of study, which comprehends so much, will make haphazard work in attempting to teach the youth. They are not qualified to direct in our schools, because the way of the Lord must be learned in order to be practised.--Test., \"Our School Work.\"",
