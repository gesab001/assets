    "word": "Nourishment for All the Needs of the Soul. The soul needs spiritual food and drink. This is supplied in the words of Christ. Those who receive Him as a personal Saviour, and look constantly to Him, receive nourishment sufficient for all the needs of the soul. Those who are united with Christ through the daily, hourly exercise of the faith which works by love and purifies the soul, receive the forgiveness of their sins, and are sanctified unto eternal life.--Manuscript 12a, 1901, p. 1.
