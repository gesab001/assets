    "word": "Now, my brother, we want you to stand side and shoulder with us, to build up those things that God is building up, which are imperishable. We want you to lift and to wear the yoke of Christ. We want you to be ripening up for the future life. We want your help in the work which we are doing for these last days. We do not want you to be involved in perplexities that I know at your age you will be if you undertake to build and conduct a health reform institution. If in the order of God such an institution is established in Fresno, be sure that the very foundation of its establishment is laid in solid timber. Do not let the enemy come in and spoil the work by placing defective timbers into the institution, for these defective characters, not under the special control of the Spirit of God, will work at cross purposes. It is Satan's special business to create variance and dissension among the people who claim to be Seventh-day Adventists.",
