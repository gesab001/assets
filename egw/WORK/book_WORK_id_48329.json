    "word": "The multiplication of so many restaurants and food stores is helping to cause a dearth of laborers. Some who have intellect and talent that should be employed in evangelistic work choose to labor in restaurants rather than in sanitariums or in other lines of work where they are really needed. We have reached a time when we have but few ministers in the field, and but few well qualified teachers. Where are the canvassers to engage in the work of distributing our literature? Some are working conscientiously in selling our books, but there should be many more such workers in the field.",
