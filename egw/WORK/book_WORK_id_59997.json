    "word": "Look not to human agencies to learn your duty. Seek the Lord to know His will, and He will give you light. He is the One who can truly estimate character. Christ bids His workers, \"If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth \n\n\n                             -264- \n\nis like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.\" God bids us carry our difficulties and perplexities to Him. He presents for the acceptance of the believing soul the virtues of Christ's character. A way is opened for him to receive the truth as it is in Jesus, and to have that faith which works by love and purifies the soul . . .",
