    "word": "It is true that we are commanded to \"cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show \n                                                                           329\nMy people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\" [Isaiah 58:1.] This message must be given; but we should be careful not to thrust and crowd and condemn those who have not the light that we have. We should not go out of our way to make hard thrusts at Catholics. Among the Catholics there are many who are most conscientious Christians, and who walk in all the light that shines upon them; and God will work in their behalf. Those who have had great privileges and opportunities, but who have failed to improve their physical, mental, and moral powers, and have lived to please themselves, refusing to bear their responsibility, are in greater danger and in greater condemnation before God, than those who are in error upon doctrinal points, yet who seek to live to do good to others.",
