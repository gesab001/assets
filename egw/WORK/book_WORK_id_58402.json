These councils should exercise supervision over the work where Sanitariums and schools are being established and wherever important interests are located. Those who are accepted as members of these councils as being men capable of taking an active interest in the instrumentalities \n                                                                           1618\nfor the advancement of the work and cause of God, should be allowed to work. It is not in the order of God that man, supposed to be men of mind and judgment, should lay aside their privilege of acting for themselves, to depend on the decisions of the councils at Battle Creek. If the Lord has located his sanctuary at Battle Creek, and in no other place, it is right and sensible to refer all questions to that place. But we know that he presides over every portion of his moral vineyard. To every man, according to his ability, he has given work, and this work is to be done.",
