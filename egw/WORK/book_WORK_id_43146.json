    "word": "The Lord Jesus demands that every soul make a reality of truth. Show that you believe that you are not half with Christ and half with the world. Of all such Christ says, \"I would thou wert cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.\" He who appreciates the love of Christ, will be an earnest worker with Christ to bring other souls as sheaves to the Master. Thorough work is always done by all who \n\n\n                        -24- \n\nare connected with Christ. They bear fruit to his glory. But indolence and carelessness and frivolity separate the soul from Christ, and Satan comes in to work his will with the poor worldly subject, We have a great truth, but through careless indifference the truth has lost its force upon us. Satan has come in with his specious temptations, and has led the professed followers of Christ away from their Leader, classing them with the foolish virgins.",
