    "word": "We have had at this meeting seasons for silent communion with God, seasons set apart when the people could feel that they had a time and place to pray and study the Word \n\n\n                                     -392- \n\nof God without interruption, that they might sharpen their weapons to do the best and most essential work in God's great harvest field.

The sowing time will soon be over.",
