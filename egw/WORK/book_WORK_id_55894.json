    "word": "By precept and example encourage faith, confidence, assurance. This is the work of the Comforter, and it is your work to cooperate with God's agencies. A discouraged man can do nothing to uplift others. A discouraged church can only sow doubts, complaints, and disaffection. Let all this be cleansed from us. Cease to look to the darkness. Look to the light. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God.",
