Years ago the Lord gave me instruction that there should be a sanitarium near the city of Los Angeles. Instruction was also given that we should find properties for sale on which there would be buildings suitable for sanitarium purposes, and that we might secure such properties at a very low cost. The location of the Glendale Sanitarium meets the representation given  me of places God has reserved for us. The electric cars running close by the institution make access to it very convenient.",
