    "word": "One thing I must say:  If you choose to remain with me, the school work must be laid aside. If you prefer to labor in educational lines, then you must be free so that you can give your undivided attention to that work.

So many have spoken to me of your efficiency and talent as an educator that I dare not hold you. If at any time in the future you shall choose to connect with me again, you will not have become less efficient.",
