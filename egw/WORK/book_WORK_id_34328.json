    "word": "Are integrity and amiability of character, and solid attainments in the Christian growth, made manifest? Never be discouraged in your efforts to save souls, because those who have been educated in error and darkness do not immediately respond to your efforts. You must show that you are God's workmen who are never to faint or be discouraged. The pity and Christlike patience manifested will reveal to those with whom you associate that you have a living connection with God, that you are pure in heart, tender in word, earnest and fervent in spirit.",
