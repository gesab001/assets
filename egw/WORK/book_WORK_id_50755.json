    "word": "You may see the Lord looking pityingly upon you. If you will cast yourself upon His mercy, crying, \"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee,\" He will receive and pardon you. When you take your stand truly and humbly before God, then, and then only, will you be received by Him. My soul has longed to see you separating from every false dependence, and casting your helpless soul on Christ. Without delay make sure that your feet are placed upon the sure foundation. Then you will no more compromise with any evil work.--Letter 100, c. 1911. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C., July 19, 1984 Entire Letter Released",
