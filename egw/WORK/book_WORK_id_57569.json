    "word": "Those giving Bible studies before a class need to guard these special matters, lest their minds lose the very essential points they wish to impress upon the minds of the hearers. When the door is thrown open to allow every one to ask questions confusion of ideas often results because some one presents a question full of unbelief. Through this one questioner the whole class of hearers have started a little matter in another channel and thus that precious Bible study is spoiled. Let all questions be presented in writing after the class exercises close. This will give the teacher time to know whether a question is suitable to be presented--whether it flashes a ray of light and life, or tends to deepen the dense shadow that Satan is constantly working to cast athwart human minds; whether this question will drop into some heart as the sowing of tares, or will be for the education and enlightenment of the class who have presented themselves as learners. The Bible study may be so conducted as to confuse minds rather than produce more thorough thought and enlightenment. If the ideas expressed by these questions will lead to a lower and more common level the class have been robbed of solid principles which concern their eternal welfare. There is produced a multiplication of words without corresponding progress in the Bible doctrines which are so much needed to be brought into families and churches; there has been a multiplying of expressions with little substantial knowledge, little increase of solid principles. \n                                                                           880",
