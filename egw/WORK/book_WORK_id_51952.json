    "word": "Jesus upbraided His disciples for their unbelief. Unbelief is the occasion of all sin and is the bond of iniquity. Its work is to make crooked, things that are straight. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen. When we become as little children, sitting at the feet of Jesus, learning of Him self-denial and what it is to live by faith in every word of God, then the soul finds rest and peace.",
