    "word": "Education of Apprentices.--Much has been presented to me regarding the special work which should be done for apprentices by those who occupy positions of responsibility in our publishing houses. The Lord will lead us onward and upward if we are willing to be led. He wants us to reach a higher standard of spirituality than we have reached in the past. Those carrying responsibilities in our publishing houses have under their charge apprentices who will be \n\n92 \n\ninfluenced by their words and actions. Those who have any part to act in the education of these apprentices should reveal Christ in their lives.",
