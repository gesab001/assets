    "word": "\"We love Him, because He first loved us.\" True conversion, true sanctification, will be the cause of the change in our views and our feelings toward one another and toward God. \"We have known and believed the love that God hath toward us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\" We must increase in faith. We must know the sanctification of the Spirit.
