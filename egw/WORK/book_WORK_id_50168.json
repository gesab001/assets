    "word": "MR No. 978 - A Trip to Lake County, California\n\n     Lakeport a Good Place to Escape Pressures--I have recently made a journey to Lake County, and I stood it much better than I expected. I will enclose with this an account of our trip. If it were possible I would like to secure a little place where I can go at times from the pressure of the work here. Especially would I enjoy such a place in the hot season of the year. I was much pleased with the scenery on the way to Lakeport. --Letter 152, 1908. (Written from Sanitarium, California, to Mrs. L. M. Hall, Battle Creek, Michigan, May 12, 1908.)",
