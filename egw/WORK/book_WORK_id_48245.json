    "word": "MR No. 560 - Eduardo F. Forga\n\n     W. C. White has his house well filled at present. Nora and Margaret, the sisters of May White, are with them, and the husband of Margaret, Mr. E. F. Forga, from Peru. Brother Forga is studying the English language. We think he will be able to translate my writings into the Spanish [language], for he is an educated man, and one who fears God. We believe that it is in the providence of God that he has been brought into connection with the work here.--Letter 140, 1907, p. 2. (To J. E. and Emma White, April 8, 1907.)",
