    "word": "Terrible Responsibility. \n\n     The tithe you have withheld I reserved for the support of my servants in their work of opening the Scriptures to those who are in the regions of darkness, who do not understand my law. In using my reserve fund to gratify your own desires, you have robbed souls of the light which I made provision they should receive. You have had opportunity to show loyalty to me, but you have not done so, you have robbed me; for you have stolen my reserve fund.\" \"Ye are cursed with a curse.\"",
