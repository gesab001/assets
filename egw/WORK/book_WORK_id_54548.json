    "word": "Jesus will take possession of the soul and be developed in the life and character. Perhaps I feel too much, but I do feel to the very depths the great work to be done and the few to engage in this great work. I am in continual fear I shall not act well my part and do all that I might do. The Lord does help me in the Testimonies, that I know. I could not, no, I could not of myself do this work. I trust to the Lord to take care of you.",
