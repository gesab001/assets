    "word": "Greater care should be taken in regard to the spirit circulating through the institutions at the heart of the work. All should bear the signature of God. All the workers are to humble their hearts before the Lord, acknowledging His sovereignty. All are to work in humility of mind, as servants of Christ, yoked up with Him. All are to live lives of self-denial and self-sacrifice. They are to learn Christ's meekness and lowliness. No vestige of an overbearing spirit will then be seen.--Ms. 91, 1899. \n\nWhite Estate December, 1983",
