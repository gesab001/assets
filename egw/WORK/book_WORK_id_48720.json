    "word": "Essential for a Living Church.--Some of those who are newly come to the faith know not how to bear testimony, for they had never done this; but I presented the matter before them, and urged them to be earnest, interested workers for the Lord Jesus, and to serve Him. This they must do if they had a living church; everyone must bear his share of the responsibility. If they would exercise their ability God would give them increased power, and this was the way to let their light shine out to the world. Well, fifteen testimonies were borne. Some had never before opened their lips in meeting, although they were intelligent men. . . . The blessing of the Lord rested upon all present.--Letter 50, 1894, p. 3. (To Harmon Lindsay, June 14, 1894.)",
