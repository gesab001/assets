    "word": "Let the presidents of State conferences walk humbly with God, and they will not have occasion to write to the president of the General Conference to leave his work to settle little matters for them. Even many large matters may be carried to God, and God will give counsel in every State conference. The Lord can be approached by all. He is much more accessible than the president of the General Conference. Let the president of the General Conference educate the presidents of State conferences to take care of their portion of the moral vineyard where they are situated wisely, without laying their burdens upon him.--Ms. 17, 1896, pp. 4, 10, 11. (Untitled Manuscript, May 13, 1896.)",
