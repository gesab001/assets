    "word": "To some are entrusted larger responsibilities than to others. But if you have only one talent, you can increase it by use, to two. Then by working humbly, trustingly, you may add to the two, two more. Thus the work in your charge may be continually growing. But there are a large number of idle stewards. Those are to be found among those who bear credentials as ministers. But they do not minister, carrying the burden of souls. Dishonest, idle shepherds, they do not have travail for the souls that are perishing all around them.",
