    "word": "Medical Missionary Work in \n                  Southern California. \n\n\n     That there are special providences connected with Sister White's sojourn in California, and with her continued burden in behalf of medical missionary work in Southern California, but few are prepared to gainsay. Whether beyond our feeble comprehension, or not, there is a special providence connected with the establishment of Sanitariums near San Diego, Los Angeles, and in the Redlands-Riverside-San Bernardino district. Year after year since her return to America, Sister White pointed out the importance of doing a strong work in Southern California, and of establishing in that field, not one mammoth sanitarium, but several smaller institutions. It seemed as if no one fully comprehended the import of her words. Repeatedly she pointed out, \n\n\n                               -399- \n\nin this connection, the advantages to be gained by securing the Paradise Valley Sanitarium; and she urged the brethren in responsibility in Conferences (both State and Union), and also in our Medical Missionary and Benevolent Associations (both local and general) to act, and to act quickly. No one acted, apparently because of lack of faith in the proposed enterprise.",
