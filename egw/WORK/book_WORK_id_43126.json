    "word": "This matter should open the eyes of all our people, to see how easy it is to depart from justice, truth, and the keeping of the way of the Lord, when there is a desire to follow a certain course, and God does not lead the way. What do these infringements mean to those who give their consent to this robbery of God's treasure? Let the prophet speak: \"Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.\" Read now the words of the prophet to the close of the chapter, and then let there be a short time of silence, five or ten minutes, of close examination of the hearts of all who read. There has been altogether too little heed given to the warnings, reproofs, and counsels from the Lord. It is a solemn record that many will have to meet in that great day when every man shall be judged according to his works.",
