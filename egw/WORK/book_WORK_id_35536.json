    "word": "It is our privilege to be cheerful. At times I have been tempted to feel a depression of soul, as I see how blind and mistaken many of our brethren are. It makes my heart ache to think of the men who are unsettled, and who have lost their bearings. May the Lord work to remove the cloud of uncertainty, that truth and righteousness may prevail. It seems scarcely possible that the power of deception can be so strong. I pity these men, but the impression they have made on other minds is so strong that it makes me tremble. A stormy future is before us, but we have with us One who is mighty to prevail.",
