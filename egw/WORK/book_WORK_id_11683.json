    "word": "The new and inexperienced workers frequently have had an idea that they could do the work themselves, and thus they have failed to seek God most earnestly for that help which they so much needed, that they might see their own weakness and insufficiency, and cling to the Arm mighty in power. These things should be no discouragement to those who would take hold of the work; for God often brings into strait places those whom he would have engage in labor for him, so that they may learn lessons of dependence and trust, and know the Source of their strength. Should he make the path very easy before them, they would be liable to feel that they were sufficient and powerful, and able to do the work themselves, and not seek God or give him the glory.",
