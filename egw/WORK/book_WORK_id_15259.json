    "word": "Book Manuscript Work \n\n     Mrs. White's personal correspondence is filled with many references to book manuscripts on which she was laboring lovingly and untiringly. While in Europe, she was amplifying \"Great Controversy\" and \"The Life of Christ.\" Following the issuance of the subscription edition of \"Controversy\" in 1888, she completed the companion volume, \"Patriarchs and Prophets,\" in 1890. \"Steps to Christ\" appeared in 1892, \"Gospel Workers\" in 1893, and \"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing\" in 1896. Her largest literary work, \"The Desire of Ages,\" occupied much of her time during the sojourn in Australasia, and appeared in 1898. \n                                                                           432",
