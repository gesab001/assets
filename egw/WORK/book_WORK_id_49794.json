    "word": "Members to Respect Each Other's Gifts--What a lesson this scripture [1 Corinthians 12] teaches! There is to be an active exercise of the various gifts in one body, the head of which is Jesus Christ. Let no member of Christ's body entertain a spirit of self-sufficiency. Because two members do not act the same part, let not one member say to another member, I have no need of thee. Among the members of the body there is to be no crowding, no judging, no measuring of one gift by another. Many gifts are called for, yet all are members of one body.--Ms. 128, 1901, p. 4. (\"The Principles That Should Control the Lord's Workers,\" December 24, 1901.)",
