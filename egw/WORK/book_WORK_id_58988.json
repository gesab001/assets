    "word": "God chooses His agents, and gives each an individual trial. He allows His workers to be tempted: thus He proves them to see whether they are building on the right foundation, whether they are doing what Christ would do under similar circumstances. Those whose lips are sanctified will utter no witticisms or sarcasms to hurt the Lord's purchased possession. Men and women are the Lord's heritage, and no man on the face of the earth has the shadow of a right to oppress those whom God has redeemed. Christ shed His blood to make it possible for them to be partakers of the divine nature. Human beings are very dear to God's heart of love, and when He makes up His jewels He will gather to Himself those who love and believe in Him. In that great day when every case is settled forever, He will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. His chosen ones, who appreciate the value of redemption, will live through all eternity with Him whom they have served faithfully on this earth.",
