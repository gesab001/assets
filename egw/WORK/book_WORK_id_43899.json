    "word": "You are not as social and courteous as you should be, and your cold, unapproachable manner is not pleasing to God. You allow your feelings to be easily excited. No man can properly fill a position in connection with the work of God who is controlled by feeling and moves from impulse. Your mind must come in closer connection with God, and your sympathies and interest be more identified with those who are engaged in his work, or you can be of no use in advancing the cause in B----- C-----. You are too independent and exclusive, you need to soften and assimilate your disposition to the mind and feelings of others. You can, as a business man and as a Christian, do much valuable service for the cause of God if you only surrender your will and your way to the Lord. You need to be sanctified by the truth, your mind elevated above every personal consideration and every selfish interest.",
