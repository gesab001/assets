    "word": "And here are the ministers of Jesus Christ watching upon the walls of Zion to give the note of warning to the people, the laymen. Are you not to watch with your brethren, that jealousy may not arise in you because your brethren may have the name of doing a little more work than you do? But you are to watch for souls. There is too much work for one word of contention to arise in your heart. But your deportment will express your interest, and your gifts will express it.",
