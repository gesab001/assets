    "word": "Follow Your Divine Leader--The Lord Jesus has given to every believer a work to do for Him. We are not to act like sinners. We must do the work given us. \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" In this work none are to be carried, but all are to exercise their God-given powers. Each one is to stand on his own feet, and all are to have their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Do not go stumbling on alone. Remember that one step taken heavenward prepares the way for the next. Those who step aside from the straight way to try paths of their own choosing will find themselves entangled in difficulties. Follow your Leader, obeying every direction He has given. Every day Christ gives us work to do, and in doing this, we become better fitted for the duties of the morrow. Our duties are to be performed with cheerful alacrity. There is to be no repining, no scolding, no fretting. We are constantly to go forward, full of faith and hope and courage in the Lord.--Ms 149, 1905, p. 6. (Diary, Sept. 22, 1905.) \n\nWhite Estate Wash. D. C., June 15, 1982",
