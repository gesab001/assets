    "word": "We may present pure doctrines, yet if our work is mingled with self, it depreciates the truth, so that our offering is pronounced by God \"strange fire.\" It strengthens the prejudice of those who know not the truth; for they judge of our doctrines by the words and works of those who advocate them. If these are not such as to represent its sacredness and value, unbelievers are often led to turn from light and evidence. They may receive altogether wrong ideas, and misrepresent the truth to others because of the impressions that have been given them.",
