    "word": "There are hearts that the Lord has touched with His Holy Spirit. No sooner does grace begin its work in the soul, than the heart is humbled and subdued; there is no wrestling for the supremacy; pride is gone; there is such a sense of the love of Christ in giving His life for sinful beings that there is no desire to become self-exalted. The converted one sees that his Redeemer lived a life of humility, and he desires to walk in His footsteps. The missionary spirit is awakened in his heart; and, while walking humbly and circumspectly, in accordance with his faith, he can not rest until he is engaged in the work of trying to win souls to Christ. He wants every one to know the preciousness of a Saviour's love. In his work of faith and devoted labor, he will meet with strong temptations and trials, for the Lord tests all His children. If he has the root of the matter in him, he will become more and more firmly established in the truth. If Christ is abiding in his heart by faith, sin \n26\nappears revolting. While he will have love, kindness, and tenderness for the scholars under his charge, he will feel that as a faithful servant he must discipline and preserve order in his class. If truth is cherished, the love of the Saviour is revealed in his words and deportment. The Word of God with him is not a dead letter; he will give not only lip service, but heart service.",
