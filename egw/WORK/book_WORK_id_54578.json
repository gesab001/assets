    "word": "I hope to get this into the mail tonight, but I do not know that I can have it copied. Your letter in regard to the lot and building is reasonable. I think you will certainly get help. The Lord will not leave us with a dearth of means. The Lord will help us and will not allow our way to be hedged up. Just keep strong faith in exercise. Means will come. Our Lord will see that we have means with which to work here in Newcastle, and He will help you in Brisbane. Only have faith in God. I have much desire that you should go to Ballarat, but I see no consistency in our going.",
