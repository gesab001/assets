    "word": "\"At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up into me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. And he wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spake unto you out of the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them unto me. And I turned myself, and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me.\" Yes: there they were to be hidden and preserved, to justify the obedient and condemn the disobedient. Those who choose to disobey will surely receive sentence according to their works.",
