    "word": "Jesus has said, \"Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works' sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do, shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\" The disciples of Christ are to do greater works that Jesus himself has done. He says further: \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\" \"If ye ask anything in my name, I will do it.\" Christ spoke these words for the comfort of all who should have faith in him, and it is our privilege to believe that God will do just as he has said he would.",
