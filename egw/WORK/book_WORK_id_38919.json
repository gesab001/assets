Whatever work \n\n\n                     - 35 - \n\nis attempted with reference to the cause and work of God, we are under obligations to God. Let him be consulted. A few men, whatever office they may hold, should not be mind and judgment for the wide-spreading work all over the large vineyard, which is the world.",
