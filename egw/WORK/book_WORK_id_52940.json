    "word": "I am very anxious to get out Testimony No. 24 now. I have secured Eliza's help. I will undertake that work which ought to have been done years ago. I have things that should come to the people. Time is short. The end of all things is at hand. We are to give more diligent searching to Revelation. Here is a book opened for those who shall live in these last days of time. Daniel and Revelation are the books applicable to us, and should be carefully studied, with much prayer. Read the first three verses: [Revelation 1:1-3, quoted].",
