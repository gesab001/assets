    "word": "We are not working in Christ's lines if we do not adorn the doctrine of Christ by the manifestation of His grace and meekness, by revealing Christlike attributes of character, by manifesting in our external experience the work of internal sanctification. No one of us is to be angry with those who are blind spiritually because they do not see. We were once as blind as they are. We must be wise as serpents and as harmless as doves in order that we shall not increase opposition to our faith by our practice.",
