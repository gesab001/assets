    "word": "Try it, brethren in Africa. There is no growth in aiming at a low standard, but there is required persevering, untiring effort if you would succeed in winning souls to Christ. Satan and all his hosts, allied with evil men, will oppose the work, and you cannot meet this opposition in your own feeble strength. The Captain of the Lord's host alone can win for you the victory. You cannot be at peace and harmony among yourselves if you have no well concentrated efforts to push the triumphs of the cross.",
