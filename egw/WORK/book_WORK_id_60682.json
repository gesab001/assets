    "word": "Chap. 8 - In Every Place\n\nBy Ellen G. White\n\n     Christ was the great Medical Missionary to our world. He calls for volunteers who will co-operate with Him in the great work of sowing the world with truth. God's workers are to plant the standards of truth in every place to which they can gain access. The world needs restoring. It is lying in wickedness and the greatest peril. God's work for those out of Christ should broaden and extend. God calls upon His people to labor diligently for Him, so that Christian efficiency shall become widespread. His kingdom is to be enlarged. Memorials for Him are to be raised in America and in foreign countries.",
