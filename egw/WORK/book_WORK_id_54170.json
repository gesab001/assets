    "word": "While Brother and Sister Maxson were connected with the Health Retreat, if they had been possessed of the right spirit they would have done a good work for the Master. They believed falsehood instead of truth. They did not stand with me and my work, but made my work very hard by sympathizing with the ones to whom the Lord sent me with messages of reproof and rebuke, that they might be saved to the cause of God. Dr. Maxson and his wife did not accept the word of the Lord given me on that occasion. They believed the statements made to them by Brother L, and therefore all that I did say or could say to them was of no avail.",
