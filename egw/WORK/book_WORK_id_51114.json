    "word": "I must not forget to tell you about the well. When we reached the sanitarium we found that the workmen had gone down about 80 feet in digging a well on the lower part of the sanitarium land. They had already found a little water, but expected to find much more. They were going to dig down still further, through the clay to the gravel below. One evening Brother Palmer came to my room with his face full of joy, to tell me that the water was flowing into the well in a stream as big as his hand. The next morning Willie and Brother Palmer came up early to tell me that there was 14 feet of water in the well. The water is soft and pure, and we are greatly rejoiced to know that there is an abundant supply. This well is a treasure more valuable than gold or silver or precious stones. \n\n\n                                   -239-",
