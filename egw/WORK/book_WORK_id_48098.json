    "word": "Now, my sister, I must write to you. I have before spoken to you in regard to the spirit of criticism which you have cherished. By indulging this spirit, you do great harm to yourself and the servants of God. . . .

He has His appointed agencies, through whom He works. . . . Your words were of a character to belittle the servant of God. It is the attribute of Satan to criticize, to accuse, to disparage. . . .",
