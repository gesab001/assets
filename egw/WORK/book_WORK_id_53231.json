    "word": "I can write no one. Only be sure to remember that the Lord has managed matters for you because you have put your trust in Him. He will bring to pass that which He desires to do, if you will hide yourself in Him. Be of good courage in the Lord. Remember how merciful and kind He is, how great has been His keeping power over you. That which men have failed to do, God has done. Honor Him. Be an example of piety to all with whom you are connected. Let God do all judging. Your work is to love and serve God and to be a help to others.",
