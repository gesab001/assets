    "word": "Keeping his eye upon the cross, man, who has brought the message, may step to one side, for his work is done. It is then he will learn his lesson, and there by beholding, he will hate the sin that brought such suffering \n\n\n                                  -332- \n\nupon Jesus Christ. By beholding he contemplates and he will believe. \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent\" (John 17:3). The sinner sees Jesus as He is, full of compassion and tender love, and he becomes transformed by beholding this exhibition of suffering, because of the great love wherewith He hath loved fallen apostate man. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" (Philippians 2:12, 13). Man's working, as brought out in the text, is not an independent work he performs without God. His whole dependence is upon the power and grace of the Divine Worker. Many miss the mark here, and claim that man must work his own individual self free from Divine Power. This is not in accordance with the text.",
