    "word": "Canvassers should not be taught that one book or one class of books is to occupy the field, to the neglect of all others. Among the workers are always some who can be swayed in almost any direction. Those who have charge of the canvassing work should be men of well-balanced minds, who can discern the relation of each part of the work to the great whole. Let them give due attention to the circulation of health books, but not make this line so prominent as to draw men away from other lines of vital interest.--Letter 57, 1896. \n                                                                           139",
