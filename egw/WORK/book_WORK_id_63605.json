Light was given me while I was there that the first five thousand dollars of the overflow above the one hundred thousand dollars sent in for the work in Washington, was due the Southern field, and that it ought to be appropriated to the present urgent needs of the work in Nashville. More than that amount which would otherwise have gone to Nashville, has gone to Washington, because of our appeals to give the Washington work our first attention.",
