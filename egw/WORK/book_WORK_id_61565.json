    "word": "The Lord has wonderfully opened up the way for us to establish sanitariums. These institutions should be centers of education. They should be conducted by men and women who have the fear of God in their hearts, and who can speak words in season, bringing to troubled souls the comfort of the grace of God. This is the work that should be done in every sanitarium.",
