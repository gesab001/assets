    "word": "The Saviour overcame the wily foe, showing us how we may overcome. He has left us His example, to repel Satan with Scripture. He might have had recourse to His own divine power and used His own words, but His example would not then have been as useful to us. Christ used only Scripture. How important that the Word of God be thoroughly studied and followed, that in case of emergency we may be \u201cthroughly furnished unto all good works\u201d and especially fortified to meet the wily foe.\u2014Letter 1a, 1872.",
