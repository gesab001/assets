    "word": "These men are saying in their hearts, \"My Lord delayeth His coming,\" and the thought is expressed not only in action but in words. \"Be not deceived in regard to Christ's speedy appearing,\" these false guides are saying. \"Peace and safety. The time is not yet. All things continue as they were from the beginning.\" They are denying the truth in their spirit, in their works, and in their words. They come under the denunciation of Christ: \"But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth\" [Matthew 24:48-51]. See also Luke 8:12, 13; Matthew 11:20-23.",
