    "word": "The colored people of the South must be helped. The Lord is greatly blessing the efforts that are being made to build up the work of the Huntsville School. This institution had been greatly neglected and was crippled because it had received so little support. But since Brother F. R. Rogers has taken charge of the school, conditions are much improved. There are seventy-five students in attendance, and fifteen more desire to come; but there is not sufficient room at present for their accommodation.",
