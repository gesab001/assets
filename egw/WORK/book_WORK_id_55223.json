Belden that I furnish articles for the Youth's Instructor, the publishers to pay me for so doing. I told Sr. \n                                                                           37\nBolton of the request, saying that it would not be just or merciful to her [for me] to accept the proposition. She replied, \"I cannot do more than I am now doing; but I have a great interest that you should write for that paper. I will do my part of the work in preparing the articles, if you will write them, and then furnish me help to copy them on the typewriter, and also to copy the numerous letters that you have to write. . . .",
