    "word": "Not once should feeling be allowed to get the mastery over our judgment. There is danger of excess in that which is lawful, and that which is not lawful will surely lead into false paths. If there is not careful, earnest, sensible work, solid as a rock in the advancement of every idea and principle, in every representation given, souls will be ruined. Truth is mighty, and it will prevail. It will do its own work upon human hearts. We need not resort to the use of strong expressions that lead to overaction. The truth stated calmly, clearly, will enter into the mind of the receiver, and become a part of their very nature. The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, remolds the character, making a new man in Christ Jesus. The thoughts, the ideas, the principles, are sound, sensible, bearing with them a weight of influence that flows in the new and divine channel. The heart and the soul are enlisted. The yea and amen of heaven must bring up the rear of every movement, else the worker will lose the reward of success. But he should weed out from every effort all extravagant expressions. This caution will make his work far more efficient and commendable, even to those who do not believe the truth. There is danger, even in reproof, of cunning minds to dwell upon topics that lead to sensuality. Even the subject of moral purity may be so treated as to produce the very results it is desired to guard against.",
