    "word": "A brother came to me and asked me what I thought about the salvation of infants, whether they would be saved. I said, \"That does not concern you or me.\" There are points on which we must be careful not to mar present truth. All those who are to engage in the work of God must bind about their minds. There are those whose imagination is large, and they will be ever reaching out for something original. They will even fasten upon some word in a sermon and think upon that until the whole truth is covered with mist.",
