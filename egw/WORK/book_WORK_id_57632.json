    "word": "If men of talent and influence trust in themselves, then Jesus leaves them, and He will employ the weakest instruments and the simplest means to do His work, as in the case of Gideon and in the taking of Jericho. It is not man that is to be the object of attraction. It is not man that is to lift up himself. It is not man that is to glory or receive praise or glory, but the Lord God of Israel.",
