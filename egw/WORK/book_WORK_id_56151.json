    "word": "Let all guard themselves against becoming disturbed in spirit because they have to be drilled in these common branches. Students, remember that you yourselves will be educators of others. Strive constantly to improve in voice culture and in the ability to speak distinctly. Even ministers often fail in this respect. Not a few lower the voice at the end of sentences, and utter the last syllable or two so indistinctly that they cannot be heard. Such ministers almost invariably fail in any missionary effort they undertake. They cannot bring souls to Christ, because the latter part of their work is defective, just as their expression is defective at the close of sentences.",
