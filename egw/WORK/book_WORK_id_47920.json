    "word": "Parents should devise ways and means for helping their children to keep usefully busy. Let the children be given little pieces of land to cultivate, that they may have something to give as a free will offering. Parents must never forget that they must work earnestly for themselves and their little ones, if they with them are gathered into the ark of safety. We are still in the enemy's country. Let parents strive to reach a higher standard, and to carry their children with them. Let them cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light.--Ms 67, 1901, p. 5.
