[PHRENOLOGY, IN ITS EARLY DEVELOPMENT, MADE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE EMERGING SCIENCES OF THE MIND. IT WAS PHRENOLOGY THAT GAVE AMERICAN REFORMERS IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY THEIR FIRST HOPE THAT CRIMINALS, THE INSANE, AND OTHER MENTAL DEFECTIVES MIGHT NOT BE BEYOND HELP. SEE JOHN D. DAVIES, PHRENOLOGY, FAD AND SCIENCE: A 19TH-CENTURY AMERICAN CRUSADE (NEW HAVEN: YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1955). IN AUSTRALIA, MRS. WHITE FOUND PHRENOLOGY BEING ADVOCATED BY CERTAIN ADVENTIST MINISTERS AS A VIRTUAL SUBSTITUTE FOR THE POWER OF GOD IN CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION, AS WELL AS A BASIS FOR MARRIAGE COUNSELING. SHE AND MANY OTHER RELIGIOUS LEADERS PROTESTED AGAINST THIS.] It has become a fraud. We have a higher work than this. It certainly cannot be said of those who practiced these things, \"And thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward\" (Isaiah 58:8). They do not know what the glory of the Lord is. . . .",
