{
    "word": "\"I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience.\" Christ is acquainted with the history and experience of every one who has accepted Him. To His people He says, \"I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.\" He cherishes carefully every act of love and endurance performed by them. . . . Christ holds the stars in His right hand, and it is His purpose to let His light shine forth through them to the world. Thus He desires to prepare His people for higher service in the church above. . . . Let us show forth in our lives what divine grace can do for humanity (Review and Herald, May 26, 1903).",
