    "word": "Now I wish to say, Brother Melendy, if you cannot be kind, respectful, and courteous to the man chosen to come in to the Huntsville School and exercise his capabilities to help the students to advance; if you cannot be a kind brother, a companion to unite with him in continuing to make improvements, you will come to work in opposite directions and make it very hard through your unsanctified ways and spirit. I know you can unite with Brother Rogers if you will wear the yoke of Christ and become a learner in Christ\u2019s school. My heart desires this, and it is the wisest thing that you can do. But rather than remain and feel it your privilege to criticize, and imbue the students with disaffection, the very best thing you can do is to leave. But it is not the best thing for you to do to cherish your own defects of character.",
