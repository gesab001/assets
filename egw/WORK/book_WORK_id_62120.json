    "word": "The Lord has put the seal of his approval on the work done among the colored people in the South. Mistakes have been made, but have not mistakes been made in every other missionary field? When you watch for mistakes and put out your hand to discourage where God approves, you are working and talking against the Master. God is very much displeased with every one who has placed any hindrance in the way of the advancement of the work for the colored people.",
