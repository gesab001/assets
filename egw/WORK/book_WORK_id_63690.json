    "word": "The workers in the printing office, in the school, in the food factory, and in the sanitarium, should blend their interests in every other branch. All should realize that every department of these various lines of work is to be conducted according to the principles of the word of God, and that the workers are to labor under the guidance of his precious counsel. Not one thread of selfishness must be woven into the web; for the Lord will not regard with favor anything of this sort. \"All ye are brethren;\" and the work is one. There is need of daily conversion on the part of the workers if they would feel a true concern for the work as a whole.",
