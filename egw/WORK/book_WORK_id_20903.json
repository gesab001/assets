    "word": "\"We Started in Great Poverty.\"--The publishing work has been founded in sacrifice; it has been maintained by the special providence of God. We started it in great poverty. We had scarcely enough to eat and wear. When potatoes were scarce, and we had to pay a high price for them, we supplied their place with turnips. Six dollars per week was all we received for the first years of our labor. We had a \n\n28 \n\nlarge family, but we brought out expenses within our means. We could not purchase all that we desired; we had to bind about our wants. But we were determined that the world should have the light of present truth; and spirit, soul, and body were interwoven with the work. We worked early and late, without rest, without the stimulus of wages. . . . And God was with us. As prosperity attended the publishing work, the wages were increased, as they should be.--2SM 191.",
