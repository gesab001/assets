    "word": "All may become intelligent if they will. Those who worship God in the beauty of holiness will work in harmony with God by striving to supply the best conditions for worship. \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock,\" Christ says. \"If any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me\" [Revelation 3:20].
