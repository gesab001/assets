    "word": "This knowledge is the secret spring from which flows all power. It is through the exercise of the faculty of faith that we are enabled to receive and practise the word of God. No excuse can be accepted, no plea of justification received for the failure to know and understand the will of the Lord. The Lord will enlighten the heart that is loyal to him. He can read the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is useless to plead that if it had been so and so, we would have done so and so. There is no if about God's requirements; his word is yea and amen. There can be no question in the heart of faith as to the power of God to perform his promises. Pure faith works by love, and purifies the soul. \n                                                                           115",
