    "word": "Character of Building \n\n     \"The instruction that has been given me in regard to the buildings to be erected in Washington is that it is not the Lord's will for an imposing display to be made. The buildings are to show, to believers, and to those not of our faith, that not one dollar has been invested in needless display. Every part of the buildings is to bear witness that we realize that there is before us a great, unworked missionary field, and that the truth is to be established in many places.\"--Mrs. E. G. White, in a Letter of Instruction, dated Feb. 15, 1904.",
