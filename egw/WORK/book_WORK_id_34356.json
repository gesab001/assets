    "word": "Wicked men and the church harmonize in this hatred of the law of God, and then the crisis comes. Then we see the class specified in Malachi 3:13-15: \u201cYour words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee? Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.\u201d Here are a company of disaffected professed Christians, whose chief business is to murmur and complain and accuse God by accusing the children of God. \n52\nThey see nothing defective in themselves, but very much to displease in others.",
