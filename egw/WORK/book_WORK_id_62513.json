    "word": "Sources: SF Echo, May 1, 1910\n\nSupport\n\n     I present before you, my dear brethren and sisters, the work among the colored people as the object of your liberality. The mission-schools, the training-school at Huntsville, the Nashville colored Sanitarium, the ministers and Bible workers devoting their time to the salvation of the colored people-all these and many other agencies are in great need of funds. The work must go forward. Every penny that can be spared should be invested in the Lord\u2019s cause. Let us see if the November collection cannot result in thousands of dollars flowing into the treasury.",
