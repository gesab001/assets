    "word": "Wednesday night I was very free in speaking in Walla Walla. Thursday came on the ground. Meeting commenced that night. Slept but about one hour. Friday, meetings all day. I spoke in the afternoon with great freedom in a very pointed manner, but the darkness seemed so great. There has been great prejudice against me which I had not known, but I am not troubled about this. God can remove it away. He can work for us.",
