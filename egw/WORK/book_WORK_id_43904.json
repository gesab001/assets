All the faculties should be cultivated. All the powers of the mind should be exercised. Perception, judgment, memory, and all the reasoning powers, should have equal strength in order to have a well-balanced mind. In that case, you would be a whole man. Otherwise, you are in danger of being but part of a man.",
