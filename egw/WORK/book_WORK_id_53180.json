    "word": "This Scripture brings to view the fact that there is most earnest work to be done, and we need divine intuition that we may know how to work for souls ready to perish. There are souls to be plucked out of the fire; there are souls who are to be treated with the tenderest compassion. Workers are needed who have learned in the school of Christ His method of saving souls, and He has given us His way.",
