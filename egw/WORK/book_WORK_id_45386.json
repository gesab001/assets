    "word": "The influence for good that the manual training work has exerted over the students overbalances the financial loss, and would overbalance it were it ten times as large as it is. How many souls this work has helped to save, you will never know till the day of judgment. Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do. But when students are kept busy in useful labor, the Lord has opportunity to work with them.--Ms 69, 1903, pp. 1-4, 7-9. (Talk given by Mrs. E. G. White at Healdsburg College board meeting, \"Instruction Regarding School Work,\" July 7, 1903.) \n\nReleased August 29, 1962.",
