    "word": "\"A city that is set on a hill,\" Christ said, \"cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light to all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 5:14-16). The disciples are bound by solemn obligations to show to the world that they love God and keep His commandments. By obedience to the Word of God, light must shine in clear, distinct rays from every soul who has received the truth. And believers will be happy in reflecting the light of the love of God upon others.",
