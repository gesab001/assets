Then there would not be such great discouragements. Had this been done, you would have had some grumbling from students, and many objections would have been raised by parents, but this all-around education would prepare children and youth not only for practical work in various trades, but would fit them for the Lord's farm in the earth made new. If all in America had encouraged the work in agricultural lines that principals and teachers have discouraged, the schools would have had altogether a different showing. There is room within earth's vast boundaries for schools to be located where ground can be cleared, land cultivated, and where a proper education can be given. This work is essential for an all-round education, and one which is favorable to spiritual advancement. Nature's voice is the voice of Jesus Christ, teaching us innumerable lessons of perseverance. The mountains and the hills are changing, the earth is waxing old like a garment, but the blessing of God, which spreads a table for his people in the wilderness, will never cease.\"--P. C. Sept. 24, 1898.",
