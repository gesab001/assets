    "word": "I am instructed to set this matter before all our people (not merely a few) in its true light. We are to know from henceforth how to use the talent of means more wisely than we have done in the past. God's money is not to be expended to indifferent ends. Let there be less display and more praying, more sanctified planning, and less show--fewer expensive buildings. This will testify that we believe that we are living near the close of this earth's history. \n\n                                     -2- \n\nOur people in the home field have been doing a good and grand work in lifting from God's institutions in foreign fields their burden of indebtedness. God will greatly bless them in doing this work.--Letter 110, 1902, p. 9. (To Dr. David Paulson, July 7, 1902.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 12, 1980",
