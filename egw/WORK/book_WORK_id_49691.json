    "word": "My brethren in responsible places, mourn not over the work that is being done at Madison to train workers to go forth into the highways and the \n\n\n                                  -191- \n\nhedges. It is the will of God that this work should be done. Let us cease to criticize the servants of God engaged in this work, and humble our own hearts before the Lord. Let us strengthen this company of educators to continue the good work in which they are engaged, and labor to encourage others to do a similar work. Then the light of truth will be carried in a simple and effective way, and a great work will be accomplished for the Master in a short time. . . .",
