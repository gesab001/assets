    "word": "Of the church the Lord says, Why stand ye here all the day idle? Work while it is day. The night cometh, when no man can work. There is not time for us to plan and study how we can amuse ourselves, please our own fancies, follow our own methods. The mind may reach high attainments by being directed in the right channel, but if not properly cultivated it reaches no higher than the lowlands of earth. It settles in the dust. God means that His people shall have a deep and rich experience themselves for the benefit of others. He means that the capabilities of the mind shall be developed and shall triumph over circumstances. God is to be made the center of everything. Earthly things are not to be allowed to have the ascendancy.",
