Oh, what a revelation will be made in the great day of accounts when the judgment shall sit and the books be opened!  We are too much shut up to ourselves. The kindly, encouraging word is withheld. The smile which costs us nothing is not given to the children, to the destitute, the oppressed and discouraged. There are some members in the families who need more discipline, kindly training, and patient labor than others. Their stamp of character was given them as their legacy, and they need pity, sympathy and love from those who have transmitted to them their hereditary tendencies. By patient, persevering, labor given in kindly sympathy and love, those wayward ones or apparently perverse ones or dull ones may be fitted to do a good work for the Master. Such ones may possess undeveloped power which will be aroused after a time and they may fill a place far in advance of those from whom you expected very much.
