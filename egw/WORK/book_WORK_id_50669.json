    "word": "The spiritual blindness which rests upon human minds seems to be deepening. There are men who are handling sacred things who are unconverted. \n\n\n                                       -290- \n\nAll such should be replaced by men who not only have a knowledge of the truth but who practice the truth and have respect enough for the Bible to obey a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Many of the men who have long been connected with the Office and with other important lines of work are really ignorant of the influence of the decisions they make. If they had a real sense of the importance of these decisions, and comprehended what they mean with reference to the work, they would be far more modest in advancing ideas, and voicing by their vote the propositions others make.--Letter 100, 1896. (Written August 27, 1896, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N. S. W., to A. O. Tait, Battle Creek, Michigan.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 1, 1984",
