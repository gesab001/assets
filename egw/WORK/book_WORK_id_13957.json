    "word": "The mountains are terraced for vineyards, to the very summit. It must have cost an immense amount of labor to build these terraces, and the cultivation of the vineyards thus formed is no easy task. Earth as well as dressing has to be carried from the valley below; and as in many places even donkeys cannot be used, the work is done by men and women. Large baskets three or four feet long, flat on one side and rounded on the other, are lashed to the back, and they carry these, filled with earth or dressing, up the steep mountain paths.",
