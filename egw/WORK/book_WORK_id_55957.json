    "word": "The leaven of truth must have life in itself, or it will not work out of the heart the deadly errors that are there. The Word of God enjoins upon believers: \"Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Those things which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in Me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you\" [Philippians 4:8, 9]. If every member of the church would practice the truth as it is presented before him, how much pain would be saved to himself and others.",
