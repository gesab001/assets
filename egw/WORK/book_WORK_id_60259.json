    "word": "It is only the Lord's working, believing people, who are full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, who will honor the truth they profess to believe. Their faith speaks out through their earnest belief of the truth. They render loyal obedience to their Leader. They rest upon the efficacy of His sacrifice for the race, knowing that it speaketh better things than the blood of Abel. (681) They believe that to those who look for Him He will appear the second time without sin unto salvation.",
