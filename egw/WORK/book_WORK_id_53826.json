    "word": "If all who have known the way of the Lord will take warning and decidedly change their wrong principles of action, they will be received, and their transgressions will be pardoned; and if they make thorough work according to the measurement or weighing of God, they will avoid a repetition of their transgressions. God tests and tries His people. He waits for them to discern true repentance, that He may say, \"It is enough,\" and that He may grant them prosperity.",
