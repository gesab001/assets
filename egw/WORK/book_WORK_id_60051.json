    "word": "It is not the position you may hold in the work that determines your efficiency. A high position will not change the character or increase the moral worth. It is written, \"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honor, and didst set him over the works of Thine hands: Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that He put all things in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. . . But we see (501) Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels crowned with glory and honor; that He by the grace of God should taste death for every man. For it became Him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering. For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified, are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren; saying, I will declare Thy name unto My brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto Thee.\"",
