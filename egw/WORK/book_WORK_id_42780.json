    "word": "The Lord has been laboring constantly from age to age to awaken in the souls of men a sense of their divine brotherhood, and thus to establish an order and divine harmony proportionate to the great and eternal deliverance he has wrought out for every one who will receive him. The Lord calls upon all who profess to believe in him to be coworkers with him, to use every God-given ability, opportunity, and privilege to lead perishing souls within the sphere of their influence, to Jesus Christ. Here is the only hope for transformation of character; this will give peace and joy in believing, and fit them for the society of the heavenly angels in the kingdom of God. O how earnest, persevering, and untiring should be the efforts of every sin-pardoned soul to seek to bring other souls to Jesus Christ, that their neighbors shall become joint-heirs with Jesus! Whoever is your neighbor is to be sought for, labored for. Is he ignorant? Let your communication, your association make him more intelligent. The outcast, the youth, full of defects in character, are the very ones God enjoins upon us to help. \"I came not to call the righteous,\" said Christ, \"but sinners to repentance.\"",
