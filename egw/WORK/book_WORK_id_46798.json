    "word": "I felt as deeply in earnest for the small congregation before me as if ten thousand were present. I have felt in doing the work of God I must do my best on every occasion, if there are no more than two hearers. Their souls are precious in the sight of God and they need to receive the very best instruction we can give them, because they have manifested interest enough to come to hear. God wants us to do our very best on all occasions and under all circumstances. \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\" The Lord will not accept of careless, indolent work at any time, for the few or for the many. We are His employed servants to bear His message to all who will hear it.",
