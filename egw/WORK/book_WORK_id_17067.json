    "word": "Every Agency to be Set in Operation \n\n     The ordained minister alone is not equal to the task of warning the world. God is calling not only upon ministers, but also upon physicians, nurses, canvassers, Bible workers, and other consecrated laymen of varied talents who have a knowledge of present truth, to consider the needs of the unwarned cities. \n                                                                           332\nThere should be one hundred workers actively engaged in personal missionary work where now there is but one. Time is rapidly passing. There is much work to be done before satanic opposition shall close up the way. Every agency must be set in operation, that present opportunities may be wisely improved.",
