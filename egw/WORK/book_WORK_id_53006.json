Resisting Temptation. \"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, . . . might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.\" \"Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.\" \n\n\n                                      -342-",
