    "word": "Those who labor in our conferences as ministers should become acquainted with the work of ministering to the sick. No minister should be proud that he is ignorant where he should be wise. Medical missionary work connects man with his fellowmen and with God. The manifestation of sympathy and confidence is not to be limited by time or space.--MS. 33, 1901.",
