    "word": "MR No. 460 - Satan's Nefarious Work on Earth\n\n     All the vast, complicated machinery of evil agencies is put into action in these last days. Through generation after generation, from age to age Satan has gathered human agencies through whom to work his diabolical purposes, and to bring about the enforcements of his plans and devices in the earth. The great putrid fountain of evil has been continually flowing through human society. Though being unable to expel God from His throne, Satan has charged God with Satanic attributes and has claimed the attributes of God as his own. He is a deceiver, and through his serpentine sharpness, through his crooked practices he has drawn to himself the homage which man should have given to God, and has planted his Satanic throne between the human worshiper and the divine Father.--Ms 39, 1894, p. 4. (\"The Conflict Between Light and Darkness,\" undated.) \n\nReleased November 10, 1975.",
