    "word": "6. Course Not Too Long or Rigid.--\"If the Lord's will is done, students will not be encouraged to remain in school continuously for years. This is the devising of man, not the plan of God. The student is not to feel that he must take a classical course before he can enter the ministry. A large number who have done this have disqualified themselves for the labor which it was essential for them to do. The long study of those books which should not be made study books, unfits the youth for the work to be done in this important period of the world's history. These years of study cultivate habits and methods that cripple their usefulness. They have to unlearn many things which disqualify them for efficiency in any line of the work to be done for this time.\"--The Youth's Instructor, March 31, 1898, art. \"The True Object of Education.\"",
