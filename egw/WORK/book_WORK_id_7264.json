    "word": "Pilate's Wife\n     Christ's appearance made a favorable impression upon Pilate. His better nature was roused. He had heard of Jesus and His works.\n76\nHis wife had told him something of the wonderful deeds performed by the Galilean prophet, who cured the sick and raised the dead. Now this revived as a dream in Pilate's mind. He recalled rumors that had reached him from several sources, even from his own relatives.  He resolved that he would ask the Jews for their charges against the prisoner.--RH, Nov. 7, 1899.",
