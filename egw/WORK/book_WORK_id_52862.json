    "word": "I have had representation that the Lord's Holy Spirit has not been working upon the minds of the leading men in the Review and Herald office. I seemed to be passing through the office days in succession, in different rooms. There is a condition of things represented that justice and integrity and the love of God are not teaching and guiding the managers. How long will God continue to bear with the perversity and unsanctified working of the men who should be afraid, terribly afraid, because they are far from working in straightforward, righteous lines? The Lord will soon cleanse that publishing house as He cleansed the temple courts of its defilement. Iniquity is practiced, and the more it is practiced the harder and more unimpressible are the hearts of the actors. Every unfair scheme that is planned that savors of the least selfish grasping is the same that God has reproved over and over again.",
