    "word": "To speak evil of another secretly, leaving the one accused in ignorance of the wrong attributed to him, is an offense in the sight of God. Let those who have been drawn into this work repent before God, confess their sin, and then nourish the tender plant of love. Cultivate the graces of the Spirit, cultivate tenderness, compassion for one another, but do not longer work on the enemy's side of the question.",
