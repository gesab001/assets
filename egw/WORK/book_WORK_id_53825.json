    "word": "This work, which Satan saw in prospect, stirred up the great adversary of souls to resist the Lord Jesus, that God's people who had been suffering because of the transgression of His law should not be favored, but remain in depression and sorrow and weakness and suffering. Joshua, the high priest, represents the church, Jerusalem. Satan discerns the work that God is about to do for His people through Messiah, the coming Branch. Satan claims the church that has dishonored God by yielding to temptation, disobeying the commandments of God. They have been put on test and trial. Both priest and people are in a position of repentance unto obedience. \"Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?\"",
