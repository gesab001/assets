    "word": "The Lord is sending us repeated instruction, pointing us to the importance of becoming earnest, diligent workers. We have an important work to do, a work that will not wait, a work that can be accomplished only in the power of the Spirit and under the guidance and direction of Christ. Let every believer at this time show himself a worker together with God. Let all differences be put away, all light, meaningless talk. Let us speak and act righteously. The Lord will work with every soul who will yield heart and mind to His control. To all who will be led by the Spirit, God will impart His righteousness. His glory will be their front guard and their rereward.",
