    "word": "Jesus had grief, but He did not carry it in His face. Wherever He moved blessings followed in His track. Joy and gladness were imparted to the children of men. Children loved to be in His presence. He took them in His arms. Christ was an earnest, thoughtful man, an intense worker for the good of others, but He was never frowning or gloomy. The calm, steady light of a holy peace was expressed in His life and character. His presence hushed levity and none could be in His presence without feeling that life was earnest, serious, charged with a great responsibility. The more I know of Jesus' character the more cheerful I am.\"--Ms 1, 1867, p. 8. (\"Reminiscent Account of James White's Sickness and Recovery,\" written in early 1880's.)",
