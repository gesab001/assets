    "word": "You will always find Satan on the side of the oppressor. God does not oppress. God does not bring them [people] in by persecution, for He has let them live all this time, but when Satan gets the lines in his hands, he takes the spurious sabbath and sets it up against the perfection of Christ and [says] you have got to keep it. That is the spirit of persecution and oppression and bondage. It goes right with the spurious sabbath that has not one syllable for its sanctity in the Word of God. \"If you do not keep Sunday, you will not buy or sell.\" And not only that, but they work their oppression in every way possible, but thank God, He lives. He lived in the days of the apostles when the priests said, \"Do not preach any more in the name of Jesus Christ.\" Somebody else's law was to come in there and show that God had a government. He sent His angel and said, \"Go and tell Peter to go and make known My words.\" And when they came from Peter, lo he was not there. And one came and said, \"He is in the Temple preaching.\" And they sent officers to bring him without violence, and they brought him before the council. They said to [him], \"Why do you teach in His name?\" But Peter answered and said, \"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.\"",
