    "word": "After I returned to Oakland, I was instructed in the night season that the only safe course for us to pursue in the purchase of this property was to secure every foot of the land. I was shown that none of it should be allowed to come under the control of those who would work it on the Sabbath day. We therefore, planned to purchase the whole. The proposition is to buy the property for $45,000.00, the owner taking over the Healdsburg school boarding house in part payment of the same. This will help us very much. Elders Cottrell and Knox and those who are interested in the matter are in favor of purchasing. We are to have sixty days in which to close the bargain. Elders Cottrell and Knox are attending to the business. We shall be very thankful when the matter is finally settled.",
