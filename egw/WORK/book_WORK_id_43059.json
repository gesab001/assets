    "word": "Satan is ever working to have the service of God degenerate into dry form, and become powerless in saving souls. While the energy, earnestness, and efficiency to the workers become deadened by the efforts of have everything so systematic, the taxing labor that must be done by our ministers to keep this complicated machinery in motion, engrosses so much time that the spiritual work is neglected. With so many things to run, this work takes much time, and requires so large an amount of means that other branches of the work will wither and die for want of due attention.",
