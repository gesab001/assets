    "word": "Christ says, My sheep hear my voice, and the voice of a stranger will they not follow. Mr. Garmire is trying to make his voice heard; but listen not. God does not select men whose lives and Christian character are questionable wherever they have lived, and give them special light, and pass his true, devoted, self-sacrificing servants by. This is not God's plan. It looks, just as it is, like the work of the great adversary of souls.",
