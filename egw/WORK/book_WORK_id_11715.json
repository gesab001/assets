    "word": "Again, many read these papers and tracts, and their combativeness is aroused, and they throw the silent messengers from them in a passion. But ideas all new to them have, although unwelcome, made their impression. Again the hand takes up the neglected paper or tract, and the eye is tracing the truthful lines, and again in passion it is thrown from them as their path is crossed. But the mind is not at rest; the abused paper is at last perused, and thus point after point of truth begins its convicting work; step by step the reformation is wrought, self dies, and the warfare against the truth is ended. The despised paper or tract is henceforth honored as the means of converting the stubborn heart and subduing the perverse will, bringing it into subjection to Christ. Had the living preacher spoken as pointedly, these persons might have turned from him, and refused to entertain the new and strange ideas brought before them. The papers and tracts can go where the living preacher cannot, and where, if he could go, he \n410\nwould have no access to the people, because of their prejudice against the truth.",
