    "word": "We are thankful that this comfortable house has been prepared for His people. The first house built in Battle Creek [THE FIRST BATTLE CREEK CHURCH WAS 18 x 25 FEET AND SEATED 40 PEOPLE.] was only about one third larger than this, and when we entered that building we felt happy. The meetings heretofore had been held in a private house. We all felt poor, but we felt that we must have a place to dedicate to the Lord. All exerted their energies to build, as they did in building the tabernacle in the wilderness. It took quite an effort to erect it. In two years it had to be given up for a larger one, as it was impossible for it to accommodate all the people that attended our special meetings. And it was not long before the third had to be built, and then the present one which will seat three thousand persons. And we may have to enlarge our borders still. God has blessed in the effort to increase the accommodations for His work in Battle Creek. We may have to exert all our efforts in doing the will of God, but He will bless according to our faith. We must act as men of faith, and after we have done in accordance with the will of God, we do not find ourselves any poorer. \n\n\n                                        -234-",
