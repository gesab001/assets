    "word": "The divine Spirit reveals its working on the human heart. When the Holy Spirit operates upon the mind, the human agent will understand the statement made by Christ, \"He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you.\" Subjection to the Word of God means the restoration of one's self. Let Christ work by His Holy Spirit, and awake you as from the dead, and carry your minds along with His. Let Him employ your faculties. He has created your every capability, that you may better honor and glorify His name. Consecrate yourself to Him, and all associated with you will see that your energies are inspired of God, that your noblest powers are called into exercise to do God's service. The faculties once used to serve self and advance unworthy principles, once serving as members of unrighteous purposes, will be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ, and become one with the will of God.--Letter 8, 1896, pp. 1, 5. (To \"My Brethren in America,\" Feb. 6, 1896.)",
