    "word": "A mighty work is to be done by the people who observe the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. The Sabbath truth is to be presented in clear lines. Our platform is to be the law of God. We are to call attention to the Sabbath as the holy of the Lord, honorable. The Sabbath day is set apart by Jehovah as a sign between the Lord and His people. \"Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep,\" He says, \"for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you\" (Exodus 31:13).",
