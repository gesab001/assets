    "word": "Different Spirits at Work in Chicago and S. Lancaster--We have traveled all through to the different places of the meetings that I might stand side by side with the messengers of God that I knew were His messengers, that I knew had a message for His people. I gave my message with them right in harmony with the very message they were bearing. What did we see? We saw a power attending the message. In every instance we worked, and some know how hard we worked--I think it was a whole week, going early and late, at Chicago, in order that we might get these ideas in the minds of the brethren.",
