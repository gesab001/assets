    "word": "In the after part of the day a telegram came from Napier that Elder Wilson, who contracted the measles from Sister Joseph Hare, has had a relapse, and prayer is solicited in his behalf. Brethren Israel, Starr, W.C.W., and Simpson came into the parlor occupied by me, and we have had a prayer season. We all sent up our requests to the Lord. A letter also was received in regard to Brother Anderson, who was laboring for the Scandinavians in Ormondville. He labored for a while in the bush among the working class, and it was damp and wet. He contracted the rheumatism, and we prayed for Brother Anderson and Brother McCullagh that the Lord would heal these brethren and strengthen them to engage in active labor in His cause. Brother McCullagh is an excellent laborer, and the people all speak highly of his ability.--Ms 80, 1893, pp. 5, 6. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 6, 1987.",
