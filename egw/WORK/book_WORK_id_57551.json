    "word": "I arose at four o'clock, and in stooping down for my morning socks I struck my forehead, just above the eye, on the bedpost, which cut a place in the forehead. The blood came forth freely, in large drops. I called Sara and she went to work as soon as possible and kindled a fire, and she and Edna Kilborn fomented the wound with hot water bandages wet in the hot water and applied as hot as I could bear them. The pain was relieved, the blood ceased to flow, and court plaster was applied after having a cold bandage applied to finish the treatment.",
