    "word": "You have been the Lord's chosen instrument, through whom He has worked, and will work for the saving of the souls of your children. You are to bear the testimony that John bore, repeating the words of Christ to love one another as Christ has loved them. The Holy Spirit will testify of their union with Christ, and believers and unbelievers will take knowledge of you that you have been with Christ and have learned of Him. As you follow on to know the Lord, you will reflect the character of Christ.",
