    "word": "Has the Holy Spirit witnessed to our adoption? Have we been given a commission to do a special work? And does this not nearly always bring us a day of trial? But strength is given sufficient for the trial. God will surely answer the prayers of those who work in humility and faith. The assurance of the blessing of God need not lift us in our own estimation. It should lead us to exalt God. If we will lay hold of the spirituality of our faith, and walk humbly with God, we shall be furnished with the weapon, \"It is written.\" Through Christ we shall be enabled to answer wisely and firmly, and we shall not be overcome and led into temptation. Christ has conquered for us, and if we follow His example, our words will be few and true and pure.",
