    "word": "\"The land has been secured, and now the work of preparing suitable buildings is to be entered into without delay. Let all plans be laid, and the fitting place be now selected. Let those who have been faithful workers take right hold and do their best. Let not this work fail. Let the students take right hold of this matter in earnest. Let not managers, teachers, or helpers swing back in their old customary ways of letting their influence negative the very plans the Lord has presented as the best plan for the physical, mental, and moral education of our youth.\"",
