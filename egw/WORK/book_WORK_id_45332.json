    "word": "The putting up of houses costs, I think, as much as double as in America where there is lumber to be obtained far superior to the wood in these countries. There is not timber here to make carriages, coaches, wheels, poles to carriages. All have to come from America. The Australian gum trees are of no account to use even for firewood. It absorbs the water and drinks up the moisture in the ground and is not, even when dry, fit for firewood. There is the mahogany wood which can be worked up into furniture, but the working of the wood is a laborious process. We are avoiding using the native wood as much as possible. We depend upon the oak as firewood for the stove. Anything will serve for our fireplaces. The roots of trees make the best wood to burn. We have four fireplaces in our house and we need not buy wood if time should last long, but this we cannot expect.",
