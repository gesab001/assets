    "word": "By Personal Efforts and Living Faith \n\n     God would have the truth opened to the men to whom He has given special endowments but who are ignorant of the soul's great necessity. There are some who are especially fitted to engage in this work; there are those who should seek the Lord daily, making it a study how to reach persons of this class, not to have merely a casual acquaintance with them, but to lay hold of them by personal effort and living faith, manifesting a deep love for their souls, a real concern that they shall have knowledge of the truth as it is presented in the word of God. . . .",
