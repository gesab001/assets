    "word": "(253) The Speaker said, \"You can all be a blessing to one another, if you open your hearts to receive the precious love of Christ. Let all keep diligent guard over their own disposition, and then pleasant words will be spoken. Let not those who are connected with the Sanitarium as helpers think that they have liberty to exercise authority over others. God will help the ones who are chosen to act a part in the duties connected with the Sanitarium, to labor as workers together with God. Let them be sure to take charge of their own individual selves. Those who come to the Sanitarium as patients are to see that Christian love and kindness are shown to all who are connected with the institution. Let every one stand in his lot and place, refusing to go out of his way to assume \n\n\n                             -148- \n\nauthority as a dictator. The Lord calls upon every man to be courteous and to discipline himself. He is not to exercise authority that is not given him. Let every one learn daily his lesson of preparing his own heart for the heavenly inspection, for the record is written in the books of heaven. Let souls be emptied of self. Then invite Christ to come in, and open the door of the heart to His knock. He says, \"If any man hear My voice, I will come in and will sup with Him, and He with me.\" This divine companionship is what is needed in every home, in every church, in every sanitarium. There is need of strong, spirited men, men who will be sure to do special honor to the Lord Jesus Christ. We must be preparing to become members of the royal family in the heavenly mansions Christ is preparing for every one who through the grace received will wear His yoke.",
