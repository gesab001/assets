    "word": "Faith is the medium of connection between human weakness and divine power. . . . We must seek to have our faith strengthened. The iniquity that abounds must not for one moment lessen our faith and love for God or weaken our trust in His sure promises, else some mighty storm of temptation will sweep us away from the true foundation. We have a great work to do, and we need greater faith. . . . Through communion with God our faith will be strengthened, and the trial of our faith may prove our signal triumph.",
