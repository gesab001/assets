    "word": "NEHEMIAH PRAYED EARNESTLY ALL NIGHT.\u2014In secrecy and silence, Nehemiah completed his circuit of the walls. He declares, \u201cThe rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.\u201d In this painful survey he did not wish to attract the attention of either friends or foes, lest an excitement should be created, and reports be put in circulation that might defeat, or at least hinder, his work. Nehemiah devoted the remainder of the night to prayer; in the morning there must be earnest effort to arouse and unite his dispirited and divided countrymen.\u2014(Christian Service, 174.)",
