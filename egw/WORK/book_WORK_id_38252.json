And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all\" (1 Corinthians 12:4-6), to bring these different operations into perfect harmony. God hath \"set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased Him\" (verse 18). He has placed every man at his post of duty, assigning to him a given work. If you have any question as to your post of duty, pray to God for guidance, and your work will be assigned. God has told us expressly that He has placed every man at his post.",
