    "word": "Many of our younger ministers, and some of more mature experience, are neglecting the word of God and also despising the testimonies of His Spirit. They do not know what the testimonies contain and do not wish to know. They do not wish to discover and correct their defects of character.

They show their contempt for the light which God has given, by going directly contrary to His instructions. Those at the heart of the work have set the example.",
