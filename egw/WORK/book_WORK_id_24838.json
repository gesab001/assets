    "word": "BUT GOD IS UNCHANGEABLE. HIS WORK THROUGH MOSES IN THE PRESENCE OF PHARAOH WAS PERFECT, NOTWITHSTANDING \u201cJANNES AND JAMBRES\u201d WERE PERMITTED TO PERFORM MIRACLES BY THE POWER OF SATAN, THAT RESEMBLED THE MIRACLES WROUGHT BY MOSES. THE COUNTERFEIT ALSO APPEARED IN THE DAYS OF THE APOSTLES, YET THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT WERE MANIFESTED IN THE FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST. AND IT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF GOD TO LEAVE HIS PEOPLE IN THIS AGE OF ALMOST UNBOUNDED DECEPTION, WITHOUT THE GIFTS AND MANIFESTATIONS OF HIS SPIRIT.",
