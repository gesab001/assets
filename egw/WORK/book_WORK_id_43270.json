The power of Heaven has been wanting to give new perceptions in reading the truth out of the Word. But blind minds and hardened hearts have condemned the truth of God as presented because they rebel against the fundamental doctrines received. They are not half enlightened as to what the fundamental doctrines really are. If they had known for themselves they would not have possessed the spirit and attributes they have revealed. They would have known that spirit of truth which is comprised in advocating the principles of righteousness and truth. It is only by doing God's will that we can know of the doctrine.",
