    "word": "While I rejoice that many of the laborers in the office are receiving the benefit of the evening Bible teachings, let me tell you that the ones that have the responsibility as managers in the work need to place themselves in a position where they can be deeply impressed by the Spirit of God. You should have as much greater anxiety to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and a knowledge of God and of Christ as your position of trust is more responsible than that of the common working hand. You cannot do your work in a manner that will be approved of God unless you feel your great need of divine help. In this work more than in any secular business, success is proportionate to the spirit of consecration and self-sacrifice in which the work is done. You have not had God working with you in all your plans because you have not sought Him with humility of heart. \n\n\n                                     -17-",
