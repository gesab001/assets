    "word": "Genuine medical missionary work is to be accepted, but every line of this work is to be carefully guarded from all wrong principles, that it may bear the searching test of God. The work done is to correspond with the name. If our physicians are going to charge worldly prices for the work they do, then let them drop the word missionary from the name they bear, that people may not be misled. Those who desire to unite with the great Medical Missionary, Jesus Christ, must change their manner of working, or they will meet reproach from the people of the world.",
