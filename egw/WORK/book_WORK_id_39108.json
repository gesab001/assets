    "word": "Not Our Own \n\n     My brother, we are not our own. We have been bought with a price. If we co-operate with God, we \n                                                                           18\ncan advance His kingdom. Neither you nor I nor any other soul should feel at liberty to underrate the talents God has given us, be they many or few. God demands a faithful return of His entrusted goods. He calls upon us to enter His school, and learn day by day how to do the work He has given us. No soul is to be an idler. If we fail to use God's gifts aright, how shall we answer Him when He calls upon us for an account of our stewardship? He says, \"Behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" Revelation 22:12.",
