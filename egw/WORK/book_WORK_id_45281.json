    "word": "Special pains should be taken to establish schools among ourselves. Elder Matteson has not given to our people a correct example. He has sent his children to school upon the Sabbath, and to justify his course has used the words of \n\n\n                                   -119- \n\nChrist, \"It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days.\" He may urge the same reason why men should work on the Sabbath, because they must earn bread to feed to their children, and there is no boundary line to tell what should and should not be done upon the Sabbath. And while holding the claims of the fourth commandment so loosely, these leaders were, by their example, encouraging the false tests which man has manufactured. The matter of dress was the subject to test character.",
