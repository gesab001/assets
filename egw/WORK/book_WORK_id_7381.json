    "word": "There are very many precious souls whom the Lord would have reached by the light of truth. Labor is to be put forth to help them to understand the Scriptures. I have felt an intense interest in the WCTU workers. These heroic women know what it means to have an individuality of their own. I desire so much that they shall triumph with the redeemed around the great white throne. My prayers shall be in your behalf that you may be given special opportunities to attend their large gatherings, and that your voice may be heard in defense of the truth.",
