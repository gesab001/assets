    "word": "I begin to feel now that I have done all that I can do in visiting other nations. I have not yet been to Naples, but I do not feel that God has a special work for me to do there. I am not yet determined at all. I left my home in Healdsburg one year ago last July, and I may not see it in two years from the time I left. All that I possess is in other hands' keeping. I have met with some losses since my absence, but this is nothing. It might have been, had I remained with it. It has been enough for me to see and sense that there must be a work done here in Switzerland, and I have not allowed home matters to disturb me or come into my experience to influence me one jot or tittle in any decision I have made.",
