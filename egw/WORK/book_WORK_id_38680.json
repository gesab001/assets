    "word": "Great injustice and even dishonesty have been committed in the board meetings, in bringing matters before those who have not an experience that will enable them to be competent judges. Manuscripts have been placed in the hands of men for criticism, when the eyes of their understanding were so blinded that they could not discern the spiritual import of the subject with which they were dealing. More than this, they had no real knowledge of book-making. They had had neither study nor practise in the line of literary productions. Men have sat in judgment upon books and MSS. unwisely placed in their hands, when they should have declined to serve in any such capacity. It would have been only honest for them to say, \"I have had no experience in this line of work, and should certainly do injustice to myself and to others, in giving my opinion. Excuse me, brethren; instead of instructing others, I need that some one should teach me.\" But this was far from their thoughts. They expressed themselves freely in regard to subjects of which they knew nothing. Conclusions have been accepted as the opinions of wise men, when they were simply the opinions of novices.",
