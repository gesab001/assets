    "word": "How many are asking this question at this point in their experience, as if they were altogether innocent of any wrong-doing? The answer comes, \"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.\" You have withheld from me the portion that I had reserved that I might advance my work, that the gospel of my kingdom might be sent to all parts of the world, as a witness to all nations. You have lived to please yourselves; you have manifested selfishness; you have taken my reserved talents to use for your own advantage. You would not deny self, take up your cross, and follow me, your Lord. It is not because you could not do this, but because you would not. You have not chosen the humble, self-denying life of which your Redeemer has given you an example. You preferred to run the risk, to venture the salvation of your souls in practising a system of robbery toward God, robbing me of treasure that I had reserved to carry forward my work in the world, \n\n\n                      -6- \n\nthat it might be a praise in all parts of the earth. At the center of the work you have put your hands into my treasury, and the funds which should have been to you a sacred trust, you have consumed in incidental expenses which self-denial and self-sacrifice, a limiting of some of your selfish indulgences, would have provided for. But self, self, self has been indulged, and my treasury has been robbed of the funds brought to it in order that there might be meat in my house to sustain my servants in opening the Scriptures to those who are nigh and afar off.",
