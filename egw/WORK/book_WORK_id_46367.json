    "word": "MR No. 236 - The Work in New York City\n\n     Sunday the 24th was a rainy, disagreeable day. I was surprised at the attendance in the hall in New York City. There was a very much larger number than we could reasonably expect. I spoke from 1 John 3. The Lord gave me freedom in speaking His word. The blessing of the Lord seemed to attend the word spoken. May the Lord bless the hearers. . . . But my burden did not leave me. I had a message to the believers in New York City, that all who are truly converted unto the proclamation of the third angel's message must not present to the world, to angels, and to men, division in the place of unity. The truth of God sanctifies the receiver to be a channel and representative of His grace to the world, and to angels, and to men.--Ms 130, 1901, pp. 1, 10. (Untitled, November 27, 1901.)",
