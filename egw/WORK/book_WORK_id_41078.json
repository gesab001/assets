They need spiritual eyesight to abhor anything like selfishness, double dealing. \"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness.\" Men who possess learning and genius may let down the standard, little by little, until they are guilty of unholy thoughts, of impure and polluted actions. There are inborn tendencies in men and women, that are not developed until some temptation assails them, when, instead of resisting the temptation, they fall. They do not preserve truthfulness, strict, straight dealing. God writes them in his book, \"Weighed in the balances, and found wanting.\" They may have great talents, wonderful gifts; but if the pure gold of character is tarnished with unfair dealing, policy dealing, the heavenly guide leaves them. They have no just, elevated standard of honor, and to gain some point have lost the sense of distinction between right and wrong, truth and falsehood. What would we do without God, a true Witness, who declares, \"I know thy works?\" Every corruption of the human heart he knows. God calls for upright men in the medical profession. Get those men from the very start, men who honor God, men who seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Such men have consciences quickened by habitual contact with the word of God. They are familiar with the heavenly standard. Pure and holy principles are interwoven with their lives and characters; and while they fear and honor God, they will be honored of him, for he has promised it. \n\n\n                          -42-",
