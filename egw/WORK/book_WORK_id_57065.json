    "word": "Christ has said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\" If your good works were the way, then Christ would not have said, \"I am the way.\" It is not our doings and deservings that will save us. If man could have gained heaven by his own efforts, Christ need not have died to make an atonement for our sins. Yet all who tread the narrow path that leads to heaven, will bear the fruits of godliness, and give evidence that they are the light of the world.",
