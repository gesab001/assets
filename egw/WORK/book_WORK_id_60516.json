    "word": "Now I want to tell our brethren that there is a work we are to do and they are to be interested in the cases of others. There are cities all around us, and when I was in Australia how glad I would have been, if we could have gone right around where the people were (as you can here). Christ said go everywhere preaching the word. It is the Word they must have. It is the Scriptures they must have. We do not need these papers that are coming into our parlors. Those who have never been used to our house sometimes don't know where to find their papers, but I say, \"If you miss your papers, you must find them where you can. I do not take any charge of them whatever only to put them out of sight. We may want to know the news of the day and we may have some excuse to just run thru them and see what it is. But I want to tell you there is a great work to be done in our world and we feel intensely like doing our part.",
