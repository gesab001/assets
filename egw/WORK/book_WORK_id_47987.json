    "word": "After the death of my husband, I was for one year so afflicted that I felt that perhaps the Lord would let me rest in the grave. Night after night I was in deep sorrow. One night I had a special answer to my prayer. It was after the healing power of God came upon me at Healdsburg. At that time the Lord raised me up, and gave me special light, and I have never since felt so unreconciled. I was instructed that the Lord had mercifully raised me up because He had a special work for me to do, and I was assured that I should have the special protection and care of God. The Lord had spared my life, and had saved me from that which was surely sapping my life forces.",
