    "word": "Set Christ ever before you as your Saviour and Friend. By beholding Him you catch His divine likeness, imbibe His attributes, and are imbued with His love. Be of good cheer, my son and my daughter. I said I would not seek to influence you in any way to come to this country to help us. I would be very much pleased to see you both. If the Lord saw fit to direct your course this way, I would welcome you gladly. But I do not want my desire and affection for my children to draw them away from the work that the Lord has appointed them to do. If you felt that the Lord would be pleased to have you in this country, I would rejoice. I have had a very heavy burden to carry, and you could have been a great help to me. I have needed just the help that you could give. But if the Lord sees that it is not for your good and His name's glory, I would not have you leave the work you have been engaged in.",
