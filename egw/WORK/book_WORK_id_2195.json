    "word": "In the Bible the whole duty of man is defined. Solomon says, \"Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.\" [Ecclesiastes 12:13.] The will of God is revealed in his written word, and this is the essential knowledge. Human wisdom, familiarity with the languages of different nations, is a help in the missionary work. An understanding of the customs of the people, of the location and time of events, is practical knowledge; for it aids in making the figures of the Bible clear, in bringing out the force of Christ's lessons; but it is not positively necessary to know these things. The way-faring man may find the pathway cast up for the ransomed to walk in, and there will be no excuse found for any one who perishes through misapprehension of the Scriptures.",
