    "word": "Correct in Righteousness--When it becomes necessary for a minister to do a work of correction, he should be very careful to act righteously and wisely.  He is not to denounce the erring harshly before those who know not the truth.  The unconverted judge the servants of God by such actions, and conclude that this can not be the work of God.  Those who are not of our faith but who are convicted of the truth, when they see a lack of unity among the ministers who claim to be obeying the truth, close the door of their hearts, saying, We want none of these things.  Thus by the exercise of unsanctified speech, souls are turned from the truth, and an example given that opens the way for the things of truth and righteousness to be lowered in the dust.  Our workers, when tempted to speak hasty words of criticism and judgment, should remember that silence is golden.--Review and Herald, November 14, 1907.",
