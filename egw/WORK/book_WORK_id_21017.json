    "word": "Should Unbelievers Be Permanently Employed?--All who connect with the institutions established by the Lord should be consecrated to God, soul, body, and spirit. No one who is an unbeliever should be permanently employed. All must have their trial and test. No one whose mind is not under the control of the Holy Spirit should be allowed to handle the sacred work of God; for the enemy lays plans to lead such men to do things which will hurt the work, and which may result in great loss and hindrance. If such, because of necessity, are brought into connection with the work for a time, and, after having had opportunity to know the truth, are no nearer conversion than before, quietly dismiss them. . . .",
