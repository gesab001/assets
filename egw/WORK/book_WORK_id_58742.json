    "word": "God chooses men of a humble and contrite spirit through whom he can work, and imparts to them his wisdom. They are little in their own eyes, and will not interpret success as the result of their own smartness, but will glorify God. \"Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord.\" If men are entrusted with great responsibilities, this is no assurance of their fitness for their position. The assurance comes after test and trial. If they evidence that they sense their own weakness, if they make God their trust, the Lord will supply them with his wisdom. If they ask in faith, they will increase in knowledge and ability. If they depend upon God day by day, the stages of development will show a symmetrical growth heavenward. If they walk day by day in humility and contrition and wholeheartedness, in the strictest integrity doing justice to their fellow-men, showing reverence and honor to God by being obedient and true to him, \n                                                                           1821\nkeeping the living principles of righteousness, God will honor them.",
