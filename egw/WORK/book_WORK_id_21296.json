    "word": "Solicit Donations From Wealthy Men.--Nashville is to be made a center for the work. From this place will go forth an influence which will establish the work as the Lord may prepare the way in other places in the South. Let those who labor in the interests of the cause of God lay the necessities of the work in the South before the wealthy men of the world. Do this judiciously. Tell them what you are trying to do. Solicit donations from them. It is God's means which they have, means which should be used in enlightening the world.--MS 40, 1901. (See also Ev 88.)",
