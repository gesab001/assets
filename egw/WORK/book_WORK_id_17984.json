    "word": "Christ's Tenderness in Dealing With Minds.--Christ identifies His interest with that of humanity. The work that bears the divine credentials is that which manifests the spirit of Jesus, which reveals His love, His carefulness, His tenderness in dealing with the minds of men. What revelations would come to man if the curtain should be rolled back and you could see the result of your work in dealing with the erring who have needed most judicious treatment lest they should be turned out of the way. \"Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed\" (Hebrews 12:12, 13).--SpT Series A, No. 3, pp. 9, 10, Aug 3, 1894. (TM 184, 185.)",
