    "word": "I am instructed to say to our ministers and medical missionary workers, Be careful what spirit you manifest to one another. Men are having their own way in many places, and if there is not a change, they will soon see that human wisdom has placed them where they cannot do the work in such a way as to make the most advancement. For man to control means that the work of God will not rise to the high elevation that God designs it to reach.",
