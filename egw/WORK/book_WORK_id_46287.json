    "word": "MR No. 225 - Miscellaneous\n\n     There were several hands employed beside himself who were irreligious, rough men. They agreed among themselves to make it hard for the minister, for as he was unaccustomed to such stern hard work, they would run him down and drive him from the field. He knew at that time nothing of this, but before he went into the field, we sought the Lord most earnestly that He would strengthen and protect him. . . . As he entered the field, they put the minister to lead in mowing the swath. He took a wide swath. Those who followed, . . . bent to with all their energies to keep up close to him, which led him to quicken his steps. . . . They had gone across the large field but twice when they threw down their scythes and said, \"White, do you mean to kill yourself and us? . . . We thought you were a minister and could not know by experience how to handle a scythe, but we give you the credit of being far ahead of us and the best mower we ever saw--and you have taken no beer or liquor this hot day. When you came into the field as a worker, we were mad. We did not want a minister in our company. . . . We have had to give up.\"--Ms 19, 1885, pp. 2, 3. (Talk at European General Council, September 21, 1885.)",
