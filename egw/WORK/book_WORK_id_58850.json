    "word": "\"O Lord, Thou knowest all about it. I need not tell Thee anything. But Lord, I will confess all thou hast spoken. Take me, O Lord; Thou hast bought me; I am Thine. So I give myself to Thee, Lord, this morning, body, soul, and spirit to be devoted to Thee, to be consecrated to Thee, to be purified by Thee, to be cleansed by Thee, to be molded and shaped by Thee, conformed to the image of Thy dear Son, that I may walk worthy of Thee, dear Lord, and glorify Thee on earth, and finish the work which Thou hast given me to do.",
