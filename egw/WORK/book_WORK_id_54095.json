    "word": "Nehemiah is an example of the standard that must be maintained at any expense. Neither danger nor difficulty would shake his adherence to the just, holy, righteous principles of truth. The honor that must be maintained in the work to be done for this time requires staunch determination. Men are needed who will say, \"The hand of God is good upon me; I will arise and build.\" [See Nehemiah 2:18.] There are today too many Pliables, as in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Beware of the inclination to follow your own impulses. Adam, hiding himself from God, encompassed himself in obstructing darkness.",
