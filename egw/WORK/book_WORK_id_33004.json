    "word": "A great work is to be done, and those who know the truth should make mighty intercession for help. The love of Christ must fill their own hearts. The Spirit of Christ must be poured out upon them, and they must be making ready to stand in the judgment. As they consecrate themselves to God, a convincing power will attend their efforts to present the truth to others. We must no longer sleep on Satan's enchanted ground, but call into requisition all our resources, availing ourselves of every facility with which Providence has furnished us. The last warning is to be proclaimed before \"many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings,\" and the promise is given, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Revelation 10:11; Matthew 28:20.",
