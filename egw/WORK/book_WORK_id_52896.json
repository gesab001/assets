    "word": "God calls for all who claim to be His followers to show their faith by their works. We are not to enter into secret confidences with those who love not God nor keep His commandments. We are to seek most earnestly to keep in sympathy and harmony with those of like faith, and we will do this if we are indeed a living branch of the true Vine. They will be one in Christ, brought into practical sympathy with Christ in His mission and in His work, to save the souls for whom Christ has died, not in their sins but from their sins. But these sinners are not in any case to have the supremacy over the children of obedience and light.",
