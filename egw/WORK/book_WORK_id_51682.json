    "word": "September 26 was set apart as a season for fasting and prayer. I slept but little Friday night, but went into the ministers' meeting in the morning. I opened the meeting with prayer; the Lord poured upon me the spirit of supplication for my ministering brethren. Angels of God were in the building. Daniel broke out in most urgent prayer. He confessed and confessed, and pleaded for the forgiveness of God. Prayers and tears were mingled together. It was a most precious season. I bore a message with many tears, stating the solemn work of the watchmen and the necessity of faithfulness. The power of God rested upon me and upon those who heard. I never heard Brother Matteson talk as he did in that meeting. He seemed so humble, and his face shone with spiritual light. Every testimony was borne with deepest feeling. The crust over Elder Andrews is breaking. Daniel made a good confession in every way.",
