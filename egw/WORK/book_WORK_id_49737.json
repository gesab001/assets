    "word": "A great work is to be done in Australia, and one important way of advancing this work is the establishment of a sanitarium where the sick can be cared for. All classes of people will come to the sanitarium, those in high positions of trust as well as the more lowly, and the Lord will impress their minds. If there ever was an object where the means locked up in banks would be well invested, it is in such an institution, where the sufferings of humanity will be relieved, and the work conducted on the strictest temperance principles.",
