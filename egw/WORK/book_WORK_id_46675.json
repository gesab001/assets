    "word": "Two great systems of efficiency are blended in the human body. The circulatory system and the nervous system are combined. The heart is the reservoir of the circulatory system and the brain of the nervous system. From the blood the food is assimilated by the body. Both agencies are ever at work. The food nourishes the whole man; therefore there is every need of wholesome food. But there is not the slightest call for the great variety of dishes which are nearly always on hand. Much time and labor might be saved in this matter. God does not design that our time should be so fully occupied in contriving dishes to suit the palate. God would have all of His people missionaries in every sense of the word.",
