    "word": "Chapter II. - The Mission of John.\n\n     Previous to Christ's entering upon his ministry, the mission of John commenced. He was to prepare the way for the reception of Christ. In the spirit, and with the power, of Elijah, he denounced the corruptions of the Jews, and raised his voice in reproving their prevailing sins. His discourses were plain, pointed, and convincing. Many were brought to repentance of their sins, and, as evidence of their repentance, were baptized of him in Jordan. This was the preparatory work for the ministry of Christ. Many were convicted because of the plain truths uttered by this faithful prophet; but, by rejecting the light, they became enshrouded in deeper darkness, so that they were fully prepared to turn from the evidences attending Jesus, that he was the true Messiah.",
