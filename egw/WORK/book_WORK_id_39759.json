    "word": "My brother, my sister, have you been entrusted with certain duties and responsibilities?--Give yourself unreservedly to God, and realize your individual responsibility. There is a Watcher who is pleased or displeased with the manner in which your work is done. The Lord calls for those who will carry their load of responsibility with fear and trembling, looking to Him for wisdom, and praying for counsel and continual grace, that no mistakes shall be made.",
