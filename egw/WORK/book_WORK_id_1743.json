    "word": "The truth must be proclaimed in the dark places of the earth. Obstacles must be met and surmounted. A great work is to be done, and those who know the truth should make mighty intercession for help now. . . . The Spirit of Christ must be poured out upon them, and they must be making ready to stand in the judgment. While they are consecrating themselves to God, a convincing power will attend their efforts to present the truth to others. We must sleep no longer on Satan\u2019s enchanted ground, but call into requisition all our resources, and avail ourselves of every facility with which Providence has furnished us. . . . And the promise is given, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201dManuscript 100, 1893.",
