    "word": "A Parable--Gathering the Ripening Fruitage.--In a dream given me September 29, 1886, I was walking with a large company who were looking for berries. ... The day wore on, and very little was accomplished. At last I said: \"Brethren, you call this an unsuccessful expedition. If this is the way you work, I do not wonder at your lack of success. Your success or failure depends upon the way you take hold of the work. \n                                                                           294\nThere are berries here; for I have found them. Some of you have been searching the low bushes in vain; others have found a few berries; but the high bushes have been passed by, simply because you did not expect to find fruit on them. You see that the fruit which I have gathered is large and ripe. In a little while other berries will ripen, and we can go over the bushes again. This is the way in which I was taught to gather fruit. If you had searched near the wagon, you might have found fruit as well as I. . . .",
