    "word": "People have been called to the Gospel Wagon to listen to the music and the speeches that are made. But after they are gone little is left on the mind that will ripen into fruit. Many are enchanted with these outward performances; but the life and work of Christ was not after this order. God \n\n\n                                 -251- \n\nhas not appointed us to proclaim the truth in this way, when there are better methods. Outward display is not to characterize our work.",
