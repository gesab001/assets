    "word": "Brother C. must learn as he passes along by the things he suffers. I saw that God loved Brother C. The loss of means in New York City rests heavily on Brother Wilcox. He is much more to blame than Brother C. I saw Brother C., if you should follow out all your plans, it would require an inexhaustible fund to support your plans that would accomplish nothing in the end. Brother C. the same means which you have expended would have kept a successful laborer in the gospel field. If Brother Taylor had received half this means, he could have left home free and have accomplished much more than has been accomplished by Brother C. Brother C.'s life has been such, he has not valued money. He is very free, openhearted and confiding and has not discernment of character. He must value means more. The brethren work hard and some suffer privations to put money into the treasury, and then when they see it foolishly wasted for want of judgment, it saddens them and also discourages those who have used their influence to call out means from their brethren.",
