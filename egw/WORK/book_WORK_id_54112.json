    "word": "This was the work of the great Master Artist, and we could but exclaim, How wonderful are all Thy works, Lord God Almighty. We feel subdued and awed in the presence of such manifestations of the great God. I thought of the psalmist who calls upon everything, animate and inanimate, to join in one chorus of thanksgiving to God. He, thus calling upon the senseless and irrational, is the most powerful rebuke to those blessed with intelligence if their souls do not glow and their lips proclaim the majesty and glory of God. \"Praise ye Him, sun and moon: praise Him, all ye stars of light.... Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling His word\" (Psalms 148:3, 7, 8).",
