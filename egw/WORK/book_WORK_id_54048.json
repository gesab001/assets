    "word": "Mere intellectual knowledge, apart from moral and spiritual elevation, is as nothingness. The greatest of this world's great men, who think that they have reached wonderful heights in science, cannot compare with the great apostle Paul or with John the beloved.

Such an one reaches the highest standard that can be reached.",
