    "word": "A mistake has been made in the course that has been followed to clear the San Fernando school from debt. When the school property was first purchased, and the minds of our people were upon it, only a feeble effort was made to raise the money (470) spent in its purchase. But after the sanitariums were purchased and the sympathy and financial strength of the people were needed to put them in working order, there were some who made the school debt the matter of first consideration, and who by criticism of the Sanitarium work and management, discouraged the brethren from giving them the full support that they needed.",
