    "word": "President Educates and Trains--The president of a State Conference is, by his manner of dealing, educating the ministers under him, and together they can so educate the churches that it will not be necessary to call the ministers of the conference from the field to settle difficulties and dissension's in the church.  If the officers in the conference will, as faithful servants, perform their Heaven-appointed duties, the work in our conferences will not be left to become entangled in such perplexities as heretofore.  And in laboring thus, the workers will become solid, responsible men, who will not fail nor be discouraged in a hard place.--Gospel Workers, p. 419.",
