    "word": "Beware of Self-pity.--We need to beware of self-pity. Never indulge the feeling that you are not esteemed as you should be, that your efforts are not appreciated, that your work is too difficult.

We are treated better than was our Lord. \"Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not\" (Jeremiah 45:5). --MH 476 (1905).",
