    "word": "Our safety lies not only in professing the truth but in living the truth out. Daily, hourly, momentarily, we need that genuine faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Unless as individuals we are imbued with the Holy Spirit of God, we shall surely be led astray by some of Satan's specious devices. Our only course of safety is to walk humbly with God, to watch most earnestly lest selfishness, lest some sin we do not discern, shall have the mastery of our minds and be developed in our character, and thus our feet be caused to stumble, and we fall into Satan's net before we know that we are entangled. The Lord would not have us ignorant of Satan's devices. I consider that you are in need of watching unto prayer in order that not one hereditary or acquired habit shall be cherished that will lead you away from following Jesus, and from copying the great Pattern.",
