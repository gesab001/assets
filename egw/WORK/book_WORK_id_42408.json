    "word": "\"Dear Young Friends: . . . A burden is resting upon me in regard to you. I have been repeatedly shown that all who are in connection with the work of God in publishing the present truth, which is to be scattered to every part of the field, should be Christians, not only in name, but in deed and truth. Their object should not be merely to work for wages, but all engaged in this great and solemn work should feel that their interest is in the work, and that it is a part of them. Their motives and influence in connecting themselves with this great and solemn work, must bear the test of the judgment. None should be allowed to become connected with the office of publication who manifest selfishness and pride.",
