    "word": "A great work is to be accomplished by personal labor. Much is comprehended in the command, \"Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.\" There is a work to be done in this line that has not yet been done. Let the Bible be read to those who will hear it. Let God's workers teach the truth in families, with earnest prayer drawing close to the people. If they thus co-operate with God, he will clothe them with spiritual power. The Holy Spirit works with him who opens the Scriptures to others. It is our part to give the word to the people; we are to sow the seed. We know not which shall prosper, whether this or that; but God will give the increase.",
