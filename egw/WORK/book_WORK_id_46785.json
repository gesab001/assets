    "word": "Sometimes the thought arises, Is it the will of God for me to stand almost alone, as it were, with those who ought to be standing with me and sustaining me, working in various ways to counteract the testimonies given me by God? These reflections are extremely painful, but when I stand before the people, the power of God comes upon me, and I am strengthened to speak the word of reproof and warning.--Ms 22, 1890, pp. 12, 13. (Diary, January 10-March 1, 1890.)",
