    "word": "Brother Prescott, your ministerial ability is needed in the work that God requires shall be done in our cities. These cities are not to be left unenlightened and unwarned. Open your eyes to see the work that is to be done in sowing the seeds of truth in new places. You should unite with other workers in seeking to bring souls to the truth. I am instructed to say to you that you are needed in the fields that are opening for evangelistic work. When you make the Lord your trust, and give to the people the message of truth, wonderful reformations will be seen. There will be an awakening and conversion of many souls who are now ignorant of what is the truth for these last days.",
