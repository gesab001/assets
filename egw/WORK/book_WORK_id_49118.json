    "word": "God is revealed in nature, God is revealed in His Word. The Bible is the most wonderful of all histories, for it is the production of God, not of the finite mind. It carries us back through the centuries to the beginning of all things, presenting the history of times and scenes which would otherwise never have been known. It reveals the glory of God in the working of His providence to save a fallen world. It presents in the simplest language the mighty power of the gospel, which received would cut the chains that bind men in slavery to Satan's chariot.--Letter 67, 1894, pp. 4, 5, 7. (To W. W. Prescott, Jan. 18, 1894, from Middle Brighton Camp Ground, Australia.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. June 23, 1980",
