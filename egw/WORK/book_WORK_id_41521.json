    "word": "Matthew 23:2-4, 10-12: The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat; all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy \n\n\n                         -42- \n\nburdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders: but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. . . . Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.",
