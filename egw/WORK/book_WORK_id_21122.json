    "word": "There is a great work to be done in the publishing of Seventh-day Adventist literature. It would not be well pleasing to the Lord for us to plan that the work of publishing our books and periodicals, for which we have well-trained workers, should be placed in the hands of unbelievers. If our offices depend upon unbelievers to do their binding, they will often be disappointed in the quality of the work. God desires that all the work we do for Him shall be well done. All the work done in our offices of publication should be so perfect that we may know that the Lord is glorified by its perfection. Let us do our best, and then we can say, \"Lord, I have done the best I can; now I ask thee to bless the efforts put forth.\" Then we may expect large results.--MS 71, 1906.",
