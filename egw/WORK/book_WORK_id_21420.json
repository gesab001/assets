    "word": "When God Calls to Larger Responsibilities.--There are many who are in such haste to climb to distinction that they skip some of the rounds of the ladder, and in so doing lose experience which they must have in order to become intelligent workers. In their zeal, the knowledge of many things looks unimportant to them. They skim over the surface, and do not go deep into the mine of truth, thus by a slow and painstaking process gaining an experience that will enable them to be of special help to others.--CT 476.",
