    "word": "Eight hundred feet above us the water rolled from the mountaintops, dashing upon the cliffs and rocks, throwing the water like a veil on every side. Below us this water accumulating from the flow above dashed in a larger fall over the rocks.

We feel subdued and awed in the presence of such manifestations of the great God.--Letter 20, 1884, pp. 3, 4. (To Uriah Smith.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 15, 1981",
