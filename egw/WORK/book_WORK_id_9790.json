    "word": "Chap. 20 - The Message Triumphant\n\n          When the Loud Cry Sounds \n\n     Truth Soon to Triumph.--The end is near, stealing upon us stealthily, imperceptibly, like the noiseless approach of a thief in the night. May the Lord grant that we shall no longer sleep as do others, but that we shall watch and be sober. The truth is soon to triumph gloriously, and all who now choose to be laborers together with God, will triumph with it. The time is short; the night soon cometh when no man can work.--Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 135. (1909)",
