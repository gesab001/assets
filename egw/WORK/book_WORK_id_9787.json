    "word": "Workers Harmed by Unnecessary Moving.--I think it does harm to call workers from one part of the vineyard where they are doing good work, to go to another field where they are to begin all new. I think it gives the ones called an idea that they are of greater consequence than they really are, and the poor souls will be injured. I caution you on this point of changing workers when there is no necessity.--Letter 179, 1900.",
