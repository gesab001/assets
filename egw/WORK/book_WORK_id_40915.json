    "word": "Yesterday I was strengthened to speak for one hour at the sanitarium. I spoke from the third chapter of Malachi, and the Lord gave me freedom. The chapel was well filled, and all listened attentively. I spoke of the needs of the work in Washington, and of the importance of our now doing our best to advance the work there, that unbelievers may see that, having begun the work, we are able to finish it. I also mentioned the calls \n                                                                           12\nthat are constantly coming in from foreign fields for men and means with which to carry on the work.",
