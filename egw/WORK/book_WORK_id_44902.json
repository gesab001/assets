    "word": "The Lord has often instructed me that we should avail ourselves of providential opportunities to secure buildings suitable for sanitarium work in favorable locations away from the cities. I have been shown that the city districts of such places as Los Angeles are unsuitable for special sanitarium work. This was pointed out very clearly at the time the workers in Los Angeles were planning, a few years ago, to build a large sanitarium in one of the very busiest and noisiest parts of the city. The light given to me at that time, was, \"Away from the cities!\" I was shown that if we would watch and search, we should find suitable properties in retired localities. Letter 94, 1909, p. 1.
