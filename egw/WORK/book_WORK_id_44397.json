    "word": "Some do not See the Need of Rural \n               Schools \n\n\n     There are those among us who have been in the truth for years, who have never seen nor sensed the need there is for working the highways and the hedges. All such should seek for reconversion of heart, for divine enlightenment, that they may discern the needs of a dying world. Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost. He went about on foot. He did not ride in easy conveyances. There were no railways or other modern means of travel in his day. It is known that \n\n\n                  -11- \n\nhe walked, and that multitudes joined him as he walked. Along the wayside, as he journeyed, he opened the Scriptures to the understanding of his followers. Constantly he was repeating to them the words of life. The multitudes that thronged his footsteps, were charmed with the principles brought out in his discourses.",
