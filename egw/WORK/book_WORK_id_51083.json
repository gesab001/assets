    "word": "Letter 233, 1904. (To Elder and Mrs. E. R. Palmer, July 8, 1904, from Takoma Park, Washington, D. C.) Last Wednesday, July 6, W. C. White, Sara, Maggie, and I left Nashville for Washington. Just before we left, a meeting of the Southern Union Conference Committee was held in Nashville, for the purpose of devising some means of helping the Huntsville school. Those who have had charge of the school have not felt the importance of putting brain, bone, and muscle to the tax in an effort to make the school a success. The students who attend this school are to be given an education that will fit them to work for the Master. They are to be given more than book knowledge. Should they be given book knowledge merely, their education would be imperfect.",
