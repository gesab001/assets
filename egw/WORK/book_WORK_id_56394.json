    "word": "The Lord's servants are merely stewards at work. The Lord's part of the work is to do that which is entrusted to Him when His followers surrender themselves to Him to be worked by the Holy Spirit. When by faith men place themselves in the Lord's hands, saying, \"Here am I, send me\", He undertakes this work. He does that which is entrusted to Him. But men must get out of the Lord's way. They must not by their devising hinder His purpose. For years the Lord has had a controversy with His people because they have followed their own judgement, and have not relied on divine wisdom. If the workers get in God's way, hindering the advancement of the work, thinking that their own power is sufficient for the planning and carrying forward of the work, the Lord will correct their error. By His divine Spirit He disciplines and trains every worker. He shapes His own providences to carry forward His work according to His mind and judgement.",
