    "word": "The truth expressed in living, unselfish deeds is the strongest argument for Christianity. Relieving the sick and helping the distressed is working in Christ's lines, and demonstrates most powerful gospel truths representing Christ's mission and work upon the earth. The knowledge of the art of relieving suffering humanity opens doors without number through which the truth can find lodgment in the heart, and souls are saved unto life, eternal life.--Letter 36, 1893, pp. 5, 7, 9. (To J. H. Kellogg, Oct. 2, 1893.)",
