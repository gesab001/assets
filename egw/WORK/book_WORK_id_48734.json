    "word": "MR No. 703 - Sorcery Shows and Lotteries Are Satan's Snares\n\n     We have been pained as we have had brought to our notice papers, advertisers of sorcery and witchcraft, the work of magicians and all this sort of thing, going on in Battle Creek. . . .

It is the power of Satan; and just as soon as you begin to bring yourselves in connection with these sorcerers, and give them the least license, you dishonor the God of heaven, and imperil your own souls. . . .",
