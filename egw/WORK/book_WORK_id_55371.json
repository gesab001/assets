    "word": "Lynn, Massachusetts, Monday, December 8, 1890 \n\n     I have been earnestly engaged in writing and in repairing my clothing. Did not walk out all day. I am in deep perplexity. I do not understand why the \n\n\n                                    -40- \n\nburden is constantly weighing me down, why I am filled with remorse for those who are connected with the publishing interest in Battle Creek. I am hearing the words spoken in reference to myself and my work. I feel an intense desire to get Patriarchs and Prophets and Great Controversy before the people because the very light they need is contained in these books. Why have those who have accepted the publishing of these books no burden?--Ms. 50, 1890, pp. 5-6 (Diary 16, p. 368).",
