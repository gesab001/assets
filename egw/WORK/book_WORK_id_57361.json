    "word": "I think now I shall take advantage of the matched flooring in the tent and the boards connected with it and board up a shanty. The tent is a poor, leaky, cold concern. When it rains and the wind blows it is no sure protection. How is the weather there in Battle Creek? If I thought it was healthful I would return with my workers, but it is more healthful here and I want to run no risks. I shall therefore dispense with the tent, put up a frame and rough board it for protection for kitchen and drying room and all purposes, put stove in the drying room that Marian and Sister Whitney, may be comfortable. They have no place for stove, no room for stove; two beds are in the room. It is a poor show for them. I have a good room with stove in it. \n                                                                           690",
