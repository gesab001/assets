    "word": "Do not seek to push a working force out of existence and to exalt yourself in conscious superiority. Rather curtail some of your large plans and help those who are struggling. Aid them in carrying out some of their plans to increase their facilities. Do not use every dollar in enlarging your facilities and increasing your responsibilities. Reserve part of your means for establishing in other places health institutions and schools. You will need great wisdom to know just where to place these institutions, so that the people will be the most benefited. All these matters must receive candid consideration.",
