    "word": "\"The Bible should not be brought into our schools to be sandwiched in between infidelity. The Bible must be made the ground-work and subject-matter of education. It is true that we know much more of the Word of the living God than we knew in the past, but there is still much more to be learned. It should be used as the Word of the living God, and esteemed as first, and last, and best in everything. Then will be seen true spiritual growth.\"--P.
