    "word": "This bull called upon all members of the church to join the crusade against the heretics. As an incentive to engage in this cruel work, it \u201cabsolved from all ecclesiastical pains and penalties, general and particular; it released all who joined the crusade from any oaths they might have taken; it legitimatized their title to any property which they might have illegally acquired, and promised remission of all their sins to such as should kill any heretic. It annulled all contracts made in favor of the Vaudois, ordered their domestics to abandon them, forbade all persons to give them any aid whatever, and empowered all persons to take possession of their property.\u201d This document clearly reveals the masterspirit behind the scenes. It is the roar of the dragon, and not the voice of Christ, that is heard therein.",
