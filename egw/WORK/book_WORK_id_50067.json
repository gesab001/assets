    "word": "MR No. 955 - Items for Newbold--Part II\n\n     Each Person Has an Influence on Others--The fruit borne upon the tree is not seen in good works, but in perpetuation of transgression and sin. It is not alone one's own soul and his own hope of eternal life that are sacrificed. He has influenced others. And all the influence he failed to exert in behalf of righteousness and truth, all the stumbling blocks laid in the way of other souls, will be charged against him in that great day when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, and everyone shall be judged according to his deeds. The soul that has had light in regard to the Lord's Sabbath, His memorial of Creation, and to save himself from inconvenience and reproach has chosen to remain disloyal, has sold his Lord. He has dishonored the name of Christ. He has taken his stand with the armies of antichrist. With them at the last great day he will be found outside the city of God, not with the loyal, the true and righteous, in the heavenly kingdom.",
