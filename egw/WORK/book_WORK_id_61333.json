    "word": "In places where money has been expended on buildings, and a start has been made, it is the duty of the men in responsible positions to give attention to that locality, so that workers shall be sustained in accomplishing the work designed when the plant was made.

And those who know nothing of the Southern field, let them be sparing and cautious what advice they give. But sympathy, kind words, and encouragement are always in place. \n\n\n                            Your mother, \n\n\n                                   (Signed) \n\n\n                                             Ellen G.
