    "word": "To those who have been injured without a cause, the words of this scripture apply, \"If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.\" Their failure to comply with the instruction given in the text is not due to the course of action that they themselves have pursued, but to the envy, jealousy, and evil surmising of those who have been in the wrong. Thus a division is caused. How can it be healed? Shall the man that has been sinned against, misjudged, and maligned be called to account, to find something in his past course by which he can humiliate himself, and acknowledge himself in the wrong for the sake of making peace? No. If he has conscientiously gone forward under the oppression of wicked feelings that have been welcomed in the hearts of the fault-finding, if he has been patient under the abuse, if he has tried to do his duty, he is not to humble himself to acknowledge that he is guilty. He does \n\n\n                                   -161- \n\nthe offenders a great wrong thus to take their guilt upon his soul, admitting that he has given them occasion for their course of action, when he has done no such thing. This is very gratifying to those who have done the work of the enemy; but heaven's books record the facts just as they stand.",
