    "word": "U. T.--Aug. 30, '96 (H. L. para. 369) \n     If your work is sedentary, take exercise every day, and at each meal eat only two or three kinds of simple food, taking no more of these than will satisfy the demands of hunger.  {TSDF 17.10}  \n                                                        7 T.--257 \n     At bountiful tables, men often eat much more than can be easily digested. The overburdened stomach can not do its work properly. The result is a disagreeable feeling of dullness in the brain, and the mind does not act quickly. Disturbance is created by improper combinations of food; fermentation sets in; the blood is contaminated and the brain confused.  {TSDF 17.11}  \n     The habit of overeating, or of eating too many kinds of food at one meal, frequently causes dyspepsia. Serious injury is thus done to the delicate digestive organs. In vain the stomach protests, and appeals to the brain to reason from cause to effect. The excessive amount of food eaten, or the improper combination, does its injurious work. In vain do disagreeable premonitions give warning. Suffering is the consequence. Disease takes the place of health.  {TSDF 17.12}  \n                            U. T.--Aug. 25, '97 (H. L. para. 889) \n     Many are made sick by the indulgence of appetite. . . . So many varieties are introduced into the stomach that fermentation is the result. This condition brings on acute disease, and death frequently follows.  {TSDF 17.13}  \n                             U. T.--Nov. 5, '96 (H. L. para. 681) \n     The less that condiments and desserts are placed upon our tables, the better it will be for all who partake of the food. All mixed and complicated foods are injurious to the health of human beings. Dumb animals would never eat such a mixture as is often placed in the human stomach. . . . Rich and complicated mixtures of food are health destroying.  {TSDF 17.14}  \n                                                C. T. & B. H.--57 \n     Some use milk and a large amount of sugar on mush, thinking that they are carrying out health reform. But the sugar and the milk combined are liable to cause fermentation in the stomach, and are thus harmful.  {TSDF 17.15}  \n                             U. T.--Aug. 30, '96 (H. L. para 370) \n     It would be better to eat only two or three different kinds of food at each meal than to load the stomach with many varieties.  {TSDF 17.16}  \n\nChapter 6 - Cooking Schools\n\n                                                    C. to T.--127 \n     Do not neglect to teach your children how to prepare wholesome food. In giving them these lessons in physiology and in good cooking, you are teaching them the first steps in some of the most useful branches of education, and inculcating principles which are needful elements in their religious life.",
