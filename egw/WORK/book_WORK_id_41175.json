    "word": "The Lord calls for workers who are partakers of the divine nature, who have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. He would have every man to step forth in his Go-given manhood, every woman in her God-given womanhood. He desires them to stand forth like faithful sentinels to keep back the tide of moral woe, to break the fetters that are binding human beings in slavery. God calls upon His ministers to do faithful work in presenting the great curse that man himself is manufacturing. From every pulpit the message should be heard, \"Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\"--\"Review and Herald,\" May 1, 1900.",
