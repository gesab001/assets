    "word": "Chosen men were specially endowed by God with skill and wisdom for the construction of the wilderness tabernacle. \"Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel . . . of the tribe of Judah; and he hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship. . . . And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab . . . of the tribe of Dan. Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer . . . and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work\" (Exodus 35:30-35). \"Then wrought Bezaleel . . . and every wise hearted man, in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding\" (Exodus 36:1). Heavenly intelligences cooperated with the workmen whom God Himself chose.",
