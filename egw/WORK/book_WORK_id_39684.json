    "word": "Let not the work on the Nashville Sanitarium, and the Takoma Park Sanitarium, be hindered for lack of means. Let not the work of rebuilding at Huntsville be made difficult and burdensome because the necessary means is withheld. Let not those who are struggling to build up the other enterprises, great and small, that are needing the promised aid, become disheartened because we are slow to unite in making up the fund that is asked for. Let all our people arise, and see what they can do. Let them show that there is unity and strength among Seventh-day Adventists.",
