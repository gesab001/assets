    "word": "Letter 9a, 1895, entire letter. (To Fannie Bolton, November 11, 1895.)--I have considered the matter carefully in regard to your connecting with me again in the work. I cannot consent to it. The matter has been shaping itself in reference to yourself, that it is simply impossible for you to continue to do the work for me that you have done. Separation must come, for the reasons I have told you. I must use every means in my power, cut off every chance for you to make your statements which you have made in reference to me and my work--your claims to putting your talent in my work.",
