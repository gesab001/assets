It is the Lord's school, and I will send you his ideas to consider. May he help, and strengthen and bless you. Look and live. He will prepare the way before you, only have faith. I believe that the Lord intends to accomplish through this school a great work. It is the beginning of educational reform.\" \n        (Signed)         Ellen G. White.",
