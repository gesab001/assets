    "word": "God longs to work through those to whom he has given capabilities for great things. He longs to see those who occupy responsible places, representing him to the world. He desires that Christ be acknowledged as the greatest Teacher the world has ever known, and that he shall shine through their minds as the light of the world. \"To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believed on his name.\" But in order that this may be, God demands that every intellectual and physical capability be offered as a consecrated oblation to him.",
