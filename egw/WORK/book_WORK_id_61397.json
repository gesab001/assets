    "word": "\"The Lord hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.\" Here, according to the appointment of God, are the two agencies in man's salvation, - the divine influences, and a strong, living, working faith, a faith that receives the truth. God requires no man to cast aside his reason, and yield to the control of blind credulity. But we are to search the Scriptures in the spirit of learners. In the meekness of Christ canvas every point of difference. Search for the truth as for hidden treasures. It will not do to ignore these questions of vital interest. Human assertions are as valueless as straw. Many will miss the path to heaven because they rest their faith upon men. They resist the message of mercy because some one in whom they have confidence is indifferent to it. But the soul is of too great value to rest its faith on man. No one but Christ can ransom the soul. We have the word of God, and this alone can we trust unwaveringly. Let brethren seek God together. Let them fall upon the Rock and be broken. \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" We must understand the obligations imposed upon us by this co-operation, or we shall never stand approved in the Judgment. Laborers together with God means fellow-laborers with those of our own fallen race, but cooperating with divine agencies. It is the work of salvation to accomplish this union of the human with the divine.",
