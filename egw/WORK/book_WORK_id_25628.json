    "word": "An education amid such surroundings is in accordance with the directions which God has given for the instruction of youth; but it is in direct contrast with the methods employed in the majority of schools.

The minds of the young have been occupied with books of science and philosophy, \n                                                                           61\nwhere the thorns of skepticism have been only partially concealed; with vague, fanciful fairy stories; or with the works of authors, who, although they may write on Scripture subjects, weave in their own fanciful interpretations. The teaching of such books is as seed sown in the heart. It grows and bears fruit, and a plentiful harvest of infidelity is reaped; and the result is seen in the depravity of the human family.",
