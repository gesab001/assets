    "word": "As the love of God enlists all the energies and the stability of Christian principles on the side of unselfish, persevering work for the Master, Brother Radley will be an instrument in the hands of God for saving the souls of his children, and filing them under the bloodstained banner of Prince Emmanuel, and their influence will extend beyond his own family to his neighbors.
