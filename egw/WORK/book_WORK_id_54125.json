    "word": "I was shown at a certain time when the Spirit of the Lord was working upon those connected with the Institution, some confessions were made. They seemed to be assembled in a meeting of worship. Elder Rice was standing upon his feet, and the Spirit of God was deeply moving upon his heart to confess his way out of darkness into the light. But he spoke only in general terms. He in no wise cleared his soul from the stains of wrong on his part in connection with Sister Heald. He trembled for a while under the promptings of the Spirit of God, but refused to humiliate his soul before God in lifting up the cross. From that time he began to walk in darkness, contrary to light and truth. He had a molding influence upon Sister Heald. She felt at one time that she could never be free, unless she made a humble confession. But Elder Rice molded matters to please himself. He might have made straightforward work; he might have come out of darkness into the light; he might have drawn near to God; and the Lord would have forgiven his sins and lifted up a standard for him against the enemy.",
