    "word": "We are glad to see so many here today. But how many present have brought the Comforter with them? Is Jesus shining forth in their life and character, and are their hearts filled with praise and thanksgiving? There is work for everyone to do for Jesus. How many take into account the record of our works kept in the books in heaven? How many feel the responsibility of perishing souls? How many come into close connection with Jesus and sense the need of forming a perfect character after the likeness of Christ? This character is not to be dropped upon you by and by from heaven, but it is to be developed here.",
