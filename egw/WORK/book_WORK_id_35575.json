    "word": "Christ is to be represented in the home circle. Fathers and mothers bear a weighty responsibility; for they will be held accountable for giving correct lessons to their children. They are to speak kindly to them, to be patient with them, to watch unto prayer, praying the Lord to mold and fashion the hearts of the children. But while asking God to mold and fashion the characters of the children, let mothers and fathers act their part, presenting to their offspring a living representation of the divine Pattern. God will not accept haphazard work at your hands. Your children are God's heritage, and heavenly angels are watching to see that both parents and children are colaborers with God in building up character after the divine model.-- Manuscript 32, July 29, 1894, \"Meeting at Seven Hills.\"",
