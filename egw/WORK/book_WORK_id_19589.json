    "word": "Ministers' prayers unheard if they regard iniquity.--\"God has chosen us out of the world that we might be a peculiar and holy people. Who gave\n24\nHimself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\" God's workers must be men of prayer, diligent students of the Scriptures, hungering and thirsting after righteousness, that they may be a light and strength to others. Our God is a jealous God; and He requires that we worship Him in spirit and in truth, in the beauty of holiness. The psalmist says, \"If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.\" As workers, we must take heed to our ways. If the psalmist could not be heard if he regarded iniquity in his heart, how can the prayers of ministers be heard if iniquity is regarded among them? There are dangers to which we are continually exposed. It is Satan's studied plan to make the workers weak in prayer, weak in power, and weak in influence before the world, because of the defects in their characters,--defects which in no way harmonize with the truth.--RH Nov. 10, 1885.",
