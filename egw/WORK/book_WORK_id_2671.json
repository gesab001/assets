    "word": "Worry is blind and cannot discern the future.  But Jesus sees the end from the beginning, and He has prepared His way to bring relief.  \"So much to do!\" Yes; but who is the chief worker?  Jesus Christ your Lord.  He offers to lighten the loads we carry by putting Himself under the loads.  Abiding in Christ, and Christ abiding in us, we can do all things through Him, who strengtheneth us.",
