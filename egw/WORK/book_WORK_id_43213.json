    "word": "The message has been given to those in Battle Creek, that many should move into places where they may engage in this very work, in connection with their temporal business. Had they moved out by faith, willing to endure wearing labor and privation for the work's sake, they would have obtained rich experiences in the things of God. But they thought that they would find things a little more comfortable in Battle Creek, that the work there would be less taxing than elsewhere, and thus they remain. Many who crowd into Battle Creek get no good there, because they do not make use of the knowledge they receive. They do no good in Battle Creek, but are swelling the number who need conversion. They have not the spirit of sacrifice. They have much of self, and a little of Christ, a little faith, and a few good works. They think that they have religion, but it all amounts to nothing.",
