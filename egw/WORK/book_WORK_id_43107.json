    "word": "This is the will of God concerning every human being, \"even your sanctification.\"  In urging your way upward, heavenward, every faculty must be kept in the most healthy condition to do the most faithful service. The powers with which God has endowed men, are to be put to the stretch. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and \n\n\n                     -54- \n\nwith all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\" Man cannot possibly do this of himself; he must have divine power. What shall the human agent do in the great work?--\"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\"",
