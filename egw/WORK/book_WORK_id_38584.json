    "word": "Advancing the Truth. \n\n     Men make the work of advancing the truth tenfold harder than it really is, by seeking to take God's work out of his hands into their own finite hands. They think that they must be constantly inventing something to make men do things which they suppose these persons ought to do. The time thus spent is all the while making the work more complicated; for the great chief Worker is left out of the question in the care of his own heritage. Men undertake the job of tinkering up the defective character of others, and only succeed in making the defects much worse. They would better leave God to do his own work; for he does not regard them as capable of re-shaping character.",
