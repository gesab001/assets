    "word": "In this new year let new methods be recommended. Let parents encourage their children to act a part in the circulation of \"Christ's Object Lessons.\" This will instruct the children in acts of self-denial. The work of selling \"Christ's Object Lessons\" is a work that Christ would have the children engage in and they themselves will be blessed in the work. Light, precious light, is contained in the book, which every family should follow.",
