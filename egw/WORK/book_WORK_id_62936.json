    "word": "God does not call upon his missionaries to show their devotion to him by burying themselves in monasteries, or by going on long, painful pilgrimages. It is not necessary to do this to show a willingness to deny self. It is by working for those for whom Christ died that we show true love. By humiliation, suffering, and rejection Christ purchased the salvation of the human race. By his death he made it possible for man to enjoy a home in his eternal kingdom. Those who love the Lord will look at Calvary, and will think of how the Lord of life and glory laid aside his royal robes and kingly crown, and clothing his divinity with humanity, came to a world all seared and marred with the curse, to stand at the head of the fallen race, becoming their example in all things, bearing all the trials they have to bear and enduring all the temptations they have to endure. He lived the life of the poorest, and suffered often with hunger. \"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests,\" he said, \"But the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.\"",
