    "word": "The light given me is that in our meetings the speakers should keep a reserve force, so that when the enemy begins to work, we need not resort to strange fire, become combative, and kind of throw the sword. We may thus betray the cause just at the very point where victory is ours. If we should let loose of Jesus and take up our own spirit, it may take months, or perhaps years to counteract that one wrong move. Unless many of us are \n\n\n                                    -69- \n\nconverted and become as little children, we shall never see the kingdom of God. These are just the lessons we need to bring into our schools.  They do not need science so much as these principles.",
