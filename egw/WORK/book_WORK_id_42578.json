    "word": "My brother, my sister, you are forbidden to make the mistakes of a fellow-worker a subject of conversation. By speaking evil of another, you sow the seeds of criticism and denunciation. You cannot afford to do this. Go to the one who you think is in the wrong, and tell him his fault \"between thee and him alone.\" If he will hear you, and can explain the matter to you, how glad you will be that you did not take up a reproach against him, but instead followed the Saviour's directions!",
