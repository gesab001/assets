    "word": "Again I would urge upon [you] the necessity from the very first establishment of your work, to commence in a dignified, Godlike manner, that you may give character to the influence of the truth which you know to be of heavenly birth. But remember that great care is to be exercised in regard to the presentation of truth. Carry the minds along guardedly. Dwell upon practical godliness, weaving the same into doctrinal discourses. The teachings and love \n13\nof Christ will soften and subdue the soil of the heart for the good seed of truth. You will obtain the confidence of the people by working to obtain acquaintance with them. But keep up the elevated character of the work. Let the publications, the papers, the pamphlets, be working among the people, and preparing the minds of the reading class for the preaching of the truth. Let no stinted efforts be made in this line, and the work, if commenced wisely, and prosecuted wisely, will result in success. But do be humble and teachable, if you will teach others, and lead others in the way of truth and righteousness. \u2014 Letter 14, 1887.",
