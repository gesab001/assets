    "word": "W. C. WHITE: THERE IS A MINE THAT BROTHER HARRIS THINKS OF BUYING. IT IS TO COST ABOUT $300,000. HE THINKS THAT THE LORD HAS SHOWN HIM THAT HE IS GOING TO MAKE SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF IT. HE WANTS TO USE THE GREATER PART OF THE EARNINGS IN CARRYING THE MESSAGE AND HASTENING THE CLOSE OF THE WORK. SISTER HARRIS AND SOME OTHERS HAVE ADVISED HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE EXPERT MEN GO AND EXAMINE IT, BUT HE HAS DEPENDED UPON THESE TESTS, AND HE FEELS THAT THE LORD WOULD HAVE HIM BUY IT. HE HAS SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THE PRICE TO RAISE TODAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY WORD OF CAUTION TO SEND HIM?",
