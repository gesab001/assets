    "word": "Equity in the Matter of Wages [SPECIAL TESTIMONIES, SERIES B, NO. 19, PP. 32, 33 (1902).] \n\nDear Brother: \n     I did not suppose that it would be so long before I fulfilled my promise to write to you. I have been thinking of the question that was agitating your mind in regard to wages. You suggest that if we paid higher wages, we could secure men of ability to fill important positions of trust. This might be so, but I should very much regret to see our workers held to our work by the wages they receive. There are needed in the cause of God workers who will make a covenant with Him by sacrifice, who will labor for the love of souls, not for the wages they receive.",
