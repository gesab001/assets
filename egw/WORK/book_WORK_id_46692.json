    "word": "I entreat those who have charge of the office here to be kind and courteous in dealing with the apprentices. Win their souls by kindness. If they do wrong, go to them in the spirit of meekness, and talk and pray with them. Work for the salvation of every one of them. Do not rest till you see that their feet are planted firmly on the Rock of Ages. Then everything will move harmoniously.",
