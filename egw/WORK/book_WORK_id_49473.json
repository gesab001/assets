    "word": "Prescott in Danger of Making Shipwreck of Faith (To W. W. Prescott)-- There are constant dangers besetting the pathway of God's servants, and these dangers we may learn to avoid. At times, Elder Prescott, you have come very near making shipwreck of your faith. Only the grace of God and the confidence you have had in the messages He has sent through the Spirit of Prophecy have held you back. I was shown that although you have had many years of experience in the cause of God, you are still in danger of making grave mistakes. You will be inclined to catch hold of some minor matter which you consider to be important, and place great weight upon it. At such times Satan is waiting and watching for an opportunity to influence your mind and through you to work upon many other minds, leading them to questioning and doubt. The Lord has not called you to such a work as this. Upon some questions silence will reveal a spirit of wisdom and discretion.--Letter 166, 1908, p. 2 (May 22, 1908). \n\n\n                                  -362-",
