    "word": "The malarious, poisonous atmosphere, which surrounds the souls of those who are dead in trespasses and sins, is causing them to become like the inhabitants of the Noatic world, who, because they chose to follow the imaginations of their own corrupt minds, and dishonor God by their wicked inventions, they became corrupt in body and soul, and hated the God who made them. God sent them a message that they should not live, but should be destroyed because of their wicked works. And whole families today are in need of being terribly alarmed. They have been, and still are, corrupting their way before God. They are so steeped in licentiousness that they do not discern the difference between the pure affections given them of God, the attributes of human nature, and the destructive lusts which by indulgence and wicked inventions make them as sinful as were those before the flood and the inhabitants of Sodom.",
