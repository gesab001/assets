    "word": "There has been wrong management, not designedly, but in zeal and ardor to carry forward the missionary work. In the distribution and wide circulation of papers, tracts, and pamphlets, the instrumentalities to produce these publications have been crippled and embarrassed.

Responsible men are in danger of becoming one-idea men, of concentrating their thoughts upon one branch of the work, to the neglect of other parts of the great field.",
