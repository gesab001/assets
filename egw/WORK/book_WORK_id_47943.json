    "word": "Brother Haskell is a man of experience, and is respected and honored by all. His wife is a woman of rare ability as a manager. She takes hold most earnestly, not afraid to put her hand to any work. She does not say, \"Go,\" but she says, \"Come, we will do this or that,\" and they cheerfully do as she instructs them. We have had most precious instruction from the Word from both Bro. and Sr. Haskell.",
