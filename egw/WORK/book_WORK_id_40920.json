    "word": "Brother Abbey. \n\n     Bro. Abbey and family have a great conflict to get the love of the world out of their hearts. The cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches are choking out the precious graces, until the heart is almost destitute of them. There is a cold. unfeeling spirit for the needy and unfortunate. But the time will come when Bro. and Sr. Abbey will experience the fulfillment of these scriptures. That which ye sow ye shall also reap; and, That which ye mete to others shall be meted to you again. Take care. Watch. Every member of the family, watch; the course you pursue toward others, watch; yes, watch your feelings, your words, your actions. Your motives and acts are \n                                                                           5\nto bear the test of the Judgment. Bro. and Sr. Abbey, you are deceived in yourselves. You love this world, and you devote very little time to the service of God. It is all hurry, drive, work, work, confusion, disorder, and distraction. Such a condition of things is unfavorable to a growth in grace and spirituality. You are laying up treasure upon the earth, and your hearts are on your treasure. \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.\"",
