    "word": "The Holy Spirit of God manifested among his people has by some been treated as an intruder. You, yourself have not made the Holy Spirit your dependence as in your earlier experience. Had you been following the Spirit's guidance, you would have known that you could not unite with these men, listen to their suggestions, and give them influence. This was not the work which God had given you to do. He has promised you efficiency through the power of the Holy Spirit, which will be with you in every act, if you will hold fast the beginning of your confidence firm unto the end. If you had depended less on the men who, as you had every reason to know, had not a vital connection with God, and had depended more on the presence and aid of the Holy Spirit in answer to prayer, the cause would today be in a far more healthful condition.",
