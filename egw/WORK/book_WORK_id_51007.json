    "word": "On the Sabbath no servile work is to be done. God has given man six days on which to work. He claims the seventh day as His own. On this day men are to worship Him. They are to contemplate the wonderful works of the Creator, praising Him for His goodness and love. By giving them the Sabbath, it was God's design to preserve among men a clear, definite knowledge of Himself as their Creator. He declares, \"It is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you\" [Exodus 31:13].",
