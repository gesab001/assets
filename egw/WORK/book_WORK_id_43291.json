    "word": "Study Appropriateness. \n\n     The various points of truth are not all equally appropriate to be presented to a congregation at any one time. Even Jesus said to his disciples, who had been with him for three years, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" We must endeavor to present the truth as the people are prepared to hear it and to appreciate its value. The Spirit of God is working upon the minds and hearts of men, and we are to work in harmony with it.",
