    "word": "When we returned from Kansas in the autumn of 1870, Bro. Gage was at home sick. His wife, and his mother, brother and sisters-in-law, said he had worked so hard that it resulted in his sickness. This was not the truth. Overlabor was not the cause of his sickness. He accompanied his brother-in-law on a pleasure trip to Chicago to see the place. The cars were delayed, and he was obliged to wait, on an unpleasant, rainy night, till near morning in the depot, before the cars came along. He traveled all the next day over Chicago, in a rain storm, and returned in the night to Battle Creek. This exposure brought on fever. This desire for a pleasure trip led him to desert his post of duty, and what makes this appear still worse, sister Van Horn, at this very time, was absent from the Office in consequence of fever brought upon her by the sudden death of \n                                                                           23\nher mother. Bro. Smith was also from the Office, in Rochester, N. Y., recovering from a fever. There was a great amount of unfinished work, and that Bro. Gage should feel at liberty, in my husband's absence, to neglect pressing duties which related to the interests of the cause generally, to take a pleasure excursion, is astonishing. Yet he left his post of duty to gratify his own pleasure. This fact in Bro. Gage's experience is a sample of the man. Sacred duties rest lightly upon him.",
