    "word": "In all wisdom people are to be warned and taught. Those who are seeking to win souls to Christ must be guarded in every action, lest they make a wrong impression on those for whom they are working. The Lord will give success to those who in spiritual and temporal lines will deal faithfully with human minds. Let those who work for Christ put on Christ. Then there will be a continual advancement in knowledge and understanding, an advancement that will make an impression on the world.",
