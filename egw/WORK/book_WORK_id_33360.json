    "word": "\u201cI have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the Word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.\u201d God calls upon the young men and young women \n59\nto make the most of their intrusted ability. He would have you cultivate habits of industry, habits of study, that you may improve the talents He has given you. God will accept your service, and the improvement of your talents, but He can not look with approval upon half-hearted, half-way work. Every branch of God's work calls for the exercise of the highest ability; it demands that you shall bring into requisition every available help, that you shall direct your noblest impulses to the propagation of the truth. The exalted, sacred character of the work requires the enlistment of the highest intellectual and spiritual powers, that it may be properly represented before those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.",
