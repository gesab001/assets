    "word": "Let workers be selected who are qualified to teach the truth wisely in clear, simple lines. Let us not wait before beginning this work until all the way is made clear. Faith says,  Move forward. Christ says, \"Lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Go on, step by step, departing not from that spirit of sanctification through the truth which the presence of the Spirit of God and obedience to the truth will give. Let none who have accepted this blessed faith and hope be found lacking in the spirit of self-sacrifice as they engage in the sacred work of presenting to the people, the truth in its simplicity.--Letter 142, 1909, p. 8. (To A. G. Daniells, October 27, 1909.)",
