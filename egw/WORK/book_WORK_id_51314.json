    "word": "Brother Sutherland has caught up the idea that there must be many church schools built; but this would mean the misappropriation of means that are called for to open new fields for the ministry of the Word. Wherever \n\n\n                                  -49- \n\nthere is a settled church, a small building should be erected as a church school. In whatever locality a meeting-house is erected, let a schoolroom be prepared for that locality, and let teachers of good ability work in instructing the students. But there must be no catching up without discretion, of rays of light, beautiful light, mixing with it erroneous matters, and calling it truth, which each supposes he can prove from the testimonies. I am afraid to write out many things which are exceedingly precious. I am afraid to introduce them.",
