    "word": "The Lord calls for valiant men, who will not fail or be discouraged. Trials and disappointments will come to God's workers; but did they not come to Jesus? Shall we cover the Lord's altar with mourning and sighing and tears? God forbid. It comforts me to meditate upon the loving words of Christ, to think of His courtesy, His sympathy, His compassion. I long to be like Him. I will rest in His care. He will make me a conqueror over evil.",
