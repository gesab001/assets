    "word": "Brethren, we want to do something to set things in operation for God. We want to do something that will save souls, that at last we may enter into the joy of our Lord, that we may give praises to our Lord that we have been the means of saving some through Him. That some may say, It is through your instrumentality, it is you who saved me through Jesus Christ. That is the way we shall enter into the joy of our Lord. This is the way we want to work. We cannot know here what the effect of our work has been, but we shall see in eternity what we have done for the Master. Shall we plan and devise to carry out these plans to the letter? then the blessings of the Lord will attend all our labors. --Manuscript 10, 1888.",
