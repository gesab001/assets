    "word": "Our Mighty Helper\n     It is our privilege to say with Paul, \u201cI live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.\u201d [Galatians 2:20.] And yet how many are making laborious work of walking in the narrow way of holiness. To many the peace and rest of this blessed way seems no nearer today than it did years in the past. They look afar off for that which is nigh; they make intricate that which Jesus made very plain. He is \u201cthe way, the truth, and the life.\u201d The plan of salvation has been plainly revealed in the word of God, but the wisdom of the world has been sought too much, and the wisdom of Christ's righteousness too little. And souls that might have rested in the love of Jesus, have been doubting, and troubled about many things.",
