    "word": "September 21. Brother and Sister Whitney, Brother and Sister Mallon, W. C. White, and myself had a conversation in regard to Brother and Sister Mallon connecting with the office. Sister Mallon was our interpreter. Her husband cannot speak English. We greatly desire that this change should be made, for the talent they possess is greatly needed in this printing office. The work would be enlarged and publications multiplied in different languages. In case Brother Mallon should leave Italy, then someone would have to take their place to hold what has already been gained to the cause of truth and gather in others.",
