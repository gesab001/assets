    "word": "Jewelry and Expensive Dress Will Not Give Us Influence.--We have not time now to give anxious thought as to what we shall eat and drink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed. Let us live simply, and work in simplicity. Let us dress in such a modest, becoming way that we will be received wherever we go. Jewelry and expensive dress will not give us influence, but the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit--the result of devotion to the service of Christ--will give us power with God. Kindness and forethought for those about us are qualities precious in the sight of heaven. If you have not given attention to the acquirement of these graces, do so now, for you have no time to lose.--Manuscript 83, 1909, p. 3. (\"Seek Ye the Kingdom of God,\" Sermon preached at Council Grove, Kansas, August 29, 1909.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 19, 1979",
