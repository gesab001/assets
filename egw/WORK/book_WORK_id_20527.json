    "word": "Without human effort divine effort is in vain. God will work with power when in trustful dependence upon Him parents will awake to the sacred responsibility resting upon them, and seek to train their children aright. He will co-operate with those parents who carefully and prayerfully educate their children, working out their own and their children\u2019s salvation. He will work in them, to will and to do of His own good pleasure.\u2014(The Adventist Home, 206, 207.)",
