    "word": "God's servants are to work. People need the light of truth, and by earnest, faithful effort it is to be communicated to them. There are souls to be sought for, prayed for, labored for. The lamps of the soul are to be kept trimmed and burning. God's servants are to be \"not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,\" Everything that can be done to save souls should be done without delay. Earnest appeals should be made. Fervent prayers should be offered. God's Word declares, \"The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\"",
