    "word": "PAGE 83. BICYCLE RACE: SEE ALSO PAGE 398. IN 1895, ELLEN WHITE WAS GIVEN A VIEW OF HAPPENINGS IN BATTLE CREEK. AMONG OTHER SCENES WHICH PASSED BEFORE HER WAS ONE INVOLVING BICYCLES USED IN RACING, AND A STRIFE FOR THE MASTERY. SEE TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH, VOL. 8, PP. 51, 52. AT THE TIME THIS SCENE WAS PRESENTED, THE BICYCLE WAS NOT KNOWN AS AN ECONOMICAL MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, BUT WAS RATHER A RICH MAN'S TOY. BICYCLES WERE BEING PURCHASED BY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN BATTLE CREEK, NOT TO PROVIDE NEEDED TRANSPORTATION TO WORK OR SCHOOL, BUT RATHER AS A DEMONSTRATION OF SUPERIORITY, FOR SHOW, AND IN THE SEEKING OF SUPREMACY. THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE MORTGAGING THEIR INCOMES FOR MONTHS IN ADVANCE TO BUY WHAT WAS THEN AN EXPENSIVE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO BE SO USED. WITHIN A FEW YEARS' TIME, THE BICYCLE BECAME A USEFUL AND INEXPENSIVE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION.",
