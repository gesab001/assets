    "word": "Letter 109, 1905. (To Addie and May Walling, [THE CHILDREN OF ELLEN WHITE'S NIECE, LOUISE CLOUGH-WALLING. WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE GIRLS IN THE 1870'S, BOTH ADDIE AND MAY BECAME A PART OF ELLEN WHITE'S HOUSEHOLD.] April 11, 1905, from Elmshaven.) I have just finished reading over the proofs of Ministry of Healing. We hope that this book will be out before General Conference. I will send you a copy as soon as I receive some from the Press. W. C. W. is now at Mountain View, helping on Ministry. When he is not there, other things are allowed to come in, and the work on my book goes very slowly.",
