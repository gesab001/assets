Dec. 10, 1897. \n\nDear Brethren,- \n     Many things of a corrupting nature, which should not be sanctioned for a minute have entered into the office at Battle Creek. These were of a character to eclipse the sacredness of the work. Men who had no experience in the earlier history of this work, men who knew so little of the building up of our institutions especially of the Publishing interests, seemed to have a superficial experience. Notwithstanding all the instruction, and warnings, and appeals given they went directly contrary to them, because they were not converted and were not prepared for the position they occupied in the office of publication. They were apparently interested in the work but did not disinterestedly labor for its advancement. Their selfish interests led them to bring in the worldly policy plan and to work in cheap, human principles, from a worldly standpoint. After the enemy came in at Minneapolis, was the time for more pronounced reforms to be made by our tried men in the Publishing work.",
