    "word": "The grace of humility is rare in these times; but he who possesses it will reveal the grace of Christ in word and spirit and action. We need individually to seek the Lord until we find Him, and then to follow on to know the beauty of His character. Christ invites His believing people: \"Come unto me, all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" The worker who responds to this invitation will have a correct estimate of his individual duty. \n\n\n                              Ellen G.
