    "word": "This, oh this is what is needed in the hearts of all our institutions! It is the knowledge of God; and men must not lift up themselves in their own finite wisdom, as did ancient Israel--take themselves out of the hands of God, and think in their human wisdom and supposed smartness they can do much better when left to their own imaginings.
