    "word": "Let the words of the beloved disciple be considered and practiced: \"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.\" If all would take heed to these words and obey them, we should see in all our institutions a different state of things. The souls of the workers would be surrounded by an atmosphere that is healthful, like a precious odor, a savor of life unto life. \"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith. \"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have from him, That he who loveth God will love his brother also.\"",
