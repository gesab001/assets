    "word": "The president of the General Conference should not select his son to be a counselor or a judge, for if such a relative is connected with him, there is danger that correct principles will not be carried out. The very fact that the counselor is a relative will be a source of temptation to those who have been swayed from truth and righteousness to carry things in their own way, the son thinking he has no right to question his father's decisions or work. The president of the Conference should choose as his counselors \"able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness\" [Exodus 18:21].",
