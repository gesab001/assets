    "word": "God desires His people to show by their lives the advantage of Christianity over worldliness. We are to live so that God can use us in His work of converting men and women and leading them to wash their garments of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. We are His workmanship, \"created in Christ Jesus unto good works.\" Through us God desires to reveal His manifold wisdom. Therefore He bids us let our light shine forth in good works.--MS. 73a, 1900. \n\n                                               -",
