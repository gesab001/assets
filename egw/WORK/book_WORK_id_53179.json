    "word": "The instruction given by Jude from verse twenty to the close of the chapter, will make our work a complete whole, teaching us how to conduct the \n\n\n                                  -107- \n\nwarfare in the service of Christ. No one-sided extravagance is to be revealed, no indolence or shiftlessness is to be indulged. We are not to ignore any man's individuality, nor in any way to justify cold-hearted criticism or selfish practice.",
