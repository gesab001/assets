    "word": "The worship of a common working day, and the multitudinous ceremonies in connection with this false sabbath, are of the same nature as the wrongs pointedly exposed by Christ when he said, \"And many such things ye do.\" The plain evidence of truth is not discerned.

Common things are exalted above those that are sacred and heavenly.",
