    "word": "I appeal to you, my brethren in the ministry. Connect yourselves more closely with the work of God. Many souls that might be saved, will be lost, unless you strive more earnestly to make your work as perfect as possible. There is a great work to be done in Europe. It may seem to move slowly and hard at first; but God will work mightily through you if you will only make an entire \n129\nsurrender to him. Much of the time you will have to walk by faith, not by feeling.",
