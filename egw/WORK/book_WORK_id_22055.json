    "word": "A mistake has been made in setting young men and young women at work in the slums of our great cities. Few will be saved as a result of this work. . . . The Lord has shown me that our work is to bring into the truth those who will be producers as well as consumers. There are men of talent and influence who are longing for something they have not yet received. Let the truth in its simplicity be presented to them. If converted, they would exert a powerful influence for the truth.",
