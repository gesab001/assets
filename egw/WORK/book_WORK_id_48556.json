    "word": "Self-denial is to be brought into the daily experience of each worker. Let them say to one another, \"Come; we will put all earnestness into our labors; for the night is at hand, when no man can work.\" Let no one lose minutes by talking, when he should be working. There are times when he has no right to talk nor to stand still. Make not others idle by tempting them to listen to your conversation. Not only is your own time lost, but that of others is wasted, when you spend in chatting the time you should spend doing your work. The word of inspiration tells us that we are to be \"not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" Then let all take hold of the work in earnest.",
