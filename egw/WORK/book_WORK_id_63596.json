    "word": "Elder Butler and Elder Haskell are to be given the assistance and advantages that will make their efforts successful. They are to be sustained in their labors. The Lord would have those of his people who are willing to give of their means for the advancement of his work, now turn their attention to the work in the South, and especially just now to Nashville. Twenty times as much could have been accomplished in the South as has been accomplished, had the sanitarium work been built up and had the necessary schools been established.",
