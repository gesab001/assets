    "word": "MR No. 427 - Appreciation of Marian Davis - II\n(See also Manuscript Release No. 423)\n\n     I may not be able to return to California until next fall although I shall be very glad to return as soon as possible. We are now commencing the work on Vol. I and II, and Life of Christ. Marian is earnest and anxious to put her whole soul into this work. She is of the best of courage. My workers are here [at Battle Creek] and I shall not travel much this winter. I worked so constantly, and the work was of so taxing character I feel that it is my duty now to rest this winter. We are well situated for doing our book work now and if the cold winter does not work unfavorably for me I shall carry out my determination which seems to be the only thing I can do if I want to complete my books, which I am very anxious to do.--Letter 30, 1889, p. 3. (To Brother Fulton, November 27, 1889.)",
