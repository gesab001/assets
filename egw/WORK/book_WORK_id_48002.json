    "word": "We call upon all who have a part to act in our sanitariums to become Christians, that is, Christlike. Physicians should not be employed in these institutions who cannot conduct worship in the sanitarium family and give religious instruction. If there is any place in our world where prayer is daily needed, it is in our sanitariums. Let the patients and helpers see that you appreciate physical exercise and that you place a high value on spiritual things. A profession of religion amounts to very little unless it is worked out in the home life. It is a serious neglect when those in responsibility fail to bring the family together for worship. This is a sacred privilege and duty, and it means life to the soul.",
