    "word": "Because of the importance of the work in Southern Calif., and the perplexities which now surround it, there should be selected, no less than five men of wisdom and experience (478) to consult with the presidents of the local and union conference regarding general plans and policies. The Lord is not pleased with the disposition some have manifested to rule those of more experience than themselves. By this course of action, some have revealed that they are not qualified to fill the important positions which they occupy. Any human being who spreads himself out to large proportions, and who seeks to have the control of his fellows, proves himself to be a dangerous man to be entrusted with religious responsibilities.",
