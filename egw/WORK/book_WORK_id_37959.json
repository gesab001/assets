    "word": "Christ says: \"I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain\" (John 15:16). As Christ's ambassador, I would entreat of all who read these lines to take heed while it is called today. \"If ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts\" (Hebrews 4:7).
