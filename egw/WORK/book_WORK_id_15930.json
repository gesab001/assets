    "word": "Some of the workers in the canvassing field are making no sacrifices. When the way is all \n57\nprepared for them, and they can secure the highest commission, they are willing to enter the field. Many inducements are presented to canvassers to handle popular books; large commissions are offered them; and many refuse to work for less in circulating books that treat on present truth. Therefore the inducements have been increased to correspond to those offered by other publishers; and as a consequence the expense of getting our publications before the people is large; many of the canvassers obtain their money easily, and spend it freely.",
