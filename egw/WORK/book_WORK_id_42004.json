    "word": "One example of noble benevolence is particularly mentioned in the Scriptures: \"And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, the son of consolation), a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.\" This was the effect of the pouring out of the Spirit of God upon the believers. It made them of one heart and soul. They had one common interest,--the success of the mission intrusted to them. Their love for their brethren, and the cause which they had espoused, was far greater than their love for money and possessions. They acted out their faith, and by their works testified that they accounted the souls of men of far greater value than any earthly heritage.",
