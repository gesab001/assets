    "word": "When the third angel's message closes, mercy no longer pleads for the guilty inhabitants of the earth. The people of God have accomplished their work. They have received \"the latter rain,\" \"the refreshing from the presence of the Lord\" (Acts 3:19), and they are prepared for the trying hour before them. Angels are hastening to and fro in heaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that his work is done; the final test has been brought upon the world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received \"the seal of the living God\" (Revelation 7:2).",
