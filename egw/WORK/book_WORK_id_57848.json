    "word": "That same holy Watcher who says, \"I know Abraham, knew Cornelius also, and sent his angel with a message to the man who had received and improved all the light God had given him.

And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter.\" Then the specific directions are given, \"He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou \n                                                                           1114\noughtest to do.\" Thus the angel of the Lord works to bring Cornelius in connection with the human agent through whom he might receive greater light. Study the whole chapter carefully and see the simplicity of the whole transaction. Then consider that the Lord knows every one of us by name, and just where we live, and the spirit we possess, and every act of our life. The ministering angels are passing through the churches, noting our faithfulness in our individual line of duty.",
