    "word": "There is to be in the churches a wonderful manifestation of the power of God, but it will not move upon those who have not humbled themselves before the Lord, and opened the door of their heart by confession and repentance. In the manifestation of that power which lightens the earth with the glory of God, they will see only something which in their blindness they think dangerous, something which will arouse their fears, and they will brace themselves to resist it. Because the Lord does not work according to their expectations and ideal, they will oppose the work. \"Why,\" they say, \"should we not know the Spirit of God, when we have been in the work so many years?\" Because they did not respond to the warnings, the entreaties, of the messages of God, but persistently said, \"I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.\"",
