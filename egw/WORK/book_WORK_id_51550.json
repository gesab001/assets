    "word": "Let none flatter themselves that it is an easy work to erect and conduct an institution upon health reform principles. It is not an easy matter to run an institution where the sick of all classes shall be treated. Every such institution should have as its managers and helpers the very best talents that the work can produce. Then they will have an educating school and be thoroughly disciplined and fitted, that representatives shall be sent out to any part of the world to impart their knowledge to those who are ignorant and who greatly need it. This drill is to be kept up until men and women are prepared to do the very best kind of work as educators, as well as all the time to be learners themselves, disciplining their powers to obtain increased knowledge, that they may as stewards of God have wisdom and light, [and] that they can impart [to those] that they are connected with in any branch of the work.",
