    "word": "Our small churches are needed. And the children are needed in their homes, where they may be a help to their parents when the hours of study are ended. The Christian home is the best place for young children; for here they can have parental discipline that is after the Lord's order. God would have us consider these things in all their sacred importance. It is the precious privilege of teachers and parents to co-operate in teaching the children how to drink in the gladness of Christ's life by learning to follow his example. The Saviour's early years were useful years. He was his mother's helper in the home; and he was just as verily fulfilling his commission when performing the duties of the home and working at the carpenter's bench, as when he engaged in his public work of ministry.",
