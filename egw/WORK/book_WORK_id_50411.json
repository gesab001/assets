    "word": "There are plenty of men who would have had excellent qualifications if they had by persevering, earnest, prayerful effort sought for perfection by exercising their gifts. But thousands have undeveloped capacity. They have not worked at the business of developing. They wanted to shine, but they were not willing to work so that they might shine. Daniel gained his position by self-denial, by linking himself with God by invisible cords. He put himself into every good work. But man cannot make himself like Daniel by controlling and working himself. Neither can he dash into a position. It is only by enduring trial, by proving true as steel to principle, that human agents find their places.",
