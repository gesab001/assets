    "word": "Bro. Wilber Whitney takes matters too easy. He can bear responsibilities, and will need to have them urged upon him, because it is not natural for him to take them upon himself. There is no more important or greater work than that which he is now doing, if he will make it so. But Bro. Wilber is in danger of acting the boy rather than the man. If his labor is characterized with faithfulness, if he is willing to bear the burdens he can and should bear, he will be a most useful and important workman in the Office. He can now be qualifying himself for usefulness, and for a business man, a care-taker, if he will; or he can excuse himself, and be content to pass along without taking care, and as a consequence attain no special growth by his experience in the Office, and will not be able to manage and lead, but submit to be led. \n                                                                           22",
