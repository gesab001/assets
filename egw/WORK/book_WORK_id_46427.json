    "word": "Brother Pratt can act an important part in this work if he will see the necessity of consecration and devotion to God. He needs to be spiritualized. He has zeal and earnestness, but it needs to be mingled with the softening influence of the Spirit of God. He needs the pruning knife of the Spirit of God to remove the rough surface from his character and polish him, and his words might be in wisdom, that all his acts might be in reference to the glory of God, and that he might not make enemies but friends.",
