    "word": "Kindness to Youth--God holds the managers of his institutions responsible to treat the youth in the employ of these institutions with courtesy, respect, and kindness.  They are to deal with them as they themselves wish to be dealt with by Christ.  Their first work is to be so kind to the youth, so thoughtful of their interests, that they will feel at home in their presence.--Review and Herald, April 28, 1903.",
