    "word": "Our time here is short. Let us live, not holding ourselves in our own hands, but as seeing Him who is invisible. We have no time now to nurse grievous things; we have a work of great importance before us. We shall not fail nor be discouraged. We are kept for the Master's use. We must have a trustful disposition toward God. We must cultivate love and confidence toward our brethren and sisters in the faith. We must have the habit stronger and stronger to be always thinking of Him who is our life, our crown of rejoicing. He has bought us with the price of His own blood.",
