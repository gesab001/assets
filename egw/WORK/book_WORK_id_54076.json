    "word": "MR No. 1491 - Guidelines for Success as a Minister or Physician\n\n     (Written July 13, 1900, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N.S.W., to Dores Robinson.) \n\n\n     You asked me at one time what I thought in regard to your becoming a physician. I would say that the most useful lessons for you to learn will not now be found in taking a medical course of study. Your mind needs to penetrate deeper and take a more practical turn than it has yet done. If you had entered one of our health institutions to begin at the beginning or taking a nurses' course, doing good, hard, sensible work in caring for the sick, it would have been the very best education you could have received. You would thus have become better acquainted with the duties of a physician.",
