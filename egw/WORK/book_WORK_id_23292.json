Mary, you have the best and most loving, compassionate Being, even the Sun of Righteousness, to shine upon you. Look up, look up. I feel that the rest in the grave would not be so bad a thing for me. I am so tired, so discouraged as I see so much self and so much of Satan's spirit and work. Then I look to Jesus, and I find peace only in Jesus. . . .",
