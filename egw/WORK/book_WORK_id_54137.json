    "word": "Do not, my brother, neglect a plain duty revealed to you in the oracles of God. The books of heaven will reveal the fact in the past and the present standing of your accounts with God. Be strictly honest with your Maker in tithes and in offerings. You have been moved by the Spirit of God, and under the influence of His Spirit you have made pledges. Then while you have means in your hands, make your account straight with God. Now God looks at all these transactions that bear any relation to the work and the cause of God.",
