    "word": "In order to fulfill God's purpose for us, we must be taught by the Holy Spirit. Those who have not been taught by the Spirit, however great may have been their advantages in other respects, can not discern spiritual things. They are ignorant, whereas, if they were worked by the Spirit, they would be wise, able to understand the things of God. These things can be understood by those only who are partakers of the divine nature, those who eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God, receiving and obeying his word.--Extract from letters to a Conference President, April 22, 1902. \n\n                                               -",
