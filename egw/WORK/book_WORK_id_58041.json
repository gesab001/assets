    "word": "\"Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before thine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.' This word is for the managers in all our institutions, for all ministers who are over the flock, for all who have any connection whatever with the cause of God. Let them give heed unto it; then will the Lord sanctify, and cleanse, and bless, and prosperity shall attend the workers.",
