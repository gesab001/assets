    "word": "If we are to go to the expense of building sanitariums in order that we may work for the salvation of the sick and the afflicted, we should locate these institutions where those we desire to help will be favorably situated. They pay their money for the healing of their bodily diseases; but I am instructed that while we are to do all in our power to heal the body, we should make the healing of the soul of far greater importance. Those who come to our sanitariums as patients are in these institutions to be shown the way of salvation, that they may repent and hear the words, \"Thy sins are forgiven thee; go in peace, and sin no more.\"",
