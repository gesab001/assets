    "word": "Our people in the churches of Southern California need to arouse to a work that is necessary within their own borders. Let them awake to prayer and labor. They need more spiritual vitality. They need to be converted, that they may labor for souls. Wherever there is spiritual life, there will be an imparting as well as a receiving of light and blessings. The nourishment from God's word will be received and earnest work will be done. The act of imparting keeps open the channel for receiving. This truth our Saviour ever sought to keep before the people.\"",
