    "word": "Our school is located here. Their land was cleared and planted with trees at the same time that my orchard was planted. This coming season we expect that it will bear fruit for the school. Our people are settling in this place. Here students are to be educated in books, and are also to be taught how to do all kinds of manual labor. The Lord will help us in this work. This is the first term of school. There are sixty students in attendance. Thirty of these come from a distance, and live in the home. All the students are young men and young women of excellent capabilities.",
