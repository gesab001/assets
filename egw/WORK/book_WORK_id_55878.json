    "word": "Those who are one with Christ have the mind of Christ, and work the works of Christ. They are ever improving, ever drawing near to God, ever uplifting the soul to Jesus. By beholding the world's Redeemer, they become changed into His image. A new spiritual life is created, a new motive power supplied. When one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is cast out of the soul, the vacuum is supplied by the inflowing of the Spirit of Christ. Such a one has faith that works by love and purifies the soul from every moral and spiritual defilement. The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, can work upon the heart, influencing, directing, so that he enjoys spiritual things. He [the Christian] is \"after the Spirit,\" and he minds the things of the Spirit. He has no confidence in self. Christ is all and in all.",
