    "word": "Had the minister given words of advice in accordance with the Bible rule, and stated like Nehemiah, \"I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down,\" that church would be in a far better condition. This has been acted over and over again, and many souls have been lost as the result. \n\n\n                                    -280- \n\nSatan knew just how to work upon unconsecrated, unconverted men and women, who thought more of maintaining their dignity and their own opinions than the salvation of souls; therefore he worked upon hearts and minds to get up something to call the minister away from his labors just at the time when souls are interested and leaning in favor of the truth. And should the minister leave, he knows that that interest will never be revived again. Satan then secures souls in his toils who cannot again so easily break his fetters off them.",
