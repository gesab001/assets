Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, says: \"For he endured, as seeing Him who is invisible.\" The character that Paul thus ascribes to Moses does not mean simply passive resistance of evil, but perseverance in the right. He kept the Lord ever before him, and the Lord was ever at his right hand to help him.",
