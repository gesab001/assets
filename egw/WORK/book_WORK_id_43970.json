    "word": "The lack of harmony and love between the two brothers Ross is a reproach to the cause of God. Both are at fault. Both have a work to do in subduing self and cultivating the Christian graces. God is dishonored by their dissensions, and I do not go too far when I say hatred, that exists between these two natural brothers. Bro. A. Ross is greatly at fault. He has cherished feelings that have not been in accordance with the will of God. He knows the peculiarities of his brother Manly, that he has a fretful, unhappy temperament. Frequently, he cannot see good when it lies directly in his path. He sees only evil, and becomes discouraged very easily. Satan magnifies a molehill into a mountain before him. All things considered, Manly Ross has pursued in many things a course less censurable, because less injurious to the cause of present truth.",
