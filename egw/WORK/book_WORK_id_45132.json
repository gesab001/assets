    "word": "Christ's followers will pray and believe and work as Christ worked, relying upon the Holy Spirit, Christ's representative, for their sufficiency. They realize that they are only the instruments. The Holy Spirit is the power cooperating with them. They can labor with the highest power, for it is God that does the work, and not man. With the tact and methods given of God, they work, and God works with them as a compelling power to save the souls of men. --Ms 111, 1898, p. 4. (\"Prayer and Faith,\" Sept. 8, 1898.)",
