    "word": "Women to Be Qualified to Occupy Any Position.--The Lord designs that the school [Avondale] should also be a place where a training may be gained in women's work--cooking, housework, dressmaking, bookkeeping, correct reading, and pronunciation. They are to be qualified to take any post that may be offered--superintendents, Sabbath school teachers, Bible workers. They must be prepared to teach day schools for children.--Ev 475 (1898).",
