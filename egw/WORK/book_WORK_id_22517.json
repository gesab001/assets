    "word": "Although called to travel often, and having much writing to do, I have taken children of three and five years of age, and have cared for them, educated them, and trained them for responsible positions. I have taken into my home from time to time boys from ten to sixteen years of age, giving them motherly care, and a training for service. I  have felt it my duty to bring before our people that work for which those in every church should feel a responsibility.",
