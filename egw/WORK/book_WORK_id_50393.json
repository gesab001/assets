    "word": "I have dwelt upon general principles before the church in_____because I knew that they were in peril in regard to their home life. But there has been little disposition to accept the truth; the light has been disregarded. I have tried to do as Jesus did in His teaching--bring out principles that must be made practical in the everyday life of the home. Home religion will exert an influence in the neighborhood and in the church. When home difficulties arise, the same spirit of trouble will be carried into the society that surrounds the home. Home difficulties have been made public by some, and much sympathy has been created for those who have related their grievances; but to pour out to others troubles which have come into existence because of a lack of connection with God, and through the outworking of objectionable traits of character, is a great mistake.",
