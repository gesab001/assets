    "word": "I wish to write you a few words in regard to the employment of Dr. E. J. Waggoner as a teacher in the Berrien Springs school. I have had much confidence in Brother Waggoner, but I know that just now he is in special danger. He is in danger, as many others are, of accepting incorrect views of God, as set forth in the new book, \"Living Temple\". Take him into the school at Berrien Springs. My counsel regarding his work is that you help him to place his feet on solid ground, even the Rock of Ages. I believe that he will recover his former clearness and power.",
