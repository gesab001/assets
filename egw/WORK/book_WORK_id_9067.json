    "word": "Christ's Property--Not Ours.--Let us always remember, Brother _____, that no matter how great and good a work the human agent may do, he does not gain the ownership of those who through his  instrumentality have been converted to the truth. None are to place themselves under the control of the minister who has been instrumental in their conversion. In our ministry we are to bring souls direct to Christ. They are Christ's property, and must ever be amenable to Him alone. Every person possesses an individuality that no other person can claim.--Letter 193, 1903.",
