    "word": "There are those who will never receive the gospel message in its fullness; they will never see the greater light and working of the Holy Spirit. There is a depth of depravity in unbelieving human nature, that will never be healed, because the true light has been misinterpreted, and misapplied. The Lord has given His Spirit in abundance of assurance to enable men and women to understand the fallacies and errors of Satan and to guard against them.",
