    "word": "I have read the manuscript Willie sent me for the book Christian Temperance. I see nothing that I object to except the subject of drug medication. As matters have been opened to me from time to time, as I have been conducted through the rooms of the sick in the sanitarium and out of the sanitarium, I have seen that the physicians of the sanitarium, by practicing drug medication, have lost many cases that need not have died if they had left their drugs out of the sick room. Cases have been lost that had the physicians left off entirely their drug treatment, had they put their wits to work and wisely and persistently used the Lord's own remedies--plenty of air and water--the fever cases that have been lost would have recovered. The reckless use of those things that should be discarded has decided the case of the sick.",
