    "word": "Few realize the magnitude of the work that must be done among the colored people. In the South there are millions who have never heard the third angel\u2019s message. These must be given the light of present truth. For the accomplishment of this, the Lord has provided many agencies. Gospel medical missionaries are to be trained and\n28\nsent throughout the land. Small sanitariums and well-equipped treatment-rooms are to be established near the crowded centers. Colored evangelists are to be educated and sent forth to proclaim the truth in its simplicity to their own race. Canvassers are to carry the printed page into the homes of the people. And in order that this literature may result in good, the people are to be taught to read. How can they become intelligent Christians, unless first they learn to read the Bible? Schools are to be established and maintained; churches are to be built. Throughout the South there are to be erected memorials for God and His truth.",
