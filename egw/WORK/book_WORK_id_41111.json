    "word": "The present is a solemn, fearful time for the church. The angels are already girded, awaiting the mandate of God to pour their vials of wrath upon the world. Destroying angels are taking up the work of vengeance, for the Spirit of God is gradually withdrawing from the world. Satan is also mustering his forces of evil, going forth \"unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world,\" to gather them under his banner, to be trained for \"the battle of that great day of God Almighty.\" Satan is to make most powerful efforts for the mastery in the last great conflict. Fundamental principles will be brought out, and decisions made in regard to them. Skepticism is prevailing everywhere. Ungodliness abounds. The faith of individual members of the church will be tested as though there were not another person in the world. \"Who will render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile; but glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile; for there is no respect of persons with God.\" We claim to have faith, but, oh, how feeble! \"The right hand of the Lord is exalted; the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.\" \"The haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in the day.\" \n\n\n                             [5]",
