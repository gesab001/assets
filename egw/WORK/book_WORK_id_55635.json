    "word": "Our time is precious. We have but few, very few, days of probation left us in which to qualify ourselves for the future eternal life. We are not to devote these precious moments to forms and ceremonies, or cheap, superficial education. Think deeply before you speak. God designs that we shall keep the mind in pursuit of something tangible, something that we will not leave behind in this world, but that we can take with us into the higher school. The minds of the youth need the Word of God for instruction,that they may be \"thoroughly furnished unto all good works\" [2 Timothy 3:16, 17]. The teachers will need to be very simple when teaching from the Scriptures. The students must be given \"precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little\" [Isaiah 28:10]. Do not leave the slightest impression on the minds of your students that they are restricted and forced to wear a yoke of restraint that is unnecessary. \n\n\n                                     -289-",
