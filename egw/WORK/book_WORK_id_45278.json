    "word": "Christiania, Nov. 5, 1885. It is rainy, disagreeable weather. We have done much writing today. Visit at Brother Hansen's. We had a very pleasant, profitable visit. I conversed some through an interpreter, relating some incidents in our earlier experience. We conversed some upon the habits of the people in regard to eating so frequently. . . . I related to them a little of my experience upon health reform and the manner of my eating since receiving the light from heaven. I also related to them the experience we had passed through in the first rise of this work.",
