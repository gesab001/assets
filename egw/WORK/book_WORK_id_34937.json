    "word": "Your life, your soul, your strength, your capabilities, your powers of mind and body, are to be regarded by you as entrusted capital to be improved for your Lord during the period of your life. You are to stand in your allotted order in God's great army, to work out His plan in saving your own soul and the souls of others. This you may do by living a consistent Christian life, by putting forth earnest efforts, by learning in the school of Christ His ways, His purposes, and subordinating your will and way to the will and way of Christ. . . .",
