    "word": "God requires every steward of the grace of Christ to be faithful, to elevate and purify every power of his nature, that he may be a man, and a child of God. Christ died for him; and with a high sense of his accountability, understanding when God speaks, he will become a polished instrument in the hands of God to bless his fellow-men. To perform his work well, to make the most of his priceless opportunities, will be to him a sacred duty.",
