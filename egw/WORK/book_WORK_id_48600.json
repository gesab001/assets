    "word": "It is not profitable to you or to others to engage in long talks. They do no one any special good. The time thus spent should be devoted to a searching of the Scriptures, to meditation and earnest prayer which will give vigor to the mind and stability to the character. If a man be in Christ, he is a new creature; he is prepared to use all his capabilities to minister to the soul as well as to the body, earnestly seeking the wisdom of God and guided by his Spirit. The work will be of a character to the saving of the body and also of the soul. Let this have an influence to humble your heart, that there is not one action of your life that is not open for the all-seeing eye of a holy God. The invitation from Christ is, \"Come unto me, all ye that \n\n\n                                    -433- \n\nare weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" Have you accepted this invitation? Is your will as God's will? Then you will have peace and rest.--Letter 8, 1888, pp. 3, 4, 7. (To Dr. G., 1888.)",
