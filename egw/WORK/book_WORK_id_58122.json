    "word": "Biblical Institutes. \n\n     The holding of so many biblical institutes among our own people is not wise. The object is good in itself, but there is a more urgent work to be done in carrying the light of truth into regions where it has not penetrated. The laborers held to work for those who already have a knowledge of the truth are kept away from the people who know it not. Souls in spiritual blindness, prejudiced by these who misrepresent the truth, have been left unhelped. O the neglect that will be charged against individuals, organizations, and churches in that day when every man shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body. Then it will be found how great was the measure of responsibility for failing to extend the work to the regions beyond.",
