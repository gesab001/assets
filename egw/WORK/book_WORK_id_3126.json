    "word": "Chap. 20 - Reaching The Wealthy And Influential\n\n                Not to Be Neglected \n\n     There is a work to be done for the wealthy. They need to be awakened to their responsibility as those intrusted with the gifts of heaven. They need to be reminded that they must give an account to Him who shall judge the living and the dead. The wealthy man needs your labor in the love and fear of God. Too often he trusts in his riches, and feels not his danger. The eyes of his mind need to be attracted to things of enduring value.--Christ's Object Lessons, p. 230.",
