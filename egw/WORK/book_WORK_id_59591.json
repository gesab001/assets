    "word": "Brother and Sister Burden, I am glad that you have a part in the work of the Glendale Sanitarium. May the Lord increase your wisdom and courage and faith. I am glad that Dr. Simpson and her husband can unite with you. You and Dr. Abbott (138) and the other workers may do a precious work in letting the light of present truth shine forth in clear rays. Remember that you are doing a work for time and for eternity. You should have an ever-increasing faith in the promises of God's word. It is your privilege to seek wisdom and help from God. Come \n\n\n                               -87- \n\nto the Saviour in humility, confessing your sins, and asking for strength and grace.",
