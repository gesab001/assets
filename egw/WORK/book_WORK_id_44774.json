    "word": "Every soul who is honored in being a steward of God is to carefully guard the tithe money. This is sacred means. The Lord will not sanction your borrowing this money for any other work. It will create evils you cannot now discern. It is not to be meddled with by the _____ church; for there are missions to be sustained in other fields, where there are no churches and no tithes. When the men who, as God's messengers, have their work to do, will do it in a straightforward manner, the church of _____ will take care of the duties belonging to it individually. The members will furnish the means to sustain these extra expenses. But by using the tithe for these expenses, or filling the gaps made in business lines, you lift from them a burden which they should as a church carry.",
