    "word": "There are places in the South to be worked. God will help us all to act our part if we will only have the spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifice. In the name of the Lord we call for men to build up and strengthen this work; but they themselves need to be built up in the most holy faith, that they may work in the different Conferences, that there may be a healthy, holy influence circulating through each Conference, and that there shall be a supply in any case where God calls for men to enter missionary fields. There is a great work to be done, and my heart is panting and longing for the salvation of souls.",
