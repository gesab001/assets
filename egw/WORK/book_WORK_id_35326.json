    "word": "My children, watch unto prayer, and become more and more careful in regard to your words and your deportment. \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation\" (Matthew 26:41). It is poor policy to give the enemy the slightest advantage. My son, be gentlemanly, and you will strengthen your influence over those with whom you work. Never speak unadvisedly. Let your respect for yourself as Christ's representative keep you from giving way to anger. If we respect ourselves by wearing Christ's yoke, we shall increase our influence tenfold.",
