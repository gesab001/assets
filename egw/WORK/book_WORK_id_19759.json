    "word": "If physicians and ministers will work together in the presentation of truth, more will be reached.--The work you have been doing in the city is meeting Heaven's approval. What you have done demonstrates that if our physicians and our ministers can work together in the presentation of truth to the people, more can be reached than could be influenced by the ministers laboring alone. I trust that your example in this respect may be followed by other physicians.--CH 543.",
