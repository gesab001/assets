    "word": "The Lord would have His people awake, and realize that Dr. Kellogg is and must be connected with God, and stand as a rock to the principles of our faith. The Lord has given him knowledge and understanding. The singular success of the Sanitarium at Battle Creek is a wonderful mystery to all. God has planned the whole thing, that men in the highways as well as in byways should be brought in connection with Dr. Kellogg and his associates and the Bible instruction given. Thus they are continually being educated. Everything in this line that the physicians have done gives glory and praise to Him who is behind the physicians. All believers in the truth have cause to show much gratitude that we have such an institution as the Sanitarium, also that God works with His instrumentalities, Dr. Kellogg and his co-workers, who are accepted in the beloved. These influences are to be appreciated.",
