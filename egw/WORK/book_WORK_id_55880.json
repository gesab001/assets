    "word": "Money is drawn from the Lord's treasury to support those who are unconverted and need that one teach them the first principle of the gospel, which is Christ formed within, the hope of glory.

The words of Paul to the Corinthians should be heeded by all who labor for the Master: \"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. Let all your things be done with charity\" (1 Corinthians 16:13, 14).",
