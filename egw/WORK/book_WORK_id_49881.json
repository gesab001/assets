    "word": "MR No. 913 - Insights on Inspiration\n\n     Bible Writers Inspired, Not Extinguished--The Lord takes the instrument that will submit to the Holy Spirit's influence. He works through the human instrument that accepts that holy influence. He works in giving the heavenly mold, but He waits for the human agency to cooperate with the divine. The Holy Spirit inspired John; He did not extinguish John. He inspired Matthew, but He did not make Matthew into some other person.",
