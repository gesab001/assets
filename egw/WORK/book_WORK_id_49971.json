    "word": "Invitation to Come to Australia--Last night we had a conversation with Brother Daniells in reference to Maud Boyd and her daughter coming to Australia.

I think it would be in the order of God for them to come. There is plenty of work to be done, and there is need that those of experience, who have a firm faith, should connect with the work.",
