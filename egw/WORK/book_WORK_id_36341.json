    "word": "Success in the work of God is not the result of chance, of accident, or of destiny; it is the outworking of God\u2019s providence, and the award of faith and discretion, of virtue and persevering labor. It is the practice of the truth that brings success and moral power. The bright rays of the Sun of Righteousness are to be welcomed as the light of the mind; the principles of the character of Christ are to be made the principles of the human character. . . .",
