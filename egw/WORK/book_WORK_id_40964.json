    "word": "Will our brethren now awake to their responsibility? Will they be converted daily? Will they seek to know what it means to serve God daily? Will the Israel of God now awake? Will our church members now arise, and walk in the way of the Lord? Will every one now seek to walk in humility before God? Let the sacred work now be carried forward in whole-hearted consecration. There are great privileges and blessings for all who will humble themselves, and fully consecrate their hearts to God. Great light will be given to them. When men are willing to be transformed, then they will be exercised unto godliness.",
