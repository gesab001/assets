    "word": "I have been instructed to tell our people that they are not to erect such large buildings for sanitariums. The medical institution in Battle Creek would better have been divided into at least seven different plants, so that other places would have had proper facilities for the care of the sick. There are many places in Europe and in America where medical missionary work should be begun; but these openings have been neglected in order to build up a great institution in Battle Creek, while nothing is as yet established in London and other places in Europe; nothing in many cities in our own country. The centering of so much in Battle Creek leads many of our people to drift in there, and this congested condition often destroys their piety and unfits them for the Master's service. \n                                                                           56",
