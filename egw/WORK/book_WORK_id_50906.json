    "word": "There will be those who do not see any special necessity to perfect the equipment of our schools in Graysville and Huntsville, because, from outward appearance, these places may seem inferior to some other places. But let not the work in Graysville and Huntsville, or the work in Nashville, be passed over to enter a place like Chattanooga, to begin a work that will call for quite an outlay of means, and that will divert the attention of the workers. Let not means be diverted from the places in which the work should just now be developed and strengthened. The fact that a place is popular is not sufficient reason that it should be entered. Popularity is not to be the power that draws God's people. Because some have taken a fancy to Chattanooga, this is not conclusive evidence that God desires to have work done there before the work in other places is solidly established. This is the instruction given me.",
