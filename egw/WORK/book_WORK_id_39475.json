    "word": "The school at Huntsville is greatly in need of help, that young colored people may be prepared to go forth to work as teachers for their own race. This is a great need in the Southern field of an orphanage for colored children. At Huntsville a beginning has been made on a building for this purpose, but the work has stopped for lack of means. A small sanitarium is also needed at Huntsville. Let those who desire to work place their zeal and their efforts where they will tell in supplying a genuine necessity.",
