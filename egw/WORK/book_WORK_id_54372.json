    "word": "My brother, the son of one whom I greatly respect and love in the Lord, I advise you to comply with your father's request. Do not gratify the enemy by speaking words that a son has no right to speak to his father. I beg of you not to reproach your father. You should not feel as you do, for your father has done nothing that God condemns. His condemnation exists only in the minds of men. He has in no wise dishonored his children. He is keeping the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment. The Lord is opening the way before him, that he may do a great and good work for His people. Christ is his Saviour, and in beholding Christ, he will be changed into His image.",
