    "word": "Over and over again the light has been given that a special work is to be done in Huntsville. Men who are rooted and grounded in the truth in all its bearings are to be placed in charge of that work.

On the beautiful farm of over three hundred acres, God purposes that an efficient missionary training school shall be conducted, which will develop many workers for the colored people.",
