    "word": "God help us to walk and work as men and women on the border of the eternal world. Soon an awful surprise will come upon the inhabitants of this earth. Suddenly, and with power and great glory, Christ will come. Then there will be no time to prepare to meet Him. Now is the time for us to get ready. When I see my brethren walking and working as men in a dream, I feel as if I must do something to arouse them. May the Lord help me to do all my duty; for there must be no delay. We are nearing the last great conflict.",
