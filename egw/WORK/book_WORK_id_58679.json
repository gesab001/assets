    "word": "Let all the workers in the Office remember that they are to represent Christ in word and act. There is to be no sharp speaking, no fretful scolding; for angels of God are walking up and down in every room. Christ loves to commend every faithful worker, and He will do it. Every good act is registered in the book. Little mistakes may be made, but words of censure arouse feelings of retaliation, and God is dishonored.",
