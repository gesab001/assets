    "word": "While many of the guests were looking over the buildings and grounds, I had a very interesting interview with Dr. Mary L. Potts, the one who formerly owned the property now known as the Paradise Valley Sanitarium. Mrs. Potts is one year younger than I am, and seems to be a woman of ability. She is an excellent speaker, and is still going from place to place to deliver public lectures on health and temperance. During the evening exercises she spoke before the large assembly, and told the story of her effort to establish and maintain a sanitarium-home in this beautiful place, and of her pleasure that the work she was unable to carry on is now taken up by us. She seemed to be very thankful that the place is in good hands.",
