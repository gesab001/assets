    "word": "There must be no misunderstanding, my son, in regard to the words I spoke to you just as I was leaving Nashville. My remarks were in reference to the way the work has been carried on heretofore. I have no special light with reference to particulars in detail, or concerning the point of who should carry the responsibility of manufacturing health foods in the Southern field. But the light given me is that it should not be, and must not be, carried on in the Southern field in the way in which it is now being done. The light I have had is that in every effort made to manufacture health foods in the Southern field, the business should be conducted not as a speculation for personal benefits, but as a business that God has devised whereby a door of hope may be opened for the people.",
