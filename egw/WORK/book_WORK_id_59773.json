    "word": "The truths of the word of God, applied to the heart and carried out with humility in the daily life-practise, will make Christians strong in the strength of Jehovah, and happy in His peace. Christian kindness and earnest consecration are constantly to be manifested in the life. We are not always engaged in special duties connected with sacred service; but the common, daily round of duties may be done in His Spirit, and such labor will commend itself to every man, even to the unconverted who know not the doctrine. We may let our light so shine in good works that the truth which we cherish shall be, to unbelievers, spirit and life.",
