    "word": "The one object to be kept before the mind is that you are reformers, and not bigots. In dealing with unbelievers, do not show a contemptible spirit of littleness, for if you stop to haggle over a small sum, you will, in the end, lose a much larger sum. They will say, \u201cThat man is a sharper; he would cheat you out of your rights if he possibly could, so be on your guard when you have any dealing with him.\u201d But if in a deal a trifle in your favour is placed to the favour of another, that other will work with you on the same generous plan. Littleness begets littleness, penuriousness begets penuriousness. Those who pursue this course do not see how contemptible it appears to others, especially those not of our faith; and the precious cause of truth bears the stamp of this defect.",
