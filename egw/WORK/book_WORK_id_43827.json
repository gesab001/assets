    "word": "My brother, we are living in a solemn time. An important work is to be done for our own souls and for the souls of others, or we shall meet with an infinite loss. We must be transformed by the grace of God, or we shall fail of Heaven; and through our influence, others will fail with us. Let me assure you, my brother, the struggles and conflicts which must be endured in the discharge of duty, the self-denials and sacrifices which must be made if we are faithful to Christ, are not created by him. They are not imposed by arbitrary or unnecessary command; they do not come from the severity of the life which he requires us to lead in his service. Trials would exist in greater power and number, were we to refuse obedience to Christ, and become the servants of Satan and the slaves of sin.",
