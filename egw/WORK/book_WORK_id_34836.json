    "word": "M. H.--114-115 \n     God desires us to reach the standard of perfection made possible for us by the gift of Christ. He calls upon us to make our choice on the right side, to connect with heavenly agencies, to adopt principles that will restore in us the divine image. In His written word and in the great book of nature He has revealed the principles of life. It is our work to obtain a knowledge of these principles, and by obedience to co-operate with Him in restoring health to the body as well as to the soul.  {TSDF 186.10}  \n                                                          M.

If as a people they had lived according to God's plan they would have been preserved from the diseases that afflicted other nations. Above any other people they would have possessed physical strength, and vigor of intellect.  {TSDF 186.11}  \n                                                          M. H.--312 \n     By departing from the plan divinely appointed for their diet, the Israelites suffered great loss. They desired a flesh diet, and they reaped its results. They did not reach God's ideal of character or fulfill His purpose. The Lord \"gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.\" They valued the earthly above the spiritual, and the sacred preeminence which was His purpose for them they did not attain.",
