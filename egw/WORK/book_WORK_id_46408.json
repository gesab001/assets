    "word": "\"Sister, do you think that in taking such a child you are doing a deed of mercy? Such a child would be fit for heaven, and not fitted for the atmosphere of your home. You desire one that possesses qualities that you have not yourself. If you can obtain such a child you will be fortunate. If you want to do real missionary work, and wish me to find you a child with faults and errors such as are subject to humanity, and then seek to the utmost in your power in the name of Jesus to work for the interest of that child, then I will find such a child for you. This would be doing true missionary work to mold the child after the divine pattern. You would be doing the work Christ came to the world to do for us poor fallen souls.",
