    "word": "You must not trust your own experience or wisdom or knowledge. God must be your dependence, and your trust. If you look to Him, trust in Him, believe in Him, and feel your own utter helplessness, then you will have help of the right kind just when it is most needed. God help the workers! Do we estimate the truth above the estimate we have of ourselves? Do we appreciate it according to its value? If we believe that we are engaged in a work of preparing people to stand in the great day of God, then we shall labor accordingly.",
