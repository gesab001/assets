    "word": "The subject I wish now to bring before our people is that of the special management of the general interests of the cause of God at the present time. For years light has been given me that the one selected to preside over the General Conference should not be left to bear all the burdens alone. He is to be a man of clear discernment, who will not swerve from right principles, and he is to have as his counselors staunch men who will not sway or be swayed in wrong directions, who are as firm as a rock to principle. He is not to be left to follow his own inclinations in the \n\n\n                                  -180- \n\nchoice of his counselors. This has been done for years, to the detriment of the work. His associates are to be chosen men who have the confidence of the people; God-fearing men upon whom he can rely.",
