    "word": "Christ declares to His disciples: \"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. . . . Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Christians are to reveal to the world that they are wearing the yoke of the great Teacher, and learning of Him His meekness and lowliness. As obedient sons and daughters of God, they are to fulfill their obligations to Him, giving to the world a proper representation of His character. Thus they become lights in the world.",
