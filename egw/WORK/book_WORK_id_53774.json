    "word": "We have great need of workers in this country--missionaries, medical missionaries--and those who can teach cooking. Sister Starr is the only one here who tries to give instruction in cookery. She makes no pretension to any special knowledge in this line, and teaches only when forced into it. She tells her classes plainly that she does not come as one who has been trained at the sanitarium, but will do her best to teach them what she knows. She is being urged again to teach a class but is very unwilling to do so. What can we do? May Walling is a good cook, but she is not fitted to teach.",
