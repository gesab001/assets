    "word": "Let all who love and fear God call upon Him in sincerity of soul that He will work in behalf of His people, and He will not be solicited in vain. Ways and means will certainly be provided whereby His people shall have a place where they can worship Him. Let not Satan depress any of you. Watch unto prayer. Oh, has not our Lord made us the repository of sacred truth? Will He not open the way that it shall come to the people?--Letter 52, 1895, pp. 3-5. (To Elder S. McCullagh, December 6, 1895.) \n\nReleased March 11, 1975.",
