    "word": "Jan. 30. The Danger of Resisting Light. My mind is troubled continually. I have great sorrow of heart. I know that Satan is seeking for the mastery over men. I would gladly leave the field of battle, but I will stand at my post as long as the Lord requires me to. I will not flee because of the pressure brought against me. I have been placed here, and my work is to present in clear lines the instruction given me. Some will hear, will others, even such men as Elder ----- will harden their hearts, lest they shall see and be converted. There are those who are looking to Elder -----, thinking that a man who has been given such great light will be able to see when good cometh, and will acknowledge the truth. But I have been shown that in Elder ----- character there is a pride and stubbornness that has never been fully brought into subjection to the Spirit of God. Again and again his religious experience has been marred by his determination not to confess his wrongs, but to pass along and forget them. Men may cherish this sin until there is no forgiveness for them. \n                                                                           574",
