    "word": "Who can limit the Lord God of Israel? Who can present in correct lines His expensive benevolence? Our Saviour declares that He brought from heaven as a donation eternal life. He was to be lifted up upon the cross of Calvary to draw all men unto Him. How then shall we treat the purchased inheritance of Christ? \n\n\n                                     -21- \n\nTenderness, appreciation, kindness, sympathy, and love should be shown to them. Then we may work to help and bless one another. In this work we have more than human brotherhood; we have the exalted companionship of heavenly angels. They cooperate with us in the work of enlightening high and low.",
