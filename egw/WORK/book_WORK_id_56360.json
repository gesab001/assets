    "word": "I will now hold my peace; for anything I might say may confuse. I fear for nothing that I have written. It lies out in clear, straight lines, because the Holy Spirit is working with the human agent. I greatly fear that the power and glory of God which may come in will not be recognized. God says, Work in unity. He does not say that your course has been one which will advance and unite hearts. You need to put on Christ, to follow your own Leader more closely. You are in a positive danger through your own spirit, which will always strive for the supremacy unless it is kept in subjection. You are upon a high pinnacle of greatness, because the Lord has prospered the principles you have advocated. But the Lord never designed that you should criticise your brethren and hold yourself aloof from them because they do not put their whole interest in the work you are interested in.",
