    "word": "My brother, you have let spiritual pride come into your heart. You have given the tempter an open door through which he could enter and work upon your mind. Will you give him the right of way, as many are doing in Battle Creek? Before you go any farther in this path you have entered upon, stop and consider the results. Make a halt right where you are. If you do not, you will apostatize from the truth. You and your wife must be converted, or you will, in the madness of your deceived souls, take some rash and dreadful step. Watch, pray, repent, and be converted.",
