    "word": "The sanitary condition of the Health Institute was greatly neglected. The physicians knew that girls were working over a sink that sent forth a deathly odor, yet they allowed this thing to go on. While they were professedly treating the sick, they were asleep to the matter of the surroundings of those whom they had in their care. Physicians, directors, and superintendent knew that the drainage was not such as to carry off impurities. Every day they would see before them, upon the surface of the ground, dressing spread out to enrich it, that was poisoning the air and making it unfit to breathe. This was in plain sight of all visitors and the close scrutiny of spies.",
