    "word": "This hard-heartedness is of Satan. There are many ways in which he works. He seeks to make men who claim to believe the truth, faithless, loveless, proud, selfish, haughty, tyrannical. He well knows that those who possess such characteristics can never be a savor of life unto life. They exert no fragrant influence, but rather wound and bruise the souls of those whom they might relieve and comfort.",
