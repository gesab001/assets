    "word": "If the worker has consecrated himself fully to God and is diligent in prayer for strength and heavenly wisdom, the grace of Christ will be his teacher, and he will overcome great defects and become more and more intelligent in the things of God. But let none take license from this to be indolent, to squander time and opportunities, and neglect the training that is essential for him in order to become efficient. The Lord is in no wise pleased with those who have opportunities to obtain knowledge but who excuse themselves in neglecting to improve all the privileges He has placed within their reach that they may become intelligent, well qualified workers, of whom He will not be ashamed.",
