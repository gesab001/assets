Haskell.\nDear Brother:\n     We have just arrived in Huntsville, having left Nashville early this morning. I did not think that the journey would be so long and tedious. It made me very weary, and the pain in [my] left eye caused me much suffering. I feel that I should not do more taxing labor during this journey to Washington. I am not displeased with the results of my work at College View and here. I have borne my testimony several times, and I expect that some of these meetings will be reported.",
