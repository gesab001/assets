    "word": "The angels of God in heaven that have never fallen do His will continually. In all that they do upon their busy errands of mercy to our world, shielding, guiding, and guarding the workmanship of God for ages--both the just and the unjust-- they can truthfully say, \"All is Thine. Of Thine own do we give Thee.\" Would that the human eye could catch glimpses of the service of the angels! Would that the imagination could grasp and dwell upon the rich, the glorious service of the angels of God and the conflicts in which they engage in behalf of men to protect, to lead, to win, and to draw them from Satan's snares. How different would be the conduct, the religious sentiment!",
