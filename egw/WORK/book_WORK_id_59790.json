B-142-'06                       May 17, 1906. \n\nDear Brother and Sister Burden:- \n\n\n     I have no apology to make for not sending you, sooner, this matter regarding the bakery at Loma Linda. The delay has been occasioned by illness and traveling. On my journey to Mountain View, I had a peaceful, restful night on the cars; but I had not been able to throw off a cold that I contracted in S. Calif. When I reached Mountain View Thursday morning, my throat was suffering considerably. We had expected to stop only two or three hours, and then go on to St. Helena, but the brethren urged us to stop longer; and as we considered the needs of the work there, in view of the disaster to the Pacific Press, we consented to remain over the Sabbath.",
