    "word": "Trials and obstacles are the Lord's chosen methods of discipline and His appointed conditions of success. . . . He sees that some have powers and susceptibilities which, rightly directed, might be used in the advancement of His work.

He gives them opportunity to correct these defects and to fit themselves for His service. . . .",
