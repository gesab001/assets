The messages given at the Conference of 1901, and since that time, that our sanitariums should not be linked up with the Medical Missionary Association at Battle Creek, were plain enough to be understood by all our medical workers. Had our physicians, whom God has greatly honored by giving them light and encouragement, listened to the counsels and warnings then given them, they would have saved themselves and our people generally from many perplexities and temptations. The Lord designed that these men should be his physicians, light bearers to the world; but they have misappropriated the words of warning, and the enemy has been permitted to work a strange work among those who should have stood as standard-bearers of the truth.",
