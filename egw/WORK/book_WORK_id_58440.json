    "word": "God gives men counsel and reproof for their good. He has sent His message, telling them what was needed for the time--1897. Did you accept the message? Did you heed the appeal? He gave you opportunity to come up armed and equipped to the help of the Lord. And having done all, He told you to stand. But did you make ready? Did you say, \"Here am I; send me\"? You sat still and did nothing. You left the word of the Lord to fall unheeded to the ground; and now the Lord has taken men who were boys when you were standing at the forefront of the battle, and has given to them the message and the work which you did not take upon you. Will you be stumbling blocks to them? Will you criticize? Will you say, \"They are getting out of their place\"? Yet you did not fill the place they are now called to fill.",
