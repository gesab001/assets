    "word": "We may have Christ with us while engaged in our daily avocations. Wherever we are, in whatever we are engaged, we may be indeed elevated because we are united to Christ. We may take up our humble life duties ennobled by and sanctified through the assurance of the love of God. Working from principle in the humblest calling invests it with dignity. The consciousness that we are indeed the servants of Christ will give a higher tone of character to our everyday duties--ever cheerful, patient, forbearing, and gentle. Says Christ, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" John 16:12. . . .",
