    "word": "The course of God's people should be upward and onward to victory. A greater than Joshua is leading on the armies of Israel. One is in our midst, even the Captain of our salvation, who has said for our encouragement, \"Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.\" \n                                                                           111\n\"Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\" He will lead us on to certain victory. What God promises, He is able at any time to perform. And the work He gives His people to do, He is able to accomplish by them.--Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 122.",
