    "word": "Similar advice was given to my husband, that he should let others bear the burdens, while he could aid them by his advice, counsel and experience. But he saw that others made mistakes, and were not far-seeing and judicious; that elements of character were wanting in them, which he possessed to a large degree; therefore he waited for somebody fully competent to take his place, and kept on and on in much the same way as he had done, until he finally dropped into the grave, and those men upon whom he did not dare to leave the burdens had to take them, and \n\n\n                          -20- \n\nthat without his advice, his words of counsel, and his experience, to help them. His voice might have been heard today if he had heeded the words of warning given. He was disgusted and distressed because there were so few who would be discerning and would be burden-bearers, and thought that in order to save blunders he must do all that he could himself. In his clear foresight he could see what needed to be done, and his brethren were content to let him be brains for them, and execute for them, while instead of becoming more efficient, they were growing less and less self-reliant. The simple, common business matters were brought before him by those connected with him in the work, until he became so accustomed to it that he felt it must be so; and if he was not consulted about even minor matters, he felt that it was not just right.",
