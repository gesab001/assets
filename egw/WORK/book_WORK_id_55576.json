    "word": "Well then, how shall we know that we have been drinking of the living streams of salvation? How shall we understand this? Oh, the heart is changed; out of it are the issues of life. The good man bringeth out of the treasure of his heart good things. Now we are to learn and are to know by their words and works who are converted. The evil man bringeth out of the treasure of his heart evil things, showing he is under the control of Satan. Every word is a seed. We are scattering it in words and actions--sowing seed--and then what will the harvest be? God help us that we may sow unto life eternal, that we may reap the precious grain in this life, and then the good works will cause souls to be converted.",
