    "word": "By receiving to impart, we shall become laborers together with God. Then He will work in and through us according to His good pleasure. Students, if you realize that you are to be laborers together with Him, you will not stoop to frivolity; all your work will be done thoroughly and conscientiously. You are standing on a high platform: you are God's husbandry, God's building, and therefore you are to bring into your character-building no rotten timbers or other imperfect material. All things are open to Him with whom we have to do. Let us so conduct ourselves that at last it may be said of us, \"Ye are complete in Him.\"--Ms 91, 1903 (MR 900.65). \n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nSeptember 13, 1990. Entire Ms.",
