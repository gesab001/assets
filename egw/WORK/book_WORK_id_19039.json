    "word": "The church is the object of God\u2019s tenderest love and care. If the members will allow Him, He will reveal His character through them. He says to them, \u201cYe are the light of the world\u201d (Matthew 5:14). Those who walk and talk with God practice the gentleness of Christ. In their lives, forbearance, meekness, and self-restraint are united with holy earnestness \n212\nand diligence. As they advance heavenward, the sharp, rough edges of character are worn off, and godliness is seen. The Holy Spirit, full of grace and power, works upon mind and heart.",
