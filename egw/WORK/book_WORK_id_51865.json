    "word": "We took the steamer Monday night. Elder Van Horn got off five dollars from each of our fares, which made our expenses both thirty dollars. The boat lay at Portland wharf during the night, and at 3:00 a.m. we were in motion; but after six hour's ride we stopped at Astoria, at the salmon cannery establishment, and here we remained from 9:00 a.m. until this morning. We shall cross the bar 20 miles from here at 12:00, and then our peace and quiet will be very much shaken up. We are here because the boat is loading on 22,000 boxes of canned salmon. Twenty men worked steadily all day yesterday \n\n\n                                   -150- \n\nand away into the night putting these boxes on board. The weather is quite mild; no wind now, and the prospect is for having a favorable time. I hope so, for I have no strength to resist seasickness.",
