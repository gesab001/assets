    "word": "You cannot, in your present state, distinguish the advantages of the people of God above those who do not believe the truth. You look at the few who have received the truth as being inferior; their defects are very apparent to you. Doubt and darkness are enveloping your mind, so that you do not clearly discern the things that are spiritual and eternal. If you had been walking in the light which God has given, you would long ago have broken the cords that have bound you away from Christ. You have now a work to do to sever your connection with secret societies. You can do them no good, and they can do you much harm. When you break loose from these societies, and unite fully with Christ, you will be a free man in Christ Jesus.",
