    "word": "When my brethren wrote to me about erecting another building in Battle Creek, saying that money could be obtained with which to do this, my heart was pained, and I have not been free from the pain since. The work in the South should be given the attention which it should have had long ago. It has been robbed of its just dues. And yet those who have done so little for this new field now propose to put up another building in Battle Creek, for the purpose of gaining greater room and conveniences. What would be the influence of such an action, after the light that God has given on this subject? Take the four thousand dollars that would be needed for the erection of this building, and place it where it belongs, that it may bear fruit to the glory of God.",
