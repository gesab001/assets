Butler.) \n\n\n     I have received two or three letters from you recently, but have not been able to answer them, for I have been very busy preparing matter to be sent to the brethren in council at Washington. I will now try to write you a few lines. Your letters were all most interesting. I wish that I could see you and talk with you, but this cannot be. I say to you, Be of good courage in the Lord. He knows the perplexities that we must meet in our labors, and He will give us strength according to our need.",
