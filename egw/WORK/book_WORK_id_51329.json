    "word": "The workers in our publishing houses need to have their intellects converted. The physicians and nurses in our sanitariums need to experience the daily converting power of God. Our ministers need to know that Christ is an indwelling presence with them. Some of our workers have cherished their inherited and cultivated tendencies to wrong, and this has led them to try to bear rule over one another. Repentance and daily conversion from wrongdoing is not a part of their experience. These souls are as verily the enemies of Christ as are those who have never yielded themselves to Him.",
