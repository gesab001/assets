    "word": "The angels of God, who excel in wisdom and strength and in all efficiency, whether for judgment or mercy, fulfill their mission in the world. They are sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation. Those who are walking in the light of God's commandments are very precious in His sight. He says, \"Touch not Mine anointed, and do My prophets no harm.\" In the last days Satan will use all his powers against God's people, to afflict, to distress, to discourage them, to cause them all the trouble he possibly can. Those who know the truth and yet unite with him in this work have lost their spiritual anointing. They are blinded by the sophistry of the enemy, and cannot see afar off. They have forgotten that they were purged from their old sins.",
