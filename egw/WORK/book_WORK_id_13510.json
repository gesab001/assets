    "word": "Our Instructor said, \u201cThe food business may be so conducted as to be an injury instead of a blessing to the people of God. This line of work must be jealously guarded, else we shall find ourselves on the losing instead of the gaining side. The workers must be guarded. The barriers that I have placed between them and the world must not be taken down, lest they become leavened with worldliness. Unless great care is taken, some will fall into Satan's snares, seduced by the spirit of the world, and led to corrupt their ways.\". . .",
