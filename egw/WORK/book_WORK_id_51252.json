    "word": "God desires men and women to awaken to a sense of His great mercy and lovingkindness. Every blessing we receive comes from Him. The Governor of the universe, He takes cognizance of the words and actions of human beings. He knows whether His children are deserving of praise or of condemnation. Each human being will be rewarded or punished according to his works. \n\n\n                                   -346- \n\nRetribution must come upon those who disregard the laws which God has made known. Those who are loyal and obedient will be rewarded with the richest blessings. Those who are disloyal and presumptuous, who dishonor the laws of God's kingdom, refusing to repent, will surely be punished with death.",
