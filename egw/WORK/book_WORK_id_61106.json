    "word": "Let there be in the Sanitarium much prayer for the healing of the sick. We must depend more decidedly upon the great Healer. It is the miracle-working power of God that will give efficiency to the gospel message. As believers, are we not sons and daughters of God? Is not Christ our Elder Brother? Then shall we not believe that He will reveal His power in restoring the sick to health? Tell Him your wishes and desires, and plead the promise, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me, and he shall make peace with Me.\" Christ can not too often be reminded of His pledged word. \n\n\n                                                                        17.",
