    "word": "I think of you all because peculiar temptations come to every soul upon the weakest point in their character. That weak point needs to be strengthened and conformed in righteousness. Following Jesus Christ means that you are doing the very same works of righteousness which Christ would do were He in your place. Following always implies obedience. No soldier can follow his commander unless he obeys orders. Following means imitation. In every case of action you are to do just as Christ would do in your place. \"Learn of Me,\" says the great Teacher. Then keep your eye on the copy. Christ is our model. We are to do all things to His name's glory, and in the love that Christ has for us individually.",
