    "word": "A very precious work has been going on in Stanmore, a suburb of Sydney a few stations from Ashfield. Forty have embraced the truth since the camp meeting. Twenty-seven have been baptized, and still others are to go forward in baptism next week. The interest continues to be good. Brother and Sister Haskell, Brother and Sister Starr, and Brother and Sister Wilson are at work. Meetings have been held in the tent on Sabbaths and Sundays, and every evening in the week except Monday.",
