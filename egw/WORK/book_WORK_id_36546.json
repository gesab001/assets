    "word": "When man has taken the lines in his own hands to guide and drive, he will be rewarded, for the work of God will reveal terrible mistakes.

Every day some plan will be devised when Satan thinks he can lend a hand to sow his tares among the wheat. Vice is not to be commingled with virtue, and the cry may have to go forth in no measured tones, even now while missionary work is being done, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you\" (2 Corinthians 6:17). God is now working for His people, but how many do not recognize the work of God from a strange work.",
