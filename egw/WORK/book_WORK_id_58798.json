You have tried to put all that there is of you into the work. You have not observed regular hours for eating or for rest. For a long time, Brother......, you have abused your physical powers; you have laboured above your strength. This is not to be the example minister, but if you do as you have done in the past, you will be able to work only as a broken-down piece of machinery.",
