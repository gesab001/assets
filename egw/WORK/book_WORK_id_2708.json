    "word": "God cannot display the knowledge of His will and the wonders of His grace among the unbelieving world, unless He has witnesses scattered all over the earth. It is His plan that those who are partakers of this great salvation through Jesus Christ, should be His missionaries, bodies of light throughout the world, to be as signs to the people, living epistles, known and read of all men, their faith and works testifying to the near approach of the coming Saviour, and showing that they have not received the grace of God in vain. The people must be warned to prepare for the coming judgment.--Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 631, 632. \n                                                                           17",
