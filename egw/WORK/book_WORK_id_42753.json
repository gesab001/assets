    "word": "I wish to say to authors, that I can not see that they have any liberty to either give away or sell their right to books they have written. When you do this, a door of temptation is opened before the publishers to repeat the history of the past. They will obtain for a small sum books that are not of vital importance. They will be tempted to say to the authors, \"It is naught, it is naught.\" They will make some little changes, and then exalt these books to the highest in their notices. They will deceive the people, and while doing this will treat valuable books indifferently, as they have done Brother Smith's work.",
