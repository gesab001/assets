    "word": "The Saviour's promise, \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given\" (Matthew 13:12), applies also to the reception of truth. To him who seeks to understand its teachings will be given increased understanding. To him who reveals that he possesses the spirit of truth will be given a larger measure of the Spirit, that he may work out his own salvation. The work of reflecting Christ to the world will not be done boastingly, but in fear and trembling, yet in the power of the Spirit.",
