    "word": "WITHOUT CONDEMNING, MRS. WHITE POINTED OUT THAT THE CHRISTIAN CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS, OR RENDER ALLEGIANCE TO TWO AUTHORITIES.

WHITE COUNSELS, AND HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE MESSAGE WAS CONFIRMED AS MRS. WHITE--UNBEKNOWN TO HERSELF--GAVE THE SECRET SIGN USED ONLY BY MEMBERS OF THE LODGE.

LOOKING BACK TO THIS EXPERIENCE IN LATER YEARS, HE TESTIFIED THAT THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY MESSAGE COMPLETELY CHANGED HIS LIFE.",
