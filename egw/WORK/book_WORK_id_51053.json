    "word": "Satan has come down with great power; he is working with desperate energy, playing the game of life for the souls of men. We need now men of discernment and understanding, who will look deep and reason soundly, men in living touch with Christ, the risen Saviour. Falsehoods are everywhere, but God's Word is the solid rock. We are in the day of waiting; we are to be looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God. We are to be climbing, ever climbing, heavenward.",
