    "word": "I write these particulars to you because you have had so many temptations, so many jealous thoughts, and so great misunderstanding of me and my work. All the time I am forced to give to perplexing matters requiring reproof is so much taken from the very work the Lord would have me do. I am perplexed, distressed, and fearfully afraid for the souls of some who have had light and evidence, but do not appropriate the same. They are erecting barriers that prevent me from doing the work I should attend to.--Letter 17, 1891, pp. 14, 15. (To a leading worker, July 20, 1891.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C.
