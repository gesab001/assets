    "word": "More Workers Needed to Spread Light. Willie, your heart would ache to look upon this vast field in Texas with only one preacher and calls coming in from every direction for help. I tell you that God could use hundreds of young men if they would only give themselves to the work to labor humbly in God. Oh, I do feel that we should appoint one day in a month for fasting and prayer for the Lord of the harvest to raise up men who shall go into the field and sow the seeds of truth. What can be done? My soul is stirred to its very depths. So many are in darkness, yet longing for light. They are not satisfied with their present condition. They are pleading for preachers to come. They hear the Word gladly but the moral darkness is so great one or two discourses are shedding merely a glimmer of light.",
