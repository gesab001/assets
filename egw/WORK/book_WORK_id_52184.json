    "word": "There are different kinds of work to be done. Souls are precious in the sight of God. Educate them. Teach them, as they embrace the truth, how to bear responsibilities. He who sees the end from the beginning, who can make the seeds sown wholly fruitful, will be with you in your efforts. Says Christ, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" Let not one discouraged thought or feeling come in. See and sense the value of human souls. Toil for them, knowing you must meet these again. Oh, we have not fully learned the value of Christ or of His work. Work in faith; do your part, and believe the Lord will work with your efforts. God giveth the increase.",
