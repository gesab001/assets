    "word": "Before leaving Australia and since coming to this country, I have been instructed that there is a great work to be done in America. Those who were in the work at the beginning are passing away. Few are left of the pioneers of the cause. The work must fall on the younger brethren. The world is filled with strife for the supremacy. The spirit of pulling apart, of war, \n\n\n                                    -354- \n\nor animosity and disorganization, is in the very air we breathe. Our only hope is to remember that we are little children--God's little children. \"Behold the nations before Him are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance.\" We are inclined to exalt self. But God wants no self-exaltation in His work. He wants us to labor in simplicity and humility, as His little children, learning daily of Him. We must bring His word into the practical life. We talk the truth, we preach the truth, but we do not live the truth.--Ms 11, 1903, p. 1. (\"Words of Counsel\", March 26, 1903.)",
