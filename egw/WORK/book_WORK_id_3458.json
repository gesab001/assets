    "word": "Responsible for Work We Might Have Done\nWe are in the shaking time, the time when everything that can be shaken will be shaken. The Lord will not excuse those who know the truth if they do not in word and deed obey His commands. If we make no effort to win souls to Christ we shall be held responsible for the work we might have done, but did not do because of our spiritual indolence. Those who belong to the Lord's kingdom\n26\nmust work earnestly for the saving of souls. They must do their part to bind up the law and seal it among the disciples.",
