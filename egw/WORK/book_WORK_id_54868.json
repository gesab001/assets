    "word": "\"Ye are God's building.\" You cannot build your character yourself. You must unite with the divine Builder. Said Paul, \"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man \n\n\n                                     -399- \n\ntake heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" Let no man suppose that he is appointed to be a foundation upon which other human beings are to build. Every human being is to erect his building upon the sure foundation, Jesus Christ. \"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is\" [1 Corinthians 3:12, 13].",
