They love the things of this world, and have fellowship with the works of darkness. They have pleasure in unrighteousness. They have not love toward God, nor love for their neighbors. They are idolaters--worse, far worse, in the sight of God, than the heathen graven-image worshipers who have no knowledge of a better way.",
