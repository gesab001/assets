    "word": "There is a great work to be accomplished. The Lord has chosen men whom He has called to work in His vineyard. Let each do his appointed work faithfully; but in no case must he consider his branch supreme, to absorb the time, brain power, and money which is necessary for the healthful growth of other parts. Let there be unity of spirit and action, a binding together, Christ being the great Center.",
