    "word": "Our only safety now is to live a life of faith and good works. Your heavenly Father knows your every trial. He is acquainted with all your infirmities. He will be to you an ever present help in time of need and He will withhold no good thing from them that fear and love Him. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Our compassionate Saviour will never be indifferent to any pain or sorrow or grief His children suffer. . . .",
