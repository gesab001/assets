    "word": "I will here give some extracts from a letter written November 8, 1880: \"The interest of every part of the cause is as dear to me as my life. Every branch of the work is important. I was shown that there was great danger now of making the tract and missionary work so absorbing that it will become perplexing and absorb every other interest. It was brought before me that there was too much machinery in the tract and missionary and in the Sabbath School work. There was form and arrangement, but little of Christ-like simplicity felt \n\n\n                              -134- \n\nor practiced by the workers. We want less machinery and mechanical arrangement, and more heart work, more real piety and true holiness, especially in the missionary work everywhere. There needs to be piety, purity and wise generalship, and then for greater and much better work would be done with less expenditure of means.",
