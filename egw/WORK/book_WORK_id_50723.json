    "word": "In this time of moral declension God calls upon His people to show a marked distinction between their habits and practices and the habits and practices of the world. Let not those who claim to be Christians, who are professedly walking in the way of God's commandments, take the side of idolaters by indulging self. The advancement of the principles of health reform and medical missionary work is to engage the energies of God's people. Those who are to be a sign to the world are to learn their lessons from the greatest Teacher the world has ever known. In their work they are ever to follow Christ's example.--Manuscript 78, 1900, pp. 12, 13. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. June 7, 1984",
