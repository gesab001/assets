    "word": "God will withhold nothing from the soul who gives himself to Christ for service, but will give him ability to accomplish a work the results of which will be as measureless as eternity. The wounded hands of Christ are His pledge that grace sufficient will be given to every soul to work out the will of God. All power in heaven and in earth will co-operate with Him. Acting as Christ's instrumentality in the earth, day by day man becomes a partaker of the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust. The church on earth, having united with it the power of the church in heaven, will come off more than conqueror through the blood of the Lamb and the word of its testimony. \n\n\n                                               Ellen G.
