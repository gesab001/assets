    "word": "The apostle Paul felt the importance of faithfulness. He says of his own ministry in Christ, \u201cwhom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.\u201d [Colossians 1:28, 29.] And he exhorts Timothy, \u201cPreach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d [2 Timothy 4:2.] This is in accordance with the word which through the prophet Isaiah the Lord has spoken to the watchmen on the walls of Zion: \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d [Isaiah 58:1.]",
