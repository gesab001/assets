We may be \"filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,\" walking \"worthy of the Lord,\" \"being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins\" (Colossians 1:9-14).",
