    "word": "WE CAN HASTEN HIS COMING.\u2014Christ tells us when the day of His kingdom shall be ushered in. He does not say that all the world will be converted, but that \u201cthis gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come\u201d (Matthew 24:14). By giving the gospel to the world, it is in our power to hasten the coming of the day of God. Had the church of \n162\nChrist done her appointed work as the Lord ordained, the whole world would before this have been warned, and the Lord Jesus would have come to the earth in power and great glory.\u2014RH November 13, 1913 quoted in AG 353.",
