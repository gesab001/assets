    "word": "My dear friends, I want to ask you in conclusion to do what you can to help in the establishment of Glendale Sanitarium. You may have to make sacrifice in order to respond to this call, but God will richly bless you in so doing. Those who have the work in hand are doing their best, but they are in great need of funds. This institution must be furnished. First give yourselves to the Lord, and then bring your offerings to him. We want to see the Glendale Sanitarium put in working order, so that the sick who come for treatment may hear the truth. Often we meet those who first heard and became interested in the truth while at one of our sanitariums, and who have been keeping the Sabbath ever since. \n\n\n                           (Stamped)    Ellen G. White \n\n                                               -",
