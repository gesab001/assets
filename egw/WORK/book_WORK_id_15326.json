    "word": "Never should botch work of any kind be allowed in our institutions. Every student should be taught that in order to attain to perfection in character building, he must be faithful in the smallest duties appointed him. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building,\" and your work is to be done as in the sight of a holy God. Do your best, and heavenly angels will help you to carry the work on to perfection. . . . Christ left the heavenly courts, and came to this world to make an atonement for us. All who come to Him in living faith will be enabled to stand on vantage ground. . . .",
