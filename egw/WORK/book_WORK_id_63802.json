    "word": "Into all to which the Christian sets his hand should be woven the thought of the life eternal. If the work performed is agricultural or mechanical in its nature, it may still be after the pattern of the heavenly. It is the privilege of the preceptors and teachers of our schools to reveal in all their works the leading of the Spirit of God. Through the grace of Christ every provision has been made for the perfecting of Christlike characters, and God is honored when his people in all their social and business dealings reveal the principles of heaven.",
