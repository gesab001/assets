    "word": "Christ gave Himself willingly and cheerfully to the carrying out the will of God. \u201cHe . . . became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross\u201d (Philippians 2:8). In view of all that He has done, should we feel it a hardship to deny ourselves? Shall we draw back from being partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings? His death ought to stir every fiber of our beings, making us willing to consecrate to His work all that we have and are.",
