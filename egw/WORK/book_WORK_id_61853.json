    "word": "There are many who are at ease, who are, as it were, asleep. They say, \"If prophecy has foretold the enforcement of Sunday observance, the law will surely be enacted,\" and having come to this conclusion, they sit down in calm expectation of the event, comforting themselves with the thought that God will protect his people in the day of trouble. But God will not save us if we make no effort to do the work he has committed to our charge. We must be found faithfully guarding the outposts, watching as vigilant soldiers, lest Satan shall gain an advantage \n                                                                           334\nwhich it is our duty to prevent. We should diligently study the word of God; and pray in faith that God will restrain the powers of darkness; for as yet the message has gone to comparatively few, and the world is to be lightened with its glory. The present truth - the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus - has not yet been sounded as it must be. There are many almost within the shadow of our own doors for whose salvation no personal effort has ever been made. We are not prepared for the time when our work must close. We must take a firm stand that we will not reverence the first day of the week as the Sabbath, for it is not the day that was blessed and sanctified by Jehovah, and in  reverencing Sunday we should place ourselves on the side of the great deceiver. The controversy  for the Sabbath will open the subject to the people, and an opportunity will be given that the claims of the genuine Sabbath may be presented. Blindness, disloyalty to God, so prevails that his law is made void, but the psalmist says of such a condition, \"It is time for thee Lord to work; for they have made void thy law.\"",
