    "word": "We are to commit our way to the Lord, testing it by His searching laws. \"Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass\" (Psalm 37:5). We cannot commit our way to God if we are working out deeds of injustice. \"If I regard iniquity in my heart,\" the psalmist declares, \"the Lord will not hear me\" (Psalm 66:18). When we commit our way to the Lord we are to search the heart through and through, casting out all evil, that Christ may fill it with His righteousness. We are to seek the Lord in prayer, putting at the beginning of our petitions repentance for sin. . . .",
