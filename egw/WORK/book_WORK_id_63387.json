    "word": "I leave these words with you, praying that the blessing of God may rest on the self-sacrificing workers at Berrien Springs, and upon all who continue in the work of canvassing for \"Object Lessons\". Time is short, and there is much to be done. Let all who can, old and young, men, women, and children, take up this work. As they go forth, the Lord will open the way before them. The words that they speak will be as seeds sown in good ground. Many souls will be saved as a result of their willing service. And at last, when we join the royal family in the courts above, the Lord will open before us the good that has been accomplished by \"Christ's Object Lessons\". \n\n\n                                      -316-",
