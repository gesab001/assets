    "word": "\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto My Father\" [verse 12]. What wonderful words! Since we have such promises, let not one of us doubt; let not one of us fall into unbelief. Let us take the Lord at His word--believe Him. The Spirit that was with Christ will indeed be with all who trust in the Lord.",
