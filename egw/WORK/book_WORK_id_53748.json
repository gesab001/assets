    "word": "When your letter and Elder Kilgore's, regarding the work in Nashville, were read to me, a great burden came upon me, and for a time I thought that my reason would give way. I was so weary, having just come from the Portland camp meeting and having labored very hard while there, that I was in no condition to have such matters brought before me. It takes so long for our leading brethren to read beneath the surface that I feared that perhaps I had said something which would have been better deferred in regard to the publishing work in Nashville being conducted as separate and independent from the work in Battle Creek. So often the same old difficulties arise and are presented in regard to disturbing the \"regular lines.\" But God will work in some way to make His people understand that the regular lines have become full of irregular practices. [THE PHRASE \"REGULAR LINES\" REFERRED TO THE PUBLISHING WORK AT BATTLE CREEK. THE \"IRREGULAR PRACTICES\" INCLUDED THE EXERCISE OF KINGLY AUTHORITY (PM 132), THE PRINTING OF \"THE SOUL-DESTROYING THEORIES OF ROMANISM\" (8T 92), AND A VARIETY OF OTHER IMPROPRIETIES. (SEE THE PUBLISHING MINISTRY, PP. 127-178.) MEANWHILE, IN 1894, ELLEN WHITE'S SON, EDSON, HAD BEGUN A PRIVATELY SUPPORTED MINISTRY FOR THE BLACKS IN MISSISSIPPI AND TENNESSEE. EDSON'S SACRIFICIAL PUBLISHING VENTURES IN THE SOUTH, WHILE INDEPENDENT OF THE \"REGULAR LINES,\" RECEIVED ELLEN WHITE'S STRONG SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT.]",
