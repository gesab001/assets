Those who comply with the conditions laid down in the Word will find full provision for their spiritual needs and for power to overcome. . . .

In the home they are to cultivate the graces of the Spirit, in all their ways acknowledging Him who through the sanctification of the Spirit has promised to make us perfect in every good work. . . .",
