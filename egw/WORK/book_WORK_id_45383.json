    "word": "The principal of a school cannot do justice to his work when his interests are divided. Brother Cady cannot do justice to this school and be away in the field so much of the time, as has been the case in the past. The school needs his presence. It should not be left to the uncertainty that arises when the one who stands at its head is absent. The one who stands as principal should devote the greater part, if not all, of his time and energy to the school. He should study and plan for its success, and should put his whole soul into an effort for its advancement.",
