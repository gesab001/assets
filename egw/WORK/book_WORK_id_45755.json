    "word": "God has a work for Brother Prescott to do in bringing the light of present truth to those who have not seen it. It is not wisdom for him to remain continuously in Washington. He has special ability for ministering the work of God to the people. . . . He is not where the Lord would have him be. He would be the recipient of much greater spiritual strength if he were much of the time out in the field seeking to lead souls to the light of truth.",
