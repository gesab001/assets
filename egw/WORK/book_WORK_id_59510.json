    "word": "I would not now speak so plainly, were it not for the intense desire I feel that our medical workers shall \n\n\n                              -68- \n\nbe molded and fashioned after the similitude of Christ, in order that all their work and their relation to God's cause may be in harmony with His purpose. God calls upon every physician and every other medical missionary worker to take his stand on the platform of truth, where he shall not be influenced by any man's false theories and wrong devising. The pure, living principles of the gospel are to be respected. God has a people in His church who are laboring just as disinterestedly to save sinners, as the medical missionary workers have been laboring. He calls upon His medical missionary workers to labor unitedly with His church, and not to allow any physician to control their efforts by his authority. The Lord now calls upon His people to unify. Let all our medical missionaries unite with our ministers in soul-saving work.",
