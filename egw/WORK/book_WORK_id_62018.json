    "word": "The efforts made to induce our people to move away from Battle Creek have not succeeded. And why? Because the enlargements constantly going forward have been encouraging people to move in. There was represented to me a mammoth vineyard, requiring much labor to tend and care for it. Men were working in one part of the vineyard, while other parts were left unworked, to grow thorns and briers. One of dignified bearing said, Why are you setting out so many plants in this part of the field? Take some of the plants to other portions of God's vineyard. More ground may be brought under cultivation. Thus the work will be greatly extended, and new elements will be brought in. When the people are congregated together as they are in Battle Creek, it requires more labor to keep the church in a right condition than would be required to minister to the same number if they were scattered as they should be in different parts of the field.",
