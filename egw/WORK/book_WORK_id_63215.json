    "word": "Let the Southern field have its own home published books. Selected books from the Old and New Testaments can be published in separate volumes, with simple explanations and inexpensive illustration. In addition to these books, there can also be published some illustrated books suitable for school children. These books will be a great help in the work in the South. The publication of these books can be done acceptably in the Nashville office. The work of this institution is not to be limited to the publication of the \"Gospel Herald\", and a few children's books. But let not the workers try to embrace too much.",
