    "word": "The character and destiny of man in probationary time is determined by the principles which control his action. Selfishness is an attribute of Satan, and if this governs the life, it will be manifested in any profession or occupation, however noble or philanthropic it might be represented to be. A multitude of sins has been covered under the profession of medicine, although there has been a witness to every unholy transaction, a just verdict rendered in the decision of every case. Many things that are thought lawful and right in this profession are unlawful, and they need the scourge of small cords in the hand of Christ that they may be driven out. Many good and merciful acts have been done by practicing physicians, but I was shown that as a general thing the medical profession has become a den of thieves. In connection with the cause of God the work of the Christian physician is to be beautified by the presence of Christ; for He would cooperate with the physician who professes His name. But when men become extortioners, all He can do is to drive them from His courts.",
