    "word": "Sanitariums Connected With Schools \n\n     In every place where schools are established we are to study what industries can be started that will give the students employment. Small sanitariums should be established in connection with our larger schools, that the students may have opportunity to gain a knowledge of medical missionary work. This line of work is to be brought into our schools as part of the regular instruction.--Letter 25, 1902.",
