    "word": "In the night season I was conversing with you, as I stated to you in my letter of two or three months since. Before that letter could have reached you, I received one from you, stating in substance the things I was talking over with you. You said that you had decided to heed the instruction given you by the Lord not to mingle temporal financial enterprises with your work.
