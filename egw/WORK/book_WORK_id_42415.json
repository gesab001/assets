    "word": "Below are given a couple of paragraphs from No. 21, first published in 1872:-- \n     \"No selfish feelings should exist among those who labor in the office. It is the work of God in which they are engaged, and they are accountable to God for the motives and manner in which this branch of His work is performed. They are required to discipline their minds, and to bring their minds to task. Forgetfulness is sin. Many feel that no blame should be attached to forgetfulness. There is a great mistake here; and this leads to many blunders, and much disorder, and many wrongs. The minds must be tasked. Things that should be done should not be forgotten. The mind must be disciplined until it will remember.",
