    "word": "I do not refuse to go to Battle Creek if the Lord indicates that it is my duty to go. But I may not be present at the General Conference if it is held at Battle Creek, or even if it is held in Oakland. I have a great and most solemn work before me in preparing for publication the writings which till now have been merely private testimonies, to be laid away in a drawer, with no heed paid to their instructions. Should I now attend a Conference at Battle Creek or in any other place, and bear the clear cut testimony I would have to bear, there would be cavilling over the instruction given, as there has been over the written testimonies. There would be great blindness of heart, and a disposition to misapply truth. Poor unconsecrated souls would be brought into even greater danger and peril than they are in now.",
