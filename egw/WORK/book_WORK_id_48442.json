    "word": "Very important is the work to be done. Much has been said, and too much cannot be said in regard to Bible education in our schools. The Bible is to be presented as the lesson book. I have seen that infidel sentiments would be brought from our schools where infidel authors are placed in the hands of the students. Sentiments will be expressed in regard to Scripture statements that are directly infidel and will open the way for the students, if but one chance is given them, to put a construction on the Scripture that will lead to unbelief and infidelity.--Letter 47, 1897, pp. 1, 2. (To A. G. Daniells and E. R. Palmer, June 28, 1897.) \n\n\n                                    -286-",
