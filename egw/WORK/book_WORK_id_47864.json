    "word": "I am not able to write much, but I desire to say that I was greatly pleased with your letter, in which you give me the history of your experience with the W.C.T.U. When I read it, I said, \"Thank the Lord. That is \n\n\n                                    -166- \n\nseed sowing which is of value.\" I am pleased, so much pleased. The Lord has certainly opened your way. Keep it open if possible. A work can be accomplished by you. Preserve your strength for such efforts. Attend important gatherings when you can. These occasions will be very trying seasons, but when the Lord gives His loved ones a special work to do, he sends His angels to be round about them.",
