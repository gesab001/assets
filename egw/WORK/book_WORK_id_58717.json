    "word": "I have felt reluctant to have Edson stay in the South, fearing that he would lose his health, and perhaps his life. Christ said, If they receive you not in one place, go into another.

Brother Butler should have periods of rest, and Edson White should have an occasional rest. And the other workers in the field must guard their health carefully. God is jealous of His servants. He desires that they shall place themselves where they can best preserve, their mental and physical powers, because if these are not preserved, the spiritual powers will be so weakened that the work will suffer much.",
