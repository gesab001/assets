    "word": "A pastor should have a correct understanding of the word and also of the human character. Our faith is unpopular. The people are unwilling to be convinced that they are so deeply in error; a great work is to be done, and at present there are but few to do it. One man usually performs the labor which should be shared by two; for the work of the  evangelist is necessarily combined with that of the pastor, bringing a double burden upon the worker in the field.",
