    "word": "I pray that the people of God may not cast aside the peculiarities of their faith. Christ is glorified by a life of constant, well-defined faith. Paul declares, \"The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me\" (Galatians 2:20). Christ is to be glorified by the living, working faith of His people. The just shall live by faith. Christ has not left His people to stumble along in darkness. He has marked out the way before them. He says, \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Mark 8:34). It is along the path of self-denial, the royal highway cast up by the Redeemer, that God's people are to travel.",
