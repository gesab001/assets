    "word": "The Lord has instructed me that those who are now carrying on work among the colored people can not remain in the field in a bare-handed condition, and do the work that is required. It will be necessary for them to receive help. The Lord has been calling upon His people in the stronger conferences of the North, the East, and the West to sustain the Huntsville school by liberal gifts. We pray that He will put it into their hearts to respond nobly. \n                                       Ellen G. White.",
