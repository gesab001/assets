    "word": "I entreat you, brethren, to come to Christ and drink; drink freely of the water of salvation. Do not appeal to your own feelings. Do not think that sentimentalism is religion. Shake yourselves \n138\nfrom every human prop, and lean heavily upon Christ. You need a new fitting up before you are prepared to engage in the work of saving souls. Your words, your acts, have an influence upon others; and you must meet that influence in the day of God. Jesus says, \u201cBehold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.\u201d Light is shining from that door, and it is our privilege to receive it if we will. Let us direct our eyes within that open door, and try to receive all that Christ is willing to bestow.",
