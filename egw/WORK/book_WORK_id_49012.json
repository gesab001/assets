    "word": "Our camp meeting in Adelaide is closed, but the meetings continue still in the same North Side Park, over the third Sabbath and Sunday, then the time has expired for which the grounds were secured. Every effort has been made to drive us from the grounds by a Wesleyan Methodist minister by the name of Green. He has circulated Canright's books, and advertised in the paper that Mrs. White was a second Ann Lee and a Southcote. He challenged to a discussion in regard to the work of Mrs. E. G. White, but no notice was taken of the matter. He went to the city authorities to give him permission to take a platform carriage and make that his pulpit, come on the grounds, and preach against us. The magistrate told him he would have no such permission from him, for they had hired the grounds and it was their right to have their meetings without disturbance, and he must stand the consequence of any such movement, for he would not be sustained. Sabbath afternoons and evenings and through the day Sunday, the tent was full, and Sunday afternoon and evening a large crowd was on the outside of the tent.",
