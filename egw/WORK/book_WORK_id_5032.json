I am suffering more now for want of some one who is experienced in the cooking line,--to prepare things I can eat. . . . Food is prepared in such a way that it is not appetizing, but is having the tendency to dry up the desire for food. I would pay a higher price for a cook than for any other part of my work. \n                                                                           488",
