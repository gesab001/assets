    "word": "Our schools are established in the order of God, and parents are to cooperate with the teachers, saying to them, We will act our part in the work by seeing that our children practice what is taught in the school. The efforts made in the home for the education of the children are to correspond with those made in the school. Every power that God has given parents is to be used in union with the plans that the school is carrying out to help the children to perfect Christian character.",
