    "word": "One reminder alone remains: our Redeemer will ever bear the marks of his crucifixion. Upon his wounded head, upon his side, his hands and feet, are the only traces of the cruel work that sin has wrought. Says the prophet, beholding Christ in his glory, \u201cHe had bright beams coming out of his side; and there was the hiding of his power.\u201d [Habakkuk 3:4 (MARGIN)] That pierced side whence flowed the crimson stream that reconciled man to God,\u2014there is the Saviour's glory, there \u201cthe hiding of his power.\u201d \u201cMighty to save,\u201d through the sacrifice of redemption, he was therefore strong to execute justice upon them that despised God's mercy. And the tokens of his humiliation are his highest honor; through the eternal ages the wounds of Calvary will show forth his praise, and declare his power.",
