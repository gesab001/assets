    "word": "Ellen White Declines to Take Fannie Bolton Back.--You asked if you could come back again and connect with me in my work, if you should regain your health. The light I have from the Lord is: She is not converted. . . . I was shown that by your coming to my home, the Lord would give you an opportunity to clear your soul of its guiltiness in connection with me and my work. Your words had created in others ideas that would be communicated to still others. The opportunity was granted you to make straight and thorough work, to clear your soul, and place me in a clear and proper light before the people to whom you had spoken, to show that you had acted as my adversary. The light given me of God is that it was not the will of the Lord henceforth that you should have the least connection at any time with me and the work which God had given me to do.--Letter 25, 1897, pp. 4,5. (To Fannie Bolton, April 11, 1897.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. August 29, 1979",
