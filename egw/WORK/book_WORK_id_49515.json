    "word": "The Lord has need of you. He does not do His work without the cooperation of the human agent. The truth, God's down-trodden law, is to be uplifted; Christ and His righteousness are to be presented to souls that are perishing. The blindness, the spiritual blindness upon the people today is greater even than when Christ was upon the earth. The help of every man and woman is needed. Let us now rally around the standard, and angels which minister unto those who shall be heirs of salvation will accompany you.",
