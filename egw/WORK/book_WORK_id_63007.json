    "word": "You have had educational advantages. But God has not imparted His gifts to you to be used in disparaging another man's work. The Lord has not told you to enter into another man's field, to rob him of the influence God has given him, to show how wise you are as contrasted with him. I pray that you may be converted. Unless you are changed in disposition and spirit, the gates of heaven will be closed against you.",
