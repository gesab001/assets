    "word": "True Love and Sympathy Needed, With Less Form and Ceremony--I am sure if there were fewer forms and ceremonies in our churches, and a greater manifestation of that genuine simplicity, that true love and sympathy that reaches out for souls, and bears others' burdens, much more would be accomplished. All who have the work of Christ to do must have the mind of Christ. The great burden is to educate these souls by the Word of God, and adapt its teachings to all classes. It alone can purify the soul from all moral and spiritual impurity.--Letter 123, 1896, p. 2. (To Edson and Emma White, August 30, 1896.)",
