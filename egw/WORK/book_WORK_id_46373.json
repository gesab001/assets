    "word": "It is very important that at this stage of the work in New York, Elder Haskell have well-qualified helpers, men who have the true missionary spirit, who will take up the work in accordance with Christ's example. Brother Brunson is needed in New York, and I am somewhat surprised to see that now, just as he is getting hold of the work there, plans are being made to call him away. I hope that the Lord will give Elder Brunson clear light in regard to his post of duty. It is a man's privilege to know for himself whether he is in the right place, without depending on any other man's preferences or decisions as to where he shall devote his energies. . . . The work in New York has been laid open before me. The Lord has shown me that the circumstances connected with that work are of such a character as to make it necessary that no haphazard work be done in sending men there. Elder Haskell needs the very best helper that can be provided--a man who will not make friction, who will understand his duty and do it. In answer to prayer, such \n\n\n                                    -300- \n\na man has appeared. To take him from the field just as he is getting acquainted with the work, and put him where there are already several workers of talent and ability, is not in the order of the Lord.",
