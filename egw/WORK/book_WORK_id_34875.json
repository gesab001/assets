    "word": "God approves of the work that has been done in behalf of suffering humanity. Those who have stood opposed to the principles of health reform have stood where the Lord could not fulfil His purpose to work for them or through them. God says, \"That servant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.\" It is intemperance in eating that causes so much invalidism, and robs the Lord of the glory due Him. Because of a failure to deny self, many of God's people are unable to reach the high standard of spirituality He has set for them, and though they repent and are converted, all eternity will testify to the loss they have sustained by yielding to selfishness.",
