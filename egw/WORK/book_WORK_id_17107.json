    "word": "The religious work which the Lord gives to young men, and to men of all ages, shows His respect for them as His children. He gives them the work of self-government. He calls them to be sharers with Him in the great work of redemption and uplifting. As a father takes his son into partnership in his business, so the Lord takes His children into partnership with Himself. We are made laborers together with God. Jesus says, \"As Thou hast sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.\" Would you not rather choose to be a child of God than a servant of Satan and sin, having your name registered as an enemy of Christ?",
