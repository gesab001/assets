    "word": "God has no use for lazy men in his cause; he wants thoughtful, kind, affectionate, earnest workers. Active exertion will do our preachers good. Indolence is proof of depravity. Every faculty of the mind, every bone in the body, every muscle of the limbs, show that God designed our faculties to be \n168\nused, not to remain inactive. Men who will unnecessarily take the hours of daylight for sleep, have no sense of the value of precious, golden moments. Such men will prove only a curse to the cause of God.",
