    "word": "God's Message for the Present Time \n\n     This is the very work which the Lord designs that the message He has given His servants shall perform in the heart and mind of every human agent. It is the perpetual life of the church to love God supremely and to love others as they love themselves. There was but little love for God or man, and God gave to His messengers just what the people needed. Those who received the message were greatly blessed, for they saw the bright rays of the Sun of Righteousness, and life and hope sprang up in their hearts. They were beholding Christ. \"Fear not,\" is His everlasting assurance; \"I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore.\" \"Because I live, ye shall live also.\" The blood of the spotless Lamb of God the believers apply to their own hearts. Looking upon the great Antitype, we can say, \"It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.\" The Sun of Righteousness shines into our hearts to give the knowledge of the glory of Jesus Christ. Of the Holy Spirit's office He says, \"He shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you.\" The psalmist prays, \"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. . . . Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; and uphold me with Thy free Spirit. Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto Thee.\"",
