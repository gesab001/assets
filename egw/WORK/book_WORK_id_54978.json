    "word": "There are persons in each of your conferences who should attend the Healdsburg or the Battle Creek College to gain an experience and training which you cannot give them in your school. They need instruction that will qualify them to become active educators in some branch of the great missionary field. The Lord Jesus has been disappointed in many ways in regard to the laborers. They bring so much of self into the work; they put their own impress upon it. In order that we may have complete success, the impress of Christ must be upon the work. The teachings of Christ must be understood and practiced by every educator.",
