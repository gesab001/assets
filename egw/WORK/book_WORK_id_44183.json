    "word": "Pentecost's Experience To Be Repeated \n\n\n     FOR MANY YEARS FOREIGNERS FROM ALL LANDS HAVE BEEN COMING TO OUR SHORES, UNTIL AMERICA'S POPULATION IS LARGELY FOREIGN. HER LARGE CITIES ARE PRACTICALLY FOREIGN CITIES. THERE IS A PROVIDENCE IN THIS. PENTECOST'S EXPERIENCE IS TO BE REPEATED. IT IS GOD'S PURPOSE THAT MEN FROM EVERY NATION UNDER HEAVEN THAT HAVE GATHERED HERE SHALL HEAR THE LAST MESSAGE OF MERCY AND CARRY IT BACK TO THEIR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. BUT, IN ORDER TO REACH THE FOREIGNERS IN OUR CITIES, HOUSE-TO-HOUSE WORK MUST BE DONE WITH THE PERIODICALS AND BOOKS WHICH ARE PRINTED IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE. THEY MUST HEAR MEN SPEAK IN THEIR OWN TONGUE. \"From door to door His servants are to proclaim the message of salvation.\"--Id., p. 16. SHOULD THIS WORK BE ENTERED UPON AS ENERGETICALLY AS IT SHOULD BE BY MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH WHO HAVE PREPARED THEMSELVES FOR IT BY THE PUTTING AWAY OF ALL SIN, THE HOLY SPIRIT WOULD BE GIVEN THEM, AND MANY SOULS WOULD AGAIN BE ADDED TO THE CHURCH. SOME OF THESE WOULD BE MEN OF MEANS. IN THIS WAY, SUCCESSFUL WORK COULD BE DONE FOR FOREIGN FIELDS, FOR BOTH MEN AND MEANS WOULD THUS BE SUPPLIED. BY WORKING THE HOME FIELD, WORKERS ARE TO BE DEVELOPED FOR THE FOREIGN FIELD. THE GOSPEL COMMISSION CANNOT BE FULFILLED IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN THROUGH THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH BECOMING ACTIVE LABORERS. \n                                                                           8",
