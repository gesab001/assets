    "word": "Chap. 73 - Labor in the East\n\n     I have been shown that the time has come for more effective labor in the East. The necessity of organization and order is at last felt there. Ministers will not now be obliged to labor under such discouragements as before. The angel of mercy is hovering over the East. Said the angel: \"Strengthen the things that remain. Proclaim the message to those who have not heard it.\" There are some in the East who will be in danger of going to extremes when the Lord shall revive His work among them. They should remember that the Lord removed His work from them to the West to humble them, and to subdue an independent, rebellious spirit in them, and lead them to better prize the efforts of His faithful servants.",
