    "word": "We feel the need of more help, but the conference has not money to pay the expenses of laborers to return to this country or to transport laborers. We know not what to do. I am distressed over the situation. I am now paying these workers $19 per week, and they support their families and give their services. I could do more of this work if I had the money to do it with. This sum was increased until I paid five pounds per week.--Letter 46, 1895, pp. 2,3. (To J. H. Kellogg, April 15, 1895.)",
