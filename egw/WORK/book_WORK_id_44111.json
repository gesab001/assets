    "word": "The flesh of dead animals, fermenting and putrefying in the stomach, to be sent through every part of the system, is not pleasant to reflect upon, or to experience. It causes many wretched feelings, and is the greatest cause of fevers, suffering of every type, and of death. Those of sedentary habits should certainly discard flesh-meats. Many greatly abuse their stomachs by eating too much of even healthful food. But how much more those who eat of unhealthful food. The abused stomach bears up in a wonderful manner under the continued abuse daily heaped upon it, until malignant disease brings down the victim. The entire system seems to be corrupted, and nothing can stay the rapid work of disease and premature death.",
