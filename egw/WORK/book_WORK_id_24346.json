    "word": "Chapter 4 \n\n     1 (Psalm 11:6; 8:44). Root and Branches of Evil.--The whole work of the father of lies is recorded in the statute books of heaven, and those who lend themselves to the service of Satan, to put forth and present to men the lies of Satan by precept and practice, will receive according to their deeds. Root and branch will be destroyed by the fires of the last days. Satan, the great general of apostasy, is the root, and all his workers, who teach his lies in regard to the law of God, are the branches (MS 58, 1897).",
