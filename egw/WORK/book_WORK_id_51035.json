    "word": "I hope the Lord will have compassion upon you, but you need self-control, you need to consider your vital organs and the perseverance you have revealed in talking so long. You make yourself tedious, and thus wear out the hearers. This has been presented before you time and again; now let the word of the Lord be heeded, and no longer overtax your powers as you have done. One quarter of the time you have occupied will do a far more acceptable work than to speak at so great length. May God bless you both.-- Letter 54, 1893. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. January 3, 1985 Entire Letter",
