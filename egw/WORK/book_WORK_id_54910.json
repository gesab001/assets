    "word": "As God worked for Cornelius, so He works for these true standard-bearers. He prepares the way for them to take the place of those who have been given a knowledge of Bible truth, but who have disappointed the Lord our Saviour. These men will be true to pure, holy principles in their investigation of the laws which rule our world. They will obtain a knowledge of God as Cornelius did--through the visitation of angels from heaven. That they may obtain advanced light, God places them in connection with men of superior knowledge regarding His Word.",
