    "word": "Could not Approve Plans for Building in Los Angeles [STATEMENT MADE BY E. G. WHITE, SEPTEMBER 15, 1902, AT A COUNCIL MEETING CALLED IN LOS ANGELES TO CONSIDER PLANS FOR THE ERECTION OF A BUILDING ON HILL STREET TO BE USED FOR RESTAURANT AND SANITARIUM WORK.] \n\n\n     With the light that I have had in regard to sanitariums where the sick are to be treated I cannot give one word of counsel about huddling in the city. I cannot do it myself, and yet it may look very different to others; but with the light that I have, I could not advise placing a building in the city. You are out of the city, I know; you are out at one side. That changes the proposition somewhat; but further than that, I could not say; I could not give you any advice. You will have to arrange that among yourselves, because I could not give advice to build a sanitarium in any city. I could not do it, because it has been so distinctly laid before me that when a sanitarium is built, it must be located where it can accomplish the end in view--the object for which it is established.",
