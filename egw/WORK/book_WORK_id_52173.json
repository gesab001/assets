    "word": "MR No. 1249 - Counsel on Soul Winning; The Need to Crucify Self; The Importance of Character Development\n\n     (Written August 24, 1886, from Basle, Switzerland, to \"Dear Brethren Engaged in Labor in Nimes\" [France].) \n\n\n     I feel very grateful for the success you have had, and sincerely hope that you will cling to the work until it is nicely bound off. When the first efforts are made in a place by giving a first course of lectures, there is really greater necessity for a second course than for the first. The truth is new and startling, and the people need to have the same presented the second time, to get the points distinct and ideas fixed in the mind.",
