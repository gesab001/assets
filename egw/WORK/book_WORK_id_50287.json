    "word": "You are not doing God's will in depreciating those who are fellow workers in the same cause and for the same purpose as yourself. Give them the same chance to obtain an experience and to act, as you have had. God enjoins upon us to guard the reputation of our fellow believers in the harvest field as we desire our own reputation to be guarded. If carnal ambition holds the supremacy, God is displeased, for His name is dishonored where it should be magnified. A man may be looked upon as under the controlling influence of the Spirit of God, while he may be deceived, for it is his own natural tendencies that control his judgment and bear sway, so that a look, a hint, a mean smile, a word from him, though he may be apparently suppressing his own feelings, goes a long way in suggesting doubts and suspicion to other minds when, in order to meet the approval of God, his every word, his whole soul, should be thrown in an opposite direction from that to which he gives it.",
