    "word": "Achan Felt No Burden.--That which was esteemed by Achan as a very little thing was the cause of great anguish and sorrow to the responsible men of Israel, and this is always the case when it is manifest that the Lord is angry with His people. It is the men upon whom rests the burden of the work, who most keenly feel the weight of the people's sins, and who pray in agony of soul because of the rebuke of the Lord. Achan, the guilty party, did not feel the burden. He took it very coolly. We find nothing in the account to signify that he felt distressed. There is no evidence that he felt remorse, or reasoned from cause to effect, saying. \"It is my sin that has brought the displeasure of the Lord upon the people.\" He did not ask, \"Can it be that it is because I stole that golden wedge and Babylonish garment that we have been defeated in battle? \"He had no idea of making his wrong right by confession of sin and humiliation of soul (Letter 13, 1893).",
