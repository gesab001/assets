    "word": "We need now to be prepared for the closing scenes of this earth's history. Let all search their own hearts diligently and be converted, that their sins may be pardoned. The world is becoming more and more decidedly opposed to God and to the truth of God. All who will do the will of God will be successful in obtaining knowledge and their experience will be valuable. We must now prepare to do a great work in a short time. We must have an individual experience, and, if we will come to the Lord in humility, He will be found of us, and He will work with us, and His salvation will be revealed.",
