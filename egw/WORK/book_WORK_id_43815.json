    "word": "The Lord put it into the heart of my husband to help Dr. Kellogg at a time when he needed help. Eld. White has felt for Dr. Kellogg all the tenderness of a father, and the Doctor has, in turn, responded. This was in the order of God. My husband can have the satisfaction of knowing that the results of his interest for Dr. Kellogg--which has been far deeper than that manifested for his own children--fully answer his expectations. The Doctor should now manifest the same interest for others who need help and encouragement as he needed it. In this work he may meet with disappointments, but should not be discouraged. \n                                                                           20",
