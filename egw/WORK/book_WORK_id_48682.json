    "word": "Now we want to understand that there is something more to our work than we have given to it, and we want to understand that the essential work must begin with our own individual selves, our own hearts. We must know the influence of the Spirit of God on the human heart, on the human affections. Do not you remember that when Christ was teaching there came one saying, \"Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with Thee.\" And Christ, looking around upon His disciples that were receiving His words of life, read the interest in their eager countenances and said to the messengers, \"Behold My mother and My brethren\" are they that \"do the will of My Father\" (Matthew 12:47, 49, 50). They are the ones that are His mother and His brethren. They are the ones that are more closely related to Him than any ties of relationship.",
