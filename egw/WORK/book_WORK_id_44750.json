    "word": "The Light of the World \n\n\n     Our large books should have a wider circulation. The words, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" must have a much clearer fulfillment in the lives of Seventh-day Adventists than they have yet had. Every line of our work should be carried forward in a way that will recommend the truth to those who hear. No selfish act is to be seen in commercial work, or in spiritual work. No thread of dishonesty is to be drawn into the pattern.",
