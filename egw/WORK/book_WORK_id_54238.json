    "word": "The Lord God has work for women as well as men to do. They can do a work in families that men cannot do, a work that reaches the inner life. They can come close to the hearts of those whom men cannot reach. Therefore their labor is needed. We must have it. We who \n\n\n                                     -31- \n\nlove God in truth are all working for a heavenly kingdom. There is no time to waste upon a class of work that has no Christ in it, or upon that work that woman, who is man's equal, can do if her heart is imbued with the love of Christ our Saviour.",
