    "word": "At the 1901 General Conference, in an article entitled, \"Instruction regarding the School Work,\" read before the delegates April 22, 1901, it was pointed out that all our medical students were not to receive their training at the one medical College in Battle Creek. Of our schools that were introducing educational reforms, Sister White read: (G.C.B. 455-1901) \"We are thankful that an interest is being shown in the work of establishing our schools on a right foundation, as they should have been established years ago. If the proper education is given to students, it is a positive necessity to establish our schools at a distance from cities, where the students can do manual work.\" . . .",
