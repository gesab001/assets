    "word": "About twenty-six hands--students--have worked a portion of the time felling trees in clearing the land, and then have their studies. They say they can learn as much as in the six hours of study as in giving their whole time to their books. More than this, the manual labor department is a success healthwise for the students. For this we thank the Lord with heart and soul and voice. The students are rugged and the feeble ones are becoming strong. Wild young lads such as _____ are becoming men under the discipline of labor. He is becoming a Christian, transformed in character. Oh, how thankful are his parents that he is blessed with this opportunity!--Letter 126, 1895, pp. 1-5. (To J. E. and Emma White, August 19, 1895.)",
