    "word": "Ministry means more than sermonizing. It means earnest, personal effort. And there are many different kinds of work to be done. Those who have gained an experience in God's service are to take young, inexperienced workers with them into the harvest-field, teaching them how to work successfully for the conversion of souls. They are to exhort the church-members to qualify themselves for service.--Letter 21, 1903, pp. 3, 6. (To \"Those Who at the Last General Conference Chose Australia as Their Field of Labor,\" January 26, 1903.)",
