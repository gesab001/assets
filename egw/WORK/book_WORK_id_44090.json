    "word": "A way is opened before every one in the Office to engage from the heart directly in the work of Christ and the salvation of souls. Christ left Heaven and the bosom of his Father, to come to a friendless, lost world to save those who would be saved. He exiled himself from his Father, and he exchanged the pure companionship of angels for that of fallen humanity, all polluted with sin. With grief and amazement, Christ witnesses the coldness, the indifference and neglect with which his professed followers in the Office treat the light, and the messages of warning and of love he has given them. Christ has provided the bread and water of life for all who hunger and thirst.",
