    "word": "God Cannot Use the Undecided Leader--Those who have any connection with God's work in any of our institutions must have a connection with God, and must be committed to do right under all circumstances, that they may know where they will be found in the day of trial.  No one connected with the sacred work of God can remain on neutral ground.  If a man is divided, undecided, unsettled, until he is sure that he will lose nothing, he shows that he is a man God can not use.  But many are working in this line.  They have not been appointed by God, or else they have decidedly failed to be worked by the mighty agency of the Holy Spirit.--Testimonies to Ministers, p. 403.",
