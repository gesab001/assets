    "word": "These words that I have been reading to you this afternoon, are the words of the Bible in regard to your duty and my own duty. And I greatly desire that you shall learn to guard the door of your lips, lest you speak unadvisedly. I used to say to my children, as they were leaving home in the morning: \"Now, children, you are going out for the day's work. Remember that you are to guard your tongues. Speak not one word that will provoke a wrong act. If you fail, then when we meet at family worship during the evening hour, we shall talk the matter over, and make it right with God. You see, children, kind words never cause you any pain and sorrow. Speak kindly, tenderly to one another, and see what a refreshing, what a blessing, come to your own heart. But if you begin to contend one with another, then passions arise, and you have to strive with all your might to retain control over yourself. Be brave, be true.\"",
