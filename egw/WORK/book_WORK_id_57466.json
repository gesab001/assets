    "word": "There is an enemy constantly at work to make of none effect the holy law of God. He has woven into the theology of today His perilous errors, that exalt a spurious Sabbath and trample down the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, so that God is dishonored and the man of sin has exalted himself above God and above all that is worshiped. The professed Christian world have accepted Satan's lie and discarded the words of God, as did Adam and Eve. People say unto us smooth things, they prophesy deceits.",
