    "word": "O how greatly Christ would be honored and glorified before irreligious, worldly men and women if His followers were what they claim to be--true Christians, the love of Christ constraining them to make Him known before an idolatrous world, showing the marked contrast between those who serve God and those who serve Him not. . . .We are to tell others of the love of Christ, and in order to do this, we must know by experience what it means to have this love in the heart. All will find abundant opportunities to work if they will improve the opportunities that come to them.--Letter 35, Feb. 25, 1903, to Sister L. M. Hall, a faithful co-worker and for many years matron of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.",
