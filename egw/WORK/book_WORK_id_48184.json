    "word": "When Christ came, He entered a world disloyal to God, a world all seared and marred by the curse of rebellion against the Creator. The arch deceiver had carried on his work with intense vigor, until the curse of transgression had fallen upon the earth. Men were corrupted by Satan's inventions. He had been leading men astray by his false representations of God's character. Claiming [for] himself the attributes of mercy, goodness, and truth, Satan attributed his own attributes to God. These misrepresentations must be met and demonstrated as false, by Christ in human nature.",
