    "word": "Over and over again the light has been given that a special work is to be done in Huntsville. Those who are rooted and grounded in the truth, in all its bearings, are to be placed in charge of the work. A beginning has been made on the orphanage for colored children, but this work stands unfinished. On the beautiful farm of over three hundred acres, God purposes that an efficient missionary training school shall be conducted, which will develop many workers for the colored people.",
