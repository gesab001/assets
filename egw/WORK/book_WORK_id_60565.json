    "word": "In the afternoon of the day that we left for home, Elder Andross took us in an automobile to visit the several churches and the Bible workers' home in Los Angeles. We did not get out of the conveyance, but stopped and spoke to some of those engaged in the work. It was a very pleasant trip, and I was very glad to see so much of the work in Los Angeles. The automobile was an easy-riding machine that did not jolt me, so I was spared any increased suffering.",
