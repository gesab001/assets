    "word": "Those who press close to the bleeding side of Christ will have the spirit of Christ, and a nature that will be quickly responsive to His call. They will work to relieve the necessities of suffering humanity, as Christ worked, while, before the world fallen, the worlds unfallen, and all the heavenly host, He was representing the ways and works of God. In the life of Christ we see what a Christian can do in relieving the distressed, binding up their physical and spiritual wants. Among the colored people, many, even of those \n\n\n                                     -5- \n\nwho profess to be Christians, are sadly ignorant, not only of Bible doctrines but of Christian principles. Their religion is mingled with earthliness and sensuality. Justice and mercy and the love of God demand that those who have learned of Christ should impart to the very ones in the greatest need. The light is to shine forth amid the corruptions that will be found in the Southern field.--Letter 5, 1895, pp. 6, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 21-23. (To \"My Brethren in Responsible Positions in America,\" July 24, 1895.)",
