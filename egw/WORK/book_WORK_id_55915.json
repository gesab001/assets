    "word": "Why was it that Christ went out by the seaside and into the mountains? He was to give the word of life to the people. They did not see it just that minute. A good many do not see it now to take their position. But these things are influencing their lives, and when the message goes with a loud voice they will be ready for it. They will not hesitate long. They will come out and take their position. There is a work that we have not done at our camp meetings that ought to be done.--Ms. 19b, 1890.",
