    "word": "A few of our brethren who have taken hold of the truth have no idea what it will accomplish. What is needed is a more thorough conversion to the truth of God. There needs to be an education of the people up to the standard. They need organized, systematic effort for every church. If everyone here feels that it is the great and solemn work of God, and that they are individually to be a light that is to be reflected to the world, then we shall see that the cause and work of God will advance more rapidly than it has in the past.--Ms. 6, 1886, p. 2. (\"Beginnings of Work in Scandinavia,\" June 23, 1886.)",
