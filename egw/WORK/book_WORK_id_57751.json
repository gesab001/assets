    "word": "It is a sad fact that many of our people have leaned upon others, and have not made God their dependence. The humility, the meekness and lowliness of Christ, has not been attractive to them. They have set themselves in stubborn self-will, and unless there is a decided change in their attitude, they will, to the last, cherish traits of character that will unfit [them] for seeing and understanding the working of the Spirit of God, and they will be led by another spirit. They will fail to obtain the experience essential for them, so that they shall be clothed in the righteousness of Christ. Having on their citizen's garments, they will venture into the marriage feast, as it is represented in the parable, and will do the greatest dishonor to Him who has invited them and prepared for them the spotless robe. \n                                                                           1042",
