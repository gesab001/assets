    "word": "The interests of the cause of God are not to be committed to men who have no connection with heaven. The interests of those who are disloyal to God cannot be safe counsellors. They have not that wisdom which comes from above. They are not to be trusted to pass judgment in matters connected with God's cause, matters upon which such great results depend. If we follow their judgment we shall surely be brought into very difficult places, and shall retard the work of God. Those who are not connected with God are connected with the enemy of God, and while they may be honest in the advice they give, they themselves are blinded and deceived. Satan puts suggestions into the mind and words into the mouth that are entirely contrary to the mind and will of God. Thus he works through them to allure us into false paths. He will mislead, entangle, and ruin us if he can.",
