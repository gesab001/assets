    "word": "By the Power of the Spirit \n\n     One man cannot carry through any work and make it complete himself, unless no other worker is available; then the Holy Spirit supplies the deficiencies of the worker. But because a measure of success attends his labors, let him not suppose that it is his methods and capabilities which have done the work; for this idea will often bring defeat. Let not men flatter themselves and take to themselves the credit of doing wonderful things; for they are weak and feeble in doing even their best. The Holy Spirit is the worker, and if the human instrument is a close student of his Bible, seeking to know the light and to walk in it, thus learning daily of Jesus, the Holy Spirit will use him as a means of communicating the Word while the Holy Spirit Himself works the heart.",
