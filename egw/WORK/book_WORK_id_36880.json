    "word": "I hope you will not think you can go forward in your own strength relying upon your own judgment. Seek wisdom from above. Be true, be noble in purpose. Be elevated in life, and may the God of peace sanctify you wholly, soul, body, and spirit. Do not cease searching and studying and getting at the very bottom of things. God will help you in all your earnest efforts, my dear children. If you both consecrate yourselves unselfishly to God and to His work, He will accept you. You will not have the reward here, but you must look for the reward by and by when the \"Well done\" is spoken by the Master. . . .",
