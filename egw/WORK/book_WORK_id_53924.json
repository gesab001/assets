    "word": "Our physicians are to unite with the work of the ministry of the gospel. Souls are to be saved, that the name of God may be magnified, and the physician is not to feel when brought in contact with the higher classes of society that he must hide the peculiar characteristics which sanctification through the truth give him. The greatest respect will ever be shown to the physician who reveals that he is under the orders of God. Therefore he is not to take himself into his own hands, but be in every respect a representative of Christ.",
