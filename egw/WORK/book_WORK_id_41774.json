    "word": "Jesus did not condescend to explain to his enemy how he was the Son of God, and in what manner as such he was to act. In an insulting, taunting manner Satan referred to the present weakness and the distressed appearance of Christ in contrast with his own strength and glory. He taunted Christ with being a poor representative of the angels, much less of their exalted Commander, the acknowledged King in the royal courts, and that his present appearance indicated that he was forsaken of God and man. He said that, if Christ was indeed the Son of God, the monarch of Heaven, he had power equal with God, and he could give him evidence of this and relieve his hunger by working a miracle, by changing the stone just at his feet into bread. Satan promised that, if Christ would do this, he would at once yield his claims of superiority, and that the contest between himself and Christ should there be forever ended.",
