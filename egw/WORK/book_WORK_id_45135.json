    "word": "The influence of the Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul. We do not now see Christ and speak to Him, but His Holy Spirit is just as near us in one place as another. It works in and through everyone who receives Christ. Those who know the indwelling of the Spirit reveal the fruit of the Spirit-- love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith.--Ms 41, 1897, p. 12. (\"Words of Comfort,\" no date.)",
