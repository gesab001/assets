Why do you not listen to the counsels and the warnings that have been given to you regarding this matter? Why do you not take decisive steps to establish centers of influence in many of the large cities? Why do you not encourage the Michigan Tract Society and the International Tract Society to establish their offices in cities where there is a great missionary work to be done, and where their secretaries and workers may engage personally in missionary labor, and act as leaders in important missionary enterprises. Move out, brethren, move out, and educate your workers to labor for those outside the camp. Why do you hide your light by continuing to remain in Battle Creek? Go out, brethren, go out into the regions beyond.",
