    "word": "You are responsible to God to educate, train, and discipline in right habits and practices the children that you have brought into the world. Will you who have neglected your families not now give to the world and the church an example of a well-disciplined family, where the children are under the control of the father and mother, and the father and mother under the control of God? Will you who are ministers of God's churches disobey His word by failing to require obedience and order in your households? If you neglect this work, you will neglect to set the church in order. It is the neglect of home duties that is eclipsing the light, so that it cannot shine forth in a correct example in eating, in dressing, in working in right lines.",
