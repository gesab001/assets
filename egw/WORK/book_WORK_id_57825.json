    "word": "Is there not better work for you to do than to discourage one another and try to put out the light of your brethren? Oh, rather, let the mind expand that you may take in the heavenly beauties of the blessed promises. Only believe in Jesus and learn in the school of the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, and His grace will act mightily upon the human intellect and heart. His teaching will give clearness to the mental vision. It will give compass to the thoughts; the soul hunger will be filled. The heart will be softened and subdued, and filled with glowing love that neither discouragement, despondency, affliction, or trial can quench. God will open to the mind's eye His preciousness and His fullness. Then let us love and labor. I point you to Christ, the Rock of ages. You can be saved only through Him. Let the praise of God be upon your lips when you meet together in little companies to worship God. Let all take a part.",
