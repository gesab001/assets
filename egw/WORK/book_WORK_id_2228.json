    "word": "The work of Christ is to draw men from the false and spurious to the true and genuine. \"He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" [John 8:12.] There is no danger of going into error while we follow in the footsteps of \"the Light of the world.\" We are to work the works of Christ. We must engage heart and soul in his service; we must search the word of life, and present it to others. We must educate the people to realize the importance of its teaching, and the danger of deviating from its plain commands.",
