    "word": "Literature Dealing With Daniel and Revelation.--Let all have more to teach, to write, and to publish in regard to those things that are now to be fulfilled and that concern the eternal welfare of souls. Give meat in due season to the old and the young, to saints and to sinners. Let everything that can be said to awaken the church from its slumbers be brought forward without delay. Let no time be lost in \n\n98 \n\ndwelling on those things that are not essential, and that have no bearing upon the present necessities of the people. Read the first three verses of the Revelation, and see what work is enjoined upon those who claim to believe the word of God: [Revelation 1:1-3 quoted].--7T 155-158.",
