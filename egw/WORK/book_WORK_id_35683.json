    "word": "Parents and children, bear this in mind, that the true followers of Christ will make their home as nearly as possible a symbol of the home above, for in doing this they are coworkers with Christ to carry out the laws of His kingdom. Read the prayer that Christ taught His disciples. Live that prayer. It is a whole sermon for all who would practice it. We have something to ask of Jesus. We have great wants and great necessities, which He alone can supply. The prayer which Christ taught His disciples covers all these needs. We want pardon, forgiveness; but we can have it only as we shall pardon and forgive others.",
