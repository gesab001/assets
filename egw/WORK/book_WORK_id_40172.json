    "word": "\"A great work is before us. We must watch and work for souls, in this time of waiting for our Lord. Cultivate personal piety. Every precaution must be taken to prevent spiritual declension, lest the day of the Lord come upon us as a snare. To be good and to do good should be the study of every human being. There is, my brother, great need that your spiritual eyesight be enlightened. 'Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine.' Keep the channel of your mind clear, that you may understand how to use the Lord's entrusted capital. If there are those who have means that they can possibly spare, it is their duty to use it to advance the cause of God.",
