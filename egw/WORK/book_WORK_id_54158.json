    "word": "Those who have charge of our institutions, the sanitarium, the college, the publishing house, the missions established in various places, are not to depart from the rule of strict integrity for any bribe or money consideration. There are those working in these institutions who are dependent for bread upon the means they earn. Often these workers labor just as hard and faithfully as the men who are paid three times as much. Be careful not to crowd down the wages of the poor below what their labor is worth. Beware lest any injustice be done them and they cry unto the Lord against you, for you will surely lose every dollar that has been wrongfully withheld from them.",
