    "word": "God says, \"My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways. . . . For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.\" Then let finite beings be humble and submissive in their desires, realizing that God uses many influences which it is beyond their power to control. We must take self in hand; we must do our duty faithfully; and in this work peace and rest and happiness will come. We must discipline self, seeking to bring it under the control of intelligent reason. We must have a true sense of what the last six commandments mean. There are opportunities daily of practicing forgetfulness of self, and being a blessing to those around us.",
