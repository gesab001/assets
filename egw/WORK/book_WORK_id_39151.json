    "word": "All missionary successes have been gained by consecrated effort. By God's ordained means we can work successfully, meeting and surmounting obstacles, standing steadfastly under Christ's banner, refusing to fail or become discouraged. But often the Lord's workers relax their devoted, persevering efforts, and prosperity declines. Often the door is opened to Satan's temptations, and God's Spirit is sorely grieved. Pride of heart is cherished, and self-exaltation makes the church weak and strengthless.",
