    "word": "All religious exercises are to be treated with the greatest solemnity and reverence. The teaching given should be of a higher class, of a more sacred and religious character, than has been given in schools generally. Human nature is worth working for, and it is to be elevated and refined. There is a work which God alone can do for those who are deficient. They must be fitted with the inward adorning which is in the sight of God of great price. But the teachers can cooperate with God. Through the grace of God in Jesus Christ, which bringeth salvation and immortality to light, teachers may cooperate with God, and His heritage may be educated, not in the minuteness of etiquette, but in the science of salvation and godliness, and this will prepare the sons and daughters of God to be finally transformed by the finishing touch of immortality, and in heaven they will carry forward more thoroughly the education begun in the school here below. We shall be learners through all eternity.",
