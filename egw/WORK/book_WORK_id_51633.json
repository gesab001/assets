    "word": "I was shown in regard to the poor--objects of charity. I saw that the stewards of God have no duty in the case of those who will persist in using tobacco, coffee, and tea.

They must deny appetite. Here they can make a sacrifice. God calls upon them to do it. And after they leave off these hurtful things, if they get into straitened circumstances while exerting themselves to do the best they can, it will be a privilege for their able brethren to help them out of difficulty.",
