    "word": "Here are represented the great white throne and He that sat on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away. Let every teacher consider that he is doing his work in the sight of the universe of heaven. Every child with whom the teacher is brought in contact has been purchased by the blood of God's only-begotten Son, and He who has died for these children would have them treated as His property. Be sure that your contact, teachers, with every one of these children shall be of that character that will not make you ashamed when you meet them in that great day when every word and action is brought in review before God, and with its burden of results laid open before you individually. \"Bought with a price,\"-- O what a price, eternity alone will reveal!",
