    "word": "\"Unify. Your unbelief and lack of unity have been a standing reproach to the people of God, who have been given such great light. The pride of the human heart has dishonored the greatest work ever committed to mortals. Unify; come into the sanctifying circle of truth. Draw together; walk humbly with God; and be subject one to another, according to the light of the word. Let no man seek to be the greatest. This has been an offense to God. Press together, and heed every word of God; that will create oneness. Avoid all fault-finding and dissension. Perplexing matters will adjust themselves if each one will walk circumspectly. \n                                                                           35",
