    "word": "Sister Haskell married Elder Haskell because she was convinced that he needed a helper in his work.  The difference in their ages seemed to Elder Haskell to be a barrier against their union.  He asked my opinion and advice.  I said, \"If her mind is drawn out in this direction, do not hesitate.  You need the help of a spiritual-minded, intelligent woman, who can sustain and encourage you in your work.\"  They were married, and the Lord has greatly blessed their union, making their lives doubly useful to His cause and work.",
