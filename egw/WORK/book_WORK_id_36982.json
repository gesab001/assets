    "word": "There is a work to be done for some who feel no special need of help. It is because they do not feel their needy condition, that they do not reform. They carry the mold of a spoiled character. Unless these souls experience the new birth, they will never see the kingdom of heaven. Unless evil is put away from the life, they cannot be welcomed to the presence of holy angels. God will never again permit to enter the courts of heaven that which will harm and destroy.",
