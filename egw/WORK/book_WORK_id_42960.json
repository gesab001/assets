    "word": "Results of Poor Bookkeeping.--The reason that today so many mistakes are made in accounts is not because those in charge of them are dishonest, but because they have not a thorough knowledge of bookkeeping. They are not prompt in making a faithful, daily estimate of their outgo. These mistakes are not dishonest. Many a youth, because ignorant of how to keep accounts, has made mistakes which have caused him serious trouble. Those who have a living interest in the cause and work of God should not allow themselves to settle down with the idea that they are not required to know how to keep books.--Dec. 20, 1896.",
