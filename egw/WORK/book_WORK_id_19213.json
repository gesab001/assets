    "word": "Men of true Christian principle will take their place, and will become faithful, trustworthy householders, to advocate the word of God in its true bearings, and in its simplicity. The Lord will work so that the disaffected ones will be separated from the true and loyal ones....The ranks will not be diminished. Those who are firm and true will close up the vacancies that are made by those who become offended and apostatize.",
