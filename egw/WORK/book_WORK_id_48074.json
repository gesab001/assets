    "word": "The system is made up of different parts fitted to work harmoniously, and so arranged and proportioned as to make one complete whole. It is the \n\n\n                                    -374- \n\nmisuse and violation of nature's laws that keeps some parts of the human machinery in action, while others are left to become weak through disuse. God designs that the whole being shall be proportionately worked, that every part of the wonderful machinery may act in harmony with the other. While God is speaking to the senses, telling us to preserve the organs in their beautiful arrangement that they may do service for God, and glorify the giver, we are to do our part by cultivating every organ in the order of God. We are not to act in accordance with perverted ideas and customs, but in the intelligence which God has given. We are to preserve simplicity, to maintain the natural form and motions of the body, and not educate the mind and body to meet the customs and fashions of this degenerate age.",
