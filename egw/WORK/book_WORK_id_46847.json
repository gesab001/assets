    "word": "Concerning the work in behalf of the Jewish people being done by Brother Gilbert, I am instructed to say, Give him all the encouragement that is possible. Do not bind about his work by many forbiddings. Help him, so that through his efforts, and the efforts of his fellow laborers, many of the seed of Israel may be grafted to the true stock, Christ Jesus. The Lord will work through men of different nationalities to do a work for their fellow countrymen.",
