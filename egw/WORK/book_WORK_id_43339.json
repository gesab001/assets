    "word": "As a people, and as individuals, our success depends not on numbers, on standing, nor on intellectual attainments, but on walking and working with Christ. The more fully we are imbued with His spirit, the greater will be our love for the work, and the greater our delight in following in the footsteps of the Master. Our hearts will be filled with the love of God; and with earnestness and power we shall speak of the crucified Saviour. As He is uplifted before the people, as they behold His self-sacrifice, His goodness, His tender compassion, His humiliation, His suffering, their hearts will be melted and subdued.",
