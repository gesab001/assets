    "word": "I have been shown that we need to move with the greatest wisdom that we shall not in anything create prejudice by giving the impression that Americans feel themselves superior to people of other nations. There have been two errors,--one error in seeking in our words and actions to exalt foreign national customs above our own American habits and practices and suiting our American stamp to adapt it to foreign countries which will bring us no influence. Then there has been still another error of extolling in conversation and in the labor for souls American practices as far above those of other nations. We need to be constantly guarded on every point. The religion of these nations they think superior to all others, and are exceedingly jealous on this point. They send their missionaries to the uncivilized heathen, and to bear on the front in our approach to them that we \n\n\n                                    -107- \n\nare sent to this country from America as missionaries, will create the suspicion and jealousy at once that [they] are regarded as heathen. . . . This is missionary ground; we are doing missionary work, but the peculiar prejudice will be stirred against us if we put it just as it truly is.",
