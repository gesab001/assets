    "word": "Impartation of Christ's Grace--The riches of the grace of Christ which He is ever ready to bestow upon us, we are to impart in true, hopeful words. \"Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.\" If we would guard our words, so that nothing but kindness shall escape our lips, we will give evidence that we are preparing to become members of the heavenly family. In words and works we shall show forth the praises of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. Oh, what a reformative influence would go forth if we as a people would value at its true worth the talent of speech and its influence upon human souls!--MM 213.",
