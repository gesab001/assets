    "word": "We are under contract to God, in his divine service, to work as Christ worked, not in accordance with natural inclinations, but in accordance with the Spirit of God. But man has woven into \n\n\n                      -48- \n\nthe work of God, his own defects of character, devices that are human and earthly, delusions, ensnaring to himself and to all who accept them. He must make it his first duty to understand the work of God in the regeneration of the soul. He must learn this lesson as a little child. This change should take place in every man before he accepts a position as leader or ruler in connection with the work of God. If he has not a vital connection with God, his own spirit and sentiments will prevail, and he will offer strange fire in the place of the sacred.",
