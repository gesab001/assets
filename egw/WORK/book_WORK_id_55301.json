    "word": "Letter 87a, 1896, p. 2. (To Elder Olsen, May 25, 1896.)--Fannie Bolton has now left us. Sister Burnham and Marian are with me, also Sister Maggie Hare, whom we are entrusting with articles to prepare for the paper, and who gives promise of becoming a good worker. I have just engaged Minnie Hawkins, who has been long in the Echo Office, who understands the typewriter, has some knowledge of short-hand, and we hope may be able to assist in preparing copy. Like Maggie Hare she is young and healthy. They have not a nervous temperament like Fannie Bolton, but will bring a healthful current into the work. If sanctified to God, they will do a good work.",
