    "word": "Set Your Heart in Order Before God.--The best thoughts and noblest feelings will be cultivated and brought into the work, that the heavenly intelligences may cooperate with human beings. As the workers realize that they are in the presence of angels, whose eyes are too pure to behold iniquity, what strong restraint they will place on thoughts, words, and actions. They will be given moral strength, for the Lord says, \"Them that honour Me I will honor\" (1 Samuel 2:30). Every worker will possess a precious experience, and a power and faith that is stronger than all circumstances. They will be able to say, \"The Lord is in this place.\" The angels of God will be in every room. The power of an inward life will circulate through the Office. There will be a power in the lives of the workers that will be felt throughout \n\n\n                                     -119- \n\nthe entire institution.",
