    "word": "When Jesus spoke these words to His disciples, he was about to leave them. He had just given them a portion of His parting address, and in that he had foretold the work of Judas in betraying his Lord for thirty pieces of silver. When Judas left the presence of Christ to perform this terrible work, Jesus said to His disciples, \"Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God be glorified in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself, and shall straightaway glorify Him. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me, and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go ye cannot come; so now I say to you. A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.\" \n                                                                           227",
