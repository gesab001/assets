    "word": "There has been such strife of tongues, such neglect of work that ought to be done, that much, very much, has been lost. In the place of making centers of influence for the Lord's work, men spend their time criticizing and condemning what others are doing. Thus they have done for years, and the saddest part of it all is that they do not realize that they are among those who have lost their first love. They think that they must make others walk in straight paths, when they themselves are constantly making crooked paths for their feet, by their unchristian course strengthening the spirit of strife and dissension.",
