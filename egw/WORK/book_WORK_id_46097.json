    "word": "MR No. 214 - Materials Relating to Seventh-day Adventists and Their Institutions and Confederacies and Labor Unions\n\n     [There is considerable counsel in the Spirit of Prophecy writings of the 1890's and the early 1900's touching on confederacies, both within and without the church. The principle is clearly dealt with. See The Comprehensive Index, \"Confederacies.\" The term is used in dealing with the relationship of the publishing house to authors; of dealing with the wages of publishing house employees; of agreements by which sanitarium workers were bound to the institution; in dealing with Seventh-day Adventists and the Masonic Lodge; in connection with SDA medical institutions opening up their records to non-Adventists or accepting counsel from non-Adventists in the operation of our sanitariums; it is often used in connection with large trusts and oftener with labor unions.]",
