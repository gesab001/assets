    "word": "Let your zeal be for yourselves, to show out of a good conversation your work with meekness of wisdom. Avoid every bitter word, every unkind action. Love as brethren; be kind; be courteous. Do not scandalize the truth by bitter envying and contention, for such is the spirit of the world. Let not these unholy traits be once named among you.",
