    "word": "Christians should bear in mind that God has a personality as verily as has Christ. They should so represent Christ's person and conduct that by doing His work they will manifest the character and spirit of the Father. Christ is the express image of His Father's person and character. Those who are imbued with His Spirit will have an intense love for everyone for whom He died, and will work earnestly to bring into the heavenly garner a harvest of souls. Filled with His Spirit, men and women will be animated with the same desire to save sinners that animated Christ in His lifework as a missionary sent of God.",
