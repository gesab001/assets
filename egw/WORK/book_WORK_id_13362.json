The people of God are privileged to hold open communion with the Father and the Son. \u201cNow we see through a glass, darkly.\u201d 1 Corinthians 13:12. We behold the image of God reflected, as in a mirror, in the works of nature and in His dealings with men; but then we shall see Him face to face, without a dimming veil between. We shall stand in His presence and behold the glory of His countenance.\u2014GC 676, 677.",
