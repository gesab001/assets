    "word": "We must build humble houses for worship. Wherever our camp meetings are held, some of our workers are to remain and carry on the work as the interest demands; and this work should not be left before a meetinghouse is erected for the use of those who shall accept the truth as the result of the personal labor that has been put forth. In Brisbane this plan has been followed, and about 40 have been converted. A small meetinghouse is now being erected. [APRIL, 1899. THIS WORK HAS ADVANCED, AND I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHURCH IS COMPLETED AND IS DEDICATED FREE FROM DEBT.]",
