    "word": "Nor is there justice in the claim that, because a worker in the publishing house receives wages for his labor, his powers of body, mind, and soul belong wholly to the institution, and it has a right to all the productions of his pen.

For that which he may produce in these hours, he is responsible to his own conscience and to God.",
