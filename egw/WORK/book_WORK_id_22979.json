    "word": "Counsel to the Brother and His Wife \nDear Brother and Sister L: \n     Recently, in visions of the night, there were opened before me some matters that I must communicate to you. \n                                                                           45\nI have been shown that you are making some sad mistakes. In your study of the Scriptures and of the Testimonies you have come to wrong conclusions. The Lord's work would be greatly misunderstood if you should continue to labor as you have begun. You place a false interpretation upon the word of God and upon the printed Testimonies; and then you seek to carry on a strange work in accordance with your conception of their meaning. You have even supposed that power is given you to cast out devils. Through your influence over the human mind men and women are led to believe that they are possessed of devils, and that the Lord has appointed you as His agents for casting out these evil spirits.",
