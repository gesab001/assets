    "word": "Our college is far-reaching in its principles. It has for its one great object the education and training of young men and women for usefulness in this life and the service of God. If these youth have an eye single to God's glory, they will seek to fit themselves for His special service. The love of Christ will have a controlling influence upon their everyday life. This object imparts an energy more than finite, and qualifies for achievements that are divine. Their works will show some proportion of the strength of their motives. The salvation of men for whom Christ has paid an infinite price will be their grand aim. All other considerations,--home, family, social enjoyment, are secondary to this.",
