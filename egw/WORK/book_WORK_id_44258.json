Every branch of the work should protect, build up, and strengthen every other branch. Men of varied abilities and characteristics are employed for carrying forward the various branches of the work, and each must give his own branch special effort; but it is the privilege of each to study and labor for the health and welfare of the whole body of which he is a member.",
