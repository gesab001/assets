    "word": "While we desire to stand on the right platform and to be in unity in regard to the medical missionary work, we also desire to understand individually what true medical missionary work is, as outlined in the Word of God. We desire to understand the length, breadth, height, and depth of this work. It is an unselfish work. Some things that are said to be medical missionary work are not rightly named. The medical missionary work is a most exalted work. It is one of the principal means of preparing a people to stand as God's family in the last days. It is not merely something that will gain for us a round of applause from the world.",
