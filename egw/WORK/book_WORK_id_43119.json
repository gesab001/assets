Will you take your Bible and read this carefully and solemnly, under the influence of the Holy Spirit of God? Make an application to yourself of these decisive words. Verse 5 it applicable to many: \"I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false \n\n\n                      -5- \n\nswearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.\" There is a work of restoration to be done before God will accept the repentance, or heal the wounds that sin has made. \"For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed [in your evil doings].

But ye said, Wherein shall we return?\"",
