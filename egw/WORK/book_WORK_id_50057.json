    "word": "Said one mother of good ability, of high intellectual attainments, \"I am amazed at the change in my daughters. Before going to Battle Creek to work at the sanitarium they were particular in regard to keeping the Sabbath, but now they often infringe upon the Sabbath. They used to love to attend our meetings, and they will now frame any excuse to remain at home. Their love for serious things is gone. Their love for vanity, for dress, for trimmings and display has become a passion. They laugh at me in the face when I express surprise and tell me that we can be religious without being so prudish and fanatical. They say, \"I wish you could see how the lady physicians dress at the sanitarium. I wish you could see how different are the ideas of the matron. She is a real good woman--so kind and accommodating to us girls. She does just what we want her to do!\" And they began to sing a light song, and broke into a coarse laugh. \n\n\n                                    -135-",
