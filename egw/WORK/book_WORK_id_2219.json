    "word": "When God's word is made the man of our counsel, and we search the Scriptures for light, angels of heaven come near to impress the mind, and enlighten the understanding, so that it can truly be said, \"The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" [Psalm 119:130.] It is no marvel that there is not more heavenly-mindedness shown among the youth who profess Christianity, when there is so little attention given to the word of God. The divine counsels are not heeded; the admonitions are not obeyed; grace and heavenly wisdom are not sought, that past sins may be avoided, and every taint of corruption be cleansed from the character. David's prayer was, \"Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.\" [Psalm 119:27.]",
