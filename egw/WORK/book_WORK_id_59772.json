    "word": "The manager of a sanitarium bears important responsibilities. Let his associates who are engaged in continuous hard labor in the various handicrafts, keep their souls searched as with a lighted candle. Unity of action in diversity of labor must be maintained. (290) The workers are to live out the prayer of Christ, who declares, \"I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.\" Let them read the word of the Lord, in order that they may have the wisdom that is unto salvation. The richest treasures are to be found by searching for them in the Word. Some minds will be so impressed to seek these hidden treasures as to sell all that they have in order to buy the field and come into possession of the priceless jewels of truth. Of times the most lowly are in possession of the hidden treasure, which they may impart to others.",
