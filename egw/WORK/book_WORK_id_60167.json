    "word": "The truth for this time, the third angel's message, is to be proclaimed with a loud voice, (meaning with increasing power), as we approach the great final test. This test must come to the churches in connection with the true medical missionary work, a work that has the great Physician to dictate and preside in all its comprehends. . . The present truth for this time comprises the messages, the third angel's message succeeding the first and second. The presentation of this message, with all it embraces, is our work. . . The third angel's message, in its clear, definite terms, is to be made the prominent warning; all that it comprehends is to be made intelligible to the reasoning minds of today. Unpublished MS. . . (H. 121-1900). \n\n2. To Every Man His Work. Ephesians 4:11-13.",
