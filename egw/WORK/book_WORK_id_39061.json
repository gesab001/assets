    "word": "The long sessions of committee meetings have confused the senses with words of great things to be done, which have not been done at all. We want the mind of Christ, and then each one will indeed become a partner in the great firm with an invincible Jesus. There have been altogether too many looking in upon their own trials and difficulties; but when they forget self, and look upon the suffering necessities of others, there is no time to magnify their own griefs. Earnest work for the Lord is a recipe for mind ailments, and the helpful hand to lighten in lifting the burdens Christ has borne for all his heritage, will lessen our burdens, so they will not be worth mentioning.",
