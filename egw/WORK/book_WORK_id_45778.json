    "word": "The Lord has greatly blessed Brother Daniells in his ministry, and now he would have a change made in his location.  There are altogether too many things connected with Melbourne that are no strength to Brother Daniells. There are large business interests, which he is not educated to carry, and which it is not his duty to carry. . . . If he could give himself directly and decidedly to the work of preaching, and have his mind free from such a raft of little matters and difficulties that are constantly arising at Melbourne, it would be a great blessing to him.  He needs to go where he can unload, and not be made responsible for matters in business lines that others are appointed to attend to.  There are men who can do this work. . . . \n\n\n                                      -248-",
