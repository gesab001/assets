The preparation of the buildings does not correspond with the work that the Lord has outlined to be done by this school. An orphanage for the care of colored children is needed there, and humble, but neat, cottages should be put up to accommodate those who desire to bring their children to the church school. Improvements should be made on the school buildings, and in this there should be no delay.",
