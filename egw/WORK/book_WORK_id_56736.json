    "word": "In witnessing for Christ he declared what he knew, what he had seen and heard. There was no supposition, no guesswork, about what he said.

Christ had humbled Himself; He had taken man's nature; and few could see Him as John saw Him. But John had an advanced experience; the darkness had passed away. On him the true light was shining, and in his epistles he breaks forth against sin, presenting Christ as the One who could cleanse from all iniquity.",
