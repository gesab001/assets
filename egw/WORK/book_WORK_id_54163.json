    "word": "You who are appointed as directors are yourselves to be under the direction of Christ. Take your orders from Him, and give them to the workers in the spirit of Christ, remembering that \"all ye are brethren.\" We are reformers, and we are not to accept a human standard but to be governed by the principles of heaven. It does not become reformers to confine the work of reform to some special points to the neglect of others. If wealth is brought to the sanitarium by the sacrifice of one Christlike attribute or principle, souls will be discouraged, and one soul is worth more than the whole world. Remember that Christ will deal with you as you deal with those under your care.",
