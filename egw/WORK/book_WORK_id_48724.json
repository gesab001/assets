    "word": "In Connection With Sermon and Lord's Supper.--I spoke to our people upon Sabbath with much freedom. A social meeting followed where many bore testimony for the truth and expressed gratitude for that which they had heard, and said they meant from that time to be more earnest and interested in the work and cause of God than they had been heretofore. At the close of the meeting the Lord's supper was administered.--Letter 21, 1880, p. 2. (To James White, April 15, 1880.)",
