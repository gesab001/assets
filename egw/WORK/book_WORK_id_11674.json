    "word": "The Holy Spirit is grieved and driven away by the self-sufficiency, the unchristlike spirit, that is cherished. You have no time to spend in contention. Draw near to God, and go to work for Christ and the souls he died to save. If mistakes are made, as they will be, do not fall back, content to make no further effort, but try again. With agony of desire, in humility, with wrestling faith, come to One who is too wise to err, and who will make no mistake in your case; one who knows your every weakness, and who will hear your heart-felt prayers. May God make his servants wise through the divine illumination, that the impress of man may not be seen on any of the great and important enterprises before us.",
