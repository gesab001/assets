    "word": "BUT THERE CAME A TIME WHEN PAGANISM IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE FELL BEFORE THE ADVANCING FORM OF CHRISTIANITY. THEN, AS IS STATED ON PAGE 54, \u201cPAGANISM HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE PAPACY. THE DRAGON HAD GIVEN TO THE BEAST \u2018HIS POWER, AND HIS SEAT, AND GREAT AUTHORITY.\u2019\u201d THAT IS, SATAN THEN BEGAN TO WORK THROUGH THE PAPACY, JUST AS HE HAD FORMERLY WORKED THROUGH PAGANISM. BUT THE PAPACY IS NOT REPRESENTED BY THE DRAGON, BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER SYMBOL IN ORDER TO SHOW THE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF THE OPPOSITION TO GOD. PREVIOUS TO THE RISE OF THE PAPACY, ALL OPPOSITION TO THE LAW OF GOD HAD BEEN IN THE FORM OF PAGANISM,\u2014GOD HAD BEEN OPENLY DEFIED; BUT FROM THAT TIME THE OPPOSITION WAS CARRIED ON UNDER THE GUISE OF PROFESSED ALLEGIANCE TO HIM. THE PAPACY, HOWEVER, WAS NO LESS THE INSTRUMENT OF SATAN THAN WAS PAGAN ROME; FOR ALL THE POWER, THE SEAT, AND THE GREAT AUTHORITY OF THE PAPACY, WERE GIVEN IT BY THE DRAGON. AND SO, ALTHOUGH THE POPE PROFESSES TO BE THE VICEGERENT OF CHRIST, HE IS, IN REALITY, THE VICEGERENT OF SATAN\u2014HE IS ANTICHRIST.",
