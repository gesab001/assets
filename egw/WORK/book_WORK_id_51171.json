    "word": "Especially is this true in regard to the president of the General Conference. His time is not to be filled up with the details of business; for this in a great degree disqualifies him for the very work which he should do. He cannot continue to carry the burden he has carried in these lines, without neglecting lines of work which cannot be left to others. Let men be chosen to give themselves to the business part of the work, and leave the president of the General Conference free to attend to the spiritual interests. Let him have time to understand the spiritual needs of the church.",
