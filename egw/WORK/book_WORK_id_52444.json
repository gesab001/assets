    "word": "The Lord declares that His church is not to be governed by human rules or precedents. Men are not capable of ruling the church. God is our Ruler. I am oppressed with the thought of the objectionable human management seen in our work. God says, Hands off. Rule yourselves before you attempt to rule others. Strange things have been done, things that God abhors. For men to claim that the voice of their councils in their past management is the voice of God seems to me to be almost blasphemy.--Manuscript 35, 1901. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. July 9, 1987. Entire Manuscript. \n\n\n                                    -251-",
