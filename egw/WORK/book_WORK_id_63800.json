    "word": "The most important work for our educational institutions to do at this time is to set before the world an example that will honor God. Holy angels through human agencies are to supervise the work, and every department is to bear the mark of divine excellence. Let the word of God be made the chief book of study, that the students may learn to live by every word that Christ has given.",
