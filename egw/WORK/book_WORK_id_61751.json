    "word": "I send you these lines because I see that there is need of a deeper intuition, a wider perception, on the part of our sanitarium and educational workers if they would get all the benefit that God intends shall come to them through these books. I ask you, Brother Burden, to read these words to our people, that they may learn to show the wisdom of a sound mind. The Lord gave me His Holy Spirit to enable me to write the manuscript for this book, the Review and Herald and the Press donated the labor required to prepare it for the public; and God now calls upon our people, men and women and youth, to make the most of this gift to His cause. Let the students, under wise directors, be set to work to sell the books, and let all understand why they are engaged in this missionary enterprise. The blessing and approval of God will rest upon those who make the effort. \n                                                                           291",
