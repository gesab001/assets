    "word": "Do not lose interest in the work for the colored people. Do not rest until sanitarium work is established for them, both at the Huntsville school and at Nashville. In the past much labor has been given to this people under the most trying circumstances, and you should not overlook what has been done by the hardest kind of labor. Do not ignore what has been done, but unite your sympathies \n\n\n                                     -72- \n\nwith the sympathies and labors of those who have gone before you and prepared the way. God help you, and give you wisdom to know how to treat your fellow workers. Christian instrumentality is a wonderful thing. If its place in the divine economy is appreciated as it should be, the workers will appreciate more than they do what has been accomplished in the Southern field.",
