    "word": "We need to make use of the youth who will cultivate honest industry, who are not afraid to put themselves to the task. Such youth will find a position anywhere, because they falter not by the way; in mind and soul they bear the divine similitude. Their eye is single, and they constantly press onward and upward, crying, Victory. But there is no call for the indolent, the fearful and unbelieving, who by their lack of faith and their unwillingness to deny self for Christ's sake keep the work from advancing. \n                                                                           20",
