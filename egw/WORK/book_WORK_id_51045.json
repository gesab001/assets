    "word": "I caution all to walk carefully, to take the Word of God individually. We may meet Satan with the weapon, \"It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve\" [Matthew 4:10]. The Bible is the great mine of truth, which we are to work as those seeking for hidden treasure. In no case is the attention to be diverted from that Word. \"This \n\n\n                                   -193- \n\nis life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent\" [John 17:3].",
