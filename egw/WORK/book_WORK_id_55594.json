    "word": "At this time what will be the course of those who claim to fear God and respect His commandments? Will they be carried away by the apparently overwhelming power of the tide of evil? Will they allow themselves to be tempted by the scorn thrown upon God's law, to think that it makes no difference what day they keep? Shall they not give heed to God's word: \"Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. Six days may work be done; but the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh He rested, and was refreshed\" [Exodus 31:14-17].",
