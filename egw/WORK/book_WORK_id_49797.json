    "word": "This instruction is of vital importance to everyone. At this time, above all other items in the history of the earth, these words should be practiced. But today they are to a great extent left out of the practice of professing Christians. This is the reason why God is dishonored by discord and strife, why He does not give to His people the power He would be pleased to impart. He desires to glorify His name before the world and before the heavenly universe. But church members are not doing the work they should do.--Ms. 69, 1901, pp. 2,3. (\"The Unity of the Spirit,\" July 29, 1901.)",
