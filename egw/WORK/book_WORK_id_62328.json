    "word": "The truth should have been proclaimed years ago in the Southern States, from city to city. Health institutions should be arranged in a way that it [the South] will not be so distressingly barren of facilities as in Huntsville. Our people who have a knowledge of how meager were the preparations in some places ought to have done the very things in that locality to raise means to place them in a much more favorable, encouraging situation to work. Why has this not been done? Because of lack of means which they should have had. The Lord has graciously sent Brother and Sister Hughes to that locality, and the softening influence of these workers will put their mold on the work, as it should be in every locality if they have help where work is taken hold of in the South.",
