    "word": "Chapter 10 \u2014Belief in a Personal God\n\nIt will be found in the day of final settlement that God was acquainted with everyone by name. There is an unseen witness to every action of the life. \"I know thy works,\" says He that \"walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.\" Revelation 2:1. It is known what opportunities have been slighted, how untiring have been the efforts of the Good Shepherd to search out those who were wandering in crooked ways, and to bring them back to the path of safety and peace. Again and again God has called after the pleasure lovers; again and again He has flashed the light of His word across their path, that they might see their peril, and escape. But on and on they go, jesting and joking as they travel the broad road, until at length their probation is ended. God's ways are just and equal; and when sentence is pronounced against those who are found wanting, every mouth will be stopped.  5T 43582",
