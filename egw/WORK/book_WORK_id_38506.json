    "word": "Look up, and if one tells you that things are all wrong, tell him the Lord Jesus knows all about it, and just close the heart against doubt and unbelief. Look up, and say, My treasure is laid up on high. Through Christ we shall reach the end of the journey, if we hold fast the profession of our faith. \"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward; for ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.\" Do the work of God diligently and with faith. \"Press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\"           Ellen G. White. \n     Aug. 10, 1890. \n\n                                               -",
