    "word": "Not every church in every conference may have their minds made clear and distinct as to where the work shall be established. There may be restaurants to be set in operation. Let not men have charge of these matters who will begin to enlarge when in doing some great thing they will accumulate debts that will crush out their life and their courage to do a good work. The truth is that our position is constantly changing, and we know not what sort of experience is before us. Our past and present light will not answer in all respects for the future necessities. We must have fresh food every day. Of the future we know not what shall be, except that which the Word of God maps out before us. We know not unless the matter is mapped out before us by the Holy Spirit.--Ms 176, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Dec. 17, 1987. Entire Ms.",
