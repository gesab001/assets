    "word": "\"In Southern California there are many properties for sale on which buildings suitable for sanitarium work are already erected. Some of these properties should be purchased, and medical missionary work carried forward on sensible, \n\n10 \n\nrational lines. Several small sanitariums are to be established in Southern California for the benefit of the multitudes drawn there in the hope of finding health. Instruction has been given me that now is our opportunity to reach the individuals flocking to the health resorts of Southern California, and that a work may be done also in behalf of their attendants.",
