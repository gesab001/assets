    "word": "PREDICTIONS FULFILLED\n \n     ONE OF THE FEATURES THAT DISTINGUISH THE TRUE GOD FROM ALL FALSE GODS, IS THE POWER TO COMMUNICATE WITH MEN REGARDING THE PAST AND THE FUTURE. THROUGH THE PROPHET ISAIAH, JEHOVAH ISSUES A CHALLENGE TO THE GODS WORSHIPED BY THE HEATHEN: \"LET THEM SHOW THE FORMER THINGS, WHAT THEY BE, THAT WE MAY CONSIDER THEM, AND KNOW THE LATTER END OF THEM; OR DECLARE US THINGS FOR TO COME. SHOW THE THINGS THAT ARE TO COME HEREAFTER, THAT WE MAY KNOW THAT YE ARE GODS.\" AND BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY OF THESE FALSE GODS TO DO THIS, JEHOVAH DECLARES, \"BEHOLD, YE ARE OF NOTHING, AND YOUR WORK OF NOUGHT; AN ABOMINATION IS HE THAT CHOOSETH YOU.\" ISAIAH 41:22-24.",
