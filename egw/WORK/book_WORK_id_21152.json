I thought that in one speaker I recognized the voice of Elder A, but his manner of speech and his words seemed to be Brother B's. At first I could not understand the things that were said by this speaker. Afterward I heard something said in regard to the way in which he thought the publishing work should be carried on. The assertion was made that this work should be placed on a more sure and elevated basis.",
