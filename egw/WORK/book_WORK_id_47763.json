    "word": "MR No. 437 - Bible Tests Not Man-Made Tests\n\n     We do not worry. The cause is the Lord's; He is on board the ship as chief director, and He will guide our bark into port. Our Master can command the winds and the waves. We are only His workers, to obey orders; what He saith, that will we do. We have no need to be anxious or troubled. God is our trust. The Lord sends His richest endowments of reason and reasoning to a people He loves, and who keep His commandments. He has by no means forsaken His people who are working in His lines. God is seeking to make His church the continued incarnation of Christ. The gospel ministers are the under-shepherds, Christ is the divine shepherd. The members of the church are the working agencies of the Lord. His church will stand out prominently. It is the Lord's body. With all its working forces it must become one with the great Head. Among the members of Christ's body there must be unity of action. They are partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. This lust has many branches and comprehends much; but those who are partakers of the divine nature will hold the doctrines of God's word in their purity. The Bible is to be followed implicitly.",
