    "word": "June 15, I see by the letters and accounts received in the last mail that Willie is cut down in his wages; were he in America with his family, this would not be inconsistent; but your visit to Australia and New Zealand should certainly give you an understanding of the situation, that limited means brings embarrassment upon the leading, care-taking workers, which is very much above anything that is possible to exist in America. There are constant demands for means to sustain the work in its various branches, and it is necessary for us to lead out in donating to the enterprises that call for money. Those who remain with their own families and have a position in our institutions could get along far better with much less wages than are needed by those who are called to the work in such fields as we are now laboring in. Those who labor in these new and destitute fields must have means in order to lead out, or they must see the work blocked, and themselves helpless to relieve the situation. I know whereof I speak; for in much of our work we have been pioneers for many years.",
