    "word": "Prescott Not to Stay in Washington, But to Engage in Public Work--During this Conference I had a message for Brother Prescott. He is a minister. \n\n\n                                 -361- \n\nHe should not remain here in Washington to do a work that another man can do. He can stand before the people and give the reasons of our faith in an acceptable way. I know this because I have been associated with him in labor. He has a precious gift, and here he is employed in work that other men can do, while there is a dearth of laborers who can warn these large cities. His gift is not to be used longer as it is now, for if he continues to labor here his health and strength will be used up. But if he will go out into the public ministry, strength will come to him.--Ms. 53, 1909, p. 5. (\"Proclaiming the Third Angel's Message in Cities at Home and Abroad,\" a talk before the General Conference Committee, June 11, 1909.)",
