A. \n   Burden and W. C. White, Sanitarium, Calif., Sept. 20, 1909. \n\n\n     E. G. White: We want none of the kind of \"higher education\" that will put us in a position where the credit must be given, not to the Lord God of Israel, but to the god of Ekron. The Lord designs that we shall stand as a distinct people, so connected with Him that He can work with us. Let our physicians realize that they are to depend wholly upon the true God.",
