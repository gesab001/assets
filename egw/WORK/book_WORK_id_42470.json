    "word": "Chap. 6 - The Result of Reformation.\n\n     Dear Brother Daniells: Yesterday morning I read your letter, in which you express your ardent desire to see a strong corps of workers sent to India and China and other oriental countries. Last night instruction was given me that at present our principal efforts are not to be made especially for China or other fields similar to China. We first have a work to do at home. All our institutions--our sanitariums, publishing houses, and schools--are to reach a higher standard. Then the workers sent to foreign fields will reach a higher standard. They will be more earnest, more spiritual, and their labors will be more effective.",
