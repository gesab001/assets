    "word": "Respect for Older Workers.--In the office of publications at Battle Creek, a spirit is cherished that is an offense to God; there is selfishness that God cannot tolerate; there is hardness of heart; a lack of love and meekness, and it is manifested in words and deportment that are entirely unchristian. The Lord has reproved the sins; He has set them before the erring, and they still are cherished.",
