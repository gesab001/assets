    "word": "Proper Remuneration for Ministers\n     \u201cInstead of bringing the expense of the work down to a low figure, it is your duty to bring the minds of the people to understand that the \u2018laborer is worthy of his hire.\u2019 [Luke 10:7.]\u201d \u201cThe churches need to be impressed with the fact that it is their duty to deal honestly with the cause of God, not allowing the guilt to the worst kind of robbery to rest upon them, that of robbing God in tithes and offerings. When settlements are made with the laborers in his cause, they should not be forced to accept small remuneration because there is a lack of money in the treasury. Many have been defrauded of their just dues in this way, and it is just as criminal in the sight of God as for one to keep back the wages of those who are employed in any other regular business.",
