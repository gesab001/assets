    "word": "Those who give themselves to the work of spreading evil reports have no desire to put on the garment of Christ's righteousness. They may claim to have a knowledge of the truth, but the truth does not work in their lives with sanctifying power. They may seat themselves at the Lord's table, but they have not clothed themselves with the garment of righteousness provided for them, and they are dismissed from the heavenly banquet.",
