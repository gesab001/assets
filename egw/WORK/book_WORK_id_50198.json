    "word": "MR No. 988 - Christ in Both Old and New Testaments\n\n     The instruction given in the Old Testament Scriptures is as verily the word of Christ as the instruction in the New Testament. Christ was as verily man's Redeemer in the days when the Old Testament was written as He was when He appeared in the form of humanity. He gave those of ancient Israel just as favorable an opportunity of working out their own salvation as He did those who listened to His words.--Letter 34, 1899. (Written from Cooranbong, Australia, February 14, 1899, to \"My Brother and Sister.\") \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. June 1, 1983",
