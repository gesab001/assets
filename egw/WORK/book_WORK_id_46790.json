    "word": "I have a work to do for those who will be helped, even if the light given does not harmonize with their ideas. They will recognize the light from God, because they have the fruits of the work which the Lord has been pleased to do through His humble instrument in the last forty-five years. They acknowledge this work to be of God, and are therefore willing to be corrected in their ideas and to change their course of action. But those who will maintain and retain their own ideas, and because they are corrected, conclude that Sister White is influenced to take a certain course of action which is not in harmony with their ideas. . . could not be benefited. I would not consider such friends to be of any value in a hard place, especially in a crises. Now you have my mind. I do not want to do the work of God in a bungling manner. I want to know what duty is and move in harmony with the spirit of God. . . .",
