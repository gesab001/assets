    "word": "God declares, \"If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.\" God will punish those who attempt to compel their fellow men to keep the first day of the week. They tempt them to deny their allegiance to God. They accept the fruit of the forbidden tree, and try to force others to eat it. They will try to compel their fellowmen to work on the seventh day of the week and rest on the first. God says of them, \"They shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation.\"",
