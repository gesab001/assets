    "word": "\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me\" [Revelation 3:20]. Let us answer the knock. Let us open the door. That is our part of the business, and then the glory of God shall pervade our souls. What then? We shall be one in Christ Jesus. \"I have given them Thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\" Well, shall we be engaged in hating one another? The world, He says, hated them. But shall we be working to annoy and make unhappy and hate one another? Is that our business? God forbid. \"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil.\"",
