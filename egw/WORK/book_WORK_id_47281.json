    "word": "MR No. 359 - On Competition\n\n     The Signs is a good paper, never to be exalted as superior to our church paper among our people or to take the place of the church paper. This paper was first in the field and when there is a spirit of competition manifested, it is all wrong and displeasing to God. The Signs is our pioneer paper to serve a want in the cause at the time of its establishment, to give character to the work on the Pacific Coast. But when I see so much made of this paper to the exclusion of the church paper, the Review and Herald, I have said they are beating on the wrong track. They do not work as intelligently as they suppose.--Letter 8, 1881, p. 8. (To Elders Butler and Haskell, June 20, 1881.) \n\nReleased March 26, 1974.",
