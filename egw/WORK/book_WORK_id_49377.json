    "word": "Men will never be prepared to do the work of God acceptably unless they take themselves in hand and endeavor, firmly and constantly, to correct their own errors. No one is to take the position that his own way is perfect, that he has no need to reach a higher standard. \"Seeing that ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently\" (1 Peter 1:22). This work is too often left undone. Many are working in an entirely different manner from that which is given to them as a standard of perfect service. . . . \n\n\n                                   -286-",
