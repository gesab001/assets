    "word": "I was sitting in my room on Sabbath morning, thinking about the perplexities of the work, and wondering, What shall I do? when a little bird hopped onto the windowsill, and poured forth such a flood of song as set my heart free for a time. I believe that the bird was God's messenger to me. I am determined to put my trust in the Lord. I thank Him that I have been so wonderfully sustained. I want to do much more work for Him before I lay off my armor.--Letter 108, 1902, pp. 1, 2, 11. (To Mr. and Mrs. N. D. Faulkhead, July 14, 1902.)",
