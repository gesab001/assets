    "word": "Whatever our duties in the various lines of work may be, remember that God is the General over all.  You must not withdraw from Him to make flesh your arm.  You have been too much inclined to measure yourselves among yourselves and compare yourselves one with another, estimating the importance of your work.  Will you remember that your comparisons may fall wide of the mark?  It is not position or rank by which the Lord estimates.  He looks to see how much of the Spirit of the Master you cherish and how much of the likeness of Christ your work reveals.--Letter 49, 1897 (Sept. 1897, To Brn. Daniells, Colcord, Faulkhead, Palmer, Salisbury).",
