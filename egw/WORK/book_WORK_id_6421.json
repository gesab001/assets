    "word": "It is God who has given life and every physical and mental endowment that the youth possess. He has bestowed upon them capabilities for wise improvement, that they may do a work which will be as enduring as eternity. In return for His great gifts He claims a due cultivation and exercise of the intellectual and moral faculties. He did not give them these faculties merely for their amusement, or to be abused in working against His will and His providence, but to advance the knowledge of truth and holiness in the world. In return for His continued kindness and infinite mercies He claims their goodness, their veneration, their love. He justly requires obedience to His laws and to all wise regulations which will restrain and guard the youth from Satan's devices and lead them in paths of peace.",
