    "word": "Brethren in Vermont should be careful and wait until the Lord lays the burden on men before they encourage them to labor; then even if the Lord designs to use individuals, the brethren are in danger of hurrying them along, hurting them by encouraging them too much. They should be left to work their way along, and let God fit them for the work. Let them come along with the deep weight of the work upon them. Some are entirely spoiled by being hurried into the field before the Lord has prepared them for going. Let them endure some hardships and obtain an experience in the work. Those who do not devote their whole time to labor in new fields, and carry the truth, should labor with their hands, and do what they can to supply their own necessities.",
