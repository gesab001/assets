    "word": "God gives the physicians of this institution skill and efficiency because they are serving Him. They know that their skill is not their own, that it comes from above. They realize that there is beside them a divine Watcher, who gives wisdom to his physicians, enabling them to move intelligently in their work. It was by His order that this sanitarium was established here. We are so thankful that there is a place where medical missionary work may be carried on under the supervision of the great Medical Missionary.",
