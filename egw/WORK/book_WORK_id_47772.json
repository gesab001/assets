    "word": "\"The prayer of Christ is not yet answered. There is a work to be done that still remains undone. Although proclaiming the gospel message, yet ministers and lay-members are envious, full of strife, destitute of the love that should be in their hearts. Those who claim to be Christians but who reveal the characteristics of worldlings, are dishonoring the name of Jesus. Will you consider the representation that you are making before unbelievers? Will you seek for the blessing of the Holy Spirit, that you may answer the prayer of Christ? Would it not be well for you to pray that you shall not disappoint the Lord Jesus by failing to be His instrumentalities? When in word and deed you answer His prayer, putting away all variance, His Spirit \n\n\n                                    -97- \n\nwill bear witness that you are His instrumentalities, and the world will take knowledge of you, that you have been with Jesus and have learned of Him.",
