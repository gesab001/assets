    "word": "The command is \"Come out from among them, . . . and I will receive you, . . . and ye shall be My sons and daughters\" [2 Corinthians 6:17, 18]. What greater honor could be conferred upon mortal man? This life is filled with anguish and sorrow, but the promise is eternal life, a life without sorrow. This is a precious boon, and how earnest we should be to enter heaven! God has given us a moral standard, and we need not make any mistake, for the rule is laid down, and it is here that we must fit up for eternal life. And it is only through obedience that we obtain it. But we have this to encourage us, that Jesus knows our weakness and He will assist us to gain heaven, and we must believe the truth and remember that we are taken into the workshop to be fitted to join the heavenly family and to connect with the heavenly choir. Then let all sin be put away, and let us bring heaven into our lives. If we \n\n\n                                    -262- \n\nlet Christ rule in our hearts we shall have heaven below, and thus be fitted up for a heaven above.",
