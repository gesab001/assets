    "word": "We shall not withdraw our interest from Battle Creek, but cannot trust our life and happiness in your hands. God does not require it of us. He has called us and commissioned us to do an important work. This work must be done where it will be appreciated and our time not thrown away. It must tell. May God help us to work in humility, trusting in Him to give the increase. In love, Ellen G. White.--Letter 3, 1869, pp. 1-8. (To Brethren Uriah Smith and George Amadon, April 23, 1869.)",
