    "word": "Before man can belong to the kingdom of Christ, his character must be purified from sin and sanctified by the grace of Christ. . . . Christ longs to manifest His grace, and stamp His character and image upon the whole world. He was offered the kingdoms of this world by the one who revolted in heaven, to buy His homage to the principles of evil; but He came to establish a kingdom of righteousness, and He would not be bought; He would not abandon His purpose. This earth is His purchased inheritance, and He would have men free and pure and holy. . . . Though Satan works through human instrumentalities to hinder the purpose of Christ, there are triumphs yet to be accomplished through the blood shed for the world, that will bring glory to God and to the Lamb. His kingdom will extend, and embrace the whole world. . . . Christ will not be satisfied till victory is complete. But \"he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.\" \"So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun\" (Isaiah 53:11; 59:19).",
