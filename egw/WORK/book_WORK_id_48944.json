    "word": "Do not try to work. Ride out in the Harper carriage with Sister Peck or with Sister Nelson. The rides would do both you and Sister Peck good. Keep in the open air as much as possible. Do not worry. When the book is finished, we shall thank the Lord. But I have thought that perhaps it might be delayed in His providence. I shall not fret, nor hurry you. Take everything as easy as possible.--Letter 275, 1904, p. 2. (To Marian Davis, August 7, 1904.)",
