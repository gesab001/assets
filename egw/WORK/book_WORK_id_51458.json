    "word": "When anyone comes to a minister or to men in positions of trust with complaints about a brother or sister, let them ask the reporter, \"Have you complied with the rules our Saviour has given?\" and if he has failed to carry out any particular of this instruction, do not listen to a word of his complaint. Refuse to take up a report against your brother or sister in the faith. If members of the church go entirely contrary to these rules, they make themselves subject of church discipline, and should be put under the censure of \n\n\n                                  -194- \n\nthe church. This matter, so plainly taught in the lessons of Christ, has been passed over with strange indifference. The church has either neglected her work entirely, or has done it with harshness and severity, wounding and bruising souls. Measures should be taken to correct this cruel spirit of criticism, of judging one another's motives, as though Christ had revealed to man the hearts of their brethren. The neglect of doing aright, with wisdom and grace, the work that ought to have been done, has left churches and institutions weak, inefficient, and almost Christless.",
