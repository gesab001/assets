    "word": "The Privilege of Ministry \n\n     To the workers in our sanitariums I am instructed to say, Truth must be wisely, kindly, tenderly presented. In the fourteenth chapter of John there are precious lessons, valuable instruction, which should be appreciated by every child of God who desires to minister to others the comfort and grace of God. Let these lessons be impressed upon the mind; over and over again let them be repeated.",
