    "word": "Now the churches have a stumblingblock placed before their feet not easily removed, and if the ones who have been engaged in this do not see and realize where they have grieved the Spirit of God and make confession of their wrongs, darkness will surely gather more densely about their souls. They will be blinded and call light darkness and darkness light, truth error and error truth, and they will not discern the light when it shall come, and will fight against it. In regard to the testimonies, God has given them all the light they will ever have. That light they have cast aside as unworthy of their respect. The state of the churches is thus: Should reproof come to those who are wrong, they will quote the leaders who do not receive the testimonies. And while no temptation comes because no reproof is given to them, they have little confidence in the men who have stood out in opposition to that which they believe to be the truth. So if these men say and do these things right in principle, it does not have any special weight with some. Thus the enemy's work has done that which \n                                                                           705\nhas made the work of God of but little account. Now when they shall see this and confess their mistake, then the Lord can heal the wounds made, and their defeat may be turned into victory. But while they stand as they do, God's work is not appreciated and confusion and want of unity is the result.",
