    "word": "Brethren and sisters, you who tarry by the stuff at home, there is something for you to do. The work of saving souls is not to be done by the ministers alone. Every one who has been converted will seek to bring others  to a knowledge of the truth. Commence to work for those in your own homes and neighborhoods. Labor with wisdom and earnestness, with perseverance and much prayer, that they may be brought to accept the light of truth. You can also send up your petitions for the laborers in the different fields. God will  hear your prayers, and will make them like sharp sickles in the harvest field.",
