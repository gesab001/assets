    "word": "I know the danger of those who refuse to walk in the light as God gives it. They bring upon themselves the terrible crisis of being left to follow their own ways, to do after their own judgment. The conscience becomes less and less impressible. The voice of God seems to become more and more distant, and the wrongdoer is left to his own infatuation. In stubbornness he resists every appeal, despises all counsel and advice, and turns from every provision made for his salvation. . . . The Spirit of God no longer exerts a restraining power over him, and the sentence is passed, \"He is joined to idols; let him alone\" (see Hosea 4:17). . . . This is the process through which the soul passes that rejects the working of the Holy Spirit. . . .",
