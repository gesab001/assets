    "word": "Thus we often find it, even in the religious world. God's expressed commands are transgressed; and \"because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.\" Ecclesiastes 8:11. In the face of the most positive commands of God, men and women will follow their own inclinations, and then dare to pray over the matter, to prevail upon God to allow them to go contrary to His expressed will. Satan comes to the side of such persons, as he did to Eve in Eden, and impresses them. They have an exercise of mind, and this they relate as a most wonderful experience which the Lord has given them. But true experience will be in harmony with natural and divine law; false experience arrays itself against the laws of life and the precepts of Jehovah.",
