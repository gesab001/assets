    "word": "It is impossible to describe the feelings I have for this people. Oh that every one present would kindle his taper from the divine altar! If Christ has given you light, let it shine to others. \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Will you not begin from this time to work upon the Bible plan, and live to do your neighbor good, to be a blessing to those around you? Do not make one crooked path for your feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way.",
