    "word": "Those who will gratify their appetite, and then suffer because of their intemperance, and take drugs \n\n186 \n\nto relieve them, may be assured that God will not interpose to save health and life which is so recklessly periled. The cause has produced the effect. Many, as their last resort, follow the directions in the word of God, and request the prayers of the elders of the church for their restoration of health. God does not see fit to answer prayers offered in behalf of such, for He knows that if they should be restored to health, they would again sacrifice it upon the altar of unhealthy appetite.  {TSDF 185.10}  \n                                                       1 T.--560-561 \n     The health reform is a branch of the special work of God for the benefit of His people. . . .",
