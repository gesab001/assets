    "word": "But the infinite sacrifice of God in giving Jesus, His beloved Son, to become a sacrifice for sin, enables Him to say, without violating one principle of His government: \"Yield yourself up to Me; give Me that will; take it from the control of Satan, and I will take possession of it; then I can work in you to will and to do of My good pleasure.\" When He gives you the mind of Christ, your will becomes as His will, and your character is transformed to be like Christ's character.--5T 515 (1889).",
