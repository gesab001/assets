    "word": "Unreserved Consecration--Some time ago I wrote in my diary the following: \"We seemed to be assembled in a meeting. One of authority was present. He said: 'Say to ministers and evangelists, Carry the work forward with true spirituality. Make the application that is made in the Word of God, that the result may not be merely a sympathetic stirring of the feelings--a result that will fade away into nothingness when the impression is \n                                                                           342\nremoved.' I am commissioned to say that all who see their need can be helped. Let every step taken be a step of advancement toward genuine conversion, toward unreserved consecration of heart, mind, soul, and strength to the service of the Lord. Let all that is done tend to genuine reformation in thought, in word, in deed, in character-building. Let the true be discerned from the false. Do not allow the enemy to lead you to weave wrong figures into the pattern. Keep the love of Christ prominent before the children and youth. Repeat to them often His simple lessons.\"--Lt 111, 1904.",
