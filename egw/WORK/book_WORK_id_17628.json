    "word": "Need for Purity in Thought and Action.--I urge upon you the necessity of purity in every thought, in every word, in every action. We have an individual accountability to God, an individual work which no one can do for us. It is to make the world better by precept, personal effort, and example. While we should cultivate sociability, let it not be merely for amusement but for a purpose. There are souls to save.--RH, Nov 10, 1885. (Ev 495.) \n\n290",
