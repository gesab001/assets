    "word": "What is the matter? The truth we advocate is not popular; it is unpopular and ever will be, because the Sabbath truth ever involves a cross. There are enough men who are willing to preach, but they are unwilling to be laborers; they shun the working part. They are not willing to visit by the fireside, to take the Bible and try to teach its sacred doctrines in the family, to carry the burden of souls upon them, to weep between the porch and the altar, crying, \"Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach\" (Joel 2:17). They are not willing to feel an interest for those who listen to their discourses, to become acquainted with the individual member of families, to put forth personal efforts for them, to pray for them and with them, to show the youth that they have a deep love for their souls, to lead them kindly, tenderly, lovingly, to the fold of Christ.",
