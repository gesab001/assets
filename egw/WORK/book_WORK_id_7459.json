    "word": "I would be pleased to have May's clothing prepared, that she may go anywhere that it shall be necessary to learn a trade or go to St. Helena in time. I want her to be fitted with good clothing. She needs a good sack [short jacket] of some kind made. There is that beaver sack in the trunk. May can have a cloak from that. Again, I give positive orders that it shall be made roomy and not so tight that she cannot get it on or off without tugging and pulling. Now, if this girl at Brother Leinenger's can sew, May can do the work and get her sewing done. . . .",
