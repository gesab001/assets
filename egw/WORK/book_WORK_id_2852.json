    "word": "The message of Christ's soon coming is to be given to all the nations of the earth. Vigilant, untiring effort is required to overcome the forces of the enemy. Our part is not to sit still and weep and wring our hands, but to arise and work for time and for eternity.--Southern Watchman, May 29, 1902. \n     \"Do something, do it soon, with all thy might; \n      An angel's wing would droop if long at rest; \n      And God Himself, inactive, were no longer blest.\" \n                     --Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 308.",
