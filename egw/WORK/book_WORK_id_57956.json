    "word": "The professed Christian world is under Satan's sway. Christ calls the prince of this kingdom Satan, Beelzebub, a liar, a murderer from the beginning, the wicked and evil one who is constantly working with the unholy and disobedient to trample upon the laws of Jehovah. Satan acquired the supremacy as a legislator in guilt to compel by decree the transgression of God's law, and the professed Christian world come under his banner fully choosing his service and shall do after the works of the fallen foe. The rebellious chieftain signalized himself as having authority to establish laws entirely contrary to the laws of Jehovah, the living and only true God, the supreme Ruler in heaven and in earth. When this deceiving power is accepted in the place of light plainly given in God's word, Satan stands as their ruler. The daring leader in rebellion is given by human agencies the pre-eminence above God, and the prince of darkness \n                                                                           1200\nis acknowledged as their supreme authority. The number of his angels we cannot conjecture, but his field is the world and he multiplies himself through his agencies over his whole field, the world, concurring in and actively instigating the clergy to be his efficient workers in making of none effect the law of God, of tearing down His memorial the insignia of His honour and His supremacy. There is no lack of satanic agencies.",
