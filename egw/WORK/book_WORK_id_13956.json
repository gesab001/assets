    "word": "The roads along the Rhine are as near perfect as it is possible to make them. And well they may be; for workmen have been constantly employed in building and improving them for nearly two thousand years. In many places they have been walled up on the side toward the river, the rock cut away on the land side, valleys filled up, hillsides terraced, and chasms bridged over, so that though passing through a very mountainous region, they are almost as level as a railroad.",
