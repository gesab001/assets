    "word": "Human beings are Christ's property--the purchase of His blood. By creation and redemption they belong to Him; therefore He claims their undivided service. But many are unsanctified, unwilling to submit to God, cherish evil hereditary and cultivated traits of character. So much of self and so little of Christ is cherished in the heart, that they do the will and works of the arch-deceiver. They are not laborers together with God. They need to be converted. Those who would be teachers need first to learn to do the will of God.",
