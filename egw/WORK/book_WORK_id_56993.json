    "word": "I ask you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth to arise and shine, for thy light has come. We do not want the work bound about. As you see men and women who have some ability, encourage them. God doesn't want novices to do His work. He doesn't want His work crippled. He wants you to place yourself where you may have a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.",
