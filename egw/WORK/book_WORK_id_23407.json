    "word": "Not to Unite With the World \n\n     There is to be no compromise with those who make void the law of God. It is not safe to rely upon them as counselors. Our testimony is not to be less decided now than formerly; our real position is not to be cloaked in order to please the world's great men. They may desire us to unite with them and accept their plans, and may make  propositions in regard to our course of action which may give the enemy an advantage over us. \"Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A  confederacy\" (Isaiah 8:12). While we should not seek for controversy, and should not needlessly offend, we must  present the truth clearly and decidedly, and stand firm to what God has taught us in His Word. You are not to look to the world in order to learn what you shall write and publish or what you shall speak. Let all your words and works testify, \"We have not followed cunningly devised fables\" (2 Peter 1:16). \"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place\" (2 Peter 1:19).",
