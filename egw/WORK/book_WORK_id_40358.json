    "word": "Sow the seeds of truth wherever you have opportunity. In establishing the work in new places, economize in every possible way. Gather up the fragments; let nothing be lost. The work of soul-saving must be carried on in the way that Christ has marked out. He declares, \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Only by obeying this word can we be His disciples. We are striving for a kingdom and a crown. We shall obtain both by wearing Christ's yoke and learning of Him. \"Follow My example,\" He says. \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; . . . and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\"",
