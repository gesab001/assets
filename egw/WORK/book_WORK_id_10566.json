    "word": "The practice of furnishing a few persons with every advantage of perfecting their education in so many lines that it would be impossible for them to make use of all of them, is an injury rather than a benefit to the one who has so many advantages, besides depriving others of the privileges they need so much. If there were far less of this long continued preparation, far less exclusive devotion to study only, there would be much more opportunity for an increase of the student's faith in God.

God's commandment-loving people are to testify to the world of their faith by their works.",
