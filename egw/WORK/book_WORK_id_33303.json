    "word": "A keen, sharp intellect may be an advantage, but the power of the educator is in his heart \n18\nconnection with the Light and Life of the world. He will love humanity and ever seek to bring it to a higher level. He will not always be blaming others, but his heart will be filled with pity. He will not be great in his own estimation, neither will he seek constantly to bolster up and strengthen his own dignity; but the humility of Jesus will be personified in his life. He will feel the truth of the words of Christ, \u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d Such teachers as these are greatly needed. God will work with them. \u201cLearn of Me,\u201d says Christ; \u201cfor I am meek and lowly of heart.\u201d Many who are engaged in the Sabbath-school work need divine enlightenment. They lack spiritual insight to enable them to apprehend the wants of those for whom they are laboring.",
