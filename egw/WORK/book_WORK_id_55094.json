    "word": "Friday, April 28, 1876, Oakland, California, Ellen White to James White \n\n\n     Dear Husband: I have written fifteen pages today. Mary Clough is hard after me. She has copied fifteen pages today--a good, large day's work. As soon as dinner is eaten, I go to Mary's room and she reads me what she has written while I lie on the sofa and rest. Then again at night I go to her room and she reads the rest. She delights in it all as much as myself. Mary is trying her utmost to get these books out. We have so quiet a time. Never have I had such an opportunity in my life before. I will improve it. We have written about 200 pages since you left, all copied, ready for printers. . . .",
