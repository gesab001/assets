    "word": "The Lord sees the work that must be done in his vineyard. He sees the places in which there should be memorials for him, in order that the truth may be represented. He sees the fields that are unworked and destitute of facilities. He requires from all who serve him equity and just judgment. A large amount of means should not be absorbed in one place. Every building erected is to be erected with reference to the other places that will need similar buildings. It will not be pleasing to God for you to bind about the work of establishing small sanitariums. In many places sanitariums are to be established. These sanitariums are not to be large. In a mammoth institution, such as the Battle Creek Sanitarium has been, it is difficult to maintain the high spiritual standard that should be maintained; for it is hard to provide workers enough who have capabilities and talents that enable them to conduct the affairs of the institution in a way that is after God's order. Let many small sanitariums be built. Let treatment-rooms be established in many cities. Let hygienic restaurants be started that people may learn what health reform really is.",
