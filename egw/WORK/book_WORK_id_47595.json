    "word": "ELDER TAYLOR: NOW TAKE THE MATTER OF HISTORY. WE HAVE HISTORY IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, U. S. HISTORY. WE ARE EXPECTED TO TEACH HISTORY IN OUR CHURCH SCHOOL, BUT WE CANNOT TEACH HISTORY IN OUR SCHOOL AS THEY TEACH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. SISTER PECK, AT THE PRESENT TIME IS SIMPLY WORKING IT OUT TO CONNECT ALL THE EVENTS THAT HAVE COME INTO OUR HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, WITH THE BIBLE IN THE FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECY. SHE HELPS THE CHILDREN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES, AND THE WORKING OUT OF GOD'S PLANS, AND SHE KEEPS THEIR MINDS IN TOUCH WITH GOD ALL THE TIME. I HAVE FELT THAT IF WE COULD HAVE TIME IN OUR SCHOOLS FOR THAT, WE COULD CUT OFF OTHER STUDIES \n\n\n                                    -373- \n\nTHAT CROWD IN, AND THEN WE WOULD BEGIN TO SEE LIGHT COME IN, AND OUR CHILDREN WOULD GET HOLD OF GOD.",
