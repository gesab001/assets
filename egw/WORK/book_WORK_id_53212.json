    "word": "We should not be like the people of the Noachic world--to have our minds all engrossed in eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage. Christ is soon to come, and who is ready to meet Him? Have you felt for the young around you? Have you given your means to send the truth to the far-off heathen, and overlooked the very ones right by your door? Here are souls right around us that we might save if we would give them our help. We want to watch our opportunities to give help to souls. How many of us while gossiping might take the Bible and give a knowledge to precious souls. We must meet the record of our lives in the judgment. Christ says, \"Love one another as I have loved you.\" Do we manifest that love for souls in darkness that Christ manifested for us?

He is the propitiation for our sins.",
