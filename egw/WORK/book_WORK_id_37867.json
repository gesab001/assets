    "word": "Reward for Welfare Work.--Those who will receive the most abundant reward will be those who have mingled with their activity and zeal, gracious, tender pity for the poor, the orphan, the oppressed, and the afflicted. . . . There are about us those who have a meek and lowly spirit, the Spirit of Christ, who do many little things to help those around them, and \n                                                                           314\nwho think nothing of it; they will be astonished at last to find that Christ has noticed the kind word spoken to the disheartened, and taken account of the smallest gift given for the relief of the poor, that cost the giver some self-denial.--Review and Herald, July 3, 1894.",
