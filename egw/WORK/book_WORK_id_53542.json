    "word": "There are erratic men and women who fancy that the Lord has called them to do a great work. They seek to mix human sophistry with Bible truth, and present it as some wonderful theory. They dash about here and there, working as their fancy dictates. They do not work according to law and order but according to caprice. They are not good soldiers of a well-regulated army. He who enlists in Christ's army has no right to work as he chooses. He must obey orders, or he will work at cross-purposes with God. The Lord cannot cooperate with a man who labors in his own way, with no thought of what effect his way of working will have on the general good of the cause. If one rushes here and there, following out plans of his own, and refusing to obey directions, what can be expected but confusion and entanglement.",
