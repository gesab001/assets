    "word": "Experienced Workers Not Boys and Girls.--Ministerial labor cannot and should not be entrusted to boys, neither should the work of giving Bible readings be entrusted to inexperienced girls, because they offer their services and are willing to take responsible positions, but who are wanting in religious experience, without a thorough education and training. They must be proved to see if they will bear the test; and unless there is developed as firm, conscientious principle to be all that God would have them to be, they will not correctly represent our cause and work for this time.",
