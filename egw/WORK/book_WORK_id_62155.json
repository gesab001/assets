    "word": "The Lord has instructed me that those who are now carrying on work among the colored people cannot remain in the field in a bare-handed condition, and do the work that is required. It will be necessary for them to receive help. The Lord has been calling upon His people in the stronger conferences of the North, the East, and the West to sustain the Huntsville School by liberal gifts. We pray that He will put it into their hearts to respond nobly.  And the smaller mission schools must also be sustained. In past years this line of work has been approved and blessed of heaven, and it must now be developed and strengthened. Means must be raised for establishing the medical missionary work also, and for training and supporting ministers and house-to-house workers.",
