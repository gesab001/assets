    "word": "The potter takes the clay in his hands, and molds and fashions it according to his own will. He kneads it and works it, and then tears it apart, and then presses it together. He wets it, and then dries it. He lets it lie for a while without touching it. When it is perfectly pliable, he continues the work of making from it a vessel. He forms it into shape, and on the wheel trims and polishes it. He dries it in the sun, and bakes it in the oven, thus it becomes a vessel unto honor, fit for his use. So the great Master desires to mold and fashion us, and as the clay is in the hands of the potter, so we are to be made in His hands. We are not to try to do the work of the potter. Our part is to yield ourselves to the molding of the Master-worker.",
