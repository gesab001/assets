    "word": "I have been engaged in missionary work in this new field for about six years. I did not come here from choice. I did not want to come; for I saw an abundance to do in America. But the Conference decided that I had better come, and the people here were very anxious that I should come; so I am here, to do the Lord's work in lifting the standard of truth in new localities. He has greatly blessed me in this work, and wherever I go, I have a message for the people.",
