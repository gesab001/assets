    "word": "To Avoid Worldly Entanglements \n\n     Especially should the minister keep himself from every worldly entanglement, and bind himself to the Source of all power, that he may represent correctly what it means to be a Christian. He should cut loose from everything that would in any way divert his mind from God and the great work for this time. Christ expects him, as His employed servant, to be like Himself in mind, in thought, in word, in action. He expects every man who opens the Scriptures to others, to work carefully and intelligently, not exercising his powers unwisely, in a way to injure or overtask them, \n                                                                           240\nbut so that he may be fitted to do good work for the Lord.--5T 530, 531.",
