Burden \n\nDear Brother: \n\n\n     I wish to express to you some thoughts that should be kept before the sanitarium workers. That which will make them a power for good is the knowledge that the great Medical Missionary has chosen them to this work, that He is their chief instructor, and that it is ever their duty to recognize Him as their Teacher.",
