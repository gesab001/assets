    "word": "My attention has been called to your articles in our papers in reference to the Women's Christian Temperance Union. In the work of temperance, all church members are supposed to stand upon the platform of union. . . . You \n                                                                           124\nare building up barricades that should not be made to appear. After reading your articles, will those who know not what our faith is feel inclined to make an attempt to unite with us? The tone of your articles savors of Pharisaism. The man who expects to enlighten a deceived people must come near them and labor for them in love. He must become a center of holy influences. One concession made on their part would prepare the way after patient enlightenment for a second concession. . . .",
