    "word": "Brethren and sisters, what are you doing to prepare yourselves for a home in glory? Do you realize that to everyone is given his work? God has not given all the same work. Some have a greater number of talents than others. Those who have five talents should faithfully trade upon them. To those who have two talents the Lord says, \u201cTrade upon your talents, using and improving them to My glory.\u201d We are to use our talents according to our several abilities.",
