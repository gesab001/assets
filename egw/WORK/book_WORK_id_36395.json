    "word": "The soul that lives by faith in Christ desires no other nor greater good than to know and to do the will of God. It is God\u2019s will that faith in Christ shall be made perfect by works; He connects the salvation and eternal life of those who believe with these works, and through them provides for the light of truth to go to all countries and peoples. This is the fruit of the working of God\u2019s Spirit.",
