    "word": "Instead of speaking harsh words, of making unfeeling remarks concerning those who are struggling against temptations, and who are not favorably situated for the formation of a symmetrical character, speak words inspired by the Holy Spirit, that are so full of Christian sympathy that the hardest heart will be touched by their kindness. The most persuasive eloquence is the word that is spoken in love and sympathy. Such a word will bring light to confused minds, will bring hope to the discouraged, and will lighten the dark prospect before them. You will meet just such cases in the church and out of the church. Make a covenant with God that you no more will indulge in a carnal, selfish ambition, but that you will work to reveal the fact that you love and serve Christ in meekness and lowliness of heart. Make determined, urgent efforts to save the erring and the perishing. Reveal the holiness of the cause and work in which you are engaged, so that you may not manifest the spirit of the enemy.",
