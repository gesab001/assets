    "word": "Solid Ability Called For--Those who are entrusted with the management of the more important districts should have solid ability.  They should be men who are able to carry responsibilities.  It would be wisdom for several men to take this work.  One man should not be left to oversee the important but neglected fields.  With the testimonies before them, our ministers have passed by on the other side, to seek more favorable places, where churches have been raised up.  Slothful work has been done.--Manuscript 34, 1901, p. 3 (April 20, 1901, \"Our Aged Workers\").",
