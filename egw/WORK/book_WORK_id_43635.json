    "word": "The church in Battle Creek should not feel at liberty to visit the Office and engage in common topics of conversation. Matters are freely introduced by members of the church, who visit the Office, which have no right to be brought into the Office. In doing this they are robbing the cause of God of the time of the workmen, diverting their interest from the work, and bringing in a worldly spirit which should have no place in the Office. Members of the church should time their visits, and call upon those who labor in the Office when they are at their own homes. I saw that God had been displeased with the lax way these things have been managed.",
