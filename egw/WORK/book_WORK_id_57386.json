    "word": "O the breadth and height and depth of the love of God! Who of finite beings can comprehend it? He would do a work, a great work, that in the fulness of the offering he would leave no possible excuse for man to be apprehensive that his guilt is too great for the offering to ransom him. God claims the whole of the affections of man, the whole heart, the whole soul, the whole mind, the whole strength. He lays claim to all that there is of man, because he has poured out the whole treasure of heaven by giving us his all at once, reserving back nothing greater that heaven can do.",
