    "word": "But while the truth of God is carried by young and inexperienced men whose hearts are scarcely touched by the grace of God, the cause will \n140\nlanguish. . . . Men who dare to assume the responsibilities of receiving the word from the mouth of God and giving it to the people, make themselves accountable for the truth they present and the influence they exert. If they are truly men of God, their hope is not in themselves, but in what he will do for them and through them. They do not go forth self-inflated, calling the attention of the people to their smartness and aptness; they feel their responsibility, and work with spiritual energy, treading in the path of self-denial which the Master trod. Self-sacrifice is seen at every step, and they mourn because of their inability to do more in the cause of God. Their path is one of trial and conflict; but it is marked by the foot-prints of their Redeemer, the Captain of their salvation, who was made perfect through suffering.",
