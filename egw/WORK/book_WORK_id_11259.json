    "word": "Some have no experience in taking hold of the work as though it was of vital importance. They do not enter upon it with zeal and earnestness which would show they are doing work that will have to bear the test of the Judgment. They work too much in their own strength, They do not make God their trust, and therefore errors and imperfections mark all their efforts. They do not give the Lord an opportunity to do anything for them. They do not walk by faith, but by sight. They will go no faster or farther than they can see. They do not seem to understand that venturing something for the truth's sake has any part in their religious experience.",
