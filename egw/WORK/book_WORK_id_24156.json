    "word": "Chapter 26 \n\n     16-21 (2 Kings 15:5). Success Must Not Lift One Up.--[2 Chronicles 26:16-21 quoted.] The case of Uzziah the king reveals how God will punish the sin of presumption.... The Lord has ordained men to certain positions in His church, and He would not have them step out of the places to which He has appointed them. When the Lord gives them a measure of success, they are not to become lifted up, and think themselves qualified to do a work for which they are not fitted, and to which God has not called them (RH Aug. 14, 1900).",
