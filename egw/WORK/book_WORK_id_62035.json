    "word": "You yourself have not been able to discern clearly the right and justice, the tenderness and mercy and strict integrity, which should have been maintained in all your decisions. These matters have several times been presented before me, and I dare not withhold them. You might better have done far less preaching, and reserved your energies to take your stand personally against the wrong in spirit, in mind, in judgment, that has struggled for the mastery, and in a large degree obtained it, leading to a wrong course of action. Had you thus taken your stand, your discernment would have been a sharper, and you would have been able to give your decision against the slightest act of injustice toward God's heritage. Those who are working contrary to the will of God, and misrepresenting his character, would have been given to understand distinctly that you could not permit these things to go on; you could not let them pass in heaven as your action. It was your duty to speak decidedly, but you kept silent.",
