    "word": "\"IT IS BY THE CANON OF PTOLEMY THAT THE GREAT PROPHETICAL PERIOD OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS IS FIXED. THIS CANON PLACES THE SEVENTH YEAR OF ARTAXERXES IN THE YEAR B. C. 457; AND THE ACCURACY OF THE CANON IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE CONCURRENT AGREEMENT OF MORE THAN TWENTY ECLIPSES. THE SEVENTY WEEKS DATE FROM THE GOING FORTH OF A DECREE RESPECTING THE RESTORATION OF JERUSALEM. THERE WERE NO DECREES BETWEEN THE SEVENTH AND TWENTIETH YEARS OF ARTAXERXES. FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY YEARS, BEGINNING WITH THE SEVENTH, MUST COMMENCE IN B. C. 457, AND END IN A. D. 34. COMMENCING IN THE TWENTIETH, THEY MUST COMMENCE IN B. C. 444, AND END IN A. D. 47. AS NO EVENT OCCURRED IN A. D. 47 TO MARK THEIR TERMINATION, WE CANNOT RECKON FROM THE TWENTIETH; WE MUST THEREFORE LOOK TO THE SEVENTH OF ARTAXERXES. THIS DATE WE CANNOT CHANGE FROM B. C. 457 WITHOUT FIRST DEMONSTRATING THE INACCURACY OF PTOLEMY'S CANON. TO DO THIS, IT WOULD BE \n                                                                           495\nNECESSARY TO SHOW THAT THE LARGE NUMBER OF ECLIPSES BY WHICH ITS ACCURACY HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED, HAVE NOT BEEN CORRECTLY COMPUTED; AND SUCH A RESULT WOULD UNSETTLE EVERY CHRONOLOGICAL DATE, AND LEAVE THE SETTLEMENT OF EPOCHS AND THE ADJUSTMENT OF ERAS ENTIRELY AT THE MERCY OF EVERY DREAMER, SO THAT CHRONOLOGY WOULD BE OF NO MORE VALUE THAN MERE GUESS-WORK. AS THE SEVENTY WEEKS MUST TERMINATE IN A. D. 34, UNLESS THE SEVENTH OF ARTAXERXES IS WRONGLY FIXED, AND AS THAT CANNOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT SOME EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT, WE INQUIRE, WHAT EVIDENCE MARKED THAT TERMINATION? THE TIME WHEN THE APOSTLES TURNED TO THE GENTILES HARMONIZES WITH THAT DATE BETTER THAN ANY OTHER WHICH HAS BEEN NAMED. AND THE CRUCIFIXION, IN A. D. 31, IN THE MIDST OF THE LAST WEEK, IS SUSTAINED BY A MASS OF TESTIMONY WHICH CANNOT BE EASILY INVALIDATED.\"",
