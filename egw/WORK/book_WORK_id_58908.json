    "word": "The head physician in any institution holds a difficult position and he should keep himself free from minor responsibilities: for these will give him no time to rest. He should have sufficient help: for he has trying work to perform. He must bow in prayer with the suffering ones, and lead his patients to the great Physician. If as a humble suppliant he seeks God for wisdom to deal with each case, his strength and influence will be greatly increased.",
