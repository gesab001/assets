    "word": "I write this because I want you to preserve your life and your influence, and I want the cause of God to have the very best kind of service we can any of us give it.

In these important efforts it is best that as strong a force as possible should be connected with the work. No one's freedom is to be limited, no one is to be ignored, no one is to bear universal sway; but you are to counsel together and pray together and realize that if left to the strength and wisdom of any one of you, you will surely fail.",
