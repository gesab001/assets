When the present truth was first published, he had to put forth double energy and labor with but little encouragement; and from the first he has taken burdens upon him that were too much for his strength. The burdens were not equally borne. While he took much responsibility, some were not willing to take any, and those who shunned taking responsibilities and burdens did not realize his burdens, and were not as interested in the cause as they should have been. There was a lack. James felt it and laid his shoulder under burdens that were too heavy. I saw by these extra efforts more souls would be saved, but it is these efforts that have undermined his constitution and taken away his strength. Regardless of his own interest and health, he has labored with interest for others, and it has not been appreciated. His reward from many has been dissatisfaction, evil surmising and jealousy. Those who should have helped him bear the burdens were a burden themselves by their unwise course. By care and incessant labor and overwhelming anxiety has the work gone on, until now the present truth is clear, its evidence by the candid undoubted, and it is easy work now to carry on the paper to what it was a few years ago. The truth is now made so plain, that all can see it and embrace it if they will. But it needed much labor to get it out clear \n                                                                           35\nas it is, and such hard labor will never have to be performed again to make the truth clear. \n                              E.
