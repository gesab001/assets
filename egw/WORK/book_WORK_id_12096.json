    "word": "It is not by the might or power of the human agent that truth is to be impressed upon minds, \"but \n                                                                           252\nby My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\" [Zechariah 4:6.] It is not the temperament or the eloquence of the one who preaches the word that makes his work successful. Paul may plant and Apollos water, but God gives the increase. It is a minister's familiarity with God's word and his submission to the divine will, that give success to his efforts.",
