    "word": "When men allow property to get too strong a hold on the mind, it is a snare. When one uses the property lent him in trust to gratify any passion, it becomes a snare, for it fosters pride and leads its possessor into extravagance in its outlay, and his soul is imperiled, serving lust. To serve God with the heart and mind and affection, we must work for His name's glory, and use His entrusted gifts as one who must give an account to God as to how he has used his Lord's goods.",
