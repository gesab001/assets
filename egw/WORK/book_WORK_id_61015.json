    "word": "Chap. 43 - How to Open Closed Doors\n\nBy Ellen G. White\n\n     During the night season I was speaking in a large congregation. We have been instructed by the Lord that the medical missionary work is to be to the work of the third angel's message as the right hand to the body. The right hand is used to open doors through which the body may find entrance. This is the part the medical missionary work is to act. It is to largely prepare the way for the reception of the truth for this time. A body without hands is useless. In giving honor to the body, honor must also be given to the helping hands, which are agencies of such importance that without them the body can do nothing. Therefore the body which treats indifferently the right hand, refusing its aid, is able to accomplish nothing.",
