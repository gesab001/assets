    "word": "In the place of those who have not been brought over the ground, who have not had an individual experience, when it was a positive necessity to know the truth as it was unfolding before them, in the place of these--tearing to pieces the building which has been erected on the interpretation of the prophets--let them in all meekness fall into line and work in harmony with those whose voices are now silent in death, and with the workers who are still living. Fall into line. Obey the orders of the Captain of your salvation, and bear witness of the light which the Lord has flashed upon the world in the message for these last days. Keep in step with your Leader.",
