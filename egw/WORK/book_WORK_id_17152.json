    "word": "Limitless Possibilities for Good \n\n     In doing this work for yourself you are having an influence on many others with whom you associate. \n                                                                           125\nWords spoken in season, how good are they! How much strength a word of hope, courage, and determination in a right course will give one who is inclined to slide into habits that are demoralizing! The firm purpose you may possess in carrying out good principles will have an influence to balance souls in the right direction.",
