    "word": "Overeating. \n     685. Nearly all the members of the human family eat more than the system requires. This excess decays, and becomes a putrid mass. . . . If more food, even of a simple quality, is placed in the stomach than the living machinery requires, this surplus becomes a burden. The system makes desperate efforts to dispose of it, and this extra work causes a tired feeling. Some who are continually eating call this \"all gone\" feeling hunger, but it is caused by the overworked condition of the abused digestive organs.--U. T., Aug. 30, 1896.",
