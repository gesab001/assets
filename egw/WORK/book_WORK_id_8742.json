    "word": "Where One Weak, Another Strong.--The Lord moves upon ministers who have varied capabilities, that they may feed the flock of His heritage with food convenient for them. They will reveal truth on points that their brother laborer did not regard as essential. Were the work of ministering to the flock left entirely to one man, there would be deficiency in the results. In His providence the Lord sends various workmen. One is strong on some essential point where another is weak.--Manuscript 21, 1894.",
