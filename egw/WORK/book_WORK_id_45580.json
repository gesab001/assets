    "word": "I restrain the deep feelings of my soul, knowing that you have difficulties to meet, prejudices and customs to overcome; but I plead for the souls for whom Christ has died. You are not to labor as though by your human efforts alone you must carry forward the work. Go forward, knowing that as you press forward by faith, the obstacles will be removed. Brethren in England, you have not asked enough; you have moved too slowly. Work as in the fear of God, praying and working, and constantly depending upon God.",
