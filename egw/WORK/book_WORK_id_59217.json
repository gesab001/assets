    "word": "He who is unjust in small matters will be unjust in matters concerning his eternal interest. Those who will rob their fellow men will rob God. The Lord gives men talents that they may benefit and bless their fellow men. He has made men his stewards in trust, that they may relieve the temporal and spiritual necessities of those for whom Christ had died. Those who faithfully do this work labor in Christ's stead.",
