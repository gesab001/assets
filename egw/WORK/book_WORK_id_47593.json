    "word": "SISTER PECK: NO, I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANY PROPOSITIONS TO MAKE. I BELIEVE OUR SCHOOL BOARD HERE IS SOLID ON THE IDEA OF DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO WORK OUT THIS EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM, NOT SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF THIS SCHOOL HERE, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL WORK IN GENERAL. I AM SURE THAT WE ALL APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING YOU WITH US AND HELPING US ALONG THIS LINE. I KNOW THAT WHAT WE HAVE GOTTEN THIS MORNING WILL REALLY BE A GREAT HELP TO US IN WORKING OUT THIS PROBLEM AND PLANNING FOR THE SCHOOL AS WE OUGHT. WE HAVE TALKED OVER THESE MATTERS A GOOD DEAL IN ONE WAY AND ANOTHER, AND OF COURSE WE MEET A GOOD MANY DIFFICULTIES, TOO, AND WE SHALL EXPECT TO MEET THEM. BUT WE WILL HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES.",
