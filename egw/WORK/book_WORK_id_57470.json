    "word": "We have stood shoulder to shoulder with Elder Smith in this work while the Lord was laying the foundation principles. We had to work constantly \n                                                                           789\nagainst one-idea men, who thought correct business relations in regard to the work which had to be done were an evidence of worldly-mindedness, and the cranky ones who would present themselves as capable of bearing responsibilities, but could not be trusted to be connected with the work lest they swing it in wrong lines. Step after step has had to be taken, not after the wisdom of men but after the wisdom and instruction of One who is too wise to err and too good to do us harm. There have been so many elements that would have to be proved and tried. I thank the Lord that Elders Smith, Amadon, and Batchellor still live. They composed the members of our family in the most trying parts of our history.",
