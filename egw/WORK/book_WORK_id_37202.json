    "word": "Deeds Combined With Words--God desires that the bounties He has freely given to His children be communicated to those who do not possess so many temporal blessings. By this communication, by the utterance of kindly words, accompanied with deeds of love, those who work for God will find entrance to hearts, and win others to Christ. This part of religion we are not to forget; \"for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\" --RH Feb. 18, 1902.",
