Let every one attend to his own work, and not regard himself as appointed by the Lord to watch for something \n                                                                           84\nto criticize in the work that his brother does. If a worker sees that a fellow-laborer is in danger of doing wrong, let him go to him, and point out his danger, listening kindly and patiently to any explanation that may be offered. He dishonors the Saviour when, instead of doing this, he tells others of the mistakes that he thinks his fellow-worker is making.",
