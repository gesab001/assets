    "word": "A Twofold Service \n\n     You greatly need divine wisdom to enable you to serve in two positions of responsibility--as skillful physician, and also as a preacher of the gospel. There must be a daily conversion in order to blend successfully the work for the body and soul. I cannot tell you in detail just how this should be done, but I know that you can do an important work in the ministry of the word, in instructing the souls for whom you labor to believe in Jesus Christ.--Letter 64, 1910.",
