Evans, General Conference president and General Conference treasurer, respectively. Mrs. White took her burden for the Southern work to the highest church level in this letter.\nSeptember 23, 1907\n     I desire to say to you, my brethren, that not one penny of the means that comes in from different sources for the work in the Southern field should be diverted to the work elsewhere. If the Lord has opened the hearts of His people to give to this field that its distressing needs may be met, let it not be truthfully said that any portion of the means given was withheld from the field for which it was intended.",
