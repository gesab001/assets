    "word": "Will the Lord work a miracle to counteract the evils of a meat diet? He cannot do this, for in so doing He would dishonor His name. But in His Word He lifts the danger signal, showing plainly the evils from which He would save us, and if people prefer to risk the consequences, their course will produce the sure result. Too soon they will learn that they have brought suffering upon themselves by persisting in their own way. Their appetites craved meat; the Lord would not force them into the right way.",
