    "word": "England is the hardest field, the very hardest part of the Lord's vineyard. Prejudice is strong against anything that turns the people out of old paths into new. Success in the work must cost years of persevering labor. Something must be done in that country with means from our own people, and something will be done; but now God would have the work established in this field, Australia, which is ripe for the harvest. He would have memorials raised among His people here, in the shape of sanitariums and schools, to give to the work a character proportionate to its unspeakable importance.",
