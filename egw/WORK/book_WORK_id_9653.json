    "word": "God calls for light bearers who will fill the world with the light and peace and joy that come from Christ. God will use humble men, men who will cherish a sense of their weakness, who will not think that the work of God depends on them. Such men will remember what the service of God demands from them--the propriety of speech and action that God calls for. They will reveal that Christ dwells in the heart, imparting purity to the whole being.--Letter 197, 1902.",
