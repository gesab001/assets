    "word": "2 T.--362-365 \n     Many who have adopted the health reform have left off everything hurtful; but does it follow that because they have left off these things, they can eat just as much as they please? They sit down to the table, and instead of considering how much they should eat, they give themselves up to appetite, and eat to great excess. And the stomach has all it can do, or all it should do, the rest of that day, to worry away with the burden imposed upon it. All the food that is put into the stomach, from which the system can not derive benefit, is a burden to nature in her work. It hinders the living machine. The system is clogged, and can not successfully carry on its work. The vital organs are unnecessarily taxed, and the brain nerve-power is called to the stomach to help the digestive organs carry on their work of disposing of an amount of food which does the system no good. . . .",
