    "word": "Men who accept a position in any of our health institutions should do so with as full a realization of its responsibilities as possible. The Lord has promised to be a present help in every time of need, and there is no excuse for not doing more real missionary work at the sanitarium. Far better attention should be paid to obtaining a fitness for every duty. Workers should seek to improve, that they may do their work in the best manner possible and with fidelity, so as to meet the approval of God. Opportunities for doing good have always been far in advance of the workers, for they have failed to see and improve them, because the enemy of right doing has had a controlling power over their minds.--Health, Philanthropic, and Medical Missionary Work, pages 46, 47 (1888). \n\n\n                                              (287)",
