    "word": "With his eye upon the church, the Lord has again and again allowed matters to come to a crisis, that in their extremity his people should look alone for his help. Their prayers, their faith, together with their steadfast purpose to be true, have called for the interference of God, and then he has fulfilled his promise, \"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.\" His mighty arm has been stretched out for the deliverance of his people. God reserves his gracious interposition in their behalf till the time of their extremity; thus he makes their deliverance more marked, and their victories more glorious. When all human wisdom fails, the Lord's interference will be more clearly recognized, and he will receive the glory that is his due. Even the enemies of our faith, persecutors, will perceive that God is working for his people in turning their captivity.",
