    "word": "If through the wisdom donated by God for the benefit of His people, Dr. Kellogg has discovered something in regard to health foods, why should he feel that these productions are his own?

God will give knowledge regarding the way in which to prepare food in the best and most wholesome manner, and the Lord forbid that any of His people should make one stroke with the pen in signing a contract saying they will do this or that in regard to the sale of these foods.",
