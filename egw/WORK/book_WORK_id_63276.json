    "word": "It gave me much pleasure to see in the building where I had a room, some of the articles of furniture that had once been in my own home in Battle Creek. I saw a sofa and a chair that formerly belonged to my husband, Also some sets of furniture and other conveniences that I had given to be used where most needed. But many of these who were cared for at the meeting, dishonored God by their criticisms. They gave but little encouragement to the men who had worked almost beyond human endurance in order to make them comfortable. I was on the ground. I speak the things I know. The Lord has not pronounced the judgment, that those so forward to condemn have pronounced. He was not pleased with the spirit of accusation, and of imagining evil where no evil existed.",
