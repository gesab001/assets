    "word": "I am glad that you have a little child in the family. The home should be a heaven upon earth. Nothing should be allowed to enter to mar the happiness of the members. The little things in the home should be so adjusted that no one will be irritated. Our work in this world is to be pleasant, kind, and thoughtful. My sister, let there be no contention in your home. You must act as the peacemaker. Be careful to do nothing to irritate your husband. Let the peace of God rule in your house.",
