    "word": "A profession of Christianity is not sufficient to constitute us Christians. We must each have the character manifest by our divine Pattern. The Word of God must be the rule of our life, the director of our practices; self-denial, self-sacrifice, holiness, compassion, truth and love must be found to be the fruits of our faith in Christ. When Christianity has its place in the heart it cannot be hid; it will be seen inwrought in the soul, and will be manifest in the outworking of practical life. Unless Christianity is found in the daily life, in the manner of working, in every line of duty, we do not represent Jesus. A Christian will manifest Christianity in the market, in buying and selling, in his profession, in his occupation and life, in his unselfish course toward all his associates. But of all men to whom we would look for a manifestation of the spirit of Christ, it is entirely proper for us to look with expectation to the Christian physician. But the standard must be elevated in the medical profession; for it is very low, and principles are corrupted for the sake of gain.",
