    "word": "In the family circle and in the church we should place Christian temperance on an elevated platform. It should be a living, working element, reforming habits, dispositions, and characters. Intemperance lies at the foundation of all the evil in our world. We are altogether too silent upon the subject of Christian temperance. We fail to urge this subject upon Christian parents. Fathers and mothers should be invited, in the fear of the Lord, not only to abstain from all intoxicating beverages, but from tea, coffee, and flesh meat.",
