    "word": "God calls for a change in these matters. My mind has been frequently drawn to this subject, but I have disliked to speak of the situation as it is. But I must tell you that there must be a thorough reformation, a readjustment of our health food work. God has not called our people to provide food to feed worldlings who have no disposition to study the truth. He desires us to feed them with the food that is to be found in the word of God. He will give you words to speak, that souls may be saved unto eternal life. Christ said, \"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life.\" (John 6:54.) But unless you lead others to partake of Christ's flesh and blood, of what benefit, I ask, is your work to the cause of God? You are spending your time for that which profiteth nothing. Every hour that we have in this life should be devoted to the work of enlightening the minds of those who know not the truth.",
