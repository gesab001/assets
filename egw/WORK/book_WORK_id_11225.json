    "word": "God will not place his benediction upon those who are negligent, selfish, and ease-loving, who will not lift burdens in his cause. The \u201cWell done\u201d will be pronounced upon those only who have done well. Every man is to be rewarded \u201caccording as his work shall be.\u201d [Revelation 22:12.] We want an active ministry,\u2014men of prayer, who will wrestle with God as did Jacob, saying, \u201cI will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\u201d [Genesis 32:26.] If we obtain the victor's crown, we must stretch every nerve, and exercise every power. We can never be saved in inactivity. To be an idler in the Lord's vineyard is to relinquish all title to the reward of the righteous.\u2014Vol. 4, p. 523.",
