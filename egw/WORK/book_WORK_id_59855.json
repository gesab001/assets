    "word": "In no place in the world can our influence tell on the Lord's side with such power as in the position to which He calls us. The most useful thing we do in the service of God is to encourage the souls that are distressed, and lead them to Christ. (353) Keep the lives of the patients constantly refreshed by the example of a Christlike example. You will have success if you will \n\n\n                            -203- \n\nbe a self-denying Christian. An earnest desire to be obedient to the will of your heavenly Father will bring you to the place where you will wear Christ's yoke. Those who are great in the sight of the Lord will, like John the Baptist, have humility of heart. Then good works will follow. Your example may be such that others will wish to emulate it. Your obedience and humbleness of mind will make obedience and humility a desirable thing to those who are associated with you.",
