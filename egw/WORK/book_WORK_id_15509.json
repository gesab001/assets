    "word": "Throughout His life on earth, Jesus was an earnest and constant worker. He expected much; therefore He attempted much. . . . Jesus did not shirk care and responsibility. . . . The positiveness and energy, the solidity and strength of character, manifested in Christ are to be developed in us, through the same discipline that He endured. And the grace that He received is for us. . . .",
