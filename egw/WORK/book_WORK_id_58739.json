Had he been converted and sanctified, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, his qualifications would have presented a far different showing. But he was connected with men who were not connected with God. There was not that harmony and love in the hearts of the workers, high or low, which could have made them strong and efficient, a complete whole.

The wisdom of finite men was placed in opposition to the wisdom of God.",
