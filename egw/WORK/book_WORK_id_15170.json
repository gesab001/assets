    "word": "\"In these countries,\" Mrs. White pointed out, \"the Lord has able workmen, laborers of experience. These can lead out in the establishment of institutions, the training of workers, and the carrying forward of the work in its different lines.

The institutions established would give character to the work in these countries, and would give opportunity for the training of workers for the darker heathen nations. In this way the efficiency of our experienced workers would be multiplied a hundredfold.\" [\"TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH,\" VOL. 6, P. 25.]",
