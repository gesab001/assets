    "word": "This was the spirit and life of the message that John bore to all in his old age, when he was nearly one hundred years old.  The standard-bearers are holding fast their banners.  They are not loosening their hands on the banner of truth until they lay off the armor.  One \n                                                                           19\nby one the old warriors' voices become silent.  Their place is vacant.  We see them no more, but they being dead yet speak, for their works do follow them.  Let us treat very tenderly the few aged pilgrims remaining, esteeming them highly for their works' sake.  As their powers are becoming worn and enfeebled, what they do say is of value.  As precious testimony let their words be treasured.  Let not the young men and the new workers discard or in any respect show indifference to the men of hoary hairs, but let them rise up and call them blessed.  They should consider that they have themselves entered into these men's labors.  We wish that there was much more of the love of Christ in the hearts of our believers for those who were first in the proclamation of the message.  -- 2SM 223,224.",
