    "word": "MR No. 792 - L. R. Conradi\n\n     Yesterday afternoon after speaking, I called for a contribution for foreign missions, and nearly one hundred dollars was raised. This will be sent to Pastor [L. R.] Conradi. He is pushing the work in Europe with all his power, and is opening up new fields. He needs money. I have just given those in charge of the work in Europe permission to use one thousand dollars of the royalty of my books for the payment of translations.--Letter 149, 1902, pp. 3, 4. (To G. B. Starr and wife, September 22, 1902.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. June 10, 1980",
