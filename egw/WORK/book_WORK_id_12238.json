    "word": "When a mission is established in a city, our people should take an interest in it, showing this interest in a practical, substantial way. The mission workers labor hard and self-sacrificingly, and they do not receive large wages. Let not our people think that the conducting of city missions is an easy work, or one that brings financial profit. Often the missions are carried on with no means in sight, by men and women who from day to day beseech God to send them means with which to advance the work. \n\n\n                                                   [367]",
