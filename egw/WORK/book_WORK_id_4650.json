    "word": "Just before us is the closing struggle of the great controversy when, with \"all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness,\" Satan is to work to misrepresent the character of God, that he may \"seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.\" If there was ever a people in need of constantly increasing light from heaven, it is the people that, in this time of peril, God has called to be the depositaries of His holy law and to vindicate His character before the world. Those to whom has been committed a trust so sacred must be spiritualized, elevated, vitalized, by the truths they profess to believe.  5T 745, 746616",
