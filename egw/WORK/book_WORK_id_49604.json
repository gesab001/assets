    "word": "MR No. 875 - Appeal for Spiritual Ministers\n\n     I am assured again and again that the Lord has a great work to be done in this country. He has laid upon me a burden that I dare not refuse to carry. We have greatly needed a sanitarium in this country. The medical-missionary work is to be as the hand and arm of the gospel message to be borne in this new world. We needed a sanitarium to give influence and character to the work, to accomplish the reforms so much needed! The ministry of the word and medical-missionary work, properly combined, would have exerted a much greater influence for good than working alone.",
