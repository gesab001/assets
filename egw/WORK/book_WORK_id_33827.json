    "word": "Let all be careful how they interpose themselves between God, the great Master Worker, and His people. We should see and acknowledge the workings of His providence, and bow to His authority. Let every messenger of God attend to his own specific work, and not rush into a work that is simply after his own wisdom and devising. Let the Lord's messengers go unto the mercy seat, that they may receive wisdom and grace to know God, to understand His workings. Knowledge of God will give them well-balanced minds and sound judgment, that they will not move impulsively at this critical, important time of earth's history.",
