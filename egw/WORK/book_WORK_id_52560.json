    "word": "At this time we need, not men who will catch up new, fanciful ideas, but men who will catch the notes that sound from the heavenly courts, and who, without consulting any man, will obey God's orders. We have been warned that the enemy will bring in his deceptive working. In so subtle a way will he work that he will appear to be an angel of light. I am bidden to lift up my voice and say to all our people, Beware, beware. Those who, having had warnings and entreaties and counsels, still follow their own will, are not laborers together with God.",
