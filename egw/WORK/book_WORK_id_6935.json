    "word": "The Lord declares, \"The message is to go forth in words of solemn warning. Nothing that will hinder the clear presentation of the message is to be introduced into your plans. Repeat the message. The wickedness in the cities is increasing; the adversary has great influence over men, because My people did not open their hearts to realize their responsibility. Tell My people to take up their work and proclaim the message. They are to speak and work in the simplicity of true godliness, and My Spirit will make the impression on hearts. Let the true note of warning be sounded. My angel shall go before you if you will be sanctified through the truth.\"--Letter 88, 1910.",
