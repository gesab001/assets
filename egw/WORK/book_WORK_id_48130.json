    "word": "I would be pleased, Elder Haskell, if you and your wife could unite with the workers of California in guiding our people amid the changes and turmoil, the violence and crime that are on every side. Keep firm hold on the power of the One who sees and knows, and who will enable you to give the trumpet a certain sound. Work intelligently, work disinterestedly. But I need not tell you this. You cannot well do otherwise, with the experience that you have had, and your knowledge of the Word of God.--Letter 68, 1908, pp. 2, 3. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, February 5, 1908.)",
