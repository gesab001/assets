    "word": "A few pence well handled are of more use than pounds that lie unused. The one who uses one talent faithfully for the Master is of far more value in his sight than the one who has many talents, but who refuses to use them aright, who looks down on the one who does humble service. The faithful performance of small duties fits us for larger responsibilities. Of those who take up their appointed work, no matter how small it may seem, who perform faithfully the humble duties nearest them, Christ says, \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\"",
