    "word": "I have been trying to write out some important instruction given me in reference to the responsibilities resting on the medical missionary worker. Complete subjection through Christ to the will of God is our only safety. The selfish thoughts and impulses that sweep through the soul, producing discordant notes, can be separated from the life only as the whole being is under the control of Christ. The Saviour's word to all unruly elements is, \"Peace, be still.\" Christ welcomes all who accept Him as their Saviour, and rules over them as their king.",
