    "word": "Take your Bible; read it; search it as for hidden treasures. Cling to the word. Pray and watch, that you may be able with clear, sanctified perception to consider the propositions made in council meetings. In no case neglect the work you must do for your individual self. You are not your own. You belong to God. You have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\"",
