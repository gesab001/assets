Attended by a retinue of servants, and with camels bearing \"spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones,\" she made the long journey to Jerusalem. \"And when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.\" She talked with him of the mysteries of nature; and Solomon taught her of the God of nature, the great Creator, who dwells in the highest heaven and rules over all. \"Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king, which he told her not.\"",
