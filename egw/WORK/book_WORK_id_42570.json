    "word": "The work of God has no need of overbearing men, or of harsh, unkind spirits. True zeal is always tempered with the meekness and lowliness of Christ. My brethren, in your work things will arise that would naturally provoke you, but you must be patient under provocation. The spirit of Christ will be revealed in all who truly do Christ's service. They wear the yoke of Christ, and they see the need of perfect self-control. As laborers together with God, they seek to co-operate with their fellow-workers, that they may act their part in fulfilling the grand purpose for which Christ came into the world,--the saving of all who receive Him as a personal Saviour.",
