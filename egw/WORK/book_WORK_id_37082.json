    "word": "There is a work to be done by the Holy Spirit in the heart; when this is accomplished, bitter tears will no longer flow forth, but the promise will be fulfilled, \"The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (John 4:14). You can stand only in God. When the heart is reconciled to God, the fact will be made manifest in your association with your brethren. It will be seen that Christ is abiding in the soul temple.--Letter 10, Oct. 27, 1894, to an evangelist working in Australia.",
