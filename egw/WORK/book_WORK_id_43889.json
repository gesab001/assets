    "word": "The Health Reform is a branch of the work connected with the third angel's message, as the hand is united to the body. Those engaged in this branch of the work have been neglectful of their duty, and God has marked their careless inattention and positive uncleanness. This disgusting appearance has been laid open to spectators, and the cause of Health Reform, as connected with the great truths we advocate, has been placed, in their minds, on a level with the outward condition of the surroundings and grounds of the Institute. The truth that we profess has been brought into disrepute because of the loose state of things that has existed there.",
