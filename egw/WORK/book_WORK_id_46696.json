    "word": "We need a sanctified imagination, and a sanctified tongue. Our work is to put on the meekness of Christ, to be kind and tender and courteous. The Lord will not accept the work of any man that is not done in tenderness and love and kindness. He has not set us as rulers, to lord it over His heritage. Let others be moved by Christ, just as we desire to be moved by Him.",
