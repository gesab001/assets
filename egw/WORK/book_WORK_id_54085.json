    "word": "Do good if you would be cherished in the memory of others. Live to be a blessing to all, wherever your lot may be cast. There are so many thousands who do no good in the world. None could point to them as the agency through [which] Jesus Christ [worked] in the saving of their souls. Let children and youth wake up. By kindness and love, by self-denying, self-sacrificing deeds, write your names in the hearts of many.",
