    "word": "The Voice of Wisdom \n\n     These seemed to be important questions, and hard to solve. Then the voice of wisdom was heard; the subject of health reform is a great subject, an important subject, and this missionary work is to be carried into the highways and byways of life. The third angel's message is present truth for 1898, and the health question is as closely connected with that message as the arm is with the body. Therefore light must be given as to the best methods of introducing health reform. Meat is the greatest disease breeder that can be introduced into the human system. \n                                                                           267\nBut you cannot teach health reform unless you present the most inexpensive methods of living. The enemy must have no advantage in any line. The Lord can only bless those who are keeping every precept He has give in relation to this life.--MS. 105, 1898.",
