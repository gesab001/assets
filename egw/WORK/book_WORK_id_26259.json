    "word": "Chapter XXIX. - Jew and Gentile.\n\n     The next day after the stoning of Paul, the apostles left the city, according to the direction of Christ: \"When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\" They departed for Derbe, where their labors were blessed by leading many souls to embrace the truth. But both Paul and Barnabas returned again to visit Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, the fields of labor where they had met such opposition and persecution. In all those places were many souls that believed the truth; and the apostles felt it their duty to strengthen and encourage their brethren who were exposed to reproach and bitter opposition. They were determined to securely bind off the work which they had done, that it might not ravel out.",
