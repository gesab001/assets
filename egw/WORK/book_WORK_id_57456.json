    "word": "I am called not only to write, but to bear my testimony with voice as well as pen, and I must be situated where I can be lifted out of the temporal embarrassments and the common business perplexities and conflicts. \n                                                                           771\nThe Lord Jesus must dwell in my heart and all my powers shall be devoted to His service. It is my constant prayer day and night that we may realize an awakening among His people, that Jesus may work in this city of Washington in demonstration of His Spirit and with power. In this city are the lawmaking powers which will ere long make their power felt. Truly the prince of darkness is working with his confederacy of evil, to make void the law of God.",
