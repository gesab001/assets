    "word": "The night before the passengers were to have their carousal, I went into a little anteroom, and lay down. I fell asleep, and presently I was awakened by a voice speaking to me. I knew as soon as I awoke what this meant, for the room was filled with a sweet fragrance, as of beautiful flowers. I fell asleep once more, and was wakened again the same way. Then words were spoken to me, assuring me that the Lord would protect me; that He had a work for me to do. Comfort, encouragement, and direction were given to me, and I was greatly blessed. I felt then that I would make no more complaints in regard to the noise and the smoking.",
