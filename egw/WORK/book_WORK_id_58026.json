I am willing to go where ever the Lord indicates my duty, but I am not willing to go at the voice of the Conference unless I see my own way closer to do so. I know they would not wish me to do this. I do not yet feel inclined to go to America; for there would be so much work to go there that it would not be wisdom for me to go. I will remain here for further orders from the Lord to bid me how to move. I thought I ought to tell you, so that you would not be thinking I would go, when I do not feel that it is my duty.
