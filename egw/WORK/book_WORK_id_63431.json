    "word": "Again: I hope that Brethren Magan and Sutherland can be relieved of the strain under which they have been laboring. I trust that you will study what I have written concerning their work. I very much desire that Emmanuel Missionary College shall become what it should be. I hope that the teachers and students there will be provided with comfortable quarters in which to pass the winter. I wish I had more means; for I should be so glad to help our brethren at Berrien Springs in this their time of need. But I have barely enough with which to live and to pay my workers. The Lord knows all about this matter, and he will help us. I am not distrustful, but am full of faith and hope and courage. I present these matters before you, and leave them with you. I pray that you may be guided by the Lord. \n\n\n                                Ellen G. White.",
