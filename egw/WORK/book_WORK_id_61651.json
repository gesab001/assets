    "word": "Until this recent visit, I had never before seen such a place with my natural eyes, but four years ago such a place was presented before me as one of those that would come into our possession if we moved wisely.

If God will bless the treatment given, and Christ will let His healing power be felt, a wonderful work will be accomplished.",
