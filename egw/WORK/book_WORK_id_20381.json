    "word": "PRAYER IS NOT TIME WASTED.\u2014Every morning take time to begin your work with prayer. Do not think this wasted time; it is time that will live through eternal ages. By this means success and spiritual victory will be brought in. The machinery will respond to the touch of the Master\u2019s hand. God\u2019s blessing is certainly worth asking for, and the work cannot be done aright unless the beginning is right. The hands of every worker must be strengthened, his heart must be purified, before the Lord can use him effectively.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, 194.)",
