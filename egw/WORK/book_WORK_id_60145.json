    "word": "Brother Reaser's letter touched my heart, and I replied in the hope that he might be helped in just the right way. If this is possible, we shall accomplish much. If Elder Reaser will see himself as he is and acknowledge his mistakes, he can unite his strength with ours to save others from going over the same ground that he has traveled. Much will be gained if he learns to stand. \n\n\n                                -331- \n\nnot in his own strength, but in the strength of God. I was so thankful for the acknowledgements that Brother Reaser made in his letter, that I could not refrain from weeping; for I knew that they would mean much to such a man as he. I know also that if he will turn his strength of purpose on the right side, he will be a power for good in the work of God. And the strength that he can give is needed.",
