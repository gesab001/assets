    "word": "Mistakes have been made at Healdsburg, but the brethren need not feel discouraged. The Lord may have permitted them to make these mistakes in order to put them on their guard, that in the future they may avoid making greater mistakes. Let us look at things in a rational light. Our people are not half awake to the fact that the enemy against whom we are contending is a keen, intelligent, eloquent being, who works in every conceivable way to hinder the advancement of God's work. We must rid ourselves of the idea that we can move along smoothly, meeting no hindrances. The enemy will oppose every effort put forth to advance the cause of God. \n                                                                           37",
