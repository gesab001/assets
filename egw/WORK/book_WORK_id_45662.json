    "word": "In order for us to be like the Saviour, we must be changed. Now is the time for us to bring into the daily life the virtues of Christ's life. We have no time to lose. Should we fail in our character-building, we shall lose eternal life. We must build on the true foundation. If we bring to the foundation material represented by hay, wood, and stubble, our building \n\n\n                                -107- \n\nwill not stand the test of the judgment. We must do the work of Christ, and be constantly watching and praying. Then we shall be ready for His appearing, prepared to receive eternal life.",
