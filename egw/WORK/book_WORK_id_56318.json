    "word": "Means must be sent to China; this is right and proper; but why not also warn the various nationalities in the cities close by? Why not plan wisely to reach the hundreds of thousands of foreigners in the cities of America? God desires us to awake from our slumbers. He desires us to do our duty. He desires to endue us with His Spirit and lift us up onto a higher platform. Everyone who will come into line will understand what the will of God is. Then no one will set his stakes to follow a certain way of his own choosing, irrespective of the counsels of his brethren; but all will have the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. When God's people understand what Bible religion is, there will be coming into the ranks of believers more new converts than are seen today. We are to awake and do our duty toward the unwarned inhabitants of the cities and of many out-of-the-way places, and then we shall see of the salvation of God.--Ms 25, 1910 (MR 900.59) \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May, 1989. Entire Ms.",
