    "word": "We are laborers together with God. The frail instrument is nothing, but worked by the Holy Spirit man can accomplish much. All human effort combined is weakness without the deep moving of the Spirit of God. The Lord is the worker. Without His help the deep learning and restless energy of a Paul, the eloquence and talent of an Apollos, would fall infinitely short of convicting and bringing one soul to repentance. But man is of value if soul, body, and spirit are prepared to cooperate with divine power. While man can do nothing without God, the Lord would do nothing without the human channel through which to communicate His truth to humanity.--Letter 85, 1898, p. 4. (To C. H. Jones, Oct. 7, 1898.)",
