    "word": "The worldliness you possess does not incline your hard hearts to throw wide open the door, at the knock you hear from Jesus who is seeking an entrance. The Lord of glory who has redeemed you by his own blood, waited at your doors for admittance, and you did not throw open the door wide and welcome him in. Some opened the door slightly and permitted a little light from his presence to enter, but did not welcome the heavenly Visitor. There was not room for Jesus. The place which should have been reserved for him was occupied with other things. Jesus entreated you: \"If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\" There was a work for you to do to open the door. For a time you felt inclined to hear, and open the door, but even this inclination departed, and you failed to secure the communion with the heavenly guest which it was your privilege to have. By some, the door was opened, and Jesus heartily welcomed.",
