    "word": "The Lord speaks to His delegated servants. He will give them the very message He wants them to have. The work of all bears the mark of imperfection. Self becomes interwoven more or less with the work. If the workers have weakness in some points of character, these defects are revealed and too often influence the people. Some cherish these weaknesses as a virtue, but another laborer coming into this field may be strong upon the very points where the other is weak, and he may be able to give a more perfect mold to the work. He presents new ideas and gives new impressions. The workers in any field must not become the people's pets, and idols, among the truth-believing people. One more council meeting is passed into eternity with its burden of record.",
