    "word": "I was constrained to write out the principles that were set before us in that assembly as truth. These \"exclusive\" principles should not have place in the work of God. They should be cut out of your business arrangements and your councils in connection with the workers in the Lord's great moral vineyard. My mind has been much exercised in regard to having this \"exclusively\" come in among those who are handling our papers and pamphlets in any line in your branch office. They are unworthy of being voiced or traced with a pen. It is entirely a human device with which God has had naught to do. Its origin is selfishness. The word should be cut out, for it is not inspired of God.",
