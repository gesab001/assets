    "word": "The truth is in our hands, placed there by the Word of God, which is our guidebook, and which is to be closely and sacredly followed. The perfection of a Christian experience is an individual work. If errors are committed by lay members or by ministers or teachers, there is a way to correct them. We must follow the instruction given by our Saviour. We are bound to take the word of a minister of the gospel, unless we have clear evidence that what he says is not true. The Lord condemns any unfair work, such as encouraging others to tell the suspicions that the enemy many have put into their minds, and acting upon such accusations. We are to guard jealously the reputation of ministers and church members. To go out of the way to surmise that a brother has sinned, because we have evidence that another man has done evil things, and to give the impression that the brother is guilty of the same things, is hunting up falsehoods to repeat as truth.",
