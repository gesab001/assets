    "word": "Christ died, not to immortalize sin, not to perpetuate transgression, but He died as the only hope for the transgressor; to make a perfect sacrifice and offering; and there was not an angel in heaven that could do that work. Not one of the angelic throng would be accepted as an offering but Jesus Christ. He that was one with the Father, and was in the express image of His person. He was full of grace and truth, and when He came to our earth He found transgression everywhere. And He found that the traditions and customs of men were taught as--what? The commandments of God. They had the truth mixed with such a mass of error that it was brought down to the very dust. He came to teach the truth in its purity and tear away the error enveloping the commandments of God. He showed the true character of the law of Jehovah.",
