    "word": "I appeal to the presidents of Conferences and to ministers and workers in the cause, to arise by faith and be diligent, valiant workers with God. Every believer must be energized by the Spirit of Christ, and reach the people through the power of God. The Saviour is not in Joseph's new tomb; he has risen from the sepulcher, and has ascended into heaven to be our surety, to plead the merits of his blood in our behalf. We have a living Saviour to carry forward his own work upon the earth. We are not to work alone. The ministers of God must not only preach in the pulpit, but must come in personal contact with the people. Personal labor must be put forth, that souls may be rescued from the snare of the enemy. Then let us work in all earnestness and faith, and we shall reap a blessed harvest. \n                         Mrs. E. G. White. \n\n\n                    -34-",
