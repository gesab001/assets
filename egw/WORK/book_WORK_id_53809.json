    "word": "The very same error has existed in regard to tract and missionary work. The time and means that have been used to educate so definitely have been an injury to the success of the work and the cause of God.

This matter has been carried to extremes. There has been too much mechanical working, too much machinery, and too little vital godliness combined with human effort; too much of man's judgment and device and too little room left for the divine.",
