    "word": "The Youth As Missionary Workers\n     Why is there so great a lack of the missionary spirit among our youth? Why are there so few of the children of Sabbath-keeping parents who have any burden to labor for the salvation of souls? It is because they have not been educated to realize their responsibility. They have not been trained to render service for God. Had they been educated from the beginning of their religious experience to be true to their faith, fervent in piety, and in sympathy with Christ's longing for the salvation of souls, there would now be an army of youth to enter missionary fields. Fathers and mothers, it is your own lack of godliness and devotion that has brought carelessness and indifference into your households, and placed your children in the ranks of the enemy.",
