    "word": "ELDER C. L. TAYLOR: SISTER WHITE, THERE IS ONE QUESTION THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO RAISE, REGARDING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS AND THE RELATION OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CHURCH SCHOOL. NOW SUPPOSE I HAVE A LITTLE BOY--I HAVE ONE--SEVEN YEARS OLD. WE ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF TRAINING HIM, WE HAVE FITTED OURSELVES TO DO THAT WORK. NOW SUPPOSE WE CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY, TO NEGLECT THE BOY, LET HIM DRIFT AROUND. THEN DOES IT BECOME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH TO DO WHAT I COULD DO IF I WOULD DO? THAT IS THE QUESTION. IF I DON'T TAKE CARE OF MY BOY WHEN I CAN, WHEN I AM ABLE TO DO IT, WOULD I ASK THE CHURCH TO DO IT IN MY PLACE?",
