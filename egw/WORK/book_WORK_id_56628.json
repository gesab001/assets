    "word": "At the camp-meeting Bro. and Sister Daniels drew near to the Lord, and the Lord did indeed draw nigh to them. As by prayer and heart-felt confession, they worked out their own salvation with fear and trembling, the Lord worked in them to will and to do of his good pleasure. The promise seemed to be indeed fulfilled on this occasion, \"But unto you that fear my name, shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in his wings.\" I knew that Jesus was in our midst. I knew that he gave me sustaining grace to labor in the meeting. From that meeting Bro. Daniels has, through the grace of Christ, labored for the Fresno church with the best results.",
