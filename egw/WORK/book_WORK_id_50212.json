    "word": "In the Soldiers' Home at Yountville is an open door for service whereby we may reach needy souls. To labor for the salvation of the men in this home is as important missionary work as any to be found in India or China. I have sent down several copies of Desire of Ages and other of my books to be lent to the soldiers. Mr. Foy takes charge of them and circulates them among those who desire to read them.",
