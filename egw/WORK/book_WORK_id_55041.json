    "word": "Christ's Presence Means Advance \n     Let us strive with earnestness for the victory over sin. Let us be determined not to give place to the enemy by criticizing, by picking flaws, by demeriting others, and seeking to be first. Let us study the prayer made in our behalf, and work for its fulfillment. Let us keep our eyes fixed upon the perfect Pattern. The only way to avoid dissension and strife is to \n                                                                           35\nbehold Him who came to this world to save sinners. It is for this object that His followers are to work. They are to yoke up with the Saviour, learning of Him His meekness and lowliness. He says to us, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Matthew 28:20. How then can there be dissension and strife among us? If we live as in Christ's presence, there will be no contention. There will be no hesitancy about introducing new plans of action, as the Holy Spirit may move upon some one to suggest them.",
