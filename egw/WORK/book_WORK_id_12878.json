    "word": "\u201cEvery battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. \u201cThe indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.\u201d \u201cUpon the wicked he shall rain quick burning coals, fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.\u201d [Isaiah 9:5; 34:2; 11:6 (MARGIN).] Fire comes down from God out of Heaven. The earth is broken up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire. The day has come that shall burn as an oven. The elements melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein are burned up. [Malachi 4:1; 2 Peter 3:10.] The earth's surface seems one molten mass,\u2014a vast, seething lake of fire. It is the time of the judgment and perdition of ungodly men,\u2014 \n673\n\u201cthe day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.\u201d [Isaiah 34:8; Proverbs 11:31.]",
