Olsen \n\nDear Brother Olsen: \n     I received a letter from Willie White suggesting that Elder Waggoner be called to the east to attend the Ministerial Institutes, and to teach the school. I think it would be in the order of God for the President of the General Conference to visit this part of the moral vineyard and take in the situation of things, for there is a condition of things in California that is certainly deplorable. I will send you a copy of a letter handed me from M.J. Church while I was at the camp meeting in Fresno. There is great need of different kinds of gifts being brought in here than that which they now have. But don't send Elder Farnsworth, for he is settled nowhere. He is inclined to think and believe with the last man he is with. I put no dependence on him, and the less we have of such workers the better it will be for the vineyard of the Lord. Elder Farnsworth does not know what it is to walk with God, to move in harmony with the mind of God. He feels fully competent and self-sufficient, but oh, he carries a cheap influence out of the desk. His words, his manners, his conversation are not what should be cultivated by a minister of Jesus Christ. There has come in to our gatherings or convocation meetings a cheap, commonness in association not after the order of devout worshipers, but of the festivals and idolatrous worship. God would have all these things pass away and Christ's manner of teaching brought in and the heavenly model be copied.",
