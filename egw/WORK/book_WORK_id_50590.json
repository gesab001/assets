    "word": "-224- \n\n     [Isaiah 62:1-3, quoted.] \n     A great lack of wisdom is shown in centralizing the work in one or two places, gathering the people together in large congregations, when the believers should be spread over a larger surface, where they can be working agencies and proclaim the message of warning to those who have no knowledge of present truth. And in the place of preaching Sabbath after Sabbath to those who know the truth until they have no soul-hunger for the Word of God, let ministers go to new places where, in the power of the grace of God, they can warn those in the darkness of ignorance.",
