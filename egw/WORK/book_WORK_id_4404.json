    "word": "The time spent in physical exercise is not lost. A proportionate exercise \n161\nof all the organs and faculties of the body is essential to the best work of each.

The physical system is robbed of its healthful tone, the mind loses its freshness and vigor, and a morbid excitability is the result.",
