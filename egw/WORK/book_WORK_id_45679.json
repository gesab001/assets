    "word": "There is more joy in heaven in the presence of the angels over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance. It is impossible to estimate what may be the work that these souls may accomplish if they go on gathering more and increased light from the Word of God and walk in the way of all His commandments. If they become channels of light to this dark and irreligious city they will be indeed God's witnesses and through their fervent piety and Christlike example may be the means of winning souls to the truth.-- Ms 46a, 1886, pp. 1-3.
