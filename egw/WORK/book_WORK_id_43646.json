    "word": "Dr. Lay, you have not conducted with prudence. I was shown that there was a spirit in that Institution to get all the means they could. An avaricious spirit was manifested by Dr. Byington, also by Dr. Lay and the helpers; a selfish spirit, that brought the frown and curse of God upon those who possessed it. It was wages, wages. There was not an unselfish devotion to the work, and laboring with an unselfish interest. There was not a burden and care taken by all there engaged to labor for the prosperity and benefit of the Institute. There was a spending of time, and but little accomplished. There was a great lack of a thorough oversight of all things pertaining to the Institute. Helpers and all seemed to have a spirit of indifference, and there were many expenses out, which need not have been had there been one to take the care who possessed energy, ambition, and forethought. The prospect of large dividends, and abundance of means coming in, led to a spirit of prodigality, which would soon have run the Institute into the ground. God wants this branch of the work to live and flourish, and all who act a part in it to possess a spirit of self-denial, a spirit entirely different from that heretofore exhibited, which has been to get just all that it was possible to get, and to advantage self, out of the Institute",
