Sanitarium, July 29, 1907. \n\n\n                  God's Wisdom to be Sought \n\n\n     The Lord has given me a message for the laborers in the S. Calif. Conferences. The Lord Jesus wants us to believe that He \n\n\n                             -221- \n\nis our Wisdom, and Sanctification, and Redemption. Influences are appearing among us that are decidedly opposed to the healthy development of the work which the Lord would have carried in straight lines.",
