    "word": "Unsanctified plans were laid that worked counter to the plans of God. All this was greatly displeasing to the Lord, and it was work which He repudiated.

With unbelief, jealousies arose, and with sacred missionary enterprises were linked up men who themselves needed to experience the converting power of God, and to learn to walk humbly before Him.",
