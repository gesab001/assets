    "word": "In giving the light to His people, God did not work exclusively through any one class of men. Daniel was a prince of Judah. Isaiah also was of the royal tribe.

The Lord raised up as representative men the prophets and princes, the noble and the lowly, and by inspiration taught them truths to be given to His people.",
