    "word": "I know of not one man who has length of experience from the rise of the message to make his voice heard or influence to tell on the cause of God at this time. With the exception of Brother Lunt nearly all are sleeping in their graves. Those who are living, who have had an experience in the work which the Lord has been pleased to give me are Elder Smith, Brother Amadon, \n                                                                           715\nand Elder Loughborough. Elder Smith will not receive the light God has given to correct him; he has not a spirit to correct by confession any wrong course he has pursued in the past and thus put up the bars behind him which leads into dangerous paths.",
