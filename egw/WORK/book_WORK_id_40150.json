    "word": "\"Young men and women should receive a training and an education in these lines that will qualify them to work for the Master. But if they do not possess solidity of character, and a spirit of consecration, all efforts to fit themselves for the work will prove a failure. None should be connected with the mission who do not give evidence that they possess these essential qualifications. The same is true of older workers. Unless they have the truth, sanctifying soul, body, and spirit, they will not do the right kind of work, they can not exert a saving influence in the canvassing field, or in any other branch of the cause.",
