    "word": "The Holy Spirit is a free, working, independent agency. The God of heaven uses His Spirit as it pleases Him; and human minds, human judgment, and human methods can no more set boundaries to its working, or prescribe the channel through which it shall operate, than they can say to the wind, \"I bid you to blow in a certain direction, and to conduct yourself in such and such a manner.\"",
