    "word": "All that is enumerated in this verse--the products of the carnal mind and unsanctified heart--have influenced the workers, more or less, and the effort which cost so much money, so much weary anxiety, so much hard work, has been made of little effect, because the workers did not eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of man.
