{
    "word": "\"This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you\" This is a wonderful statement. In our lives we are to exemplify the love of Christ. Then, like Him, we shall labor most earnestly for the salvation of sinners. He desires that we shall abide in Him, that He may work through us in keeping before the world such a representation of the infinite love of God as He Himself gave. Through our lives the despondent may receive an assurance that it is possible to be partakers of the divine nature, and by taking hold of this divinity win the victory that all must win who shall enter in through the gates into the city.",
