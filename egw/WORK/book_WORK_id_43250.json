    "word": "Talk No More Your Unbelief. \n\n     If the brethren in responsible positions would talk faith and courage to all the workers in the office, if you would talk self-denial in the church, \n\n\n                          [8] \n\nif you would practise it in your own families, if you would bear a clean-cut testimony, which you have not yet borne, if you would all be mouthpieces for God, and present to the church the necessity for self-denial, the humiliation of the soul, praying for the Lord to forgive your pride, your foolish, senseless vanity, the Lord may pass by and leave you a blessing.",
