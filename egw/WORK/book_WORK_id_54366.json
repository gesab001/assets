    "word": "Christ proclaimed His message from the mountainside, from the fisherman's boat, in the desert, in the great thoroughfares of travel. He was ready to take up His work at any time and in any place. He was a consecrated evangelist. Wherever He found those willing to listen, He was ready to open to them the treasure-house of truth. He is our example. His followers are to be ever on the watch for opportunities to speak words in season. And they are to speak with the same loving sympathy that He spoke.",
