Nicola is still principal of Oakwood but the school is not improving as it should and Mrs. White expressly states that he should be relieved of his position and a new leader be installed.\nTo my brethren who are assembled in council:\n     I wish to speak a few words to you with my pen. I would not have needed to write this if you would stand in your place as men who have a work to perform. Our Brother Nicola should have been relieved of his responsibilities ere this. To every man is given his work.",
