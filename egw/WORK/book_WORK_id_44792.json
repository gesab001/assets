    "word": "God will require a return from men in proportion as they set a value upon themselves and their services, for they will be judged according to their deeds, and by no less a standard than they themselves have established. If they have accounted their talents of so great value, and placed a high estimate upon their abilities, they will be required to render service proportionate to their own estimate and demands. O, how few have any real acquaintance with the Father or with His Son Jesus Christ. If they were imbued with the Spirit of Christ they would work the works of Christ. \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus\" (Philippians 2:5).",
