    "word": "In searching for a place for the school the brethren found a farm of four hundred acres for sale about nine miles from Nashville. The size of the farm, its situation, the distance that it is from Nashville, and the moderate sum for which it could be purchased, seemed to point it out as the very place for the school work. We advised that this place be purchased. I knew that all the land would ultimately be needed.--RH Aug. 18, 1904.",
