    "word": "There must be more of Christ's ways and less of self. Sharp criticisms should be repressed. Sympathy, compassion, and love should be cultivated in every worker. Unless Jesus comes in and takes possession of the heart; unless self is subdued, and Jesus exalted, we shall not prosper as a people. I testify that which I have seen. I beseech of you brethren, to labor wholly in God. Do not have too many plans, but strive to have the work carried on healthfully, circumspectly, and with such thoroughness that it will not ravel out.",
