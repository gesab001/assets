    "word": "Christ declared, \"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another\" (John 13:34, 35). This is the love church members are to manifest for one another. Such love will exert a powerful influence in favor of the truth. Christ desires to work through His appointed agencies to make His cause a power in our world. He says, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it. If ye love Me, keep My commandments\" (John 14:13-15).",
