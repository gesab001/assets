    "word": "It is not wise to choose one man as president of the General Conference. The work of the General Conference has extended, and some things have been made unnecessarily complicated. A want of discernment has been shown. There should be a division of the field, or some other plan should be devised to change the present order of things.--TM 342 (1896). [THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH WAS ORGANIZED IN 1863 WITH 3,500 MEMBERS, HALF A DOZEN LOCAL CONFERENCES, ABOUT THIRTY MINISTERIAL LABORERS, AND A GENERAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE OF THREE. THE GENERAL CONFERENCE PRESIDENT WAS WELL ABLE TO PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP AND COUNSEL REQUIRED BY SUCH A SMALL ORGANIZATION. HE COULD PERSONALLY ATTEND EVERY IMPORTANT MEETING AND IN ADDITION GIVE PERSONAL ATTENTION TO MUCH OF THE BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE PUBLISHING WORK. HOWEVER, BY 1896 THE WORK OF THE CHURCH HAD GREATLY EXPANDED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND EXTENDED TO EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, AND AFRICA AS WELL. IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE FOR ONE MAN TO GIVE ADEQUATE SUPERVISION AND DIRECTION TO SUCH A WIDESPREADING WORK. ELLEN WHITE URGED A DIVISION OF THE FIELD, SO THAT OUR CHURCH MEMBERS AROUND THE WORLD WOULD NOT LOOK TO JUST ONE MAN FOR COUNSEL. THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE CREATION OF UNION CONFERENCES AND WORLD DIVISIONS.]",
