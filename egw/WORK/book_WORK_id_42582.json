    "word": "The death of Judas and the resurrection and ascension of Christ placed the disciples on vantage ground, and gave them courage. But if Christ had not borne with Judas until the end, the results of the betrayer's course would not have been sufficiently impressive to stay the hands of the persecutors, and after Christ's ascension the most terrible scenes would have been witnessed. But God worked by His Spirit, and five thousand were converted in a day. Let God be true, and every man a liar. Christ Jesus is at the helm. \"Lo,\" He declares, \"I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Matthew 28:20.",
