    "word": "No man will be condemned for not accepting light he has never received, or for violating a law he never heard. But when light comes to him from the word of God, and he neglects to live by it, but in his business transactions in connection with the work and cause of God, and in his dealing with his brethren, uses oppression, because he supposes he has power to oppress, he does himself great harm. He will not receive from his injustice and oppression the advantage he expects to receive.",
