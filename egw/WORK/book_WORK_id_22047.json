    "word": "House-to-house work is one very successful way of reaching souls. But it is not the only way that God has provided for the advancement of His work.

In bearing the message make no personal thrusts at other churches. . . . Let us be careful of our words. Let not our ministers follow their own impulses in denouncing and exposing the mysteries of iniquity. Upon these themes often silence is eloquence.",
