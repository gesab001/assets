    "word": "Very soon after going to Cooranbong, we began to do medical missionary work. Sara was called to many places to treat the sick, and many of the cases were very difficult ones. This work opened many doors for us, giving us access to hearts. We brought the sick to our home, and cared for them there; and the great Medical Missionary came into the home, and blessed the care and those who cared for them. He went with the one who was called, often at night, to ride for miles through the woods to visit some suffering one. God was in this work. I praise His holy name.",
