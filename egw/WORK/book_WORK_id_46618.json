    "word": "In a special sense presidents of conferences have a decided work to do. Those who stand as sentinels need to be aroused; for they are watchmen, entrusted with the work of sounding the last note of warning to a perishing world. They are to lay hold of the work in earnest, as men entrusted with the giving of the last message of mercy. It is no time now to stand before the people with a tame spiritless message.--Ms 59, 1912, p. 3. (Fragments, typed August 13, 1912.) \n\n\n                                             -449-  {4MR 447.10}  \n     I now call upon presidents of conferences and men in responsible positions to set in operation every possible means by which the members of the churches may learn how to work for the perishing. Let those who have had experience teach those who are inexperienced. Let them pray together, and search the Word of God together.--Letter 314, 1907, p. 5. (To Elders A. G. Daniells and I. H. Evans, September 23, 1907.)",
