    "word": "The character and destiny of a man is determined by the principles which control his actions. Selfishness is an attribute of Satan, and, if this governs his life, it will be manifested in any profession or occupation, however humble and philanthropic it might be represented to be. A multitude of sins have been covered under the profession of medicine, although there has been a witness to every unholy action, a just verdict rendered in the decision of every case. Many things that are thought lawful in this profession are unlawful, and need the small cords in the hand of Christ that they may be driven out. Many good and merciful acts have been done by practicing physicians, for they have a broad field in which to work, but I was shown that as a general thing the medical profession as a body has become a den of thieves. In connection with the cause of God the profession of medicine is to be beautified by the presence of Christ, for he would cooperate with the physician who professes His name, but when men become extortioners, all he can do is drive them from His courts.",
