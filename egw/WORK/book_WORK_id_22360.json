    "word": "I decided to write to you, my brother.  Cannot you send us a donation in our great need?  If the Lord signifies to you that He wants the money you have to be used \n                                                                           97\nin the advancement of His work, will you not send me money to invest?  I have used everything of my own, and now I ask you to return to the Lord His own entrusted goods.  We see so many fields opening in every direction. People are calling for us to come and hold meetings with them, and we dare not refuse.  I have tried to mortgage my place, but the banks in Australia do not care to invest money in this way.  The Lord has indicated plainly that you could relieve us by investing means in the good work.  There is a great work to be done, and we wish to move in the opening providence of God.  Considerable advancement has been made, and we cannot stop now.",
