    "word": "God would have His messengers, when they know the spirit of their opponents, keep on their own ground, and not go out of the way to learn what their opponents say of the truth. Satan inspires them when you come into their presence. Never say or do anything that would keep them away from your assemblies. Keep to your legitimate work. \"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will show them His covenant.\" \"The Lord sitteth upon the floods, yea, the Lord sitteth king forever. The Lord will give strength unto His people: the Lord will bless His people with peace.\" \"No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.\" \"This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of Me, saith the Lord.\" \"If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\"",
