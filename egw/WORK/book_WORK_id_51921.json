    "word": "Christ had a mission to educate His workers. Christ worked and suffered and died for the world, that it might be saved. He sent forth the Twelve with their commission, two and two; then sent out the Seventy to go before Him whither He Himself would go. They were to proclaim the kingdom of God through Judea, and He taught them [that] piety must be diffusive. Christ abolished the distinction between neighbor and enemy with regard to those who need light and truth.",
