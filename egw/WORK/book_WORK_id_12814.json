    "word": "Just before us is the \u201chour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.\u201d [Revelation 3:10.] All whose faith is not firmly established upon the Word of God will be deceived and overcome. Satan \u201cworks with all deceivableness of unrighteousness\u201d to gain control of the children of men; and his deceptions will continually increase. But he can gain his object only as men voluntarily yield to his temptations. Those who are earnestly seeking a knowledge of the truth, and are striving to purify their souls through obedience, thus doing what they can to prepare for the conflict, will find, in the God of truth, a sure defense. \u201cBecause thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee,\u201d [Revelation 3:10.] is the Saviour's promise. He would sooner send every angel out of Heaven to protect his people, than leave one soul that trusts in him to be overcome by Satan.",
