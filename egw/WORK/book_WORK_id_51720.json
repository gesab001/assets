    "word": "Friday morning, a two-seated buggy drove to the door to take us to San Fernando, a town 21 miles from Los Angeles, to see a property that about a year ago we advised the brethren to purchase for school purposes. Circumstances were so arranged, in the providence of God, that this property, consisting of buildings that cost $40,000, and 10 acres of land, was offered to our people for $10,000. The location is all that could be desired. The brethren wrote to me about the offer that had been made, and I told them to arrange at once for the purchase of the place. They did so, and have since been preparing the building for schoolwork. The school will open October 1, 1902.",
