    "word": "Since these meetings began, I have felt urged to dwell much upon love and faith. This is because you need this testimony. Some who have entered these missionary fields have said, \u201cYou do not understand the French people; you do not understand the Germans. They have to be met in just such a way.\u201d But, I inquire, does not God understand them? Is it not he who gives his servants a message for the people? He knows just what they need; and if the message comes directly from him through his servants to the people, it will accomplish the work whereunto it is sent; it will make all one in Christ. Though some are decidedly French, others decidedly German, and others decidedly American, they will be just as decidedly Christ-like.",
