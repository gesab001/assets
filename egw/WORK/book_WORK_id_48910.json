    "word": "Means Needed for Paradise Valley Sanitarium.--I sent you a letter a day or two ago, asking you to help us to obtain means for the Paradise Valley Sanitarium. The brethren there are pleading with me to solicit means, for unless they receive financial assistance they will be unable to advance in their work. I wrote them that I would endeavor to obtain means for them. I know that you are laboring in a place where it would be difficult to ask for means. But as I thought of the success which the Lord is giving you, I thought that perhaps you could make a donation to the Paradise Valley \n\n\n                                    -228- \n\nSanitarium in its great need. The work is in charge of prudent, intelligent men, who will make a wise use of the means sent them. Will you not do something to help them without delay? If you could not make a gift, perhaps you could make a loan.",
