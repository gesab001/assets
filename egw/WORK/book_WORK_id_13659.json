    "word": "668. The stomach, when we lie down to rest, should have its work all done, that it may enjoy rest, as well as other portions of the body. The work of digestion should not be carried on through any period of the sleeping hours. After the stomach, which has been overtaxed, has performed its task, it becomes exhausted, which causes faintness. . . . The stomach becomes weary by being kept constantly at work. . . . Having no time for rest, the digestive organs become enfeebled, hence the sense of \"goneness,\" and desire for frequent eating. . . . The stomach must have its regular periods for labor and rest.--H. to L., Chap. I, p. 56.",
