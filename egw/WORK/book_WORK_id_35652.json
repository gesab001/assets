    "word": "The artistic skill of human beings produces very fine samples of beautiful workmanship, revealing things which delight the eye, and these things give us something of the idea of the designer, but the thing made is not the man. It is not the work that is to be exalted, but the man who designed the things so much prized. So it is with nature. The Lord's power is constantly revealed as a miracle-working power, that the human family may see an infinity above and beyond the things made, that they may know that He who formed such a being as man, has also created all the beauties of the natural world.",
