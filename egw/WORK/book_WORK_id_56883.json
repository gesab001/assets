    "word": "The words spoken to Joshua are applicable to Elder B. \"Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.\" Joshua 5:15. You are led astray by the enemy, and while you have been doing a work the Lord has never committed to mortal minds to do, you have been wonderfully zealous in regard to any difference of opinion being presented upon the law in Galatians. You speak of the position I have taken upon it and the letter I wrote you being the cause of your sickness. This may be your own interpretation of the matter, but I have reason to lay your sickness to causes that you do not see.",
