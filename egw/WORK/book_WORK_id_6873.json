    "word": "Only by the aid of that Spirit who in the beginning \"was brooding upon the face of the waters;\" of that Word by whom \"all things were made;\" of that \"true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world\" (Genesis 1:2, R.V., margin; John 1:3, 9), can the testimony of science be rightly interpreted. Only by their guidance can its deepest truths be discerned. Only under the direction of the Omniscient One shall we, in the study of His works, be enabled to think His thoughts after Him.",
