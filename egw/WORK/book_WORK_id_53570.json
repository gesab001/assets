    "word": "Another woman came running out, a young woman with a babe four weeks old. She needed some counsel because the child could not retain the food from the mother's breast. A few questions were asked. Do you not put your child to the breast whenever it cries? She said she did. And you work hard and get tired and then nurse your little one? Yes, she did. Then a little counsel was given to observe regular periods to nurse her child, not oftener than two or three hours. The child was stuffed full and it was a mercy that it could throw up that which the stomach could not retain. There is so great ignorance among mothers as to how to care for their children properly. The mother promised to heed the suggestions.",
