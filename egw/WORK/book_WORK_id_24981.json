    "word": "In his letter to the Corinthians, he writes, further: \"If any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's work shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare it.\" Some ministers, through their labors, furnish the most precious material, gold, silver, and precious stones, which represent true moral worth in those gained to the cause by them. The false material, gilded to imitate the true,--that is, a carnal mind, and unsanctified character, glossed over with seeming righteousness,--may not be readily detected by mortal eye; but the day of God will test the material.",
