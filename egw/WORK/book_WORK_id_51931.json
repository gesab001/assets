    "word": "Elder Haskell has gone that he might have chance to purchase tickets. We were to follow on the noon train. But now there comes in an appeal from outsiders, prominent men, for us to remain over another week. I am disappointed not to go, but there is much work left in an unsettled condition, and my daughter Mary and I consent to stay. We have had no opportunity to consult with Elder Haskell, for he is on his way to Portland and will go at once to Oakland. But this will make no difference; if it seems duty to stay we shall do so, and I hardly dare go now. Our meetings have created great interest. The prejudice is removed, and now we can do something, we think, for our people, who have been sadly neglected, as well as for outsiders.",
