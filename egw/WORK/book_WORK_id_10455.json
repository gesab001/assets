    "word": "Chap. 29 - To Teachers and Students\n\nTo the Teachers and Students in Our College at Battle\nCreek, and in All Our Educational Institutions\n\n\n     In the night seasons messages have been given to me to give to you in Battle Creek, and to all our schools. While it is in the order of God that the physical powers shall be trained as well as the mental, yet the physical exercise should in character be in complete harmony with the lessons given by Jesus Christ to His disciples. That which is given to the world should be seen in the lives of Christians, so that in education and in self-training the heavenly intelligences should not record in the books that the students and the teachers in our schools are \"lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.\" This is the record now being made of a large number. \"Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.\" Thus Satan and his angels are laying their snares for your souls, and he is working in a certain way upon teachers and pupils to induce them to engage in exercises and amusements which become intensely absorbing, but which are of a character to strengthen the lower powers, and create appetites and passions that will take the lead, and counteract most decidedly the operations and working of the Holy Spirit of God upon the human heart.",
