    "word": "A Place for Old and Young in the Southern \n                Field \n\n\n     In preparation for the coming of our Lord, we are to do a large work in the great cities. We have a solemn testimony to bear in these great centers. But in our planning for the \n\n\n                    -6- \n\nextension of the work, far more than the cities alone, must be comprehended. In out-of-the-way places are many, many families that need to be looked after in order to learn whether they understand the work that Jesus is doing for his people. Those in the highways are not to be neglected, neither are those in the hedges; and as we journey about from place to place, and pass by house after house, we should often inquire, \"Have the people who are living in these places, heard the message? Has the truth of God's Word been brought to their ears? Do they understand that the end of all things is at hand, and that the judgments of God are impending? Do they realize that every soul has been bought with an infinite price?\" As I meditate upon these things my heart goes out in deep longing to see the truth carried in its simplicity to the homes of these people along the highways and places far removed from the crowded centers of population. We are not to wait for workers of the very highest talent to prepare the way and to show us how to labor; but, whether old or young, we have the privilege of understanding the truth as it is in Jesus, and as we see persons who are not in the possession of the comfort of God's grace, it is our privilege to visit them, and acquaint them with God's love for them and with his wonderful provision for the salvation of their souls.",
