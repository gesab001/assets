    "word": "There is no reason why his brethren should stand away from him and criticize and denounce and condemn him when they have no real knowledge of his work and what they are talking about. They gather from hearing or supposition the idea that Dr. Kellogg is a designing, dangerous man, and acting upon that idea they unjustly and with an unchristian spirit place themselves directly in the way of his efforts, thus counteracting the good work he is trying to do, and their course is not fair and just.

This is not the Spirit of Christ and will have no saving influence upon Dr. Kellogg.",
