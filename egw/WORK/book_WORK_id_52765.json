    "word": "In the day of judgment [when] those who are now uniting with the enemy in an effort to destroy the foundation of God's government are brought face to face with the false statements they have made, with what remorse they will look upon their work. They will see what a fearful mistake they have made. God will ask, \"Who hath required this at your hands? Why have you placed this affront upon the Majesty of heaven? Why have you thrown down My memorial of creation, exalting in its stead a day I have not sanctified?\" What can they say in excuse for cooperating with the enemy to break the law of Jehovah?--Ms 51, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Dec. 17, 1987. Entire Ms.",
