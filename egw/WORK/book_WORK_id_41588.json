    "word": "\"My brethren and sisters, take hold without delay to supply the means needed for the completion of the work at Washington. If you will open your hearts to the influence of the Holy Spirit, this work can soon be accomplished. Let your piety and liberality be shown just now in the accomplishment of the work that must be done in Washington, and in sending forth missionaries to all parts of the world. Put your hearts into the efforts, that soon the word may go forth that the needed means has been supplied, and that the work may go forward with joyful despatch.\"--Extract from Testimony, written March 30, 1905.",
