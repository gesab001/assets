    "word": "We shall be known by the fruit that appears in our lives. A pure fountain will not send forth an impure stream, neither will a true Christian \n\n\n                                    -255- \n\nutter words of abuse, or enter into contention with those around him. When we set our hearts on God, we shall have a constant battle to fight; for we have the enemy of all righteousness to contend with. In every conceivable way he will seek to discourage us and cast us down. The world stands opposed to Christ and His work. But those who are striving to do the will of God have this consolation--they are united with the highest authorities of heaven. Trusting in Christ, and advancing step by step, the children of God will gain the victory.",
