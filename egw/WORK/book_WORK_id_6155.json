They \n                                                                           128\ndo not build up the work of God. They do not seek to redress the wrongs of the innocent, to plead the cause of the widow and the orphan, or to reveal a lofty pattern of character before high and low, showing a spirit of beneficence and virtue.

This class are not doing the will of the Father in heaven, and they will hear the stern command, \"Depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.\"--R. & H, Feb. 14, 1888.",
