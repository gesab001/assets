    "word": "There is great need for men of wisdom in every place; but it is an error to depend upon those who do not love the Lord, and seek unto him for wisdom, sanctification, and righteousness. God has not given his work to be moulded by those upon whom his mould has not been placed because they did not want the divine credentials. Through your connection \n                                                                           1524\nwith them, your own ideas have become perverted, and they need purifying. You view things very much as these men view them. You see little the extent and the necessity for the change which the Lord calls for. You have strengthened these men in their belief that they are right, and have deepened their deception. These things the Lord will not long tolerate; for you have had light; you have not been left in ignorance and darkness.",
