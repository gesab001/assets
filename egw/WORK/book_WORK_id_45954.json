    "word": "Well, our meetings are going forward well. There are advancements being made. I spoke to them yesterday in regard to there being regular organized efforts to carry forward the work more thoroughly and taking advantage of all the ability possible to push it. There has been a great want of well-organized efforts. Elder Matteson has worked hard both in writing and speaking. He has a great deal to do in translating and to keep the papers going.
