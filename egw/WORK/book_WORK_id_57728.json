    "word": "But few have courage to do this; yet it is the only Christlike course that will prevent divisions. It is the work of Satan to cause alienation. He knows that it will separate brethren from one another, and more than this, separate them from God. And if ever there was a time in this earth's history when this would be an offense to God and perilous to our souls, it is now. O, if all would be aroused to know what is close upon us, if they would awake out of sleep and draw nigh to God, many souls would be saved. But there are many who are as blind as were the Jews in the days of Christ. Some who have preached the truth, and some who are still preaching, are spiritually blind, and spiritually deaf. They will never have their eyes opened, they will never hear nor understand, any more than did the Jews. One who is in blindness of mind leads another who is also blind. Would it not be well for us individually to examine closely our own position before God in the light of his holy word, and see our own special peril? God does not separate from his people, but his people separate themselves from God by their own course of action. And I know of no sins greater in the sight of God than cherishing jealousy and hatred toward brethren, and turning the weapons of warfare against them.",
