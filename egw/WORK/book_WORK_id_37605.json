    "word": "When those who advocate hygienic reform carry the matter to extremes, people are not to blame if they become disgusted. Too often our religious faith is thus brought into disrepute, and in many cases those who witness such exhibitions of inconsistency can never afterward be brought to think that there is anything good in the reform. These extremists do more harm in a few months than they can undo in a lifetime. They are engaged in a work which Satan loves to see go on. . . . Narrow ideas and overstraining of small points have been a great injury to the cause of hygiene.-- Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, pp. 55-57.",
