    "word": "Co-operation of Parents and Teacher.--When the child is old enough to be sent to school, the teacher should co-operate with the parents, and manual training should be continued as a part of his school duties.

They think useful employment, like learning a trade, \n\n\n                     -17- \n\ndegrading; but such persons have an incorrect idea of what constitutes true dignity. Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who is One with the Father, the Commander in the heavenly courts, was the personal instructor and guide of the children of Israel; and among them it was required that every youth should learn how to work. All were to be educated in some business line, that they might possess a knowledge of practical life and be not only self-sustaining, but useful. This was the instruction which God gave to his people.--Sp. Test., pp. 37, 38.",
