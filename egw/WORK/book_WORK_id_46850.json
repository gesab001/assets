    "word": "We are close to the time spoken of by Daniel the prophet: \"At that time shall Michael stand up, that great prince that standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation, even to that same time: but at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one whose name shall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.\" [Daniel 12:1-3.] The Lord is about to do a short and effectual work in the earth. . . .",
