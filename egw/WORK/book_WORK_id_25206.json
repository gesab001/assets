    "word": "Today in the religious world there are multitudes who, as they believe, are working for the establishment of the kingdom of Christ as an earthly and temporal dominion. They desire to make our Lord the ruler of the kingdoms of this world, the ruler in its courts and camps, its legislative halls, its palaces and market places. They expect Him to rule through legal enactments, enforced by human authority. Since Christ is not now here in person, they themselves will undertake to act in His stead. . . . The establishment of such a kingdom is what the Jews desired in the days of Christ. . . . But He said, \"My kingdom is not of this world.\" He would not accept the earthly throne.",
