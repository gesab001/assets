    "word": "I should have placed Wallsend before this last mentioned suburb. Wallsend, which is nineteen miles from Cooranbong, is divided into three parts--West Wallsend, Young Wallsend, and Wallsend proper. Some time ago Sara McEnterfer and I drove to this place. Part of the road has been newly worked, and for some distance it was hard travelling for the horses; but passing this, we had a good hard road for the remainder of the journey. We passed Cockle Creek, a little town which must be worked, and a little later came to West Wallsend. Two or three miles further on was Young Wallsend, and a drive of another five miles brought us to Wallsend proper. Three and a half hours from the time we left Cooranbong we were at the mission at Wallsend. When the roads are finished, we shall be able to make the journey in three hours.",
