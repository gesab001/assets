Our sanitariums are the right hand of the gospel, opening ways whereby suffering humanity may be reached with the glad tidings of healing through Christ. In these institutions the sick may be taught to commit their cases to the great Physician, who will co-operate with their earnest efforts to regain health, bringing to them healing of soul as well as healing of body.",
