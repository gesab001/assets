    "word": "Parents should redouble their efforts for the salvation of their children. They should faithfully instruct them, and not leave them to gather up their education as best they can. They should not be left to learn good and bad indiscriminately, with the idea that at some future time the good will predominate, and the evil lose its influence. The evil will increase faster than the good. It is possible the evil they have learned might be eradicated after many years; but who will venture this? Time is short. It is easier and much safer to sow clean and good seed in the hearts of your children, than to pluck up the weeds afterward. It is the parents' duty to watch lest surrounding influence have an injurious effect upon their children. It is their duty to select the society for them, and not suffer them to choose for themselves. If parents do not do this work, who will? Can others have that interest for your children which you should have? Can they have that constant care and deep love that parents have?",
