    "word": "God has come very nigh to us; He has honored us by making us the depositaries of His truth, and this places us under the most sacred obligations to be keepers and diffusers of the light that must illuminate those who are in darkness. Has God made a mistake in us? Are we His chosen vessels? Are we the agents whom He has selected to carry out and send forth the last message of mercy to the world? Oh if we only had Jesus in our works, if His Spirit controlled our actions, if it was the rule and law of our life what a power for good we should be in the world.",
