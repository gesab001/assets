    "word": "The Lord would have us represent Christ, and show to the world His attractive character. We may have joy in the Lord if we will hear His commandments. If we indeed have our citizenship above, and a title to an immortal inheritance, an eternal substance, then let us have that faith that works by love and purifies the soul from every spiritual defilement. If our citizenship is above, what right have we to be engaging in political strifes? We are not called to any such service. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty\" (2 Corinthians 6:17, 18). What more could we ask? We shall be members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ to an immortal inheritance. We shall have the crown of life that fadeth not away. . . .",
