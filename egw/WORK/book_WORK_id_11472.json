    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     A powerful discourse delivered from the desk may affect minds; but a little imprudence on the part of the minister out of the pulpit, a lack of gravity of speech and true godliness, will counteract his influence, and do away the good impressions made by him. The converts will be his; in many instances they will seek to rise no higher than their preacher. There will be in them no thorough heart work. They are not converted to God. The work is superficial, and their influence will be an injury to those who are really seeking the Lord.\u2014Vol. I, p. 380.",
