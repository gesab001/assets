    "word": "The Lord worked for me and through me in your behalf at the Retreat. The burden is no longer mine but yours. I have done my duty in the fear of God, and I humbly hope and pray that you may not move blindly in your own spirit and walk in the sparks of your own kindling. I have nothing further to say upon the point in question. If the Lord will only lead you, then all will be well. If you take your case in your hands, then you will follow your own mind irrespective of God's leadings.",
