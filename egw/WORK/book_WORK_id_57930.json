    "word": "Friday, April 21, 1893 \n     This day has been a day of great weariness to me because of the constant strain brought upon me in getting off essential writings, but the Lord will help me; He will strengthen me to do the work necessary to be done. Preparations are being made to go out six miles to Mentone on the Sabbath. Today the sun is shining and it may be pleasant on the morrow. We have had no sun, but plenty of clouds like a thick blanket have shrouded the heavens, and we hail the sunshine with much joy.",
