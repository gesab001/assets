    "word": "Prescott to Assist Uriah Smith in Editing the Review (To Elder and Mrs. W. W. Prescott)--I wish that I could see you. I should like to talk with you. I shall feel thankful indeed if you can connect with Elder Smith in the editorial work on the Review and Herald. You have had experience as an editor, and you can be a great help to Elder Smith. He should not be left out of the editorial work. In no case drop his name off the editorial list. You should cooperate with him in the work, that you and his son Leon may together be the strength that he needs. . . .",
