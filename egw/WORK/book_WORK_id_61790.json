    "word": "January 27, 1910 \nElder H. W. Cottrell \n\n\n     Those who have the responsibility of locating and keeping in operation our sanitariums and schools, are ever to bear in mind that these institutions are to be regarded as divinely appointed agencies for the restoration of the entire man, physical, mental, and spiritual. In planning for the establishment of sanitariums in places where God has designated we should do a special work, we are to allow no selfishness, no personal ambition to mar the work. Over and over again I have repeated that the establishment and maintenance of sanitariums is ordained of God for the advancement of His cause in the earth. While Christ was on this earth, He ministered to the needs of suffering humanity. He is our example. We are to labor intelligently; and in planning for the extension of Sanitarium work, we are to seek to secure the very places that God indicates are most suitable for carrying forward this line of our work.",
