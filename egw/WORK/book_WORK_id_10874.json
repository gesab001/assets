    "word": "The hypocrisy of the Pharisees was the product of self-seeking. The glorification of themselves was the object of their lives. . . . Even the disciples, though outwardly they had left all for Jesus' sake, had not in heart ceased to seek great things for themselves. . . . As leaven, if left to complete its work, will cause corruption and decay, so does the self-seeking spirit, cherished, work the defilement and ruin of the soul. Among the followers of our Lord today, as of old, how widespread is this subtle, deceptive sin! How often our service to Christ, our communion with one another, is marred by the secret desire to exalt self! . . . To His own disciples the warning words of Christ are spoken, \"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees.\" . . . Only the power of God can banish self-seeking and hypocrisy.",
