    "word": "Truth, precious truth, is sanctifying in its influence. The sanctification of the soul by the operation of the Holy Spirit is the implanting of Christ's nature in humanity.

Thus the character is transformed more and more perfectly after the image of Christ in righteousness and true holiness.",
