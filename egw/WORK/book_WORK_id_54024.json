    "word": "Let not human pride hurt your record. Do you not suppose the Lord sees, and is acquainted with the favorable and unfavorable presentations? Has not the Lord an oversight over His own work? You may suppose, my brethren, that you have to do all the devising, all the strengthening, and all the organizing, and I ask you, Is it not best to show that you have confidence in God? Is it not best to consider that our God is manager--that He is director? You must not be anxious to develop too fast. The hand of Providence is holding the machinery. When that hand starts the wheel, then all things will begin to move.",
