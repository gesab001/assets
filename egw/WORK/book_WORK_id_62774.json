    "word": "Students, study for time and for eternity. Bring good, hard, earnest labor into your scholastic life. Do not feel that you must take a classical course before you enter the ministry. The Lord has given light that the largest number who have done this have, through the protracted study of books, disqualified themselves for the labor which was essential for them to do. What is Paul's charge to Timothy? \"Therefore, I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Jesus Christ with eternal glory. It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him he also will deny us; if we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he can not deny himself. Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" \n\n\n                                       (Signed) Mrs. E. G. White",
