    "word": "It is that such work as this may be done that we wish to establish a sanitarium. We ask you to give us a liberal donation. A great work can be accomplished for the Lord by a well conducted sanitarium. We have demonstrated this in America. To our sanitarium in America have come lawyers, doctors, senators, \n\n\n                                   - 87 - \n\nand judges, to be guarded day and night against the cruel appetite for alcohol, tobacco, and morphine. Eternity alone can reveal the good that has been accomplished for them. They have gone forth to proclaim the glory of God and to do honor to His name.",
