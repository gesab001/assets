In the privacy of his chamber he was heard to pour out his soul before God in words full of adoration, fear, and hope, as if speaking to a friend. \u201cI know that thou art our Father and our God,\u201d he said, \u201cand that thou wilt scatter the persecutors of thy children; for thou art thyself endangered with us. All this matter is thine, and it is only by thy constraint that we have put our hands to it.

I hate with exceeding hatred those extreme cares which consume you.
