    "word": "The work of cultivating the heart is profitable at all times and in all places. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). We may learn a lesson from the work of the farmer in cultivating the field. He must cooperate with God. His part is to prepare the ground, and plant the seed, at the right time and in the right way. God gives the seed life. He sends the sunshine and the showers, and the seed springs up, \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear\" (Mark 4:28). If the farmer fails to do his part, if the human agent does not cooperate with divine agencies, the sun may shine, the dew and the showers may fall upon the soil, but there will be no harvest. And though the work of planting had been done, unless God sent the sunshine and the dew and the rain, the seed would never, never spring up and grow.",
