    "word": "Fair weather disciples will not answer to the Lord's call in time of peril toward which we are hastening. It will take those who not only hear but do the words of Christ to be active disciples--\"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord\" (Romans 12:11). A new energy proceeding from beneath is taking possession of the whole synagogue of Satan, and a new life descending from heaven is taking possession of every human agent who is consecrated, devoted, and who is seeking to work the works of God. . . .",
