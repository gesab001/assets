    "word": "Word has come to me that letters have been sent out to our churches in the different States, offering our youth special inducements to connect with the Battle Creek Sanitarium. The leading men in our conferences are requested to send their most promising young men and young women to the Battle Creek Sanitarium to be educated and trained as nurses. This is an effort to counter-work the counsel of the Lord. Those who present these inducements are working contrary to the will of the Lord.",
