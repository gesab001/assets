    "word": "Personal Appeal \n\n     God calls upon you who are connected with his instrumentalities, to do his work according to his plans, not your own. He calls for an entire consecration of yourselves to him. If you heed the requirement, it will be a blessing to you in this life and the inheritance of life eternal. There is now a precious period, though short, allotted to you for repentance and improvement.",
