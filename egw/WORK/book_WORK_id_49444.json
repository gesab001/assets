    "word": "Educational Standards Not to Be Lowered (To Elder and Mrs. W. W. Prescott)--I read your letter to Elder Starr, and was somewhat troubled by its contents. No movement should be made to lower the standard of education in our school at Battle Creek. The students should tax the mental powers, every faculty should reach the highest possible development. Many students \n\n\n                                   -348- \n\ncome to the college with intellectual habits partially formed that are a hindrance to them. The most difficult to manage is the habit of performing their work as a matter of routine, instead of bringing to their studies thoughtful, determined effort to master difficulties, and to grasp the principles at the foundation of every subject under consideration.",
