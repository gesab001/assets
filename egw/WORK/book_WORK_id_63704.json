    "word": "In visions of the night I seemed to be in a large congregation \n\n                             -407- \n\nof our people in Nashville. One of authority stood before us. Reaching out His hand, he turned himself in every direction, saying, There is missionary work to be done in all the settlements about Nashville. There are among you those who should exercise their inventive faculties to devise plans for reaching the perishing souls whom you have neglected. When you take up the work that should be done in needy settlements right within your borders, the presence of the Lord will be with you, and angels will go before you. Your faculties will develop and your capabilities for work increase. And from Nashville you will pass to other cities to do the work that is waiting to be done. There is dearth of men and dearth of means; but when the missionary spirit shall be awakened, and you take hold of the work wherever you see souls hungering for the truth, then you will grow in grace and efficiency. There is work for all who want to work in the way Christ worked.",
