    "word": "His people are to preserve their peculiar character as His representatives. There is work for every one of them to do. The rich should bring their means, the honored their influence, the learned their wisdom, the poor their virtue, if they would be effective workers with God. They are to bring themselves into right relation with God, that they may reflect the light of the glory of God that shines in the face of Jesus Christ. . . . They are to warn men of the coming judgments. They are to represent Christ to the people.--Signs of the Times, June 24, 1889.",
