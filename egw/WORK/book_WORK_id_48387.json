    "word": "You lack inward rectitude. You act as if nobody's judgment of men and things were equal to yours. Your manners you make engaging. The depravity of your heart finds occasions for its workings, and an outlet for its influence upon those who are charmed with your ways and manners. If you had real Christian principle ruling the heart and controlling the conduct you would not seduce poor inexperienced souls to violate the law of God and thus accomplish their ruin, not only in this life, but for the next world.-- Letter 19, 1875, p. 1. (To \"Dear Friend Cook,\" June 14, 1875.) Released February 1, 1978.",
