    "word": "The Witness from heaven said, \"I will turn my face from you for your pleasant picture and your selfish practices which are misrepresenting the religion of Jesus Christ, and preparing a people, through denying him in practice, to be ensnared by the deceptions of these last days.\" Every device that Satan can invent to make our people disloyal to Jesus Christ, the Captain of our salvation, will be ready at hand. The notices given in our papers extolling bicycles might better be cut out and in their place the destitute foreign fields be represented. \n\n\n                         -2- \n\n\"My people,\" saith the Lord, \"do err and separate from the Source of their strength. In their works they deny me, and I will turn my face from them, unless they repent and do their first works.\"",
