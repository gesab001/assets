    "word": "Christ came to our world to set his followers an example of perfection of character, that in his strength they might become Christlike, building for time and for eternity. I am bidden to give all our workers, men and women, a most solemn charge; if you (923) are not truly converted, God can not use you. In word, in spirit, and in all your works you are to bear testimony to the truth, making straight paths for your feet lest the lame be turned out of the way by your walking in strange paths.",
