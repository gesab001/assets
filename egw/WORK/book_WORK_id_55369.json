    "word": "Lynn, Massachusetts, ca. December 4,1890\n [ELLEN WHITE DOES NOT HERE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THE SOURCE             OF THESE COMMENTS CONCERNING THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, THE ADVENTIST WEEKLY RELIGIOUS LIBERTY JOURNAL. HOWEVER, HER COUNSELS HERE ARE SIMILAR TO HER LATER DESCRIPTION OF THE SALAMANCA VISION, AND MAY BE BASED ON WHAT SHE WAS SHOWN IN THAT VISION.] \n\n\n     The people of the world will try to induce us to soften our message, to suppress one of its more distinctive features. They say: \"Why do you in your teaching make the seventh-day Sabbath so prominent? This seems to be always thrust before us; we should harmonize with you if you would not say so much on this point; keep the seventh-day Sabbath out of the Sentinel, and we will give it our influence and support.\" And there has been a disposition on the part of some of our workers to adopt this policy.",
