    "word": "The establishment of a health institution is too important a matter to be left to the independent management of a few interested individuals. If the enterprise is under the control of the General Conference, the way is open for deliberate counsel and a careful consideration of the matter and its relation to the great whole; and if it is undertaken, there will be a united force to give it influence and standing. This will contribute largely to its success. Under such management, a class of workers could be enlisted that otherwise could not be secured, and thus the enterprise would prosper when it would prove a failure in ordinary hands. And furthermore, there must be an authority to guard such institutions, so that persons who are not qualified shall not be allowed to grasp responsibilities through selfish ambition in their professional line as physicians.",
