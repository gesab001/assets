    "word": "MR No. 495 - Last-Day Missionary Work\n\n     We are nearing the end of this earth's history, and the different lines of God's work are to be carried forward with much more self-sacrifice than they have yet been. The work for these last days is not a work for display but of consecrated service; it is a missionary work. Present truth, from the first letter of its alphabet to the last, means missionary effort. The work to be done calls for sacrifice at every step of advance. The workers are to come forth from trial purified and refined, as gold tried in the fire.-- Letter 130, 1902, p. 8. (To J. E. White, August 14, 1902.) \n\nReleased April 28, 1976.",
