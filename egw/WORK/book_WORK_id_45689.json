    "word": "(Colorado,) Monday, June 30, 1873. We arrived at the Mills late in the afternoon. . . . We went to the old mill and commenced housekeeping. . . . We cleaned two rooms. . . . Mr. Walling came with a load of furniture and things he thought we needed. We have all been very busy and cheerful in our work. We had a praying season in the woods. We prayed to God to let His blessing rest upon us as we were settling in the mountains that we might have strength and retirement to write.--Ms 8, 1873 \n\n\n                                      -161-",
