    "word": "These Scriptures were given me to give to you. Especially were the principles laid down in the twelfth chapter of Romans enjoined upon you for careful study. The men of God's appointment will not be sustained if they are not doers of His Word, in small matters as well as large. You are in positive danger. Satan is trying by every device to weaken you, so that you will become exalted in your own opinion. Thus you will permit the enemy to gain power over you. God, who is high and lifted up, will use men as His instruments as long as they will work humbly, seeking wisdom from Him.",
