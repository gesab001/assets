    "word": "I am unable to explain the reason for the position that Captain Eldridge and Frank Belden have taken. What can they mean, to drop the Patriarchs and Prophets and Great Controversy and say they have decided to handle only one book, which is Bible Readings, to occupy the field at one time? This is contrary to our custom and to truth and justice, and contrary to the light God has given me in reference to the canvassing work. This is certainly a device of Satan. God pity His people, that His words shall be held back through the devising of men who are but children in experience in the truth God has given to His people. I feel such a burden of warning on my soul because the light that was given--the word of the Lord--was that there must be no delay in getting the special warnings contained in these books before the people. If they were properly circulated, I have been shown it would prevent many from uniting in a petition to Congress to make Sunday observance a law. Many honest souls, if the light of truth contained in the books had come to them, would not have put their names to that petition--supposing they were doing God service when they were exalting a spurious sabbath that had not \"It is written\" for its authority. Who will bear the responsibility men dare take upon themselves without the least regard to \n                                                                           873\nanything I may say to change this? And what does it all mean? Bible Readings has not the message giving the certain warnings and the light that the people must have now.",
