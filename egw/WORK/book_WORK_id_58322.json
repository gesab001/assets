    "word": "In humility Christ began his mighty work of lifting the fallen race from the degradation of sin, recovering them by his divine power, which he had linked with humanity. Passing by the grand cities, and the renowned places of learning and supposed wisdom, he made his home in the humble and obscure village of Nazareth. The greater part of his life was passed in this place, from which it was commonly believed that no good thing could come. In the path which the poor, the neglected, the suffering, and the sorrowing must tread, he walked while on earth, taking upon him all the woes which the afflicted must bear. His home was among the poor. His family was not distinguished by learning, riches, or position. For many years he worked at his trade as a carpenter. \n                                                                           1562",
