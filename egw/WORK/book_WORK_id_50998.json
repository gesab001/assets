    "word": "As food to the hungry and water to the thirsty, so is the doing of God's work to those who obey His will because they love Him. Those who are engaged in the work of the ministry are to give evidence that God has a message for them to bear and a work for them to do. They are to labor in the spirit of meekness, showing that they have learned in the school of Christ His lowliness of heart. Those who are ever humble and contrite carry with them the evidence that they have been with Jesus and learned of Him. \"Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and \n\n\n                                   -144- \n\nhumble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones\" [Isaiah 57:15]. \"The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool: where is the house that ye build unto Me? and where is the place of My rest? For all those things hath Mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word\" [Isaiah 66:1, 2]. God knows how to distinguish between the righteous and the wicked in His church. To those who do righteously He will give peace and comfort and a good hope in this life, because they are partakers of the divine nature and are striving to overcome the corruption that is in the world through lust.",
