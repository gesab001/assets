I have been unable to sleep, as I have been many nights, because of great distress for the cause of God and the church at Battle Creek. I thought when my work was done in writing out Testimony No. 31, I should then be free; but last night I was, in my dreams, in your meetings. I heard your testimonies; I felt your spirit. Some were humbling their souls before God. With confession and humiliation, they made their way out of the darkness, while Eld. Smith, Bro. McLearn, and Wm. Gage seemed to feel no spirit of confession; and these very men who had brought the church into difficulty, were not by their own course of action leading them out. I heard testimonies borne to have a soothing influence upon the people.",
