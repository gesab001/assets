    "word": "MR No. 711 - The Sacredness and Value of Adventist History\n\n     Since the rise of the first and second angels' messages I have taken an active part in the work, and the evidence as it is now given cannot be controverted from the Word of God. We have not a shadow of a doubt as to the correct understanding of the order and character of the third angel's message and the two preceding it. We are now living under the proclamation of the message of the third angel. Many attempts will be made, as there have been in the past, to weave into the work human theories. Diligent study will be made to get up something original, but we may say, as did Paul, \"Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ\" (1 Corinthians 3:11).",
