The apostle Paul, writing to the Thessalonian converts, says: \"What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? for ye are our glory and joy.\" [1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20.] And he exhorts the Philippian brethren to be \"blameless and harmless,\" to \"shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.\" [Philippians 2:15, 16.]",
