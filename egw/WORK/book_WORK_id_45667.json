    "word": "I have felt that if God would give me my own children, my life has not been in vain, but it has required labor and tears. There is a great responsibility resting upon the head of the family. When I have seen my children wading through temptation I have spent all night with them in prayer. I am a mother of boys, and my heart is drawn out for everyone who has the responsibility of a family. Those who are engaged in the training of children are engaged in a great work. It will take patience and perseverance to do the work aright.",
