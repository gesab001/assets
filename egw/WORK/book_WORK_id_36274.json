    "word": "All who surrender themselves to God in unselfish service for humanity are in cooperation with the Lord of glory. This thought sweetens all toil, it braces the will, it nerves the spirit for whatever may befall. Working with unselfish heart, ennobled by being partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings, sharing His sympathies, they help to swell the tide of His joy, and bring honor and praise to His exalted name.",
