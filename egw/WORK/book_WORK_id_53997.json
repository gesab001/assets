Faulkhead.) \n\n\n     I am anxious that you shall be a free man from the slavery of all bondage. You have been binding yourself in bundles with those who are an offense to God. Your brethren, or many of them, do not know that which you yourself and the Lord know--the inward workings of the association with which you are connected. You do not yourself know its character. You are like a man intoxicated; every advancement perverts your senses.",
