    "word": "(B-132-08) \"There is a very precious work to be done in connection with the interest of the sanitarium and school at Loma Linda, and this will be done when all work to that end. Ever bear in mind that Heaven is interested in every question that agitates your mind in regard to your school and sanitarium. Both are to be strengthened. . . In our school at Loma Linda many can be educated to work as missionaries in the cause of Health and Temperance. The best teachers are to be employed in this educational work not men who esteem highly their own capabilities, but men who will walk circumspectly, depending wholly upon the Lord.\"",
