    "word": "MR No. 1265 - Minds of Committee Members to be Worked by the Holy Spirit; The Marks of Christlikeness\n\n     There are many things that should be conducted in a more serious way. There have been board meetings and council meetings where certain principles have been placed before the board and resolutions voted to be carried out. Elder Olsen has supposed that the matter would be conducted on correct principles, and he trusted matters too much to others to carry out. But there were unfaithful stewards in responsible positions who appeared to sanction the propositions but who had not the least intention of carrying them out. They would do the opposite of that which came before them for their decisions. Therefore wrongs were practiced and evils were carried out in untruthful, deceptive lines.",
