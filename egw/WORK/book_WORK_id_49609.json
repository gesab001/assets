    "word": "The Lord is not pleased with the spirit or the principles that have a controlling power in the Review and Herald office. The strong spirit of man rules; not the spirit of God. God will not work with their devising. When men get out of the Lord's way, and let Him work upon hearts and minds, blessings will come to them. The fervent prayers, the sincere humiliation, the self-denial and self-sacrifice which blends with the supplications made, will bring down rich blessings.",
