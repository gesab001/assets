    "word": "God designs that the sick, the unfortunate, those possessed of evil spirits, shall hear His voice through us. Through His human agencies He desires to be a Comforter such as the world has never before seen. His words are to be voiced, \"Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye believe in God, believe also in Me.\" The Lord has not given us the work of reasoning out the things that we do not comprehend until we are satisfied. We must take the Word as it reads.",
