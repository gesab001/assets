    "word": "Since the last General Conference, this matter has been clearly presented to me. Our restaurants should not be opened on the Sabbath. Unless they are closed, and the Lord's day is honored, the blessing of God can not be expected to rest upon this branch of His work. Those who are engaged in our restaurants must have opportunity to rest on the Sabbath, else they will backslide. The Lord does not require them to furnish meals for the public on the Sabbath. If those who come to our restaurants choose to take away with them on Friday, health foods sufficient to last over the Sabbath, let them do this. But our restaurant workers should not be asked to work on the Sabbath.",
