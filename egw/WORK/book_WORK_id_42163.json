    "word": "\"The Lord permitted the men in the Review Office to have an opportunity of manifesting what character they would develop. They have shown that they could not resist the temptation to commit robbery of God, if they had a chance, confederating to take from his treasury all they could grasp; some were ready to receive more than they did. They knew that this was unjust and dishonest. Are they as willing that others should have what is only their due because God has given them ability, tact, mental capacity, equal to, and in advance of, them?--No, no; they would bring under the contribution to the treasury every available talent of ability to acquire means to be employed in the advancement of the work. Their tact in this line of robbery is great. They felt authorized to accept of large remuneration for their own work in restricting others, denying them the opportunities and means Providence had offered them to labor as his instrumentalities, to carry on his work. God says, 'I hate robbery for burnt offering.' The men who value their own souls will, by the grace of God, guard against the first tinge of unfairness in deal, the first approach to the ungodly practises of the world,-- the practises that prevailed in the days of Noah and Lot. The poison has been at work for a long time, and others are drinking of the cup. Wake up, Brother Olsen, wake up.\"",
