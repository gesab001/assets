    "word": "The law of God is to be the means of education in the family. Parents are under a most solemn obligation to obey this law, setting their children an example of the strictest integrity. Men in responsible positions, whose influence is far-reaching, are to guard well their ways and works, keeping the fear of the Lord ever before them. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" Psalms 111:10. Those who hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord and cheerfully keep His commandments, will be among the number who see God. \"The Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Lord our God, for our good always, \n                                                                           8\nthat He might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us.\" Deuteronomy 6:24, 25.",
