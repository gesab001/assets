    "word": "The Lord has not given wisdom regarding the medical missionary \n\n                               -367- \n\nwork only to the men associated in the work at Battle Creek. Humanity is not divinity. The most talented men in our ranks are not infallible. Not all of their methods are inspired of God. They make mistakes and they will continue to make mistakes if they do not walk in humble faith before God. The greatest temptations come to the men who bear the greatest responsibilities. Our only safety is in humbling the heart before God daily, and watching diligently lest any threads of selfishness are woven into the work. Let us so labor that it will be plainly seen that self is dead, and that our work bears the signature of heaven.",
