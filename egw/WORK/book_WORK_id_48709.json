    "word": "Our camp meetings are God's instrumentalities. The people of all denominations come out to hear, and the truth is proclaimed. God bids us to give the people Bible truth for this time. Revelation means just what it expresses--revelation--truths revealed-- and the blessing is pronounced on all who give heed to the things written in this book. (See Revelation 1:1-3.) The truths contained in the Revelation are to be taught, and we are all to learn the lessons of the fearful import of the things to transpire in these last days of this earth's history. You have lost sight of these things. Other things introduced by you have not come in under the instruction of God. You need to be converted. You need to bear in mind that your mind and your judgment is not the great whole. God is the teacher. He has exalted you to be a wise man, to stand at your appointed post of duty. Our work we are trying to carry out just as the Lord has outlined it, years ago, and repeated it over again and again.",
