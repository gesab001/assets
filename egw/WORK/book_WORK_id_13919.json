    "word": "But this Satan is determined to prevent. Therefore he tempts men to the use of wine and strong drink, by which the understanding is darkened, the senses confused, and the image of God defaced. By the indulgence of appetite the perceptions become so blunted that men cannot discern God in his works; they may range through the most beautiful scenes in nature, but they have not a thought of the Creator. How many, endowed with good natural abilities, thus degrade the intellect and dishonor God. Their nature becomes brutish; it is impossible for them to be heavenly-minded. They have rendered themselves incapable of governing or guiding the springs of mental or moral activity. Thus Satan prevents man from fulfilling the destiny which Heaven has marked out for him,\u2014to reach the highest attainments, physical, mental, and moral, that he himself may be happy, that his fellow-men may be blessed by his example, and that God may be glorified.",
