    "word": "There is one thing upon which I am settled. It is not the duty of the Lord's children to remain in an objectionable climate, and be continually failing in health. Many of our brethren have done this and have lost their lives. When in a place where the atmosphere is filled with friction, when the work of a laborer is made exceeding hard by those who are continually counterworking his efforts and scheming to obtain advantage, then let the laborer go to some place where the atmosphere is more healthful spiritually, and where he can have more hope of success. . . .",
