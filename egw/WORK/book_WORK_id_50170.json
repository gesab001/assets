    "word": "In the past Brother and Sister Hurlbutt have given a home to cast-out and orphan children; but this work has been broken up by the illness of the husband. These people have thought that they might establish an orphanage at their home, but they cannot without efficient help carry on such an enterprise. The Lord understands better than we do how to manage such important matters as the education and training of the youth. Wherever such schools are located, whether they be for white or colored people, they should always have connected with them wise, strong managers.",
