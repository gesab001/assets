    "word": "Anciently it was a great sin for the people of God to give themselves away to the enemy, and open before them either their perplexity or prosperity. It was a sin in the ancient economy to offer upon a wrong altar. It was a sin to offer incense kindled from a strange fire. We are in danger of co-mingling the sacred and the common. The holy fire from God is to be used in our efforts. The right altar is Christ. The true fire is the Holy Spirit. This is our inspiration. It is the Holy Spirit that leads and guides the man and makes him sure in counsel. If we turn aside from God's chosen ones and from God to inquire at strange altars, we shall be answered according to our works.",
