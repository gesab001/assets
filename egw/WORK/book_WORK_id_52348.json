    "word": "The responsibility of each soul is measured by the endowment of grace he has received from God. All are to be laborers together with God.

They may engage in many lines, they may lead a very busy life; but this is of no account with God. Are they yoked up with Christ? is the question God asks. Do they work in Christ's lines, or do they reveal their hereditary and cultivated tendencies?",
