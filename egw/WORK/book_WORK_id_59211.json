    "word": "These messages must go to all the inhabitants of the world. The Lord is soon to come, and he calls upon all to whom he has entrusted his capital of means to invest it in his work as it demands help. His money is not to be shut up in banks and buildings and lands when there is such a great work to be accomplished. The Lord will not send His judgments for disobedience and transgression upon the world until he has sent his watchmen to give the message of warning.",
