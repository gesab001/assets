    "word": "The question has been asked if it would be well to establish our college so near to the St. Helena Sanitarium. Recently, I have written much regarding the advantages of establishing our schools close to our health institutions, that the older students may have the benefits of the united instruction in the work of ministry and the care of the sick. Our schools should be near our sanitariums, but not so close as to interfere with their work. If the instruction that has been given regarding this matter is followed, the students will reap great advantages.",
