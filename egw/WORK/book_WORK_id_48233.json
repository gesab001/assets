    "word": "I drive my own two horse team, visit the lumber mills and order lumber, to save the time of the workmen, and go out in search of our cows. I have purchased two good cows--that is, good for this locality. Almost everywhere in the colonies they have a strange custom of confining the cow at milking time. They put her head in a fixture called a bail, then tie up one of her legs to a stake. It is a barbarous practice. I told those of whom I bought my cows that I should do no such thing, but leave the creatures free, and teach them to stand still. The owner looked at me in astonishment, \"You cannot do this, Mrs. White,\" he said. \"They will not stand. No one thinks of doing any \n\n\n                                    -93- \n\nother way.\" \"Well,\" I answered, \"I shall give you an example of what can be done.\" I have not had a rope on the cow's leg, or had her head put into a bail. One of my cows had run on the mountains till she was three years old, and was never milked before.",
