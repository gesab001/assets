    "word": "My Brother Jones, you need the subduing influence of the Spirit of God. You have hereditary traits of character that are constantly striving for the supremacy. Character is power. It is an influence which makes friends. Worked by the Holy Spirit's power, self will die; but all the preaching a man may do will not make character. It is essential that the foundation cornerstone be laid aright. All your phases of character are to be guarded.",
