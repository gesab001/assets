WE WERE ALSO PROFOUNDLY THANKFUL TO OUR BRETHREN IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT, AND ALSO TO BRETHREN IN BOSTON, NEW YORK, AND CHICAGO, FOR HELPING TO FIND IN THE GREAT LIBRARIES, AND VERIFY, THOSE QUOTATIONS THAT WERE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE. THEY HAVE DONE THIS WORK AT OUR REQUEST, AND TO HELP US IN WHAT WE THOUGHT OUGHT TO BE DONE. THE USES MADE OF THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH, ARE SEEN IN THE HISTORICAL REFERENCES AT THE FOOT OF THE PAGE AND IN THE APPENDIX.",
