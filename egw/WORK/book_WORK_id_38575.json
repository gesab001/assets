    "word": "A hard, unjust, critical spirit has been indulged among those who have held positions of trust in the work of God. Unless those who have indulged this \n\n\n                           - 11 - \n\nspirit are converted, they will be relieved of the responsibility of acting a part in committees of counsel even in the transaction of business. Unless they are converted, their voices must not be heard in the council; for the aggregate result is more injurious than beneficial. Wrong prevails, man is made an offender for a word, and suspicion, distrust, jealousy, evil-surmising, evil-speaking, and injustice reproduce themselves even in connection with the cause of God. A false zeal passes for jealousy for the cause of God; but the miserable, filthy garment of self must be destroyed, and in its place, men must accept the righteousness of Christ. The persecution that is carried on among church members is a most terrible thing. It is true that some have committed errors, and made mistakes, but it is equally true that these errors and mistakes are not nearly as grievous in the sight of God as is the harsh and unforgiving spirit of those who are criticisers and censors. Many of those who are free to pass judgment on others, are committing errors which, although not made manifest, are tainted with deadly evil that is corrupting their spiritual life.",
