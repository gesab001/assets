    "word": "World conditions prior to Christ's second coming\n     Looking down through the ages to the close of time, Peter was inspired to outline conditions that would exist in the world just prior to the second coming of Christ. \u201cThere shall come in the last days scoffers,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwalking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\u201d But \u201cwhen they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Not all, however, would be ensnared by the enemy's devices. As the end of all things earthly should approach, there would be faithful ones able to discern the signs of the times. While a large number of professing believers would deny their faith by their works, there would be a remnant who would endure to the end.",
