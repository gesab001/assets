    "word": "MR No. 353 - Biographical and a Warning\n\n     I thank the Lord that, however weak I am, He gives me strength when before the people. I am often surprised, and this is my comfort, for I know I could not do the work I have done unless the Lord strengthened me and gave me words to speak to the large crowds. I know better than anyone else how much I suffer at times with physical infirmities, but I will talk as little about these depressing things as possible.--Ms 174, 1903, p. 4. (Diary, July 5 to 31, 1903.)",
