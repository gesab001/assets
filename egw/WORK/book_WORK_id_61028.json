    "word": "Christ's Instruction \n\n     Christ understood the work that needed to be done for suffering humanity. As He was sending out the twelve disciples on their first missionary tour, He said to them, \"As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\" The fulfillment of this commission by the disciples made their message the power of God unto salvation.",
