    "word": "Heaven Ashamed. \n\n     If all could see themselves as they file into the house of God in Battle Creek, the great heart of the work, and know the record which the Lord's watcher bears to heaven of the means squandered on themselves, if they could see the array of figures standing against their names, they would not feel very much satisfaction or real enjoyment in the exhibition of themselves before the heavenly universe. It is written off against their names, \"Thou art weighed in the balances, and found wanting.\" These can not but be the ones included in the number who had the gay apparel, or those who occupied the highest seats. The very principle that leads them to dress as they do, that makes Heaven ashamed of them, will reveal in them a love of dress, a love of outside appearance, at the expense of the soul.",
