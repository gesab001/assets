    "word": "Professed believers who see no work to call them from thinking and planning and working for themselves will not have the rich treasures of truth opened to them, and the truth will not be a savor of life unto them or to others through their influence. Who wears the armor of Jesus Christ? Who are marshalled under the banner to work as faithful, well-disciplined soldiers? God has made us stewards, and it is expected of a steward that he be found faithful.",
