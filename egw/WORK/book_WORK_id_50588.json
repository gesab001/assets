    "word": "While we inscribe on our banner the words, \"The commandments of God and the faith of Jesus,\" we must not forget to cleanse the heart, that it may be a fit dwelling-place for the Holy Spirit. By your words and your works, show that you love God supremely and your neighbor as yourself. The members of Christ's flock are the objects of His constant favor. In holy love to their Saviour and to one another, they are to be hid with Christ in God. Discord and strife testify that the union with Christ is imperfect. God desires us to be bound heart to heart by His Spirit. He will save those who are imbued with His grace, for in dealing with one another they reveal His love and tenderness. They deal generously with one another.",
