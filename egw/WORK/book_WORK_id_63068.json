    "word": "For their usefulness and success, the Lord's servants are dependent on Christ. He reads their hearts. He knows their motives and purposes, and He calls upon them to separate themselves from everything that would prove a hindrance to their success in presenting the truth for this time. This is the work that is to be made first of all. As they give themselves to it, success will surely crown their efforts. Angels of God will impress hearts, and many will be brought into the light of the truth.",
