    "word": "The Lord has need of your words, dictated by his Holy Spirit. He has need of the investment of your means. He needs your work for the salvation of souls. You can permit your means to be taken out of your hands to please your children. You may allow the enemy to rob you of the means that God has called for, to be used in lifting up the standard of truth in places where the people have not yet heard the message. Your means may be sunk in worldly investments, and turned into worldly channels. They may be used to do no one any good. But the Lord the owner of all, will call you to render your account to him.",
