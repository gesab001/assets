    "word": "I spent three weeks at the Paradise Valley Sanitarium, but was sick all the time. I contracted a severe cold on my way down there. In order that the others in the building might not be exposed, I kept very closely to my own room. The day before I left, Brother and Sister Richardson insisted on seeing me, that they might tell me of the many advantages that Jamaica possesses for sanitarium work. I certainly hope that this field may be entered by earnest laborers. I shall not attempt to tell you what Brother and Sister Richardson told me; for I was sick at the time, and could not hear all they said.",
