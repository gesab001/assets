    "word": "The Lord is not unjust to forget your labors of love, but you have mingled with your offerings strange fire, which God has forbidden you and every one of His workers to use. God is dishonored, the truth is brought into disrepute, the work of God is misjudged and reproached, because you have acted in your own unsanctified way, and not in God's way. The honor of God, the salvation of souls, requires that you deny self, and restrain the uprising of passion; but in your unholy zeal you break both tables of the law. You have furnished arguments against the truth in unadvised speech and actions.",
