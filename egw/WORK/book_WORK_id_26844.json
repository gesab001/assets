    "word": "Saul knows not what to do. He imagines Israel as Philistine slaves. He can see no way of escape. In his trouble he offers great reward to any one who will slay the proud boaster. But all feel their weakness. They have a king whom God does not instruct, who dare not engage in any perilous enterprize, for he expects no special interposition from God to save his life. As Israel had been partaker with him in transgression, he had no hope that God would work specially for them, and deliver them out of the hands of the Philistines. The armies of Israel seemed paralyzed with terror. They could not trust in their king, whom they had demanded of God. Saul's mind was changeable. He would for a short time direct the armies, and then fear and discouragement would seize him, and he would countermand his orders.",
