    "word": "The Infinite will work with His power to give you efficiency. Do not think you are left to do impossible things. Do not expect impossible things of others. \"Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God giveth the increase.\" \"Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure. They all shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\"",
