    "word": "A sentiment prevails that commercial work should be divorced from the Office. This is one of the seeds that has been sown. Words have been spoken here and there, and these are taking root to bring about certain results. There are no vital reasons for this, only that minds that ought not to be allowed to run in certain channels unless guarded, have yielded to temptation. Satan will tempt them again and again. Again and again they will pass over the same ground over which he has carried them.",
