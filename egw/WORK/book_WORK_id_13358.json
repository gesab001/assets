    "word": "SATAN\u2019S WORK OF RUIN FOREVER ENDED.\u2014The wicked receive their recompense in the earth. Proverbs 11:31. They \u201cshall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Malachi 4:1. Some are destroyed as in a moment, while others suffer many days. All are punished \u201caccording to their deeds.\u201d The sins of the righteous having been transferred to Satan, he is made to suffer not only for his own rebellion, but for all the sins which he has caused God\u2019s people to commit. His punishment is to be far greater than that of those whom he has deceived. After all have perished who fell by his deceptions, he is still to live and suffer on. In the cleansing flames the wicked are at last destroyed, root and branch\u2014Satan the root, his followers the branches. The full penalty of the law has been visited;\n130\nthe demands of justice have been met; and heaven and earth, beholding, declare the righteousness of Jehovah.",
