    "word": "Is Sister White Getting Rich? \n\n     Sometimes it has been reported that I am trying to get rich. Some have written to us, inquiring, \"Is not Mrs. White worth millions of dollars?\" I am glad that I can say, \"No.\" I do not own in this world any place that is free from debt. Why?--Because I see so much missionary work to be done. Under such circumstances, could I hoard money?--No, indeed. I receive royalties from the sale of my books; but nearly all is spent in missionary work.",
