JONES--AND BROTHER HENRY SAID HE REDUCED IT TO THAT, AGAINST THE TESTIMONIES.  {PH146 30.12}  \n     W. C. SISLEY--WE COULD NOT SELL THE BOOKS AND PAY A HIGHER RATE. NOW IT IS LIKE THIS: \"DANIEL AND REVELATION,\" IF SOLD AT THE TRADE, WOULD SELL FOR $1.50; TEN PER CENT. ROYALTY ON IT WOULD BE FIFTEEN CENTS. NOW THE SAME AMOUNT OF AUTHOR'S WORK SELLS FOR $3.00. SO HE GETS THE SAME IF SOLD AT THE TRADE RATE AT TEN PER CENT. ROYALTY, AS WHEN SOLD ON THE SUBSCRIPTION RATE AT FIVE PER CENT. ROYALTY.  {PH146 30.13}  \n     A. T. JONES--BOOKS WERE SOLD THAT WAY BEFORE THE ROYALTY WAS REDUCED. BROTHER HENRY SAID HE REDUCED IT IN DISREGARD OF THE TESTIMONIES. \n                                                                           31\n {PH146 30.14}  \n     J. I. GIBSON--HAVE YOU NOT BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE RATE OF ROYALTY ALL THE TIME, BROTHER SMITH?",
