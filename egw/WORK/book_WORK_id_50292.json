    "word": "God has not committed to any finite man the work of judging others, for man's judgment would be biased by his peculiar traits of character. Neither had He laid it upon any man to bind the conscience of another, or to pass judgment upon His holy Word, defining what is inspired and what is human. Unless sanctified, soul, body, and spirit, man will be in danger of manifesting an unkindly spirit toward his brother who does not agree with his ideas. There is no such narrowness with God.",
