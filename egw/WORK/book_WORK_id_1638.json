    "word": "From His earliest year, Christ lived a life of toil. In His youth He worked with His father at the carpenter\u2019s trade, and thus showed that there is nothing of which to be ashamed in work. . . . Those who are idle do not follow the example that Christ has given, for from His childhood He was a pattern of obedience and industry. He was as a pleasant sunbeam in the home circle. Faithfully and cheerfully He acted His part, doing the humble duties that He was called to do in His lowly life. Christ became one with us in order that He might do us good.\u2014Youth\u2019s Instructor, Nov. 21, 1895.",
