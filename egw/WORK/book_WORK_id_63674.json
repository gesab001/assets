    "word": "In the Madison school students are taught how to till the soil, how to build houses and perform other lines of useful labor. These are some of the lines of work that the Lord instructed us to introduce into our schools in Australia. With a practical training, students will be taught to fill useful positions in many places. Skill in the common arts is a gift from God. He provides both the gift and the wisdom to use the gift aright.",
