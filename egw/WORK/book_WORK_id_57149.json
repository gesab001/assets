    "word": "Judgment must not be passed hastily on any man or on his work or his purposes. There is need of humble hearts and contrition of soul. The message we bear at this time is from above. Its influence upon human hearts of all who have received it is good and the fruits are good; while some stand criticizing and passing judgment both upon the message and the messenger sent of God. They are self-sufficient. They say in their hearts, \"I will do as I please and work as I please on my own judgment. I will do just as I have done,--talk these old truths but I will have nothing to do with the matter now brought to us,--Justification by faith and the righteousness of Christ. I will be religious, \"in fact they continue to whiten the sepulcher but do not cleanse it. From the heart proceedeth evil thoughts, the lips speak evil, jealousy, envy, evil surmisings. The soul temple needs cleansing. These who will not accept of the message the Lord sends will soon begin a tirade against it. They see evidence enough to balance the mind in the right direction but they are too proud to submit. They are not willing to say that which they decided was all wrong is right and then the mind begins to seek some excuse, some subterfuge to evade the issue. They are resolved not to obey God in this urgent call for the will to be yielded. They will make a mountain of some minor question and seek to get up a controversy on minor points. The longer he remains as he is the more is he puzzled and perplexed. Questions arise against the testimonies for Satan will bring every doubter and unbeliever over this ground. The work is before him to give himself up to God; His will be no longer arrayed against God's will.",
