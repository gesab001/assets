    "word": "The poor scattered sheep have been left to be torn by wolves and starve without food. They are coming in from all directions. These poor souls have had no labor and yet they seem to cling to the truth, but are starving for food. I think there never was a place where my testimony was needed more than in this region of country. They seem to be deeply affected with what they hear. It takes hold upon their hearts. My prayer is continually, Lord work in any way, send by whom thou wilt. Make me an instrument of righteousness. Give me Thy word to give to the people. Make me a channel of light.",
