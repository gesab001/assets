    "word": "The intrigues of sin surpass infinite conception. Every calamity, every suffering and death, is an evidence not only of the power of evil but of the truth of the living God. Having known the truth, the word of the living God, which abideth forever, and which through obedience gives life, man's weakness in conforming to Satan's ingenuity is surpassingly strange. All who are taught of God recognize Christ as His Son. All who disbelieve the known declarations of God demonstrate the popularity of sin, and are not working on the side of life and immortality which are brought to light through perfect sanctification of the truth. Unless they make a change in character, in words, and in spirit, souls will be lost.",
