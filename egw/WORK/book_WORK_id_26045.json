    "word": "Jesus enjoins his disciples to make known to others those truths which he had spoken to their ears alone, saying, \"What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house-tops.\" Knowing the rebuffs and persecution they are to meet in the ministry upon which they are now about to enter, he strengthens them for their work by assuring them that in all their coming toils and dangers, God will watch over them. They are to go on unmindful of the opposition of men, seeking only to please God in whose hands they are: \"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\"",
