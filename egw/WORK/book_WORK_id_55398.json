    "word": "Now, suppose that someone shall say, \"Jesus has pardoned me and I have no need of the law any further. I will no longer live in obedience to the law.\" The question may be asked, \"Shall we continue to sin that grace may abound\"? No. If one should steal the money out of my purse, and then come, and confessing the crime, ask me to forgive him, and I shall pardon him, and then he go and do the same thing again, does not this show that there is no change in his life? So it is with those who have asked God to forgive them and then gone right on transgressing His law. They say, \"Lord, Lord,\" but He says, \"Depart from Me.\" While I freely pardoned you, you were doing the same thing again. Your very course was leading others in the way of the transgressor. For this reason they were called the workers of iniquity. This very course of action was the means of leading others astray.",
