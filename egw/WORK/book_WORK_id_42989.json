Gifts and considerations are made without stint and partiality, and the others are left to get along as best they can. I think this is a good symbol of the present things in America and this country. God knows that we have done what we could, but have been crippled in every way,--our hands tied,--without workers or money. The places that have nothing done in them, \n\n\n                          -11- \n\nneed money and devising and planning to create an interest. I rejoiced when I heard that the Holy Ghost had been poured out upon our people in America, and I have been anxiously waiting new developments there, as was seen after the Holy Ghost descended on the day of Pentecost. I thought similar fruits would be seen, that the missionary spirit of God would burn in the hearts of all upon whom the Spirit of God was manifestly moving.",
