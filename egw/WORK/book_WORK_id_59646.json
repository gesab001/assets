    "word": "(198) M. 247, '05.        Loma Linda, near Redlands, Calif. Aug. 24, 1905. \n\nDr. John F. Morse \n     Dear Brother:-- I write to invite you to connect with our sanitarium work in Southern California. We now have three sanitariums in the southern part of the state. Loma Linda, the one most recently purchased, is the most desirable place I have ever seen for a sanitarium. We realize that the Lord has been very gracious to us in opening the way for us to secure this plant, which was originally constructed as a sanitarium.",
