    "word": "Do not understand me as approving of the recent action of the General Conference Association, of which you write; but in regard to that matter it is \n                                                                           157\nright that I should speak to them. They have many difficulties to meet, and if they err in their action, the Lord knows it all, and can overrule all for the good of those who trust in Him. I sympathize with you in your difficulties and perplexities, but I must advise you to wait, patiently wait. These delays may seem to you to be very tedious, and to be working you personal injury; but please do not take this view of the matter. If you will put your trust in God, and wait patiently a short time, I trust that everything will be adjusted satisfactorily. . . . You may have to wait awhile for the adjustment of the matters that trouble you; but do not get yourself into worse temptations by feverish frettings, or by seeking to obtain relief by any means contrary to the will of God.",
