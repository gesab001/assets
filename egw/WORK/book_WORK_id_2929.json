    "word": "It was the joy of Christ to save souls. Let this be your work and your joy. Perform all duties and make all sacrifices for Christ's sake, and He will be your constant helper. Go straight forward where the voice of duty calls; let no seeming difficulties hinder you. Take up your God-given responsibilities, and as you bear your sometimes heavy burdens, do not ask, \"Why idle stands my brother, no yoke upon him laid?\" Do the duty nearest you, and do it thoroughly and well, not coveting praise, but working for the Master because you belong to Him.--Southern Watchman, April 2, 1903.",
