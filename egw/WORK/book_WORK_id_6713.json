    "word": "The Lord calls upon His people to put away indolence and indifference, and to act like converted men and women. Diligent work is to be done in the circulation of our literature. Faithful work, marked by Christian politeness, is to be done in many missionary lines. The truth is to go forth as a lamp that burneth, that the real meaning of higher education may be clearly understood.",
