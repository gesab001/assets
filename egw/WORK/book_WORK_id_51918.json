    "word": "The world must have evidence, and be convinced of sin, and then the Lord will receive the repentant, and condemn the despisers of His mercy. God's mighty hand is stretched out still to save all who come unto Him. Our people who claim to believe the truth, and all who see and understand, are accountable to God for the knowledge they have of past and future events, and they are to be lightbearers to the world. There is every promise made that they shall receive of Christ, and, filled with His Spirit, work as cooperating with God. He requires everyone who knows the truth to influence the entire church to unity of action, to do the truth.",
