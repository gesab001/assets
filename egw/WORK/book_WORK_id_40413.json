White\n\n     For years I have been deeply interested in gospel work among the colored people in the South. It has been my privilege to visit this field a few times, and to become personally acquainted with its needs. During the nine years I spent in Australia, I kept pace with the advance of the work among the colored people in America. I knew of the struggles and makeshifts, the self-denial and self-sacrifice of the laborers in the South, and I helped as much as I could.",
