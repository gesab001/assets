    "word": "Our Advocate, Jesus, is pleading before His Father\u2019s throne in our behalf, and He is also pleading with the sinner, saying, \u201cTurn ye, for why will ye die?\u201d Has not God done everything possible through Christ to win us from satanic deception? . . . Is He not a risen Savior, ever living to make intercession for us? Is He not ever following up His great work of atonement by the work of the Holy Spirit on every heart? The bow of mercy still arches the throne of God, testifying to the fact that every soul who believes in Christ as a personal Savior shall have everlasting life. Mercy and justice are blended in God\u2019s dealing with His heritage.\u2014Signs of the Times, Sept. 19, 1895.",
