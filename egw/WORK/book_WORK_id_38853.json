    "word": "When it is deemed expedient to invest means in school buildings, in sanitariums, or in homes for the poor in any country, in order to establish the work there. the Lord would have those who are living in that \n\n\n                    - 8 - \n\nlocality walk humbly before him, and show that they realize their personal dependence upon him, and that they believe in his willingness to help them to plan, to devise, to arrange intelligently for his work. He is as willing to give wisdom to those who feel the value of divine grace, as to give wisdom to some other mind, who will then, at great expense, communicate the same to you. Where is your faith? Will men turn from the God of wisdom to seek wisdom from finite men, sending for men from a long distance to come and help them out of perplexity? How does the Lord look upon this?",
