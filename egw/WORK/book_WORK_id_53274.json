    "word": "\"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\" [1 John 2:4]. This includes all who claim to have a knowledge of God, and to keep His commandments, but who do not manifest this by good works. They will receive according to their deeds. \"Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him\" [1 John 3:6]. This is addressed to all church members, including the members of the Seventh-day Adventist churches. \"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for His seed remaineth \n\n\n                                    -177- \n\nin him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother\" [1 John 3:7-10].",
