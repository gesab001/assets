    "word": "These are the ones who have guile in their mouths. These are the ones that profess to be followers of Christ while they are following a leader who was expelled from the courts of heaven.

If they had opportunity and power, they would do as did Nebuchadnezzar when he set up his golden image in the plains of Dura.",
