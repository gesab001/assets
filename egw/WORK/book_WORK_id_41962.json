    "word": "Jesus began with the first book written by Moses, and traced down through all the prophets the inspired proof in regard to his life, his mission, his suffering, death, and resurrection. He did not deem it necessary to work a miracle to evidence that he was the risen Redeemer of the world; but he went back to the prophecies, and gave a full and clear explanation of them to settle the question of his identity, and the fact that all which had occurred to him was foretold by the inspired writers. Jesus ever carried the minds of his hearers back to the precious mine of truth found in the Old-Testament Scriptures. The esteem in which he held those sacred records is exemplified in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, where he says, \"If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.\" The apostles also all testify to the importance of the Old Testament Scriptures. Peter says: \"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\" Luke thus speaks of the prophets who predicted the coming of Christ: \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people; and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, as he spake by the \n                                                                           28\nmouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began.\"",
