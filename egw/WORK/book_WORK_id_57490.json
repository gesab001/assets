    "word": "It has been urged as a reason why this book has not been more generally sold by our canvassers, that it is more difficult to handle than some others. I have good evidence that if properly understood and presented, it can be sold as readily as any of our books. But suppose the statement were true, that it is difficult to sell; is that a reason why it should be neglected? If it is a book which the people need, if the Divine Watcher has therein condescended to unveil the scenes of the great contest in which every soul living will have a part to act, should there not be an earnest effort to circulate it? Should not the canvasser be encouraged to handle it? Should not our people be encouraged to do their utmost to bring it before the world? Are the canvassers instructed as they should be, that they are not to handle one book, to the exclusion of all others, because it brings greater profit to them? When we shape our work for the profit it brings, wherein do we manifest a missionary spirit? \n                                                                           808",
