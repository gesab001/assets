    "word": "I have been carrying a great burden for the people in Battle Creek. Last night I was laboring most earnestly in prayer. The commission was given me by the Saviour, \"It is not you they have rejected, but Me, their Saviour. You have nothing to retract of the messages that you presented during the General Conference held at Oakland and during the Berrien Springs meeting. You have a work to do of the same order. You have nothing to regret, in the words you have spoken and written, to the leading medical missionary workers. I have for you still more decided messages to bear. Those who have made light of the messages that I have given my messenger to bear have insulted the One who gave the messages.\" Our people need to humble their hearts, and confess their sins, and be converted. They need to fear and tremble lest God's Spirit be withdrawn from them, and they be left to hardness of heart and blindness of mind, because they have rejected the word God has given them. The messages that God has sent have been borne, line upon line, precept upon precept. The Lord is still working, and he gives the admonition, \"Keep the people, the flock of my pasture, from being educated by physicians or teachers who reject the warnings I have given through my messenger. My Sabbath has been transgressed, and the light that would have shone forth has been quenched.\"",
