    "word": "Marian's work is of a different order altogether. She is my bookmaker. A _____ never was my bookmaker. How are my books made? Marian does not put in her claim for recognition. She does her work in this way: She takes my articles which are published in the papers, and pastes them in blank books. She also has a copy of all the letters I write.
