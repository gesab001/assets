    "word": "I have words to speak to our people in the Southern field, Do not confine your work in any one place. The Lord will provide for the carrying forward of the work in many places, The work \n\n\n                                      -448- \n\nthat Brethren Staines and Brailliar have begun is not to be in any way discouraged. The talents of many workers are to be used wisely and faithfully. \"My reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be,\" the Saviour declares. Let the workers remember that their final reward will be in proportion to their development of Christian character. The Lord expects interest on the talents he has entrusted to his servants--interest in proportion to the gifts he has bestowed.",
