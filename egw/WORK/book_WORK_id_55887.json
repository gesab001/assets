    "word": "Harmony and simplicity in the work, an avoidance of all unnecessary machinery, will do much to preserve the courage and the physical and mental energies of those who have to consider so many points. Those who have none, or but little, of this kind of labor should be very careful how they criticize or censure the ones who do have these burdens to bear. Let all so conduct themselves that they will not throw any extra burdens upon our president. They should not depend upon him to do their thinking. If they keep their own souls in the love of God, growing in spirituality, dissension will be shut out. The oil of grace will cause the machinery to run smoothly.",
