    "word": "Those who have no time to give attention to their own souls, to examine themselves daily whether they be in the love of God, and to place themselves in the channel of light, will have time to give to the suggestions of Satan and the working out of his plans. Satan will insinuate himself by little wedges, that widen as they make a place for themselves. There will be a gradual adoption of worldly policy. The specious devices of Satan will be brought into the special work of God at this time.                       Ellen G. White. \n\n                                               -",
