    "word": "My letter must be a short one, as my head is easily wearied. As soon as I begin to use it, I am troubled with disagreeable pains. I have not yet recovered from the severe affliction I suffered at Glendale. After our trip to Fernando my heart and arm were seriously painful. Sara gave me most thorough treatment, and after a long time relief came. I was urged to visit Long Beach, to see how they were situated, in the work there; but I was in such pain that I had to refuse. I dared not venture to go.",
