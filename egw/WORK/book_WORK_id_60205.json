    "word": "All who desire to enter the medical missionary work, and who are worthy should be given an opportunity to learn. Giving the common treatments to the sick will accomplish much, and will give opportunity to those who administer these hygienic treatments to labor with earnestness for the spiritual recovery of their patients. Let the hearts of all who are working along these lines be softened and subdued. Let the workers learn to consult the great Physician in prayer much more than they have done. Pray, watch, wait, believe. - Unpub. MS (D. 190'03).",
