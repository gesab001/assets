    "word": "I have been urging my prayer for the Lord to strengthen me, to give my poor heart a rest from pain. I leave my petition at the throne of grace and say, \"Not my will, but Thine, O Lord, be done.\" If it be His pleasure to give me grace to work for Him in pain and suffering almost constantly and this is best for me, I say, \"Amen.\" I will continue to work until I lay off the armor at the feet of my Redeemer.--Ms. 43, 1890, pp. 1-2.",
