    "word": "\"Ye are God's husbandry.\" As one takes pleasure in the cultivation of a garden, so God takes pleasure in His believing sons and daughters. A garden demands constant labor. The weeds must be removed; new plants must be set out; branches that are making too rapid development must be pruned back. So the Lord works for His garden, so He tends His plants. He cannot take pleasure in any development that does not reveal the graces of the character of Christ. The blood of Christ has made men and women God's precious charge. . . . Some plants are so feeble that they have hardly any life, and for these the Lord has a special care. \n\n\n                        *    *    *    *    *",
