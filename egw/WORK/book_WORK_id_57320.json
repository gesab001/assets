If it should prove that they will not receive counsel, if they are unwilling to do the work so essential at this time,-- to bring before the people the very books that the world should have,-- then there is only [one] course left for me; that is, to raise and train a company of canvassers for this special work,-- men and women who shall work not merely to please themselves, not merely for gain, but to do the work of God, to bring before the people the warnings of God to them. This I proposed to do some time since, but was urged to wait a little. Some of the leaders in the canvassing work felt that it would not be the right thing for me to have a separate canvassing company organized, that it would throw things into confusion. Then the promise was given that last spring the canvass for Vol. IV should be pushed as that for Bible Readings had been. I believe that our brethren meant to do just as they said; but why did they not do it? I waited, but nothing has been done. Now if the leading brethren give it as a hopeless task, I will wait no longer for them to turn the tide. I still believe that those who are working in the canvassing field will see their duty when the situation is fairly placed before them.",
