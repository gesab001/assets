    "word": "Every man who preaches the truth should cultivate the qualities necessary to an educator. He is to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. He should see that all who receive the truth are firmly established in the faith, and that no part of the work is left incomplete. God's work should be primary; other interests, secondary. Satan is playing the game of life for the souls of men, and God's ministers must watch for souls and work faithfully to repulse the enemy and gain the victory. We need wisdom and a better knowledge of Satan's devices, that he may not, right before our eyes, accomplish the ruin of precious souls. There is a Source of strength at our command, and we need not become discouraged or be driven from the field.",
