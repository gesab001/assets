    "word": "An Active Conflict \n\n     Christ's manner of rule and government is to be established to counterwork the works of Satan, and to bring the world back to its loyalty to God. The Prince of heaven, He who was one with the Father, gave Himself that He might save the fallen race. Satan is actively at work to defeat His highest purposes. But Christ says, Where Satan has set his throne, there will I establish My cross. The prince of evil shall be cast out, and I will become the center of a world redeemed.",
