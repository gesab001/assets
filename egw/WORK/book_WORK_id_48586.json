    "word": "I was shown that Brother C.'s family must not be left to suffer. There is no need of this. If all the churches in Vermont and Canada do a very little each while Brother C. is with them, they would scarcely feel it, and at the same time, Brother C.'s family would be comfortable. This burden must not rest upon any one individual. God loves Brother C. His eye is upon him \n\n\n                                    -420- \n\nand his family, and He will bless those who will kindly care for them and aid with their sympathy and substance. Brother C. suffers much in mind. His trials are peculiar to himself, and his family has known what pinching want is. Sister C. suffers from poor health yet she tries to do her duty to rightly care for her little family. I was shown that none should oppress them, but do them good; yet Brother C. must be willing to be corrected and reproved and must reform where he fails. Yet Brother C. must not be deceived and think his labors more valuable than they really are. Brother C. must exercise judgment and economy in using means. Brethren work hard for their means and, while they see so little accomplished in the field by Brother C., they are in trial. Brother C. must remember the brethren have cause for trial on account of his lack of judgment and use of means. He must be willing to be instructed by his brethren where he lacks judgment and not suffer jealousy to come into his heart against them who would labor for his interest. \n\n\n     In love, [Signed] Ellen G. White.",
