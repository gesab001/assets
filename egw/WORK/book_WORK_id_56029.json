    "word": "The Southern field must be worked intelligently. Some have thought that because the people in the South are so ignorant, it did not matter what kind of workers are sent there. But the fact that the people are so ignorant makes it necessary to send the most capable workers, workers who know how to deal with human minds. Those who work successfully for people who have sunk so low as the colored people in the South must be men and women who will not labor foolishly, who will not work a little while and then get tired and go home. This field needs workers who will say, I will not fail or be discouraged.",
