    "word": "Special Work For the Old and Neglected\n     About a mile and a half from the [Hinsdale] Sanitarium we saw the soldiers' home, where there are located hundreds of veterans and their wives. Special missionary work should be carried forward at this home. Let men who fear the Lord seek to redeem the time, and take up a work that has been neglected for these old people.\n136\nChrist has purchased their souls with the price of His own blood. For this field there should be selected discreet men and women who will not fail nor be discouraged. And let no one belittle their efforts, for the Lord will be with those who labor with Him in self-denial and self-sacrifice. This work is as important as is the work in the foreign countries.--4MR 377 (1909).",
