    "word": "Thank God, some changes have been made, but they have been made very slowly, reluctantly, and imperfectly. Now, my brethren, all who have an \n\n\n                                -443- \n\nindividual interest in the work of God, before you shall feel competent to change the publications now doing their respective work in their several branches, I beseech you to humble your own hearts before God, else the ones who have been often reproved and counseled and who still choose to work in their own way will be as described in Jeremiah 9:3-8, 12-15. The Lord has a great work to do in our world, but selfish men, had they had their own way, would have exalted themselves, and allowed the precious cause of God to be burdened through their ambitious projects and imaginations; for they lived and worked to please themselves. God has brought about changes, yet there is need of still greater changes. It is not a light wrong that has been done, and there should be repentance and confession.",
