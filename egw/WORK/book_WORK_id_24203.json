    "word": "Psalm 139\n\n   1-12 (Revelation 20:12, 15). Where You Are, God Is.--We are never alone. We have a Companion, whether we choose Him or not. Remember, young men and young women, that wherever you are, whatever you are doing, God is there. To your every word and action you have a witness,--the holy, sin-hating God. Nothing that is said or done or thought can escape His infinite eye. Your words may not be heard by human ears, but they are heard by the Ruler of the universe. He reads the inward anger of the soul when the will is crossed. He hears the expression of profanity. In the deepest darkness and solitude He is there. No one can deceive God; none can escape from their accountability to Him.  {3BC 1153.10} \n     [Psalm 139:1-12 quoted.]  {3BC 1153.11} \n     Day by day the record of your words, your actions, and your influence, is being made in the books of heaven. This you must meet [Revelation 20:12, 15 quoted] (YI May 26, 1898).  {3BC 1153.12}  \n     8. No Solitude Without God.--The psalmist represents the presence of the Infinite One as pervading the universe. \"If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; \n                                                                           1154\nif I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.\" [Psalm 139:8.] We can never find a solitude where God is not. The ever watchful eye of Omniscience is upon all our works, and although He can marshal the armies of heaven to do His will, He condescends to accept the services of frail, erring mortals (ST July 14, 1881).  {3BC 1153.13}\n \n                             Psalm 144\n\n     12. God Spends Time on Jewels.--We are God's workmanship. The value of the human agent depends wholly upon the polishing he receives. When the rough stones are prepared for the building, they must be taken into the shop, and hewed and squared. The process is often sharp as the stone is pressed down upon the wheel, but the rough coarseness is being removed, and the lustre begins to appear. The Lord spends not His time upon worthless material; only His jewels are polished after the similitude of a palace. Every soul must not only submit to this work of the divine hand, but must put to the tax every spiritual sinew and muscle, that the character may become more pure, the words more helpful, the actions such as God can approve (Letter 27, 1896).",
