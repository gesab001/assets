    "word": "God has appointed apostles, pastors, evangelists, and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith. God declares to His people, \u201cYe are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d There must be a continual advancement. Step by step His followers must make straight paths for their feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way.",
