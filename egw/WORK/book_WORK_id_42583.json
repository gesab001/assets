    "word": "Let no one cherish a zeal that is not according to knowledge. Impulse is good when it is controlled by the Holy Spirit of God; but he who does not cherish sanctified principles will practise dishonesty in order to make a wonderful display, that others may see \"what I can do.\" By I,\" selfishness is wrought. I\" disregards greater need elsewhere, grasps too much, and selfishly builds up his own work. Such a course of action is a sad spectacle to angels and to men. None are to circumscribe their influence, their God-given talent of means, in order to make a display, which God \n                                                                           89\nwill have to destroy in order to bring them to their senses.",
