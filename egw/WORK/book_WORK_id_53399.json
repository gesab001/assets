    "word": "When we are inclined to despond, as I am when I cannot work as I long to, knowing as I do that time is fast passing and that my life may go out at any time, we must take Christ at His word, and believe that \"all power\" is to be given to those who need it, that this power is for you and for me.

Let us obey the word \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and \n\n\n                                    -310- \n\nof the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end the world.\"",
