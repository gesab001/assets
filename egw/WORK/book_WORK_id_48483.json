    "word": "There is a great need of careful building in every important institution like this. There is a great need of tact, intelligence, skill and businesslike thoroughness. This is even an absolute condition of prosperity in this institution. It will be easy to make great blunders if the business is not looked after with clear and sharp attention. Although the novice or apprentice may be energetic, if there is not in the various departments someone to oversee, someone who is properly qualified for his work, there will be failure in many respects. As the work grows, it will become impossible even occasionally to postpone jobs from one date to another. What is not done in due time, be it in sacred or in secular matters, runs a great risk of not being done at all; in any case, such work can never be done so well as at the proper time. \n\n\n                                    -326-",
