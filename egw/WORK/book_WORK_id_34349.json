    "word": "Men and means are needed in this field. I think of poor Melbourne, bound about with poverty and in need of a church. As the work increases there must be plans devised to keep alive the interest, that it shall not die. The Lord has means for us somewhere. Appeals must be made to the stewards of God for help. We need wisdom from above to calculate wisely and to proportionate the improvements that must be made with economy. Self-denial must be practised everywhere. Many of the scanty rills of beneficence which now water and enrich the garden of the Lord are brought there by much effort. More, very much more must be done by individuals in economizing their resources that they may do more for God. I feel deeply over the restricted resources in this country. There must be help for us to carry forward the work. All we can do is to pray the Lord to move upon the hearts of men to \n45\ndo the work that devolves upon them. Self-indulgence, selfishness exists to a large degree. May the converting power of God change the hearts and characters.\u2014Letter 44, 1892.",
