    "word": "Leading men should place responsibilities upon others, and allow time to plan and devise and execute, so that they may obtain an experience.  Give them a word of counsel when necessary, but do not take away the work because you think the brethren are making mistakes.  May God pity the cause when one man's mind and one man's plan are followed without question.  God would not be honored should such a state of things exist.",
