They do not need suppositions, which can not be sustained by the word of God. They need the testimony of men who know the truth, men who understand and obey the charge given to Timothy: \"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke. exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth; and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.\"",
