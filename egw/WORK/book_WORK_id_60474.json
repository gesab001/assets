    "word": "In another communication, dated March 14, 1902, (MS-41-'02) I read: \"In the visions of the night I have been writing letters, (836) and I dare not put off longer the work to be done. Night after night, I have been awakened at eleven, twelve, and one o'clock with a message from the Lord, and I arise at once, and begin to write, fearing that if I do not, I shall forget the instruction given me. Thus it was when I was at Los Angeles. In the night season I was in a council meeting and the question under consideration was the establishment of a sanitarium in southern California. One brother urged that it would be best to have the sanitarium in the city of Los Angeles, and he pointed out the objections to establishing the sanitarium out of the city.",
