    "word": "Friday night [January 2] I was asked to speak; the house was full, and I gave some account of the workings of the Spirit of God with me in the meetings which I had attended. I related as well as I could the success of these meetings. We had a special meeting of deep interest after I had spoken, and many excellent testimonies were borne, especially from those who were earnestly seeking the Lord. It was a good meeting.",
