    "word": "\"As one brother was carrying away an armful of books, a canvasser laid his hand upon his arm and said, 'My brother, what are you doing with so many books?' Then I heard the voice of our Counselor saying, 'Forbid them not. This is a work that should be done. The end is near. Already much time has been lost, when these books should have been in circulation. Sell them far and near. Scatter them Like the Leaves of Autumn. This work is to continue without the forbiddings of any one. Souls are perishing out of Christ. Let them be warned of His soon appearing in the clouds of heaven.'\" -Volume 9, page 72.",
