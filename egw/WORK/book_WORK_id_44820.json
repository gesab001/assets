    "word": "The work of advocating the principles of health reform is not to be a haphazard work; it is a work which is deep and broad and high, an essential work, the credentials of which are its practical workings. Because we are health reformers, we are not to make a raid upon people's habits and practices. This is striking too directly at the gods they worship. Instead, we are to offer them something better. Why have we established health reform institutions? That we may give people a practical demonstration of the principles we advocate. . . .",
