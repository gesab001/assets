    "word": "The work of all believers is to sow the world with truth. Talk the truth, pray the truth, believe the truth, and communicate the truth. Scatter everywhere in abundance the incorruptible seed of truth. The world's Redeemer holds in His hand the key to unlock the treasure house of wisdom. He that lacketh wisdom, \"let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord\" [James 1:5-7].",
