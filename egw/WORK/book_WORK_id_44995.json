    "word": "Young men have a work to do in this life which they will be unable to perform unless they form correct habits. Every soul that has been redeemed by the blood of Jesus has a destiny to fulfill. No one liveth to himself. All exert an influence for good or for evil. The injunction of the apostle is, \n                                                                           318\nthat they are to be co-workers with Christ and partakers with Him of His self-denial, His self-sacrifice, His forbearance, and gracious benevolence.",
