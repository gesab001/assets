We are to work under the commission Christ gave to His disciples, \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" This, then, is our work, to reach the people who are neglected, and win them to Christ.",
