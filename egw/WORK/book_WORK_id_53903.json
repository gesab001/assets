    "word": "Oh, how much we lose because we do not believe in God--that He means just what He says. We are not to trifle with God, for it is an offense to Him. We have received Christ; then do not lose Him. \"But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption\" [1 Corinthians 1:30]. It is your privilege to obtain a right experience in walking by faith, working by faith, accepted by faith in the Beloved.",
