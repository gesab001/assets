    "word": "As regards the Graysville Sanitarium, I am glad that you have secured a location on the hillside. Time will demonstrate the value of having your sanitarium at considerable distance from other buildings. In our school work at Avondale, our brethren desired to have the church and the sanitarium \n\n\n                                     -46- \n\nclose to the school, but again and again instruction was given me that we must not put our buildings close together. Of late I have written much regarding the location of sanitariums, and I will have copies sent to you. We must provide for our patients to be as much as possible with nature.",
