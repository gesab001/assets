    "word": "Let those who have known of the faithfulness of the laborers, and of the progress of the work in the Southern States, testify to all our people of what they have seen and heard. I am satisfied that those who are carrying the burden of the work at Huntsville are doing their best to carry on the work of education for the colored people acceptably, and to provide increased facilities.
