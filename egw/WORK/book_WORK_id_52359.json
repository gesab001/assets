    "word": "Morning after morning I awake at 2 a.m., and often at 12 p.m. [midnight]. During the night season has been presented before me the unfaithfulness of men who have occupied positions of responsibility at the great heart of the work. The councils at this great center, if kept pure and uncorrupted, would have been as the voice of God; but men have worked upon principles that are condemned by the word of God, and they have not heard nor obeyed the voice of God. Like Jehu, they have driven furiously in a course to uproot the confidence of God's people in men who are true to the Master's cause. They have sought to establish their own authority, while betraying the cause of God. While making decisions, and devising and planning, they have tried to make their oppressive human orders as the voice of God to His people.",
