    "word": "All-compassionate Redeemer! What love, what matchless love, was Thine! Charged by the great men of Israel with doing His works of mercy through the prince of devils, scorned and maligned, He was yet as one who saw and heard not. The work He came from heaven to do must not be left undone. He saw that truth must be unfolded to men. The light of the world must flash His beams into the darkness of sin and superstition, and reveal error in contrast with truth. That truth found no place in the hearts of those who should have been foremost to receive it, because they were barricaded by prejudice and wicked unbelief, and among those who had not such exalted privileges He prepared hearts to receive it. He made new bottles for the new wine.",
