    "word": "When the workers in the cause of God are converted in spirit, they will be willing to do the work that is waiting to be done. When they are willing to practice self-denial, they will have spiritual discernment to understand what the purposes of God are. Then they will remove from their hearts that which hinders them from cooperating fully with Him. And when they give evidence that they are determined to carry out the Lord's plans, and not their own devisings, decided changes will be seen. A spirit of humility and trust in God will reveal that God is a God of wisdom, and that His work is done in righteousness and truth.--Ms. 61, 1909, pp. 1-6.
