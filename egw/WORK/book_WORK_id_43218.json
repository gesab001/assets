    "word": "The Lord has a special work for his people to do at this time. He says,\"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.\" This is the very work that the Apostle Paul charges the churches to do. \"Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.\"",
