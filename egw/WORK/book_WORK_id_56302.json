    "word": "A few days ago, in the evening, Brother [I. H.] Evans came to see me. We had only a few words together, as he was called away. I presented before him the great necessity of our people giving much careful consideration to the work that must be done in the great cities. Notwithstanding the fact that the needs of these cities have been brought to the attention of our people over and over again, yet there are very few who seem willing to move forward along the lines indicated by our heavenly Instructor. Every obstacle to progress must be removed, and we must come into a position of harmony as laborers together with God. Unless we can have unity and harmony, there will be a retarding of the work continually.",
