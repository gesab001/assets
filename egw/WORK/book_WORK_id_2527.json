    "word": "Time For a Change--There is much for men in responsible positions to learn.  When men feel that their ideas are without a flaw, it is time for them to change their position from president to that of a learner.  When they think that their ideas, their judgment, should be accepted without question, they show that they are unfit for their position.  God sees not as man sees.  Whatever position a man may be called to fill, his judgment is not to be regarded as unerring.  His entrusted responsibility makes it far more needful than it otherwise  \n13\nwould be for him to be free from all egotism, and willing to receive counsel.--Manuscript 55, 1897 (June 3, 1897, \"Development of Workers\").",
