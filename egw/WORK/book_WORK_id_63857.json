    "word": "\"God live and reigns. We must take God at his word. Then there will be wondrous works wrought. We are to magnify the Lord God of Israel in obeying his word; then glorify him because our expectations are fulfilled. We have a working God; therefore in full confidence we can open our lips and glorify him. And with our purses we can work for the saving of souls all around us.\"",
