    "word": "God is not pleased with you; you are required to be far in advance of what you are now in spiritual knowledge. With all the privileges and opportunities that God has granted you, you do not have corresponding works. You owe a duty \n\n\n                                     -257- \n\nto others, and a duty imperfectly understood will be imperfectly performed. There will be mistakes and errors that will not only be injurious to yourself but will help to fasten wrong practices upon others. You have habits of appetite that you indulge to the detriment of the health of the body as well as the soul. Your habits have been intemperate, after the habits and customs of the world, and your health has been injured by your indulgence of appetite. The brain has been beclouded, and you will never have clear, pure thoughts until your habits and practices are in accordance with the laws of God in nature.",
