    "word": "A study of women's work in connection with the cause of God in\n46\nthe Old Testament times will teach us lessons that will enable us to meet emergencies in the work today. We may not be brought into such a critical and prominent place as were the people of God in the time of Esther; but often converted  women can  act an important part in more humble positions. This many have been doing and are still ready to do.--LLM 570 (1911).",
