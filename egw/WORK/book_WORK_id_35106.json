    "word": "The Word does not say that we are to count it all joy when we fall under temptation, but when we fall into temptation. It is not necessary to fall under temptation, for temptation comes upon us for the trying of our faith. And the trying of our faith worketh patience, not fretfulness and murmuring. If we put our trust in Jesus, He will keep us at all times, and will be our strength and shield. We are to learn valuable lessons from our trials. Paul says, \"We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope . . .\" (Romans 5:3-5).",
