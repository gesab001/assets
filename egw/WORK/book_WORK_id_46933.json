    "word": "MR No. 323 - A Balance in Book Distribution\n\n     I cannot see why the health books should not have a permanent place as well as the other publications, notwithstanding human prejudices to the contrary. But I have not, as I have told you, carried any special burden of this work for a few years. My mind has been so fully occupied with the burden upon me of getting before the people the light having special reference to these last days and the great crisis before us. The world is to be warned, and I have felt so deeply over volume 4 [ The Great Controversy, enlarged 1888 edition] standing still as it has done, that all other consideration of books for which I was not personally responsible has not been a burden or consideration. I have now fully decided to do something and do it at once. I must put in operation or devise some plan that the people, believers and unbelievers, shall have the light. . . .",
