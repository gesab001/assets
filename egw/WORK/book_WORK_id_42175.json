    "word": "\"This Work has been Carried on at Battle Creek. The Publishing Office was turned from its original design; men Made Terms With Authors; councils were formed; schemes were entered into. While one author [I have not been able to find that man yet, but I am hunting for him] was engaged in the services of a meeting at a distance, the expenses of one man were paid to go and see this brother, and induce him to make the lowest figures on his books. They urged that they wished to get this important matter before as many people as possible, and that the book would have a very much larger sale if it were sold at cheap prices. The Royalty was Placed at the Lowest Figures. Then this Confederacy Held this Example Up as a Rule for others. Warnings were given me that all this was the working out of a system of Oppression and Robbery, and that The Whole Institution was Leavened Throughout With Corrupt Principles, that the light of God was fast departing from all who were engaged in this confederacy.\"",
