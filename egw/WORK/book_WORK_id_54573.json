    "word": "W. C. White and Elder Daniells have had some conversation with me upon school matters, but I tell them that W. C. W. will hold no office with my consent while he is connected with me and my work. His health is poor, and this burden shall not come upon him again. It is hard enough when his work is appreciated. I cannot think of going to Victoria and keeping under a constant load. The Lord does not require it. I want every jot of W. C. White's strength in my work, and we shall try to get some long-neglected work done. Brother Robinson pleaded yesterday, and I almost weakened, but I am more decided today not to go just because my brethren desire it. If the Lord says, Go, I will go; but if I have no positive convictions, I shall not go.",
