    "word": "Let the religious services held each day be short, but educational in character. Present the Bible and its Author, the God of heaven and earth, and Christ, the Son. Jesus Christ was the great gift of God to the world. Tell the patients how the Saviour came to the earth to reveal the love of God for men. Present before them His great sacrifice in thus coming here to live and die. Let it be known that through faith in Christ every sinful human being may become a partaker of the divine nature, and learn to cooperate with God in the work of salvation. Souls are precious in the sight of heaven. The souls who are rescued from the snares of Satan to belief in Christ as the world's Redeemer will receive the blessings of heaven in this life, and in the world to come eternal life in the kingdom of God.--Letter 112, 1909. (To the Board of Managers of Melrose Sanitarium, July 4, 1909.)",
