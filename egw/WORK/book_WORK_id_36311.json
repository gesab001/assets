    "word": "Many have inquired of me, What course shall I take best to preserve my health? My answer is Cease to transgress the laws of your being; cease to gratify a depraved appetite, eat simple food, dress healthfully, which will require modest simplicity, work healthfully, and you will not be sick. . . . Many are suffering in consequence of the transgression of their parents. They cannot be censured for their parents\u2019 sin; but it is nevertheless their duty to ascertain wherein their parents violated the laws of their being . . . ; and wherein their parents\u2019 habits were wrong, they should change their own course, and place themselves, by correct habits, in a better relation to health.\u2014Health Reformer, August 1866.",
