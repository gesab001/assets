    "word": "This is the will of God concerning human beings, even their sanctification. In urging our way upward, heavenward, every faculty must be kept in the most healthy condition, prepared to do faithful service. The powers with which God has endowed man are to be put to the stretch. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\" Luke 10:27. Man cannot possibly do this of himself; he must have divine aid. What part is the human agent to act? \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Philippians 2:12, 13.",
