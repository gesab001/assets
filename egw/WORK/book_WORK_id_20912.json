    "word": "Pioneer History to Be Kept Before the People.--The record of the experience through which the people of God passed in the early history of our work must be republished. Many of those who have since come into the truth are ignorant of the way in which the Lord wrought. The experience of William Miller and his associates, of Captain Joseph Bates, and of other pioneers in the Advent message should be kept before our people. Elder Loughborough's book should receive attention. Our leading men should see what can be done for the circulation of this book. [REFERENCE IS HERE MADE TO THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS, PUBLISHED IN 1892 BY J.N. LOUGHBOROUGH (REVISED IN 1905 AS THE GREAT SECOND ADVENT MOVEMENT).]",
