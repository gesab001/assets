    "word": "When all, as men and women in Christ Jesus, unite in works of beneficence, the Lord will prosper them, enabling them to render the highest service. A wise division of labor will effectually advance the Lord's work. Let everyone be assigned his duties, according to his ability; and let him be honored as one of God's workmen. This will bind heart to heart.",
