    "word": "I have been broken off to have a talk with Brother Martin. I furnish him with papers and tracts to do missionary work. He is not a minister, but a farmer of considerable intelligence. He sells fruit, and thus becomes acquainted with the people. Many souls have been converted through his zealous influence. I have just told him he needed the Review and Herald, and that he must take it. He put his hand in the pocket and handed me the money. I am going to send in all the names I can get; for every family ought to have our church paper. Please send the Review to F. Martin, Kellyville, New South Wales, Australia, and charge the same to my account.",
