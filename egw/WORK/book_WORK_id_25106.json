    "word": "Man is honored by being made a co-partner in God's firm, by being accepted as a worker in the great centers He has established.... By appointment, the Lord our Redeemer is heir of God, and those who are co-laborers with Him in the work of saving souls, are joint heirs with Him. . . . To be an overcomer is to be placed in the ranks of those who have the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.",
