    "word": "\"Be Ye Clean\" \n\n     The word of the Lord to those connected with His institutions is, \"Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\" In all our institutions let self-seeking give place to unselfish love and labor. Then the golden oil will be emptied from the two olive branches into the golden pipes, which will empty themselves into the vessels prepared to receive it. Then the lives of Christ's workers will indeed be an exposition of the sacred truths of His word.",
