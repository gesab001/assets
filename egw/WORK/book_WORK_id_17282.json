    "word": "The Highest Work \n\n     The work above all work,--the business above all others which should draw and engage the energies of the soul,--is the work of saving souls for whom Christ has died. Make this the main, the important work of your life. Make it your special life work. Co-operate with Christ in this grand and noble work, and become home and foreign missionaries. Be ready and efficient to work at home or in far-off climes for the saving of souls. Work the works of God and demonstrate your faith in your Saviour by toiling for others. O that young and old were thoroughly converted to God, and would take up the duty that lies next them, and work as they have opportunity, becoming laborers together with God!--The Youth's Instructor, May 4, 1893.",
