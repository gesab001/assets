    "word": "Those who are called to be superintendents or managers in our institutions must, as soon as they come into office, lay aside all wrong practices, and, with a full realization of their high obligations, solemnly dedicate themselves to God, asking Him to preside over the sacred work which He has appointed them to manage. They should expel all selfishness, all desire for worldly gain, all crookedness and deception, all over-reaching in business transactions. Never, never are they to stain their work with the sin of greed, or with corrupt, fraudulent actions, as over-reaching in trade. God will not bless any proceeding that is not carried on in accordance with holy, sanctified principles.",
