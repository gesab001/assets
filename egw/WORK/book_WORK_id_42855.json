    "word": "A Neglect. \n\n     Many presidents of State conferences do not attend to that which is their work,--to see that the elders and deacons of the churches do their work in the churches by seeing that a faithful tithe is brought into the treasury. This principle \n\n\n                     -19- \n\nneeds to be often brought before the men who are lax in their duty to God, and who are negligent and careless in bringing in their tithes, gifts, and offerings to God. \"Will a man rob me?\" \"Wherein have we robbed thee?\", is the question asked by the unfaithful stewards. The answer comes plain and positive, \"In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.\" Please read this whole chapter and see if words could be spoken that would be more plain and positive than these.",
