    "word": "After looking matters over carefully and prayerfully, I wrote as I did in my notes of travel.

The workers were doing well, and ought to have been encouraged and advised to go on with their work. There are men in New York who should have helped them by making needed donations to invest in the cause. They will have to give to the work before they will grow in grace and the knowledge of the truth.",
