    "word": "Here is portrayed the value of eternal riches, in contrast with the treasures of earth.  If the purpose and aim of your life is to lay up treasure in heaven, you will be lifted above the base, sordid, demoralizing influence of an inordinate desire to obtain wealth in this life.  Laying up treasure in heaven will give nobility to the character; it will strengthen benevolence, encourage mercy; cultivate sympathy, brotherly kindness, and charity.  It will unite the soul of man with Christ, by links that can never be broken.  You may lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven by being rich in good works--rich in imperishable and spiritual things.",
