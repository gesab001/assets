    "word": "God has in His providence placed the cup of sorrow to your lips that you might sympathize with your brethren who have tasted of its bitterness. To close the soul to human griefs, to make no consideration for circumstances where God's providence is at work upon His suffering children, to force all under any and every circumstance and condition into one groove without reference to God's providences, is a fearful mistake which will react upon our own heads.",
