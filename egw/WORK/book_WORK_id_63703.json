    "word": "To those workers who are preparing to be teachers, I would say, Begin to work in a humble way as missionaries for God. Bear in mind the example of those who for the sake of the truth are subjecting themselves to all manner of inconveniences in foreign fields,- - to the hardships of an unsuitable climate and to the opposition of people of an idolatrous faith. God asks you to begin your mission work at home. Those who are seeking to be first, need to humble their hearts before God. Let each one take up the missionary work that lies neglected at his very door. The Lord calls for laborers for our cities. Every true believer has a message.",
