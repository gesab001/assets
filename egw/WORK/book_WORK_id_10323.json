    "word": "The teachers in our schools have a heavy responsibility to bear. They must be in words and character what they wish their students to be,--men and women that fear God and work righteousness. If they are acquainted with the way themselves, they can train the youth to walk in it. They will not only educate them in the sciences, but train them to have moral independence, to work for Jesus, and to take up burdens in His cause.",
