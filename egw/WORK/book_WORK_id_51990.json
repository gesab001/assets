    "word": "God calls upon us to cooperate with Him in saving perishing souls. He would have every soul saved. But the churches are asleep.

There must be a great deal of patience, a great deal of prayer. Christ met and worked with all classes of human beings, seeking to save that which was lost. Will you who shall connect with men of different organisms and different temperaments, put on Christ, and respect each other as you desire to be respected?",
