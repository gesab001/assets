    "word": "My brother, you say that you feel that you have not a full connection with God. You say, \u201cI cannot understand it. I am trying my very best, with the Lord\u2019s help, to live up to the Word as far as I know, yet I feel a long way from the Lord, and I can\u2019t tell why it is. We left Washington, my wife and I, to come to the Oakwood School to get a training for work.\u201d You have done well in seeking to become fitted for the Master\u2019s service. And I urge you and your wife to unite in seeking the Lord most diligently. Keep to the meekness and lowliness of Christ. Look constantly to Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of your faith. Walk humbly with God, and do not talk discouragement. Have faith in God, and He will bless you and will make you an instrument for the accomplishment of a good work.",
