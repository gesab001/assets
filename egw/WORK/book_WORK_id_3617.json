    "word": "Canvassing for our publications is an important and most profitable line of evangelistic work. Our publications can go to places where meetings cannot be held.

By the canvassing work the truth is presented to thousands who otherwise would never hear it.--Review and Herald, Oct. 7, 1902.",
