    "word": "The primary classes may keep the same books without disturbance until better books are prepared. The Bible lessons should be given in clear, definite simplicity, so that the minds of the students can grasp them. Until the new methods are understood, let not the present methods be all broken up before better ones are prepared with great care. Let not things be presented to the children which they cannot understand. The light given me is, Move cautiously at every step. Do not bring in the many things that may be said upon nature as a lessonbook until small books are prepared on this subject which may be presented as textbooks. This work has not yet been done, and until it is done, the minds of the children will only become confused by the fragmentary items being brought in, which may be all truth.",
