    "word": "Cooperation With Other Temperance Workers \n\n     We should do all in our power to cooperate with heavenly agencies for the promulgation of truth and righteousness in the earth. We cannot do a better work than to unite, so far as we can do so without compromise, with the W.C.T.U. workers. Years ago we regarded the spread of the temperance principles as one of our most important duties. It should be so today. Our schools and sanitariums are to reveal the power of the grace of Christ to transform the life. They should be important factors in the temperance cause.--Letter 274, 1907.",
