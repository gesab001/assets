    "word": "Now, brethren, the zeal that leads to this kind of work is not inspired of God; Christ never prompts any man to work against Christ.

And now I come to Thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have My joy fulfilled in themselves and I have given them Thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world, but that Thou shouldst keep them from the evil.\"",
