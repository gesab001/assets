    "word": "The Lord's great vineyard demands from men that which it has not yet received--earnest, persevering labor for souls. The ministry is becoming \n\n\n                                -209- \n\nweak and feeble, and under their tame service the churches also are becoming weak.

The truth is not carried into the barren places of the earth. God calls for workers who will be producers. There is a world to be warned. Why are the ministers who should be laboring in special service earnestly to open new fields and raise up new churches, hovering over the churches which have already received great light and many advantages which they do not appreciate?",
