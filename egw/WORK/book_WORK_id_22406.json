    "word": "Christ says, \"I know thy works.\"  He knows whether you are living a life of perfection and if you love to talk and think of Him, and whether it is your joy to praise Him. Do we expect to get to heaven at last and join the heavenly choir?  Just as we go into the grave we will come up as far as the character is concerned.  For this mortal shall put on immortality and this corruptible shall put on incorruption (See 1 Corinthians 15:54).  It is the body that will be changed then, but now is the time for washing and ironing.  It is the time to wash our robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. -- Ms 84, 1886. \n                                                                           157",
