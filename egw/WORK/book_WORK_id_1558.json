    "word": "The last days are upon us, and Satan is working with all his hellish arts to deceive and destroy souls. Reproofs by testimony are met almost universally, by the ones corrected and reproved, with \u201cI believe the testimonies, but I do not understand them.\u201d The Lord has corrected their wrong ways in order to save them from unhappiness, deception, and ruin; but they pass on the same as if light and warnings had never come to them. If they were in harmony with God, they would not be departing from Him. It is because they are so far departed from God that they do not hear His voice as He calls to them, \u201cReturn unto me, and I will return unto you,\u201d\u201cand I will heal your backslidings.\u201d",
