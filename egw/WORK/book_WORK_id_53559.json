    "word": "Help will be needed by the workers in Honolulu. If sufficient money is provided, a much larger work can be done. Earnest prayer must be blended with devoted labor, so that a responsive influence will be seen and the inmost depths of mind and heart reached, the whole nature stirred to abandon every phase of idolatry, making the hearts of this ignorant people thrill with solemn awe and bound with exultation. And the souls of the teachers, under the inspiration and power of the Holy Spirit, will be filled with the determination never to give up the effort to conquer in the strength of the Lord Jesus. And the Sun of righteousness shall rise upon them, and lead true converts to cooperate with the teachers with a degree of energy that will demonstrate the power of truth to influence hearts. The power of the cross of Christ, the power of an endless life, must take hold of these blood-bought souls.",
