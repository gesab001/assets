    "word": "Wisdom, intellect, power,--these are not God. But God is the author of all wisdom, all grace, all power. God gave Lucifer his power and wisdom, yet this intelligence was not God himself. We are to know God as He is revealed in His marvelous works. Who by searching can find out God? This is not part of our work. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. God's character is expressed in the ten commandments. To know God as He is,--this is the science of all goodness and truth and righteousness. We must obey every expression of His character as revealed in His law.",
