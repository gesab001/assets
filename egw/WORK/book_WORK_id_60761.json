    "word": "Miracles Not the Sign \n\n     God's people will not find their safety in working miracles; for Satan will counterfeit the miracles that will be wrought. God's tried and tested \n                                                                           51\npeople will find their power in the sign spoken of in Exodus 31:12-18. They are to take their stand on the living word, \"It is written.\" This is the only foundation upon which they can stand securely. Those who have broken their covenant with God will in that day be without God and without hope.--9T 16.",
