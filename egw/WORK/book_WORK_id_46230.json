    "word": "In your schoolwork cherish the highest, holiest principles. Pray as did Daniel--three times a day, alone with God. Confess every sin you have committed, every mistake you have made. If in any way you have injured your fellow students, confess to them also. God says, \"Confess your sins one to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed.\" Thus you build barriers between yourself and sin. You are walking in harmony with God. He has avouched Himself as one who will hear and answer your sincere, fervent prayers. He has assured you that He will pardon and accept you. How powerful you may be in this assurance!",
