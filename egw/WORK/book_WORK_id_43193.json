    "word": "Those who believe in Jesus will love to do his will. \n                                                                           24\nThose who acknowledge that Jesus is the Redeemer of the world and yet live for themselves in all their words and actions, contradict their faith, and testify to the world that they do not believe in Jesus Christ. Sacrifice and self-denial will be met at every step in the Christian path. If we walk with Christ, we shall see his triumph and share his glory. Like our divine Master, we shall be made perfect by suffering. Those whose lives are one with Christ will not be full of mirth and worldliness and pleasure loving now. There is a work to do, earnest work to warn the world, earnest labor to wash our robes of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. There will be a wholesome fear which will lead to sobriety and balance the character,--a fear lest a promise being made us on certain conditions, we should seem to come short of meeting those conditions.",
