    "word": "(476) From a newsy letter of Sept. 17, 1907, the following is taken: \n     As to the bakery and my \"indomitable perseverance,\" I have no argument to make. I suppose my convictions as to what should be done are somewhat like other people's: I try to see that it is done. However, the Lord will have to settle this matter like many other problems too great for human wisdom. I am sure that many of the Conference Committee feel as clear as I do that it should be; perhaps they are not so willing to face problems and therefore do not say much about it, but personally a number have talked to me, and said that they felt clear that it was a part of the work, and in time would come about. \n                              (Signed) J. A. Burden. \n                                                                -",
