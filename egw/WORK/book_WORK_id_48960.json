    "word": "We are to be awake to the necessity of suffering humanity, but it would be unwise to sacrifice lives to the special work of treating consumptives. I have not one word to give in encouragement of this. It may be necessary to provide a place where patients who are dying of consumption can be cared for, but such a building should not be placed in the city, but isolated from the city. Let all who are troubled in regard to this question remember that it means much to impress upon individuals that it is their duty to take charge of an institution for consumptives. Persons may come to such an institution who are said to have consumption, but who are \n\n\n                                       -284- \n\nreally suffering from stomach trouble. If these associate with consumptive patients, they will certainly contract the same disease, for they have lost the power to resist the effects of any exposure.",
