    "word": "The Lord has not made us judges, but we have to meet these difficulties in the churches. These persons are not converted. They need to be born again. The truth has not had the privilege of doing its work upon the human heart. The sunshine of Christ's righteousness has not been permitted to shine into the soul temple. The natural and cultivated tendencies to evil are not worked upon by the transforming power of the truth, and preconceived opinions are retained as precious gems. All this reveals the absence of the grace of Christ. It reveals an unbelief in Christ's power to transform the character.",
