    "word": "From time to time we read the death notices of the great men of the world. Their time came suddenly, as in a moment. Many, supposed to be in good health, die after a feast, or after laying selfish plans for their own exaltation. The word goes forth, \"He is joined to his idols; let him alone.\" This means that the Lord no longer guards him from harm. Sudden death comes, and what is his lifework worth? His life has been a failure. The tree falls because the power that has sustained it leaves it to its idolatrous sacrifice. \n\n\n                                _______________",
