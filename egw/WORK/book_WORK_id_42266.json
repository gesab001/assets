    "word": "God help us to feel that now, just now is our time and opportunity to work for the Master. As we see the love that has been shown for us, shall not our love be awakened and enlarged, so that nothing will seem too much for us to do for God? Let us do something and do it now. Let us arouse from our apathy, and, catching the inspiration of God's love, work as never before for the Master. Let everyone now do his duty, laboring actively with Jesus Christ. A life beautified with holiness is not a life of idle contemplation, but a life filled up with earnest work for \n\n\n                          -10- \n\nthe Master, whose light shineth more and more unto the perfect day. As Seventh-day Adventists, we have a work to do in witnessing for Christ. If indeed the Lord is coming, it is time to sell what we have and give alms. It is time to put out your money to the exchangers, time to place every dollar you can spare into the treasury of the Lord, that institutions may be erected for the education of workers, who shall be instructed as were those who attended the school of the prophets. If the Lord comes and finds you doing this kind of work. He will say, \"Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" \n\n\n                                      Mrs. E. G. White.",
