    "word": "Aged Workers to Be Teachers and Counselors \n\n     God calls upon His aged servants to act as counselors, to teach the young men what to do in cases of emergency. Aged workers are to bear, as did John, a living testimony of real experience. And when these faithful workers are laid away to rest, with the words, \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord\" (Revelation 14:13), there should be found in our schools men and women who can take the standard and raise it in new places.",
