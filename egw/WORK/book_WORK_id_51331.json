    "word": "The workers need to study the life of Christ until they give themselves unreservedly to Him. \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth,\" He said, \"the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" Those who practice the words of Christ become one with Christ. Their lives represent the pure principles of the word in simplicity and meekness.",
