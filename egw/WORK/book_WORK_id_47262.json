    "word": "After we returned from the East I commenced to write [Spiritual Gifts] Volume III, expecting to have a book of a size to bind in with the testimonies which help compose [Spiritual Gifts] Volume IV. As I wrote, the matter opened before me and I saw it was impossible to get all I had to write in as few pages as I at first designed. The matter opened and Volume III was full. Then I commenced on Volume IV, but before I had my work finished, while preparing the health matter for the printers I was called to go to Monterey. \n\n\n                                   -97- \n\nWe went, and could not finish the work there as soon as we expected. I was obliged to return to finish the matter for the printers, and we left an appointment for the next week.",
