    "word": "\"As young men go out into this work and, in spite of many difficulties, make a success, let not propositions be made that they take up another work, and that the work they have started be given into the charge of men who are older and more experienced. This is not the way to encourage young men. My fellow-workers, persevere in the work which you have begun. Keep at it until you gain victory after victory, remembering that only by succeeding can you demonstrate the genuineness of your success. --Extracts from Unpublished Testimony July 10, 1902.",
