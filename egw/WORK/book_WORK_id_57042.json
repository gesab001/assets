    "word": "Brother Miller, why did you and your brother Howard appear so listless at the Wexford Meeting? The Spirit of the Lord was manifestly at work; but you did not recognize the fact. You bore no testimony that harmonized with the testimony of those through whom God was working. Why did you come to the meeting, have your expenses paid, your time recompensed, when you could offer nothing that would bring light to the souls of others? Did you think your indifference would be counted a virtue? You acted no part to advance the meeting. You did not partake of the spirit, and it would have been better for you to have remained at home, with your doubts and criticisms, than to come to the meeting.",
