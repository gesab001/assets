    "word": "[Ephesians 4:11-14 quoted.] \n     All these gifts are to be blended in the work of building upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ Himself is the chief cornerstone, \"in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord\" (Ephesians 2:21). \"Fitly framed together.\" Study these words, and seek to understand all that they comprehend. \"Fitly framed together,\" each acting his respective part unitedly. Thus we grow \"unto an holy temple in the Lord.\" Have a care how you build.--Ms. 108, 1899, pp. 1, 2. (\"He That Loveth Not His Brother Abideth in Death,\" August 2, 1899.)",
