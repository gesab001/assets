All the Lord asks of you is to be a faithful steward, to render to God \n                                                                           156\na tenth of all your increase without stopping to measure the matter to see how you are coming out. You have but little means, render back to him the portion belonging to him; for it is not yours. It is a serious matter to rob God. Thus you deprive yourself of the blessing he has promised to bestow if you exercise faithful stewardship. If you have been untrue to God, if you show that you will not do according to the agreement he has made with you, will he bless you with facilities of obtaining more means? You keep yourself under condemnation as unfaithful stewards by working contrary to a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" You deprive the treasury of God of your proportion of his agreement with you, because you choose to walk in the light of the sparks of your own kindling. In your finite wisdom, you think you are making better terms with yourself than God has made with you. How then, if you are unfaithful steward with the least, can the Lord entrust to you larger responsibilities?",
