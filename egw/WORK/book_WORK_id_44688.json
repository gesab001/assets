    "word": "I thank the Lord with heart, and soul, and voice that you have been a prominent and influential member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. In the providence of God you have been led to the light, to obtain a knowledge of the truth; and the education you have received in the grand temperance work, in connection with your sister workers, is the education you need to bring into the work with women whose hearts are softened by the Spirit of God, and who are searching for the truth as for hidden treasure.
