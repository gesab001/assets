    "word": "The arrest was effected by the efforts of Alexander the coppersmith, who had so unsuccessfully opposed the apostle's work at Ephesus, and who now seized the opportunity to be revenged on one whom he could not defeat (LP 305).  {7BC 920.10}  \n     13, 16-21. Paul Faces Death Courageously.--Paul concludes his letter with various personal messages, and again and again repeats the urgent request that Timothy use all diligence to come to him soon, and if possible to come before winter. He describes his loneliness from the desertion of some friends and the necessary absence of others, and lest Timothy should still hesitate, fearing that the church at Ephesus demanded his labors, he states that he has already dispatched Tychicus to fill the place of Timothy in his absence. And \n                                                                           921\nthen he adds the touching request, \"The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.\"  {7BC 920.11}  \n     At his second arrest, Paul was seized and hurried away so suddenly that he had no opportunity to gather up his few  \"books\" and \"parchments,\" or even to take with him his cloak. And now winter was coming on, and he knew that he would suffer with cold in his damp prison cell. He had no money to buy another garment, he knew that his end might come at any moment, and with his usual self-forgetfulness and fear to burden the church, he desired that no expense should be incurred on his account (LP 327).",
