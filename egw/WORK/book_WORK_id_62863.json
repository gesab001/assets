    "word": "The question has been asked me, Have you any light for us? If so give it to us. From time to time many things have been opened before me, and often has come just before difficulties have arisen. Thus it was when I was at Stanmore a few weeks ago. All through the night, in my dreams, we were making changes. Some were packing up, and moving to other localities. When examination was made of the purposes of each, there was much said. Some said they were on the way to Cooranbong, where they intended to locate in connection with the school. They said they purposed to work as work should be provided for them in any line whatever. If they could not take all the studies they would take what they could, and learn how to work. This, they said, would fit them for practical life and for the work to be done in the missionary field. They said they could see that great changes must be wrought in their own minds in the living policy before they could be prepared to enlighten other minds.",
