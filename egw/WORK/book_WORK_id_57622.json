    "word": "Christians indeed are opposed to display. In proportion as they are Christians they are clothed with humility, and this very grace makes them a light in contrast with darkness. If we are Christians we will not seek to be praised or exalted of men, and we will not be drawn away from the work by bribes or any flattering inducement. Christians will not be driven from their post of duty by fear or by reproach, by accusation, hatred, or persecution.",
