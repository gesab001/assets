    "word": "Power of Angels, Prayer and Faith.--Those whose engage in this work should first give themselves unreservedly to God. They should place themselves where they can learn of Christ and follow His example. He has invited them: \"Come \n\n\n                                                      303 \n\nunto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" Matthew 11:28-30. Angels are commissioned to go forth with those who take up this work in true humility.",
