    "word": "There are many who, though they profess to be Christians, would spoil heaven should they be translated with a spirit and character such as they now have. Their lives are full of earthliness; their tempers are unsanctified; they harbor prejudices that ought never to exist; they are wholly human. An atmosphere so unlike the character of Christ has surrounded the soul, so that they could not enjoy the change from earth to heaven. This earth is our school where we are to be proved and tried to see if we will become stewards of the grace of Christ. The power of the grace of Christ is to work in the children of disobedience until Christ Himself is formed within, the hope of glory. We must reveal that we are converted, born again, before we can see heaven. Shall we begin now to labor as humble learners of Jesus Christ? O how infinite is His love and grace! How utterly beyond price is His love expressed for fallen man! Christ, because He loves us, holds the standard high, and He will take our disposition, and make it like His own. . . .",
