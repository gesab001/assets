    "word": "Depression, Mental, Effect on Health.--You are a dyspeptic. Mental depression causes dyspepsia, and this aggravates the mental disorder, and unless you can be induced through change of some kind to be attracted away from yourself and from your complaints, you will cut short your life, and while you do live be unable to think healthfully and to work healthfully. Your imagination will be diseased; you take for reality impressions in which there is no truth and for which there is no foundation. You have been alone too much and yet you choose this rather than to be connected with others. If you had now some very light physical employment it would divert your thoughts from yourself and be of great advantage to you.--Letter 1, 1883.",
