    "word": "When the Lord favors any of His servants with worldly advantages, it is that they may use those advantages for the benefit of the work. And it is the privilege of accredited workers appointed to this responsibility to accept gifts or loans to help in doing the work that needs to be done. Forbiddings are not to be exercised by the conference, or by others who feel that they have authority to do so, that will deny the workers the privilege of accepting such loans and gifts of men and women [who] are willing to make them. They should be allowed to go to the people to solicit help. Properly conducted, this is a line of work that the Lord commends.",
