    "word": "I have been instructed to say to our leading sanitarium workers throughout our ranks: The work must move forward on a higher plane, and after a more sacred order than it has heretofore, if it is to accomplish all that God designs should be accomplished by it in our churches and for the world. We need to pray and to consider earnestly what is the great spiritual need of men and women in this age. Strange things are being done, which are not after the Lord's counsel, but after the devising of men. As wicked practices increase among those who are determined to do wickedly, there is great need that our people bring into prominence before the world a pure untainted work. The Lord says to us, Be ye clean that labor in the health institutions. Work under the influence of the Holy Spirit of God. Let the men holding positions of sacred trust view the work from a high standpoint.",
