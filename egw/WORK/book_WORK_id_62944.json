    "word": "The Lord has blessed the work that J.E. White has tried to do in The South. God grant that the voices which have been so quickly raised \n\n\n                                     -177- \n\nto say that all the money invested in the work must go through the appointed channel at Battle Creek, shall not be heard. The people to whom God has given his means are amenable to him alone. It is their privilege to give direct aid and assistance to missions. It is because of the misappropriation of means that the Southern field has no better showing than it has today.",
