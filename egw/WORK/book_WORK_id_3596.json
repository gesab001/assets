    "word": "Preach by Books and Periodicals\nWe have been asleep, as it were, regarding the work that may be accomplished by the circulation of well-prepared literature. Let us now, by the wise use of periodicals and books, preach the word with determined energy, that the world may understand the message that Christ gave to John on the Isle of Patmos. Let every human intelligence who professes the name of Christ testify: \u201cThe end of all things is at hand; prepare to meet thy God.\u201d Amos 4:12.",
