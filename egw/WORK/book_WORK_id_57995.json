The plan now is for Bro. Starr to go alone to that new country. I have pleaded that this should not be done; it is contrary to the Lord's order. Christ sent out his disciples two and two, and this is the plan that should be followed. At first it was planned for Brother Hickox and Brother Starr to go together to this field, but this cannot be, both for want of money to pay the expenses of the two, and because Bro. Hickox is in the midst of a growing interest, which until we moved here, he had carried alone. Elder Starr consents to go to Queensland alone to investigate the field; and at a later date Bro. Hickox will follow.",
