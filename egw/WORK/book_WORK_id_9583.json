It has worked wonders in this very place [Australia], and will still do great things. Our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in present truth must not abide alone with those who receive Christ. Christ died to save the world, and we are to work more zealously in acting our part. We are to look upon fallen humanity as our field. God cares for them. . . . Not one soul is to be left in darkness. --Letter 76, 1899. \n                                                                           567",
