    "word": "Those who bring in this unhappy chapter into the experiences of our work, and willingly accept the idea that the rulership of other men's conscience has been given to them, need to understand that they have made a grave mistake.  Their office was never intended to give to them the responsibility which they have been led to think it bestowed.  The danger signal is now lifted against this evil.  Never, never let men consent to stand in a position which God alone should occupy.--Letter 344, 1907, p. 3 (Oct. 1, 1907, to A. G. Daniells, G. A. Irwin, and W. W. Prescott).",
