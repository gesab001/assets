    "word": "When men come in who would move one pin or pillar from the foundation which God has established by His Holy Spirit, let the aged men who were pioneers in our work speak plainly, and let those who are dead speak also, by the reprinting of their articles in our periodicals.  Gather up the rays of divine light that God has given as He has led His people on step by step in the way of truth.  This truth will stand the test of time and trial.  -- Ms 62, 1905.",
