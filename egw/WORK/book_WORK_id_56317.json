    "word": "It has been said, \"We should like to send a large amount of money to China.\" Are the souls in China any more precious than the souls within the shadow of our doors? We are to act our part in warning China, but we also are to act our part in warning the cities close by where we live. Here are foreigners of various nationalities in our cities, and they are to be reached with the message of present truth.
