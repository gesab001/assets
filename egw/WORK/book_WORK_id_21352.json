    "word": "Small and Large Journals.--God would have His work move firmly and solidly, but no one branch is to interfere with or absorb other branches of the same great work. From time to time for years in the past, God has been pleased to give me special light on these points. I was shown that the small periodicals, as well as the larger ones, are to come forth from the publishing houses and be scattered like the leaves of autumn to answer the wants of the cause in its growth and extension.--Lt 71, 1894.
