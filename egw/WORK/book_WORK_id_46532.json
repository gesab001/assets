    "word": "MR No. 249 - Experience of James White\n\n     There were several hands employed beside himself [James White] who were irreligious, rough men. They agreed among themselves to make it hard for the minister, for as he was unaccustomed to such stern hard work, they would run him down and drive him from the field. He knew at that time nothing of this, but before he went into the field, we sought the Lord most earnestly that He would strengthen and protect him. . . .",
