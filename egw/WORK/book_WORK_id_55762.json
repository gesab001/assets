    "word": "The love revealed in the Saviour's life of self-denial and self-sacrifice is to be seen in the lives of His followers. We are called upon \"so to walk even as He walked.\" The cause of our weakness lies in our refusal to obey this command. On every side there are opportunities to work for our fellow men, not only in supplying their temporal wants, but their spiritual necessities. It is our duty to lead souls to the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. It is important that we fill aright our position in the world, in society, and in the church; but we cannot do this unless we have a firm hold upon righteousness.",
