    "word": "When children are born to parents who have practical godliness, they will not be troubled as to how to educate them to meet the world's standard, but their question will be, \"How shall we order the education of our children to please the Lord?\" They will search the living oracles that they may understand the way of the Lord and lead their children to Christ. They will teach them the precepts of Christ and train them to be workers together with God, saying, \"That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace.\" This polishing work especially devolves upon the mother, and this is true missionary work.",
