    "word": "I have just returned from Five O'clock morning meeting. The spirit of supplication was imparted to us for a larger blessing and that the men in responsible positions might have the presence and the power of God. Many are sick, compassed with infirmities, and God will lift them up as he has lifted me. He has given me health, and strength, and grace, and he will give the same to all his workers. Oh that every one in responsible positions of trust in our institutions may know that Jesus is to them a present help in every time of need. They want to be drawn up from themselves nearer to God that they may comfort others with that consolation wherewith they are comforted.",
