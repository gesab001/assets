    "word": "The disciples expected that Peter would no longer be allowed to occupy the prominent position in the work which he had hitherto held, and he himself had lost his customary self-confidence. But Jesus, while dining by the sea-side, singled out Peter, saying, \"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?\" referring to his brethren. Peter had once said, \"Though all men \n                                                                           230\nshall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended,\" and had expressed himself ready to go to prison and to death with his Master. But now he puts a true estimate upon himself in the presence of the disciples: \"Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.\" In this response of Peter there is no vehement assurance that his affection is greater than that of his companions; he does not even express his own opinion of his devotion to his Saviour, but appeals to that Saviour, who can read all the motives of the human heart, to himself judge as to his sincerity,--\"Thou knowest that I love thee.\"",
