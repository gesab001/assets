Jesus invites you to come to Him and learn of Him, and \"I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:29).

Therefore your will must become \n\n\n                                    -165- \n\nGod's will. Your peace, your rest, comes in wearing Christ's yoke; you have the peace of Christ, and your conscience is not continually scourging you because you have not committed yourself to do the will of God. When you love to do the requirements of God, there is sweet enjoyment, not in idleness, but enjoyment identified with, and realized through, the exercise of all your powers on the Lord's side. Christ's service means work. You can be a dutiful, obedient child of God. A soldier of Jesus Christ does not mean pleasure but hard work. You may say, \"What can I do?\" By coming out fully on the Lord's side, you can exert an influence over your young companions; by refusing to do a wrong action, you can place yourself thus far on Christ's side.",
