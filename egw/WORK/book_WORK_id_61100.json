    "word": "Men will arise speaking perverse things, to counter-work the very movements that the Lord is leading his servants to make. But it is time that men and women reasoned from cause to effect. It is too late, too late, to establish large business firms in the cities,--too late to call young men and women from the country to the city. Conditions are arising in the cities that will make it very hard for those of our faith to remain in them. It would therefore be a great mistake to invest money in the establishment of business interests in the cities. \n\n                                               -",
