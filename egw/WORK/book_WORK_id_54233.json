    "word": "The Lord would educate the leading men to reason from cause to effect. Weak men are not to be put in places where physical strength is required, neither are men with small intellectual capacity to be entrusted with work that requires tact, intellect, and sharp discrimination. Men qualified for their appointed work, who have excellent judgment and experience, who are able to do a precious work for the advancement of the cause of truth, should be selected for these positions.",
