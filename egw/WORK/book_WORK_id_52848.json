    "word": "Christ is the rightful owner of man. He says to him, \"You are Mine. I have bought you with a price. I gave My life for you, that your life might be made harmonious and symmetrical. If you will surrender yourself willingly to Me, I will guide you aright. You are a rough stone, but if you will place yourself in My hands, I will polish you. I will put you in the place that I have chosen for you, that after My plans and methods you may work out My purposes for you. I will so imbue you with My grace that by the luster with which you shine you will bring honor to My name. No man shall pluck you out of My hand. I will make you My peculiar treasure. In the day of My appearing and My triumph, you will be a jewel in My crown of rejoicing.\"",
