    "word": "571. When the weather will permit, all who can possibly do so ought to walk in the open air every day, summer and winter. . . .

The muscles and veins are enabled better to perform their work. There will be increased vitality, which is so necessary to health. The lungs will have needful action; for it is impossible to go out in the bracing air of a winter's morning without inflating the lungs.-- T., V. II, p. 529.",
