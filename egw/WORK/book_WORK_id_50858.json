    "word": "6:30 a.m. The sun is beginning to penetrate the clouds, and reveal its beams of light. I am thankful for this, and I will praise the Lord for all His goodness. We have a very pleasant household. May Lacy is like a sunbeam all the time. We appreciate her very much, and Willie will be greatly blessed in his union with her. Today I must commence in earnest the work of writing on the life of Christ. I cannot tell what matter has been sent to you, as I was at Dora Creek, but hope that it was all of that character which will prove a blessing to you and your company. We are a long distance apart but we will be thankful that there is a line of communication between us. I am very glad to know that the Lord is your Helper. To Him you may look, and in Him you may trust; and He will be to you a present help in every time of need.",
