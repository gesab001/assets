SMITH, \n     BATTLE CREEK, MICH.: \n\nDEAR BROTHER:- \n     THE ENCLOSED PAGES PRESENT A FEW POINTS WHICH WERE OPENED TO SISTER WHITE LAST NIGHT, AND WHICH SHE WISHED SENT TO YOU. SHE HAS FOR SOME DAYS BEEN SUFFERING FROM THE EFFECTS OF COLD AND OVERWORK, AND IS TODAY UNABLE TO READ OR WRITE. THE MATTER WAS WRITTEN OUT AS SHE PRESENTED IT. WE SENT SOME COPIES OF ARTICLES AND LETTERS BY THE S.F. MAIL, WHICH SISTER WHITE DESIRED YOU TO READ; BUT AS WE WERE NOT CERTAIN THAT YOU WERE IN BATTLE CREEK, THEY WERE ADDRESSED TO ELDER TENNEY, WITH DIRECTION THAT HE READ AND FORWARD TO YOU. \n\n\n                                     YOURS IN THE WORK, \n                                                        M.
