    "word": "12\n \n     Wisdom from Above--Men are wanted who feel their need of wisdom from above, men who are converted at heart, who understand that they are but sinful mortals and must learn their lessons in the school of Christ before they are prepared to mold other minds.  When men have learned to depend on God, when they have faith that works by love, and purifies their own souls, then they will not lay on other men's shoulders burdens that are grievous to be borne.--Letter 83, 1896 (May 22, 1896, To O. A. Olsen).",
