    "word": "August 9, 1896. I have written this to you because it is a serious matter, involving serious consequences, \n                                                                           316\nwhich will affect future work in other localities. Brother ----- needs no flattering words from you; for he has a full estimation of his own abilities and makes them appear by demeriting others. He does not realize that he is seeking to be first. He is not prepared to take upon himself the responsibilities of a minister of the gospel; for he needs a humble and a contrite spirit. He needs to continue to give Bible readings, and when his brethren see that he is fitted to become a preacher of the gospel, this will be made manifest. You need caution.",
