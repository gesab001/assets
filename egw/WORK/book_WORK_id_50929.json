    "word": "If the angels of God had not exercised a restraining power upon you, you would have gone to great lengths, because Satan was working with you and manifesting his attributes through you. Notwithstanding your capabilities as captain upon the high seas, and that you hold a responsible position in the vessel under your command, yet it will not be safe to trust the missionaries who have ventured their lives to go to the islands of the sea to be laborers together with God in seeking to save perishing souls, to one who is not fully under the control of the Spirit of God. The enemy is determined to destroy those who will bear the truth to the ignorant and the unenlightened. Missionaries will have enough to bear without having to encounter the spirit of the one who stood as commander of the vessel. You had it in your power to make it very disagreeable for those laborers, but it was your duty to make it as pleasant as possible.",
