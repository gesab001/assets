    "word": "Men who occupy responsible positions in the work of God should not feel that it is required of them to deal with those whose very lives are interwoven with the rise and growth of these institutions, and who made them what they \n                                                                           24\nwere in their prosperity, as with others who have had no special burden and have acted no leading part in bringing them into existence. These institutions will not please God, if they neglect the duty of giving honor to whom honor is due. The guardians of these institutions will not displease God in treating very tenderly the self-sacrificing servants of God whom he has used as his chosen instruments in the upbuilding of his cause. They should exercise the same tenderness toward them which children should exercise toward their parents; while tenderness should be ever cherished in return. These institutions are as dear to us as our children.",
