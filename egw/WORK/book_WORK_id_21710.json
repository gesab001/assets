    "word": "Giving Away Large and Small Books.--We gave away many of our large and small books to families [attending camp meeting] who were unable to buy them, asking them to read them and to lend them to their neighbors. In this way we set one family to work for neighboring families. They would come together and read the books aloud. As a result, conviction was brought to the hearts of some, and souls were converted.--Lt 102, 1908.",
