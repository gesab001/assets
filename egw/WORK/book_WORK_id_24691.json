The Drawing Cords of Love.--As Jehovah is holy, He requires His people to be holy, pure, undefiled; for without holiness no man shall see the Lord. \n                                                                           940\nThose who worship Him in sincerity and truth will be accepted by Him. If church members will put away all self-worship, and will receive in their hearts the love for God and for one another that filled Christ's heart, our heavenly Father will constantly manifest His power through them. Let His people be drawn together with the cords of divine love. Then the world will recognize the miracle-working power of God, and will acknowledge that He is the Strength and the Helper of His commandment-keeping people (MS 125, 1907).  {7BC 939.12}  \n     18, 19.
