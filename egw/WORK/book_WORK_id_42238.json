    "word": "We need to realize that we are living in critical times. There is no time to be lost if we would make the right impression regarding the work. Satan is making every effort possible to undermine our confidence of men in the law of God, causing them to regard it as of little importance. But men should remember that the God of heaven proclaimed His law from Mt. Sinai with His own voice, that men might realize its importance. The Lord does not want the people who stand for His law in the earth, and who are to accomplish His closing work in the world to represent that law and that work in a cheap manner. God's purpose in guiding us to Washington, the capital of our nation, was that we might represent His work there in a sensible way. In connection with His work, He would not have anything of a cheap and faulty character.",
