    "word": "Meditation and Prayer\n     God should be the highest object of our thoughts. Meditating upon him, and pleading with him, elevates the soul and quickens the affections. A neglect of meditation and prayer will surely result in a declension in religious interests. Then will be seen carelessness and slothfulness. Religion is not merely an emotion, a feeling. It is a principle that is interwoven with all the daily duties and transactions of life. Nothing will be entertained, no business engaged in, that will prevent the accompaniment of this principle. To retain pure and undefiled religion it is necessary to be workers, persevering in effort. We must do something ourselves. No one else can do our work. None but ourselves can work out our salvation with fear and trembling. This is the very work which the Lord has left for us to do. . . .",
