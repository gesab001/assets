    "word": "Are we working to proclaim truth, righteousness, and the love of God? This is the work that is assigned us. Even in bereavement we should not stop to grieve; but let us show our love for the faithful workers who have gone to their rest, by doing the work they would have done had they lived. While we do our own work, we may also take up theirs where they left it, and firmly and courageously carry forward the banner of truth to final victory.",
