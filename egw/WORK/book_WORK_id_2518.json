    "word": "9\n \n\nLoyalty\n\n     Faithful Leaders Needed--Faithful and picked men are needed at the head of the work.  Those who have not had an experience in bearing burdens, and who do not wish to have that experience, should not, on any account, live there.  Men are wanted who will watch for souls as they that must give an account.  Fathers and mothers in Israel are wanted at this important post.  Let the selfish and self-caring, the stingy, covetous souls, find a location where their miserable traits of character will not be so conspicuous.  The more isolated such ones are, the better for the cause of God.  I appeal to the people of God, wherever they may be found:  Awake to your duty.  Take it to heart that we are really living amid the perils of the last days.--Testimonies, Vol. 2, pp. 467, 468.",
