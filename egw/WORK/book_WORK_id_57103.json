    "word": "I attended the eight o'clock meeting, where the subject was discussed of having a ministerial institute, to continue six months. Elder Olsen spoke. Professor Prescott spoke upon the subject, laying out the matter in clear lines. E. J. Waggoner spoke with clearness. W. C. White spoke upon the necessity of laborers being sent to all lands, and illustrated on the map the work done in California, and the territory to be worked and the advancement made the past year over the previous year. Brother Loughborough spoke on this point. I bore testimony to the necessity of special institutes for the education of ministers that they might work intelligently and with courage in the service of God. Elder Kilgore read a lengthy communication in regard to the color line in the South and how to conduct the work there.",
