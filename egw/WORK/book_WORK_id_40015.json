    "word": "Words of Counsel to Teachers and Students \n\nPortion of an address given by Mrs. E. G. White at Huntsville, \n                        June 21, 1904. \n\n\n     I am so pleased to see the colored students who are here today. I only wish there were many more in training for service; for there is a large field to work in the South. God wants the students before me to be His helping hand in reaching souls in many places. He wants them to have an intelligence so sharp and clear that they can grasp the most precious truths, and in the simplicity of Christ present these truths to those who have never heard them.",
