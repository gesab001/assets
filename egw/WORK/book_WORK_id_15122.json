    "word": "\"My husband continued: 'Ellen, you are on missionary ground. You are to sow in hope and faith, and you will not be disappointed. One soul is worth more than all that was paid for this land, and already you have sheaves to bring to the Master. The work commenced in other new fields,--in Rochester, N. Y., in Michigan, in Oakland, in San Francisco, and in the European fields,--was quite as unpromising as the work in this field. But the work you do in faith and hope will bring you into fellowship with Christ and His faithful servants. It must be carried on in simplicity and faith and hope, and eternal results will be the reward of your labors.'\"",
