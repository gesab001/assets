    "word": "As the Lord's missionaries, a great work was before the disciples; but they were to be witnesses for Christ first in Jerusalem where His enemies thought to extinguish the torch of truth that had been lighted. In their cruel murder of the Saviour, and by the false reports they had circulated regarding His resurrection, they thought to remove all witness to the truth.
