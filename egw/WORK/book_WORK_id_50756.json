CALDWELL AND \n          J. S. GIBBS WERE PHYSICIANS ON THE STAFF OF THE RURAL \n          HEALTH RETREAT IN ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA.]) \n\n\n     There is a large field for you to work in. Both of you can give short lectures in the parlor at stated times, which will be select but plain, upon the human body and how to treat this wonderful house the Lord has given us, which will aid you in your work as physicians as nothing else can. The people are ignorant, and need to be enlightened on almost every point of how to treat their own bodies. Then there will not need to be a dwelling upon the delicate diseases nearly as much.",
