    "word": "New Methods \n\n     It is time for the people of God, those who wear the sign of His kingdom, and whose authority is derived from \"It is written,\" to work. The world is the field of our labor, and we are to strive to give the last message of mercy to the world. Our every action is being watched with jealous eyes. Be on guard as physicians. You can serve the Lord in your position by working with new methods and discarding drugs.",
