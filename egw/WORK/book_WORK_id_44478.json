    "word": "The Result of Unselfish Service. \n\n     In the work for the relief of our schools, the Lord has bestowed on us a gift of great value, and has marked out for us the pathway of blessing. He called upon me to give our schools the manuscript of the book, \"Christ's Object Lessons.\" He called upon our publishing houses to make liberal gifts of labor in preparing the book for sale. In response to this call, they acted their part nobly. Our people contributed generously to raise a material fund, and then went forth willingly to sell the book for the help of the schools.",
