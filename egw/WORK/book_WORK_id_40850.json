    "word": "I have been looking over the testimonies given for the Sabbath-keeping people, especially those at B. C. I am astonished at the mercy of God and his care for his people in B. C., in giving them the many admonitions and warnings, pointing out their dangers, presenting before them the exalted position he would have them occupy. If they would keep themselves in his love, and separate from the world, he would make his especial blessings to rest upon them, and his light to shine around about them. Their influence for good might be felt in every part of the gospel field, in every branch of the work. If they failed to meet the mind of God, if they continued to have so little sense of the exalted character of the work as they had in the past, their influence and example would prove a terrible curse, they would harm, and only harm. The blood of precious souls would be found upon their garments.",
