    "word": "There has been some talk of putting up a large building here. The Lord does not want us to erect large buildings. He wants converted men with converted hearts more than anything else. I urge you to go to the places that have been neglected, and give the message of warning to the people. The Lord is coming soon, and many are unready, unready. Here is territory all around you, where thorough work should be done to interest souls in the truth for this time. Some can take our books and learn what it means to go to the highways and hedges with the message of truth. Use the gift that you have; impart the light you have received. Repeat the truth over and over again to the people in simplicity and love. Such labor will be greatly appreciated.",
