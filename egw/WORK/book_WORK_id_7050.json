    "word": "I cannot understand why our papers should contain so many notices of books unessential for this time. Plenty of such books can be obtained in all bookstores. Why not draw the minds of the people to subjects relating to the words of eternal life. Why not make an effort to obtain communications simple, real, and true, from our workers in all parts of the world. God calls for this class of reading. We have no time to devote to commonplace things, no time to waste on books which only amuse.--Manuscript 80, 1899.",
