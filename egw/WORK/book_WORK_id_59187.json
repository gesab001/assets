    "word": "We are to do a special work for those who are in high positions of trust. The Lord calls upon those to whom He has entrusted His precious gifts to use in His service their talents of intellect and means. Some will be impressed by the Holy Spirit to invest the Lord's means in a way that will advance His work. They will fulfil His purpose by helping to create centers of influence in the large cities. Our workers should present before these men a plain statement of our needs, letting them know what they need in order to help the poor and needy and to establish this work on a firm basis.",
