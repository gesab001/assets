    "word": "One-half of a large building was sold for $8,000. The other half has been sold to my son for $4,000, less $25. This building is to be used as a sanitarium in the Southern field, where needed treatments can be given to colored people who are sick. I have seen this place, and all the other buildings that have been purchased at half their estimated cost. They are very well situated for our work. \n\n\n                                  -252-",
