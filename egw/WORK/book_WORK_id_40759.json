    "word": "Souls are to be gathered as sheaves to Jesus Christ; but where are the reapers? Christ has commanded, \"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.\" Not only is there a need of reapers, but of other agencies that will work in various lines, according to their ability. Every kind of labor is to be devised and set in operation. Every follower of Christ is to do something in the work, and not to do what you can, is to manifest indifference to the claims of Christ. If you refuse to be a faithful steward, working under the Master, then you are following the directions of another leader, and ranging yourself with those who are warring against God. Christ said, \"He that is not with Me, is against Me; and he that gathereth not with Me, scattereth abroad.\" If we are not active \n                                                                           29\nin the service of Christ, we are ranking with those who are in positive hostility against Him; for we are in the position of stumbling blocks. Every means of influence that God has given you, should be employed to the utmost.",
