    "word": "1146. The field for medical missionary work is open before us. We are now beginning to comprehend the light given years ago,--that health reform principles would form an entering wedge to the introduction of religious principles. To voice the words of John, \"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world.\" Would that all our workers might be enlightened, so that they could work intelligently as medical missionaries, for such knowledge would serve as credentials to them in finding access to homes and families wherein to sow the seeds of truth. We want to feel as Christ felt,--that we cannot abandon helpless, suffering ones to the evils of orphanage, and ignorance, and want, and sin, and crime.--U. T., June 13, 1895.",
