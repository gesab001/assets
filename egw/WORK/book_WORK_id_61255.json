    "word": "If any of the students and workers here desire to go with Brother Magan and Brother Sutherland, let them go and help them to carry the light to those who have never heard the truth, to a class of people that has been suffering with neglect and poverty. I know that Brother Haskell and Brother Butler will be glad to have the help of Brethren Magan and Sutherland, and will unite with them in the work of God. They will have a hard time of it at the best, but if God is with them, they may know that He will sustain them. \n\n\n                                (Signed) \n\n\n                                             Ellen G.
