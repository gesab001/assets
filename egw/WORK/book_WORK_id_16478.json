    "word": "Take Time to Commune With God \n\n     The physician who is truly converted will not gather to himself responsibilities which interfere with his work for souls. It is a mistake to lay upon the Christian physician, whom God has appointed to represent Him in His own way, so many responsibilities that he has no time to commune with God by reading His word and by prayer. Christ declares, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" How, then, can a medical missionary engage successfully in his important work without earnestly seeking the Lord in prayer? Prayer and a study of the word bring life and health to the believing worker.--MS. 159, 1899.",
