    "word": "Battle Creek, Tuesday, January 13, 1891. E. J. Waggoner came in late last evening and we had a talk in regard to the ministers' meetings now being held. He rejoiced that there was an entirely different atmosphere pervading the meetings than was in the ministerial institute last year. Thank the Lord for this testimony. Oh, my constant prayer to God is that there may be a deep, earnest work in reformation, that the matter of correct principle may be seen and sacredly acknowledged and preserved. Here, I have been instructed, is where the danger signal must be lifted, else the Lord will not cooperate with His people.",
