    "word": "The great wheel of God's providence is turning. God will work with you. I have not dared to write out that which I hope to write in regard to perplexing questions. I have some matters which I wrote in Battle Creek, April 28, 1901. This I shall have copied. When the warnings were given me in reference to your engaging in the boat business, the Lord saw the result of the whole matter. He saw the opportunity it would give the enemy to misconstrue and magnify every jot and tittle of what was done. Therefore you were warned to beware, lest you should give occasion for criticism from those who would make the most of your every mistake. There are those who make a man an offender for a word. You know that all I said has been fulfilled. . . .",
