    "word": "We are to be constantly receiving and giving. We are to be living channels of light. The transforming grace of Christ must come to every minister that he may sanctify himself, that others also may be sanctified. There should be earnest effort put forth to wake up an ease-loving, sleepy Church that has great light and knowledge, but not corresponding faith and works. There must be a living testimony borne, pointing out the necessity of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit of God upon every church-member, that light may shine forth to others that are in darkness. There is altogether too little done in ministerial labors. There is plenty of surface plowing, and the result is manifest -- there is scarcity of fruit-bearing Christians.",
