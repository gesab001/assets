    "word": "In order to be truly successful, the physician must live in close relation to Christ. He must cherish a constant sense that he is one of the Lord's chosen instruments, appointed to bear to the sick the word of life, to declare to them that if they receive Christ as a personal Saviour, they will be given power to become sons of God. It is in the power of every physician, in his work for the sick, to be a gospel teacher, bearing to those to whom he ministers, the sure cure for sin, pointing them to the Lamb of God, who alone can make successful the physical treatment given. In the simplest of language he is to speak of the Saviour, his heart filled with a longing for the salvation of the one to whom he is speaking. . . .",
