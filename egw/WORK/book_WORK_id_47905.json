    "word": "MR No. 458 - Counsels on Sanitarium Work\n\n     A large amount of means should not be used in selfishly building up an immense institution in one part of the country, to the neglect of other parts of the field that are just as much in need of similar facilities. Large sums would be required to furnish the rooms, many helpers would be needed, and heavy expenses would be incurred in carrying on such large interests. In doing this supposedly great work, our brethren would be losing sight of the real work that our sanitariums are established to accomplish.",
