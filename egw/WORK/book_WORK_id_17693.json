    "word": "All Part of a Perfect Whole.--We are all represented as being members of the body, united in Christ. In this body there are various members, and one member cannot perform exactly the same office as another. . . . Yet all these organs are necessary to the perfect whole and work in beautiful harmony with one another. The hands have their office, and the feet theirs. One is not to say to the other, \"You are inferior to me\"; the hands are not to say to the feet, \"We have no need of you\"; but all are united to the body to do their specific work and should be alike respected, as they conduce to the comfort and usefulness of the perfect whole.--4T 128 (1876).",
