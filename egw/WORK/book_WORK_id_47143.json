    "word": "The arms of Jesus are open to receive you; will you not come to Him? Jesus presents to you the gift of eternal life; will you receive it? Faith and works go together, and each is dead if alone. Not that works will save you; they are the fruit of faith, and living faith will reveal itself in action. The hand of Christ is stretched forth to receive you; will you put your hand in that of the dear Saviour and say, Lead me; I will follow Thee, my Saviour? You must not be neglectful of the conditions of salvation, which are faith and obedience. There must be a cooperation of the human with the divine. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord; but Jesus is ready to receive you now; and if you will only believe that He is your Saviour, that He died to redeem you, He will be found of you as the most precious friend.--Letter 9a, 1891, pp. 3, 6. (To Sister D. S. Gilbert, June 3, 1891.)",
