    "word": "\"This man has labored most earnestly to advance the work among the colored people. In this work he has pushed the triumphs of the cross more decidedly than any other of the laborers in this field. He is not a fraud. He has not selfishly, willfully, knowingly done wrong. The Lord is very zealous for those who have united with this his servant, and when occasion requires He will work mightily for them. Mistakes have been made: but the Lord, the Creator, has in charge those who are striving to do the work that needs to be done. They are not shielded for their wrongs, but in His pity and kindness and love, and the Lord has mercy on them. He knows all about everyone of them. \n\n\n                              -223- \n\nThey have had to pass through the fire of affliction. They have exhausted their life energy in doing the breaking-up, pioneer work, that others would not do. They are as gold tried in the fire. God will be glorified in those who have been laborers together with Him in breaking up the ground in fields that have never before been worked.",
