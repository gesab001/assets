    "word": "Every one of us is invited to be a laborer together with God. Christ estimated the human family as of such value as to lead Him to leave the royal courts, laying aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and clothing His divinity with humanity, to come to this world. He was born of poor and humble parentage. The people did not know that He was one from the royal courts of heaven. Yet He did not seek a high position. His only purpose was to seek and to save that which was lost, and in this work He wants our help today.",
