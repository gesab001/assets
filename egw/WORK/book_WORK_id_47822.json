    "word": "The sanitarium at Battle Creek has been built up under a pressure of difficulties. There have had to be measures taken, contracts signed by those whom they engage as helpers, that they will remain a certain number of years. This has been a positive necessity. After help has been secured, and after considerable painstaking effort, they have become efficient workers, wealthy patients have held out inducements of better wages to secure them as nurses for their own special benefit, and take them to their homes. And these helpers would leave the sanitarium and go with them, without taking at all into consideration the labor that has been put forth to qualify them for \n\n\n                                    -129- \n\nefficient workers.

Then people have come as patrons from other institutions that are not conducted on religious principles, and in a most artful manner have tolled away the help by promising to give them higher wages.",
