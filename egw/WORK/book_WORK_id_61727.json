    "word": "To our brethren in Southern California I bear this message: The president of your conference has the lesson to learn that he is not to endeavor to rule his fellow laborers who have occupied positions of trust under God in the work; neither is he to consider himself capable of carrying all things after his own ideas. He has thought that it was his right to rule in every branch of the conference work, and this has led him to judge and criticize fellow laborers who were better able than he to do the work. He must first rule himself before he can hope to rule others wisely, or to plan wisely for the advancement of the work. Position will not give to any man an all-round education.",
