    "word": "\"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,\" that ye may be healed of all spiritual infirmities, that sinful dispositions may be changed. Make diligent work for eternity. Pray most earnestly to the Lord and hold fast to the faith. Trust not in the arm of flesh, but trust implicitly in the Lord's guidance. Let each one now say, \"As for me, I will come out, and be separate from the world. I will serve the Lord with full purpose of heart.\" . . .",
