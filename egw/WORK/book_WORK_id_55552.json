    "word": "Men in positions of trust, positions in our institutions, you become self-centered; you bring commercial business in. Men of responsibility that stand in positions of trust have contracted too big and heavy burdens to stop to pray. You are to consider the words of Christ, \"Without me ye can do nothing\" [John 15:5]. Leave Christ out of your service and you cannot distinguish between the common and sacred fire. Oh, they are too crowded with the cares of life for them to pray. What is their positions before God? You can go on and load yourself with burdens and with cares and perplexities, and live [a secular life]. \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" Now, what is the use to leave Jesus out of the question and go on with your bungling work, botchwork, and with your affections centered upon the things of this world, and absorbed and controlled by the business part--the temporal things \n\n\n                                      -175- \n\nof this life and that which is of no value to us--and that which is of eternal moment to us is put away as a thing to be taken up transiently, when most convenient? If you go to meeting, you cannot keep awake because you have robbed God of the nerve brain power in pressure of worldly cares and of the physical and of the spiritual. You have not been drinking of the life streams which made glad the city of our God. You have not been drinking of the snow of Lebanon, but you have been drinking at the malarious streams in the valley; and what you want [lack] is religion. It is what you will have to have or you will never enter the kingdom of God.",
