    "word": "Ministers should be able to speak interestingly and understandably to Sabbath school children.--There was a general superintendent of Sabbath schools who, while addressing a Sabbath school upon one occasion, was very dry, lengthy, and uninteresting. A mother asked her daughter of ten years if she enjoyed the exercise, and also, \"What did the minister say?\" Said the little girl \"He said, and he said, and he said, and he didn't say anything.\" Now, we do not want any such account of our labor as that. We want the very best of training for the work that we can possibly have ourselves, so that we can make a success in teaching others the things that we have learned.--CSW 169.",
