    "word": "Oh, that our brethren might realize the value of the gift of Christ's love! Let the love that dwells in renewed, sanctified hearts be seen among the workers.

But those who, by receiving into the heart the lessons of the divine Teacher, have been made partakers of the divine nature, are not changeable. Their work is done in harmony with Bible principles. God calls for true, staunch men, men who are working together with Him. Such men share His wisdom, and in their renewed lives His power is revealed.",
