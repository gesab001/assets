    "word": "Christ's commission is, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" Those who are impressed to take up the work in the home field or in regions beyond are to go forward in the name of the Lord. They will succeed if they give evidence that they depend upon God for grace and strength. At the beginning their work may be very small, but it will enlarge if they follow the Lord's plan. God lives, and He will work for the unselfish, self-sacrificing laborer, wherever and whoever he may be.",
