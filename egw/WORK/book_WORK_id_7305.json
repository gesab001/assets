    "word": "100\n     Dr. Julia A. White: Dear Sister:  I write to urge you to connect with our sanitarium work at Loma Linda.  In the providence of God, this property has passed into our hands.  The securing of this sanitarium, thoroughly equipped and furnished, is one of the most wonderful providences that the Lord has opened before us.  It is difficult to comprehend all that this transaction means to us.",
