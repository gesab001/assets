    "word": "Discovered by Medical Missionary Work.--I have been instructed that the medical missionary work will discover, in the very depths of degradation, men who, though they have given themselves up to intemperate, dissolute habits, will respond to the right kind of labor. But they need to be recognized and encouraged. Firm, patient, earnest effort will be required in order to lift them up. They cannot restore themselves. They may hear Christ's call, but their ears are too dull to take in its meaning; their eyes are too blind to see anything good in store for them. They are dead in trespasses and sins. Yet even these are not to be excluded from the gospel feast. They are to receive the invitation: \"Come.\" Though they may feel unworthy, the Lord says: \"Compel them to come in.\" Listen to no excuse. By love and kindness lay right hold of them. . . . This work, properly conducted, will save many a poor sinner who has been neglected by the churches.-- Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 279, 280.",
