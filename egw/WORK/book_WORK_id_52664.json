    "word": "Many have a faith, but not a faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Saving faith is not simply a mere belief of the truth. \"The devils also believe, and tremble.\" The inspiration of the Spirit of God gives to men a faith that is an impelling power that molds character, and leads men higher than mere formal actions. The words, the actions, and the spirit are to bear testimony to the fact that we are followers of Christ.",
