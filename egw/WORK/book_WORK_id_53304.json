    "word": "Did Christ take upon Himself our nature? It was to give us unmistakable evidence that a great work may be wrought through the human agent who cooperates with God in bringing fallen man into close fellowship and union with divinity.

They are like the lost sheep who once rejected the shepherd's voice, but now they are returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of their soul, and He attaches them to Himself.",
