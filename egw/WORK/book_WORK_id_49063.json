    "word": "I have quite a number of letters to go, but shall not try to have them fitted up, for several have written me that when they could have the matter direct from my hand, it was far more forcible than after it had been prepared. It sounded like another thing, and as the matter is not designed for publication, I shall not send it to Fanny [Bolton]. [FANNY BOLTON WAS EMPLOYED AS A LITERARY ASSISTANT TO ELLEN G. WHITE DURING THE EARLY 1890'S. A TALENTED WRITER HERSELF, SHE SOMETIMES CHAFED UNDER THE ANONYMITY REQUIRED OF THOSE WHO WERE EMPLOYED TO CORRECT ELLEN WHITE'S WRITINGS GRAMMATICALLY AND ELIMINATE REPETITION, BUT WHO WERE FORBIDDEN TO INSERT THEIR OWN IDEAS INTO ELLEN WHITE'S MANUSCRIPTS. ALTHOUGH MRS. WHITE APPROVED OF ALL ARTICLES AND BOOKS BEFORE THEY WERE RELEASED FOR PUBLICATION, SHE APPARENTLY FELT THAT MISS BOLTON AT TIMES WENT BEYOND HER ASSIGNED DUTIES. IN 1894, MISS BOLTON WAS FINALLY SEPARATED FROM MRS. WHITE'S WORK AFTER REPEATED CYCLES OF CRITICISM FOLLOWED BY APOLOGIES AND CONFESSIONS.] I think Fanny feels that many of my expressions can be bettered, and she takes the life and point out of them.--Letter 77, 1892. (To W. C. White, October 21, 1892.)",
