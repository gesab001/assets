    "word": "Nurses not to be restricted.-- After the nurses have served the term agreed upon, and have given their services in return for their education, they should be at liberty to take up work where they wish, and to earn what they can. Some may not have been able to save any money while getting their education. Their board and clothing, with the gifts they have made to the cause of God, may have taken all their earnings. Then if they are taken sick, they have no money to fall back on, and they are helped by the sanitarium as cases of charity. \n                                                                           39\nThis is a species of slavery to which some will conscientiously submit, while others will backslide from the truth.",
