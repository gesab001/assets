    "word": "Since the meeting at Minneapolis, you have followed in the tread of the scribes and Pharisees. Never will you have greater evidence of the working of the Holy Spirit than you had at that meeting. Again and again the Spirit of the Lord came into the meeting with convincing power, notwithstanding the unbelief manifested by some present but you were deceived and prejudiced, and manifested the spirit of those who refused to acknowledge Christ. You have followed in their tread, and have refused to acknowledge the mistakes and errors in resisting the message the Lord in mercy sent you. Afterwards, at the Conference meetings held in Battle Creek, though evidence after evidence was given you, you refused to accept the message sent you by God. You would not humble your pride and repent; your wrong attitude remained unchanged. \n                                                                           1345\nAt times you have been deeply impressed by the deep moving of the Spirit of God, and you were almost ready to fall on the Rock and be broken, but you strengthened yourself to resist. With others you walked in the same path as did the rebellious Jews; the same spirit that inspired them inspired you, and the results have been similar. You need a teachable spirit. You will never find rest until you yield up your set, stubborn will, and cease to resist the pleadings of the Spirit of God.",
