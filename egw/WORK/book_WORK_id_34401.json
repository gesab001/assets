    "word": "We would be very much pleased to see you, after so long a separation. Will you please write to us in regard to your own health and the Mission, which has so recently been bereft of its workers. We desire so much to know the particulars of your husband's sickness and death, and also of Brother Carmichael's death. In our papers we have read the history of that field, and of your missionary labours. You have had Christ with you in all places, and at all times, and all paths are holy to them that walk with Him. As His representatives, you have suffered with Him. You have suffered deprivation in a foreign country. You have been saddened by the sight of poor wretched beings dying around you for want of food and clothing.",
