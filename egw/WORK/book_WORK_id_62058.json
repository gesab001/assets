This land was expressly bought to be the site of the Oakwood Industrial School and the acreage Ellen White spoke of to \u201cnever part with.\u201d Since then the Oakwood College constituency has acquired upwards of twelve hundred additional acres. Some of these additional acres have been sold.  It has been the practice, however, to discriminate between the original 360 acres and the additional acreage.\n\n2 - So Well Begun\n\nPlace: Oakwood School, Huntsville, Alabama\nApril 29, 1909\n     I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking to this company of students. Some time I expect that this room will be filled, and that another room will be filled also. We expect to see a work done here that men will be proud to acknowledge. We are glad indeed to see so many present.",
