    "word": "I love you and I cannot bear to be thus disconnected as we are. I have not union with you. I cannot feel any freedom in counseling with you when the Lord has signified by plain, direct testimony this should be,--that you needed counsel, you could help me and my husband and we could help you and now you must know I shall not change. You must know if you are not blinded, that my testimonies have not changed, that I have not changed in character or in my work, and hope through the grace of God, never to swerve to the right or to the left to have harmony with you or Elder Butler or any elder in the ranks of Sabbathkeepers.",
