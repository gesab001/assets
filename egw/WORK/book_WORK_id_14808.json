    "word": "IF UNBELIEF SUGGESTS THAT WHAT SHE WRITES IN HER PERSONAL TESTIMONIES SHE HAS LEARNED FROM OTHERS, THEN WE INQUIRE, WHAT TIME HAS SHE HAD TO LEARN ALL THESE FACTS? AND WHO, FOR A MOMENT, CAN REGARD HER AS A CHRISTIAN WOMAN, IF SHE GIVES HER EAR TO GOSSIP, AND THEN WRITES IT OUT AS A VISION FROM GOD? NO PERSON, EVEN OF SUPERIOR NATURAL AND ACQUIRED ABILITIES, COULD LISTEN TO THE DESCRIPTIONS OF SO MANY CASES, AND WRITE THEM OUT WITHOUT GETTING THEM CONFUSED, OR LAYING THE WHOLE WORK OPEN TO A THOUSAND CONTRADICTIONS. IF, AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN A FEW INSTANCES, INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED PERSONAL TESTIMONIES DENIED THEIR CORRECTNESS, SO MANY HAVE RISEN UP TO TESTIFY TO THE FACTS BROUGHT OUT, OR TIME HAS SO CLEARLY PROVED THEIR TRUTHFULNESS, THAT HER TESTIMONIES HAVE BEEN VINDICATED, OFTEN BY THOSE WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH HER WORK.",
