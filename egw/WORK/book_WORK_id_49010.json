    "word": "I was not well on that day. Infirmities more severe than usual had pressed upon me Sabbath and Sunday. After I had spoken an hour and twenty minutes, Elder Daniells asked if I would speak in their missionary meeting at five p.m. that day. I felt so strengthened that I said I would. We rode home two miles to dinner. While at home a severe illness came upon me. I was cramped and suffered much pain. It seemed as if I had been poisoned, and this was really the case. On the journey from Melbourne to Adelaide I had a sleeper, but in the compartment next to mine there was smoking going on. The poisonous odor could not be excluded from my compartment, as the entrance door was made of lattice work, and the transom of wire. I endured it until my heart's action was much increased, and I felt as though tight bands were drawn around my head, then we spoke to the guard. He told the smokers they were breaking rules, and pointed to the framed notices hanging in the car; but as soon as the guard's back was turned, the men smoked as vigorously as before. A second time they were spoken to, but with no better results. Then May pleaded with them, telling them of my condition, but even this did no good. So I had to submit, though the air was heavy with the poisonous odor. That night I could not sleep; a burning fever came upon me. My head throbbed with pain, and my temples and eyes pained me. \n\n\n                                -347-",
