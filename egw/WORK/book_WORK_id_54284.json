    "word": "You are engaged in a great work, but you are treating yourself unwisely. You must guard yourself and those who look to you for instruction, that you may not work away the healthy tone and fragrance which reveals the sound, sensible principles that make sound, sensible workers who can advance God's cause. This thing you must remember: every standard raised in the work is to be founded on the Book, that storm and tempest may be unable to sweep it away.",
