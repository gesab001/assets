    "word": "If we work diligently upon the plan of addition, we shall not be barren in a knowledge of Christ. We should, however, take heed to ourselves, lest we fall because we do not cherish and cultivate the \n30\nChristian graces. \u201cHe that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.\u201d This scripture brings to view those who are in a divided state, those who talk as they please, those who indulge appetite and passionate speech, failing to take themselves in hand. Such persons have no moral strength to carry out the principles that would bring to them, as overcomers, the crown of life. They are like a man who has forgotten that he has been purged from his old sins.",
