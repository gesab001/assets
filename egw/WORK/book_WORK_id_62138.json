The correspondence covers many subjects, including Ellen White\u2019s burden for Oakwood and its specific needs.\nJuly 19, 1905\n     I am glad that these men are still able to do solid, substantial work. They must have greater encouragement, in point of financial assistance, in their work in the\n34\nSouthern field. Their efforts have brought many souls into the truth, and they must not be left to wear out their souls in discouragement. The Southern field is a very hard, needy field, and it must receive assistance. Chosen men should be appointed to receive the funds that will now be called for in behalf of the enterprises that must now come to the front in this needy field.",
