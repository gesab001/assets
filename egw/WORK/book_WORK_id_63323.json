    "word": "God calls upon our pastors and teachers to be wide awake and not stand as blind watchmen. Let them obtain from Christ the eyesalve that will enable them to see all things clearly. Then let them examine the foundation timbers of our institutions. Not all pertaining to our work is being carried forward in an elevated, upright way. God wants his people to have a clear understanding of all the important transactions pertaining to his cause, that they may know that they are following a course he can approve.",
