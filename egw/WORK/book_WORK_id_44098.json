    "word": "Christ has led the way from earth to Heaven. He forms the connecting link between, the two worlds. He brings the love and condescension of God to man, and brings man up through his merits to meet the reconciliation of God. Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. It is hard work to follow on, step by step, painfully and slowly, onward and upward, the path of purity and holiness. But Christ made ample provision to impart new vigor to every advance step, and new and divine strength is imparted at every step in the divine life. This is the knowledge and experience that the hands in the Office all want, and must have, or they daily bring reproach upon the cause of Christ.",
