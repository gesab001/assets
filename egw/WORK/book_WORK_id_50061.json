    "word": "MR No. 953 - Sale of Testimony No. 34 for Relief of Institutions in Denmark\n\n     I believe with all my heart that the Lord has the supervision of the sale of Christ's Object Lessons, and my heart is being deeply stirred to make an effort for the relief of the institutions in Denmark and Norway. I wish to donate the proceeds from Testimony 34 to this work. Will our publishing houses act in harmony with me in this matter? Shall we not do our best to lift the burden of debt from these institutions? Those who take part in such an effort will not lose, but gain; for this effort will bear God's endorsement. A manifestation of liberality now will win His approval. --Letter 16, 1901. (To C. H. Jones, January 23, 1901.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. October 27, 1982",
