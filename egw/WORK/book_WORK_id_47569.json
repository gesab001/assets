    "word": "\"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\" 2 Corinthians 3:18. The glory he mentioned is character, therefore by thinking and talking of Jesus we become charmed with His character, and by faith we become changed from character to character. \"And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.\" \"Ye are the light of the world . . . Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" We must practice the example of Christ, bearing in mind His Sonship and His humanity. It was not God that was tempted in the wilderness, nor a god that was to endure the contradiction of sinners against himself. It was the Majesty of heaven who became a man--humbled Himself to our human nature.",
