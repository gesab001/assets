    "word": "It matters not what our position may be or how limited our capacities, we have a work to do for the Master. Our graces are developed and matured by exercise. With the truth of God burning in the soul we cannot be idle. The happiness we shall experience in doing will compensate even in this life for every effort. Those only who have experienced happiness resulting from self-denying effort in the service of Christ can speak of the matter understandingly. It is indeed joy so pure, so deep, that language cannot express it. \n\n\n     \". . . Through life's transient day \n      There is a special work marked out for you; \n      It may be of the lowliest kind, it may \n      Be such as shall the loftiest powers display. \n      But none besides yourself your work can do. \n      'What wilt Thou have me do?' With single eye \n      To your Redeemer's glory, work for Him; \n      Illumined every moment from on high, \n      Strive in each action God to glorify, \n      Nor let one thought of self life's radiance dim.\" . . .",
