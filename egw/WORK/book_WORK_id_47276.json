    "word": "God does not expect any man to use talents that He has not given him. He expects His workers to use their talents in union with one another. No one is to think that his work is to be carried forward in a stereotyped, precise way, little details being carried out in a way that is approved by one man or two men or three men. Give your students room to work with the greatest Teacher the world has ever known. He is a true educator. As members of God's family, we are to give one another room to work.",
