    "word": "The Work in New Fields\n     [REMARKS BEFORE THE SWISS CONFERENCE, FRIDAY, SEPT. 11.] \n     I have been deeply interested this morning in listening to the reports  of labor from the various fields. I have been connected with the work in  America from its very commencement, and understand something about the  difficulties to be met when the cause is in its infancy. We have seen the  work go hard, and we have seen of the salvation of God in the presentation of  truth. The reports we have heard here sound the same as those we have heard  in America. Those who accept the truth in this country have a great cross to  lift; and when they do take their stand firmly, our brethren no doubt feel as  we did when the work first started. One soul who embraced the truth was  regarded of more value than mountains of gold. We wept and rejoiced, and  could scarcely sleep. Our hearts were so filled with gratitude, and so  closely united in love and sympathy, that we wanted to praise God day and  night.",
