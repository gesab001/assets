    "word": "A Fund for Schoolwork \n\n     The church should take in the situation, and by their influence and means seek to bring about this  much-desired end. Let a fund be created by generous contributions \n                                                                           45\nfor the establishment of schools for the advancement of educational work. We need men well trained, well educated, to work in the interests of the churches. They should present the fact that we cannot trust our youth to go to seminaries and colleges established by other denominations; that we must gather them into schools where their religious training shall not be neglected.",
