    "word": "Before the destruction of the old world, there were talented men, men who possessed skill and knowledge; but they became lifted up in their own imaginations; just as men are doing today, and because they left God out of their plans and councils, they became wise to do that which God had never told them to do, wise to do evil. Their wisdom would have worked destruction to those who should be born who should come in contact with them, and the Lord took the matter in hand, and cut them off from the earth. After sending them warnings for a hundred and twenty years, God's mercy and forbearance was exhausted, and then the day of probation was ended. The probation given them in mercy, they devoted to ridiculing Noah, \n                                                                           388\nwhom God had sent with a message. They caricatured and criticized him, just as some who thought themselves wise have done; they have laughed at the messengers just as they did in Noah's day for his peculiar earnestness, and for his intense feelings in regard to the judgments that were sure to come. Noah warned them that God would fulfill his word; but they reasoned among themselves, they talked of science, and of the laws controlling nature, and they laughed Noah to scorn, calling him a crazy fanatic. Men who believe themselves to be wise in our day, will do good to their own souls, and to the souls for whom Christ died, if they recognize that there is a wisdom, an unsanctified wisdom, that comes from beneath, which has been in the world ever since the fall.",
