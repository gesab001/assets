    "word": "Satan's deceptions are so insidious that to some they wear the garb of truth. He comes to men telling them of the advantages to be gained by taking a noncommittal position. And yielding to his temptations, some who have been defenders of the faith become its secret enemies. The love of the world has robbed men of their discernment, and there is a general feeling that the Lord has delayed His coming. Selfishness has covered itself with the robes of heaven, and in the hearts of many truth no longer bears away the victory. There is \"another spirit\" at work. The covetousness that is fostered in business lines is astonishingly deceptive. Fraud, robbery, and falsehood are brought in, and while professedly keeping God's law, men are departing from its principles.",
