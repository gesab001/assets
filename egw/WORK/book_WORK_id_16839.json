    "word": "Section Thirteen - Medical Missionary Work and the Gospel Ministry\n\n                      A United Work \n\n     I wish to speak about the relation existing between the medical missionary work and the gospel ministry. It has been presented to me that every department of the work is to be united in one great whole. The work of God is to prepare a people to stand before the Son of man at His coming, and this work should be a unit. The work that is to fit a people to stand firm in the last great day must not be a divided work.",
