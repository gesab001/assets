    "word": "The youth of our cities breathe in the tainted, polluted atmosphere of crime. The evil influence is then communicated to the country, and the whole community becomes contaminated. The rulers are not men of moral worth, but men who are well supplied with this world's goods, and they have neither the desire nor the inclination to check the growth of this root of bitterness which is increasing year by year, and is fostered and fed by just such publications as are now being sold everywhere, and by such stories and descriptions of criminal practices as are found in the papers of the day. So-called revelations of the future are treated as realities. Revolutions are predicted: many minds catch the evil spirit lurking in these representations of future horrors and feed upon these things until they become imbued with the same spirit, gradually working themselves into a state of mind which will lead them to do even worse, were it possible, than is predicted by the writers.",
