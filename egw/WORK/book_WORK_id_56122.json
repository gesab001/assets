    "word": "We must hold to a plain, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" even though it cause great inconvenience to some who have no respect for the Sabbath. On one side is man's supposed necessity and opposition, on the other God's commandment. Which will have the greatest force on our minds? Our restaurants are not to be opened on the Sabbath to all who shall come, or to a few. Everyone who is employed is to be assured that he will have the Sabbath as a day of rest on which to honor and serve God. The closed doors of our restaurants on the Sabbath are to stand as a memorial, that all may know that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, and that in it no unnecessary work is to be done.",
