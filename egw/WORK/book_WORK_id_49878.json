    "word": "Why Christ Could Speak Forgiveness to the Dying Thief--He could, as the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, speak these words of forgiveness, which meant so much to the dying criminal. Divinity was doing its work while humanity was suffering from the hatred and revenge of a God- hating people, because Christ had acknowledged Himself the Son of God. He alone could respond to the poor suffering thief.--Ms. 84a, 1897, p. 2. (\"Christ on the Cross,\" August 15, 1897.)",
