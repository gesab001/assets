    "word": "Where there has been one laborer in the harvest field, there should have been many; but unless the minister can do thorough work, and not think that half work is all that God requires, he would better keep out of the cause. Those who stand ready to give themselves to the work of the ministry, not merely to sermonize, but to minister to souls, visiting them at their homes, searching the Scriptures and praying with them, will have success; heart will become joined to heart in holy endeavor to do for others; and the people will go forth to work for others as the minister has worked for them.",
