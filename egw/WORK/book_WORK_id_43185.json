    "word": "You have a work to do to meet the mind of the Spirit of God, to repent and confess your sins before God, and right your ways as far as possible for you to do. You have no time to lose. Some will go into their graves with their sins unconfessed because Wm. Gage, Bro. McLearn, and several others have thrown themselves as bodies of darkness between God and the people, that the light he has sent them should be of no account. Does not God call for thorough repentance and humiliation, lest his form be removed from the church.",
