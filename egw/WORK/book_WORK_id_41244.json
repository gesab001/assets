    "word": "Faithfulness in the Work. \n\n     The helpers should take Jesus with them in every department of their labor. Whatever is done should be done with that exactness and thoroughness which will bear inspection. The heart should be in the work. Faithfulness is as essential in washing dishes, sweeping the floors, and doing chamber work, as in caring for the sick or administering baths. Some may receive the idea that their work is not ennobling; but this is just as they choose to make it. They alone are capable of degrading or elevating their employment. Would that every drone might be compelled to toil for his daily bread; for work is a blessing, not a curse. Diligent labor will keep up from many of the snares of Satan, who ever finds some mischief for idle hands to do. \n\n\n                     -22-",
