    "word": "Temptation to Bypass God's Institutions.--Yesterday I had presented to me [by one of the workers] the advisability of supplying my books direct to agents in fields where few are sold. Thus I would receive a larger income. I laid the matter before my son W. C. White as it had been presented to me. Then he told me how he regarded the proposition, and in conclusion said, \"Mother, unless you have a special direction from the Lord, I advise you to make no new moves. It will bring perplexity to others and additional care and burden to you; and you have cares and burdens enough. In every new move we must consider the interests of the whole work.\"",
