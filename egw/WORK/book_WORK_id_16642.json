    "word": "\"Those who bear heavy responsibilities in our institutions should be strengthened and sustained by the knowledge that the members of every place are praying for the prosperity and success of these institutions. If the churches do not feel that the work done in our institutions is a most important work, and that the laborers need their sympathy and hearty, intelligent cooperation, this deficiency will retard the advancement of the work. Complaints are not infrequently made in regard to the men who carry a heavy load. Discouragements come upon these men because of the unconsecrated elements in the churches, who love to talk, and say, 'Report, and we will report it.' This makes more work for the men who are already overburdened.",
