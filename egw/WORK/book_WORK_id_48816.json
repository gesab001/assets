    "word": "Office Does Not Automatically Confer Wisdom \n     When a worker is selected for the presidency of a conference, that office itself does not bring to him power of capability that he did not have before. \n\n\n                                    -161- \n\nA high position does not give to the character Christian virtues. The man who supposes that his individual mind is capable of planning and devising for all branches of the work, reveals a great lack of wisdom. No one human mind is capable of carrying the many and varied responsibilities of a conference embracing thousands of people and many branches of work.",
