    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     Some men whom God was calling to the work of the ministry have entered the field as canvassers. I have been instructed that this is an excellent preparation, if their object is to disseminate light, to bring the truth revealed in God's word directly to the home circle. In conversation the way will frequently be opened to speak of the religion of the Bible. If the work is taken hold of as it should be, families will be visited, the workers will manifest Christian tenderness and love for souls, and great good will be the result. This would be an excellent experience for those who have the ministry in view.",
