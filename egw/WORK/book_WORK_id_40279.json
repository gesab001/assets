    "word": "While we were at Washington, attending the General Conference, the question was raised, \"Shall we sell the Colorado Sanitarium to those who are offering to buy it?\" I was instructed to say to our brethren in Colorado, It would not be for the glory of God for the Colorado Sanitarium to be sold. Under the circumstances, an offer . . . would be to some a strong temptation, and they would be inclined to sell the sanitarium, and thus lighten the burden of indebtedness. \n                                                                           18\nBut God sees not as man sees. Our people would be acting like men with their eyes put out, should they consent to sell this institution. . . . The Boulder Sanitarium is to do its appointed work. From it the light of truth for this time is to shine forth, and the great message of warning be given. . . .",
