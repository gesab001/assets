    "word": "The school orchard is doing excellently well. If the land is worked it will yield its treasures, but weeds will grow and those who own land will not exercise ambition to take these weeds out by the roots and give them no quarter. Deep plowing must be done. They let a few orange trees grow in the sod, also the lemons. We get the choicest, best oranges for three pence and two pence ha'penny per dozen--six cents American money, and four and five cents per dozen for large, beautiful, sweet oranges.",
