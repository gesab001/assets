    "word": "The books of Daniel and the Revelation are one. One is a prophecy, the other a revelation; one a book sealed, the other a book opened. . . . The special light given to John, which was expressed in the seven thunders, was a delineation of events that would transpire under the first and second angels\u2019 messages. . . . The first and second angels\u2019 messages were to be proclaimed, but no further light was to be revealed before these messages had done their specific work. . . .",
