    "word": "On Sunday we were taken to see the different lines of work that are being carried on by our people in Graysville. We went over the school buildings, and then we visited the 25-acre farm on the hill, which has recently been acquired by the conference, and has been leased to the school. On this farm we saw large fields of corn being cultivated by the students, broad pasture land, and on the hill 30 acres of strawberries.",
