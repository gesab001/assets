    "word": "MR No. 671 - Pacific Press Branch Office in Mexico\n\n     In reference to the establishment of a branch office in Mexico, I cannot see why this work should not be entered upon. I cannot see why, when we are the helping hand of God, when we have been given instruction in regard to the part the publishing work is to act in carrying the message of present truth, this opportunity should not be improved. It is through the publication of our literature that light is to shine forth to many places. Our books and tracts and papers will go where we cannot go. As these messengers are sent on their way, they will give their message. No one can enter into controversy with them, for they cannot answer back. They stand as dumb, but powerful witnesses for the truth.--Manuscript 81, 1901, pp. 6,7. (Talk given by Mrs. E. G. White to Board of Directors of Pacific Press, August 21, 1901.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. November 15, 1978",
