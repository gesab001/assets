    "word": "Has God placed His work in such a careless manner, that man could fashion \n                                                                           307\nit to suit his own inclinations, receive that which was agreeable to him, and reject a portion? Would God give visions to correct His people of their errors and then trust to the erring one's judgment to receive or reject what portion of them he pleased? What would be the use of visions in the church if held in this light, or if erring individuals in their darkness were left to make what application of them they pleased? This is not the way that God works. If God reproves His people through an individual He does not leave the one corrected to guess at matters and the message to become corrupted in reaching the person it is designed to correct. God gives the message and then takes especial care that it is not corrupted.",
