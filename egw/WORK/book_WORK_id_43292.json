    "word": "My ministering brethren, you are to learn the same lessons, for these are the words of Christ through Paul, given for your instruction and admonition: \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly \n\n\n                        -12- \n\nfurnished unto all good works. I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\"",
