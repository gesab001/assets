    "word": "Spoil not your influence by overworking in an effort to accomplish some great thing. When you become worried as the result of overwork, every adverse word appears in large bold characters before you, and you begin at once to make a raid against those who you think are trying to work against you. Your hasty words are unexpected, because often there is no cause for any such outburst. These things greatly detract from your influence.--Letter 193, 1903, pp. 4, 5. (To Elder E. E. Franke, Sept. 1, 1903.)",
