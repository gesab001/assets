    "word": "Our ministers must cease to dwell upon their peculiar ideas with the feeling, \"You must see this point as I do, or you cannot be saved.\" Away with this egotism.

It is not your ideas they must feed upon, but it is the flesh and blood of the Son of God. He says, \"My flesh is meat indeed\" (John 6:55). \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:63).",
