    "word": "Let us be careful that we do not offend one of the little ones who believes in Jesus. All about us are souls that are tempted. They know not how to receive from Christ the grace and help that He can give. As Christians we are ever to stand ready to help such ones. With all the powers of our influence we are to seek to draw to Jesus Christ those who are in need of His grace. We are not to stand in indifference and coldness, with no sympathy for those who are tempted. We must work one for another.",
