It is the intelligent and promising and promising youth who are called for to come to Battle Creek, and these are the very ones that are needed in other places, in our schools, in our sanitariums. These young men and young women will be needed to do the work that must be done in different parts of the Lord's vineyard.

They are to be scattered throughout the field. Plants are to be made in all parts of the Lord's vineyard.
