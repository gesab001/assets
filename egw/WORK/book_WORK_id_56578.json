    "word": "Two things are set before us,--the conversion here in this life of body, soul and spirit, or the eternal loss of the soul hereafter. When you come to understand that as you are today, there is not the slightest hope for you to secure that life that measures with the life of God, will you then dare to say, I do not confess? I do not repent?--No; you do not, you have not repented. Neither did Satan repent of all the evil that he had done. But it is for your present and eternal interest to fall on the Rock and be broken. If you do not do this, the Rock will fall on you, and grind you to powder. In the invitation that Christ Himself gives you He declares, Him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast cut. Those who have helped to hold you in your blindness and exalted infatuation are guilty with you. To the lawyers who have encouraged you in your purpose to do the unrighteous work that you have been inspired to do, the word is spoken, woe unto you lawyers.",
