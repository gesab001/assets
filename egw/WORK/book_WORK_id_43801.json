    "word": "Some at this institution are sadly deficient in the qualities so essential to the happiness of all connected with them. The physicians, and the helpers in the various branches of the work, should carefully guard against a selfish coldness, a distant, unsocial disposition; for this will alienate the affection and confidence \n                                                                           6\nof the patients. Many who come to the Sanitarium are refined, sensitive people, of ready tact and keen discernment. These persons discover such defects at once, and comment upon them. Men cannot love God supremely and their neighbor as themselves, and be as cold as icebergs. They not only rob God of the love due him, but they are robbing their neighbor as well. Love is a plant of heavenly birth, and it must be fostered and nourished. Affectionate hearts, truthful, loving words, will make happy families, and exert an elevating influence upon all who shall come within the sphere of their influence.",
