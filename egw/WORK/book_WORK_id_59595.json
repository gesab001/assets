    "word": "The Lord Jesus calls upon every one to become interestedly engaged in the work of becoming a channel of light through which \n\n\n                         -88- \n\nthe grace of Christ may flow. Jesus has said, \"Ye are the light of the world. . . Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" In the great salvation wrought through Jesus Christ, (140) the unbelieving world is to be helped through the work of believers. In the work you do in the sanitarium, many may become convinced that you are indeed the children of God.",
