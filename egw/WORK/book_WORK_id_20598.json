    "word": "We need to praise God more \u201cfor His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men.\u201d Psalm 107:8. Our devotional exercises should not consist wholly in asking and receiving. Let us not be always thinking of our wants and never of the benefits we receive. We do not pray any too much, but we are too sparing of giving thanks. We are the constant recipients of God\u2019s mercies, and yet how little gratitude we express, how little we praise Him for what He has done for us.",
