    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     Dear Reader. A sense of duty to my brethren and sisters, and a desire that the blood of souls might not be found on my garments, has governed me in this little work. I am aware of the unbelief that exists in the minds of the multitude relative to visions, also, that many who profess to be looking for Christ, and teach that we are in the \u201clast days,\u201d call them all of Satan. I expect much opposition from such, and had I not felt that the Lord required \n63\nit of me I should not have made my views thus public, which will probably call forth the hatred and derision of some. But I fear God more than man.",
