    "word": "God help us; for it is those who shall enter in through the gates into the city, who shall hear the benediction, \"Well done, good and faithful servant; enter into the joy \n\n\n                -56- \n\nof thy Lord.\" What is that joy? Why, it is to see souls saved in the kingdom of God. He sees the travail of His soul and is satisfied. What has your life been? Are you the minister of Christ? Why, what are you doing? What are you building on? Is it on hay, wood, and stubble? Or what? Or is it the gold, the silver, and the precious stones--something that the fires of the last days will not consume? I ask you again, What is your life work? God help you to bring in the gold, silver, and precious stones, that you may see in the kingdom of God souls saved through our instrumentality, and we may enter into the joy of our Lord.--Ms 4, 1888 (MR 900.57).",
