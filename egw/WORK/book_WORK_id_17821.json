    "word": "The Bible plainly teaches that there can be no harmony between the people of God and the world. \"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you\" (1 John 3:13). Our Saviour says, \"Ye know that it hated Me before it hated you\" (John 15:18). Satan works through the ungodly, under cover of a pretended friendship, to allure God's people into sin that he may separate them from Him; and when their defense is removed, then he will lead his agents to turn against them and seek to accomplish their destruction.--PP 559 (1890).",
