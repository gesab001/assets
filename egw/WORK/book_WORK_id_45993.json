    "word": "The Lord has a work for Brother Haskell to do in our large meetings. He is not to take the whole burden, but is to stand in his lot and place in connection with his ministering brethren. In the Lord's work there is a diversity of gifts. All minds are not of the same mold, neither do they present the same truths in the same way. One man's method is not to be regarded as the method which all men shall follow. Different minds compose the body of believers. All God's workers have not been given the same talents.--Ms 12, 1901, pp. 8-10. (\"The Living Water,\" typed Feb. 7, 1901.)",
