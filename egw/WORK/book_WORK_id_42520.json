    "word": "Chap. 12 - The Work in the South.\n\n     The Lord has laid upon me a heavy burden in behalf of the work in the Southern states of America. In the past I have received much instruction regarding this work, and for years I have followed the movements of the workers with intense interest. As it now is, this field stands as a reproach against those who claim to be fulfilling the commission that Christ gave His disciples just before His ascension.",
