W., July 8, 1895. \n\n\n     Dear Brother Jones: There is need for the Pacific Press to stand in God, subject to no human power of control in their action. You \n                                                                           28\nare not to hold yourself to seek permission of the authorities of Battle Creek whether you shall or shall not pursue a line of work that seems impressed upon you to do. The Lord is the one to whom you are to be amenable. All the light heretofore given me of God is that these institutions out of Battle Creek should not be absorbed by Battle Creek. It would be an injury to both parties. Each is to stand in harmony one with the other, yet preserve their individuality of action, responsible to God and Him alone. If one pursues a course of selfish action, or of absorbing everything by just or unjust means, my voice can not be silent. I shall be heard, for God has given me His word. I look upon consolidation in unity, and helpfulness of one another, as sound principle; but I do not and can not give my influence to consolidation in blending the institutions in one great whole. . . .",
