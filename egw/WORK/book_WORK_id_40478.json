    "word": "Satan is working to the utmost to make himself as God, and to destroy all who oppose his power. And today the world is bowing before him. His power is received as the power of God. It seems that the whole human creation has wondered after the beast. The kings and rulers of the earth, those who are called noblemen, think themselves altogether too great to submit to the yoke of Christ. But they are willing to bow at Satan's bidding.",
