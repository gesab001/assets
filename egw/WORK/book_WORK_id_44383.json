White to the teachers and students of the Nashville Agricultural and Normal Institute at Madison, Tenn., April 26, 1909\n\n     Words of Encouragement to Self-supporting Workers \n\n           By Mrs. E.G. White \n\nSchools for the Highways and Hedges \n\n     I am very glad to have the opportunity of speaking to as many as I see before me at this time, in a field where a large work is yet to be done. In all these unworked fields, special efforts are to be made. In laboring for the unwarned, we are to seek to \"compel them to come in.\" Why?--Because souls are at stake. There is a message to be given to these souls, and those in the highways and in the hedges must hear the Word of life.",
