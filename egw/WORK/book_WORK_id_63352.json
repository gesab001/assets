    "word": "I know that some have thought it advisable for the workers in our sanitariums to sign certain contracts. But I know also that it is not in accordance with God's plan for the workers to sign these contracts. They are pledged to God, and if he moves upon them to take the message to a certain place, shall they be bound by a pledge that hinders them from going? Never, never, We are not our own, and we are not to bind ourselves to human beings by signing contracts to do this or that. We are to work under our Master, Christ Jesus, looking to him for directions. We are to pray and work and believe, following always the course that he marks out.",
