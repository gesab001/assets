    "word": "As reformers we are to reform the medical practice by educating toward the light. Our work is to be done in the full recognition of God. We are to practice the strict principles of mercy and justice. Our work is not to be as a garment put together with basting threads. We must imitate God's perfection. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" We are to make the foundation of every building thorough and solid, as for eternity. Nothing must be done carelessly or shabbily. Do not put two timbers where there ought to be three.",
