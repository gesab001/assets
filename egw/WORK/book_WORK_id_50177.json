    "word": "MR No. 982 - Conforming to God's Will in Tithe Paying, Soul Winning, and Unity\n\n     Dear Sister: A long time ago I received your letter enclosing a draft for $100; $25 of this you say is a thank offering, to be used in carrying forward the work in some needy place. As you have requested, I shall use it where, according to my best judgment, it is most needed. The reward of whole-souled liberality is the leading of mind and soul and heart to a closer fellowship with the Spirit.",
