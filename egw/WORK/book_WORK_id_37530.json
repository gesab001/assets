    "word": "Christian Politeness Needed.--There are enough who want to be Christians, and if we will let the leaven begin to work, it will take one and then another, just as the spirit of God will work with us and we will see that we can reach the people, not by our own smartness, but by the Spirit of God. Yet we want the ability and power that God has given us to be brought into use. We do not want to be novices forever; we want to know how to conduct ourselves properly; we want Christian politeness. And we want to carry it with us in all our work. We do not want any of the sharp corners which may be in our character to be made prominent, but we want to work in humility, so we will forget them, and better characteristics will come in. We want cheerfulness in our work.--Manuscript 10, 1888. \n                                                                           90",
