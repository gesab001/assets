    "word": "The apostles thus describe the adornment that should be sought by Christians: \u201cWhose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\u201d [1 Peter 3:3.] \u201cIn like \n94\nmanner, also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.\u201d [1 Timothy 2:9.] Pride and extravagance in dress are sins to which woman is especially prone; hence these injunctions relate directly to her.",
