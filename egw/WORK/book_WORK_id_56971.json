Miller\n\n                                     Between Elmira and Canton \n                                     June 2, 1889 \n\nDear Brother Howard Miller:- \n     My mind is burdened on your account. From time to time your case has been presented before me in connection with the work and cause of God. In assemblies where you were present, I have presented general principles, knowing that if you had an ear to hear, and a heart to understand, you would take these things to yourself. While at Minneapolis I had a testimony from the Lord to His people; but you as well as others did not recognize the voice. You did not respond, but went from the meeting with matters perverted in your mind. Acting under false impressions yourself, you have given false impressions to others.",
