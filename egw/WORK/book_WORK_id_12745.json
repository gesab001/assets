    "word": "The world is given up to self-indulgence. \u201cThe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life,\u201d control the masses of the people. But Christ's followers have a holier calling. \u201cCome out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean.\u201d In the light of God's Word we are justified in declaring that sanctification cannot be genuine which does not work this utter renunciation of the sinful pursuits and gratifications of the world.",
