    "word": "To no man has been appointed the work of being a ruler over his fellow men.  Every man is to bear his own burden.  He may speak words of encouragement, faith, and hope to his fellow-workers; he may help them to bear their special burdens by suggesting to them improved methods of labor; but in no case is he to discourage and enfeeble them, lest the enemy shall obtain an advantage over their minds,--an advantage that in time would react upon himself.--Manuscript 29, 1907, pp. 9, 10 (Individual Responsibility & Christian Unity, Jan. 1907).",
