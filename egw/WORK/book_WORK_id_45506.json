    "word": "I was instructed by One of authority that our work is to be carried on conscientiously by our own believing people. We are to unite our forces solidly, and work for the glory of God, multiplying the evidences of truth in every possible way. The Lord God is our Counselor. Christ is our Mediator and Saviour. We are to bring into the work every living agency who feels that he is chosen of God to do, not a common, commercial work, but a work that will give light and truth, Bible truth, to the world.--Letter 72, 1907, pp. 1-3. (To E. R. Palmer, Feb. 25, 1907.) \n\nReleased November 12, 1963.",
