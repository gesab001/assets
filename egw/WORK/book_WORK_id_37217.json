    "word": "Scale of Usefulness--The young men and women who join the church should have a special education in the work for which they are adapted. But if one continues to choose a low, common train of conversation, receive him not as a worker. He will do more than can be counteracted to spoil the other workers. . . . The words, the spirit, the attitude, determine the scale of usefulness.--RH March 22, 1898.",
