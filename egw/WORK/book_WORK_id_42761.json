    "word": "The Lord will plan for us if we will let him do this. It is his money, not ours, and he expects that every one will ask wisdom from him in regard to the use he makes of his means. Places that have so great need of workers and facilities as Europe and London are a world in themselves, and yet, while thousands upon thousands of dollars have been invested in buildings in Battle Creek. London has scarcely been touched. England has needed many more men and much more means, but the supposed wise men have managed in a remarkable manner to reveal that their wisdom was foolishness, while they were so filled with conceit that the Lord could do nothing for them. They were working at cross purposes with God, pursuing a course in the management of their business transactions that made them feel independent, and they have taken money for their supposed capabilities, which they did not earn. The Lord does not want men to pile up buildings as they have done in Battle Creek. There is a large field to be worked, and a variety of talents in money and intelligence and experience are to be transferred to England.",
