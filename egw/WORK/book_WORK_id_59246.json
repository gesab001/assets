    "word": "The Lord has given evidences of his love for the world. There was no falsity, no acting, in what he did. He gave a lifting gift, capable of suffering humiliation, neglect, shame, reproach. While human beings are instituting schemes and methods to destroy him. The Son of the infinite God came to our world to give an example of the great work to be done to redeem and save men. But today the proud and disobedient are striving to acquire a great name and great honor from their fellowmen by using their God-given endowments to amuse. This they do instead of calling upon them to behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world.",
