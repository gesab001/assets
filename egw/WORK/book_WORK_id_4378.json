    "word": "In the words spoken to the Hebrew mother [the wife of Manoah], God speaks to all mothers in every age. \"Let her beware,\" the angel said; \"all that I commanded her let her observe.\" The well-being of the child will be affected by the habits of the mother. Her appetites and passions are to be controlled by principle. There is something for her to shun, something for her to work against, if she fulfills God's purpose for her in giving her a child.",
