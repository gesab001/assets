    "word": "There are many things that need to be lifted and strengthened in various ways. The amount of work done for the needy and destitute is to be equally divided. You should gather less upon yourself, and do some real work to place workers in destitute fields, where they can work in the same lines in which you are working. You are becoming dizzy; you are losing your clear, firm, healthful conception of the work of God for this time. Know your limitation, for the sake of those who have been trying to plant the standard in fields where they have nothing. Know what you can do and what you cannot do.",
