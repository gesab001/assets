    "word": "Vital to Our Own Eternal Destiny.--As you engage in this work you have companions unseen by human eyes. Angels of heaven were beside the Samaritan who cared for the wounded stranger. Angels from the heavenly courts stand by all who do God's service in ministering to their fellow-men. And you have the cooperation of Christ Himself. He is the Restorer, and as you work under His supervision you will see great results. Upon your faithfulness in this work, not only the well-being of others, but your own eternal destiny depends.--Christ's Object Lessons, p. 388.",
