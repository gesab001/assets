    "word": "Man becomes a co-laborer with Christ, bringing souls back to God, by representing in actions the character of God, which has been misrepresented, falsified, by Satan. We aim too low. We are hesitating, doubtful; in self-esteem we can do nothing. Caution is needed; but while some of the workers are guarded, and make haste slowly, if there are not united with them in the work those who see the necessity of being aggressive, very much will be lost; opportunities will pass, and the opening providence of God will not be discerned.",
