    "word": "If men and women could only see and realize how their unbelief and mournful murmurings exalt Satan and give him honor, while they rob Jesus Christ of His glory in the work of saving them, wholly and entirely, from all sin! . . .

Let us train our minds to stand on the mount before God in faith, strong in God under any and every temptation. . . .",
