    "word": "The Lord gave special directions in the arrangement of the encampment of the Israelites in regard to how the camp should be arranged. All was to be done with perfect order. Each man had his appointed work. No one man was to do it all, but each man had a specified work and was to attend to that work faithfully and critically, that the order and harmony and exalted character of the work should make decided impressions on the nations around them, showing to these nations that Israel had a Governor who was the Lord Himself. Thus the work and character of God would not stand inferior or belittled in the eyes of the nations who served other gods.",
