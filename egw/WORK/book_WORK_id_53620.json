    "word": "As you have had so little cooperation in your work by those who should have helped you all in their power, and as there has been so little interest in your work, the Lord would not have you work to such disadvantage, for health and strength were failing, and there are places where you could do a good work for the Master. Some things were presented before me of a determination of men who, under their general, Satan, were full of hatred to you and to your work. This is the best evidence you can have that the work was of the Lord, that Satan stirred up the people as he did against Paul the apostle.",
