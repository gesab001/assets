    "word": "Locate Families to Hold the Interest Awakened.-- Then there is Toronto [Australia], a pleasure resort. These places are all within ten and twenty miles of Cooranbong, and must be entered as soon as we can find consecrated families whom we can locate there to hold the interest awakened. All these fields are white for the harvest, but we can do nothing without devoted workers, who can enter and arouse and hold an interest.--Letter 76, 1899.",
