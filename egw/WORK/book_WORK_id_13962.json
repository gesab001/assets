    "word": "The longest of these is called, by way of distinction, the St. Gotthard. This one tunnel is nine and one-fourth miles long. In the middle of it the road reaches its highest elevation, 3787 feet above the sea, and then begins to descend on the other side. During the seven and one-half years in which this one tunnel was in process of construction, twenty-five hundred workmen on an average were employed daily, and sometimes the number reached three thousand four hundred. The boring \n230\nwas commenced on both sides of the mountain at the same time; and such was the engineering skill displayed that when the workmen came together, there was not the variation of an inch in their work. The contractor, Mr. Louis Favre, did not live to see the completion of his task, having died of apoplexy in the tunnel three years before it was finished.",
