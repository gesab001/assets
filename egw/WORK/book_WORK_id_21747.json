    "word": "In the human brotherhood it takes all kinds of talents to make a perfect whole; and the church of Christ is composed of men and women of varied talents, and of all ranks and all classes. God never designed that the pride of men should dissolve that which His own wisdom had ordained--the combination of all classes of minds, of all the varied talents that make a complete whole. There should be no depreciating of any part of God's great work, whether the agencies are high or lowly. All have their part to act in diffusing light in different degrees. . . . We are all woven together in the great web of humanity, and we cannot, without loss, withdraw our sympathies from one another.--Gospel Workers, pp. 330, 331.",
