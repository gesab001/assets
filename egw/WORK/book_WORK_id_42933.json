    "word": "For the Children.--My subject principally was that the smaller children should not be neglected. This work is fully as essential as the work for the older pupils. For many years my attention has been called to this phase of work. Schools should be established where children should receive proper education. From the teachers in the public schools, they receive ideas that are opposed to the truth. But further than this, they receive a wrong education by associating with children that have no training, that are left to obtain a street education. Satan uses these children to educate children that are more carefully brought up. Before Sabbath-keeping parents know what evil is being done, the lessons of depravity are learned. The souls of their children are corrupted.",
