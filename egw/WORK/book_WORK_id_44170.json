    "word": "Bro. Miller needs a thorough conversion. \n                                                                           22\nHe does not see himself. If he possessed less self-esteem, and more humility of mind, his knowledge could be put to a practical use. He has a work to do for himself which no other can do for him. He will not yield his views or judgment to any man living, unless compelled to do so. He has traits of character which are most unfortunate, which should be overcome. He is more accountable than H. S. Giddings. His case is worse than his; for he possesses more intellect and knowledge. H. S. Giddings has been the shadow of his mind.",
