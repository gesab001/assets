    "word": "B 29 '05 (Copied Jan. 1, '05):-- \n\n\n     O how I long to see the work going with power in New Bedford and Fairhaven, and in many other places just as greatly in need of the truth as these places. We hope that sometime a sanitarium may be established in New Bedford. Medical Missionary workers are needed in such cities. But, dear sister, it \n\n\n                         -77- \n\nrequires talent of no ordinary ability to manage a sanitarium. Men of experience, tried and tested must take hold of the work. That part of the workers who undertake to establish such an institution are experienced and qualified, is not sufficient. For their own sake, for the sake of the institution, and for the sake of the cause at large, it is important that a complete corps of well qualified men and women be found to enter upon the work. The Lord's eye is over the whole field, and when the time is (123) ripe for an institution to be started in a certain field, He can turn toward that place the minds of the men and women best prepared to enter the institution.",
