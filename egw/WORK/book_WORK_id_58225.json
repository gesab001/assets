    "word": "Bear in mind, my son, that success is not the result of chance, of accident, or of destiny, but is the out-working of God's own providence, the award of faith and discretion, of virtue and persevering labor. It is the practice of truth that brings success and strength of moral power. In practicing the teachings of Jesus you will reveal to the angels of heaven and to men that you have learned of the great Teacher. The bright rays of the Sun of Righteousness are to be welcomed as the light of the mind; and the principles of the character of Christ are to be made the principles of our character. The Lord will certainly be with you, and will endue you with his Holy Spirit, if you seek him with all your heart.",
