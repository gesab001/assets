    "word": "Transforming Power of Truth.--It is through the transforming influence of divine grace on human hearts that the power of the word of truth is revealed. The message, proclaimed in regions where it has not yet been heard, makes an impression on hearts. It seems to have greater power in transforming character than when presented to those who are familiar with its office work. Truth has little power on the hearts of those who walk contrary to it for advantage to themselves--those who follow a course opposed to its principles. Such ones profess to believe the word of God, but they give no evidence that they are sanctified by it.",
