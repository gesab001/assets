    "word": "A Work Which Discredits Health Reform \n\n\n     There will be some who will not leave the best and most correct impression upon minds. They will be inclined to narrow ideas and plans, and have not the least idea of what constitutes health reform. They will take the testimonies which have been given for special individuals under peculiar circumstances, and make these testimonies general and to apply in all cases, and in this way they bring discredit upon my work and the influence of the testimonies upon health reform.--Letter 57, 1886.",
