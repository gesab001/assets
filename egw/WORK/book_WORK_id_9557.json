    "word": "Paul's Methods Reached All Nations and People.-- Paul in his journeys combined home and foreign  missions. Now he is preaching to the Jews in their own place of worship. Now he is preaching to the Gentiles, before their own temple and in the very presence of their gods. Nor does Paul proclaim to the Jews a Messiah whose work is to destroy the old dispensation, but a Messiah who came to develop the whole Jewish economy in accordance with the truth.",
