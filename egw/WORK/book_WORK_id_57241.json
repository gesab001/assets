    "word": "You who have not spiritual enlightenment may ask, Why do ye so? Why do you speak these words? Men may want to put words in my mouth which would save them from any embarrassment, but God is my shield; I lift up my head in the storm, for He, the Lord, whose I am and whom I serve, will not allow the billows to go over me. If God strengthens me as He did on the last Sabbath and every day since then, I shall feel myself strengthened with a courageous and joyful spirit; for I experience within me a divine power by which and through which I can accomplish the work He has given me to do. Satan's work has been to erect barriers against me and my work that would keep my message from coming to the people. He would rejoice to have me in weakness, and to see me trembling at the sight of dangers which surround me and mountains of difficulties which rise before me. My nature shrinks, but notwithstanding I advance with holy boldness to meet one difficulty after another which arises to obstruct my way; yet I move forward in the name of the Lord in simple faith to meet them, relying upon Him \n                                                                           588\nwho is eternally near, and who will go with me, and who will, when it is for His name's glory, rebuke with a word the ocean's wave, and thresh the mountains that they shall become a plain.",
