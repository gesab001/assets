    "word": "The work in this missionary field is yet in its infancy. The believers have made only a beginning in the Christian life; and the reason why we have felt so great a burden for this people is, that henceforth they may learn greater things. It doth not yet appear what they shall be through a practical belief in the truth and the sanctification of the entire being by the truth. The words and example of our Redeemer in His life of humility and self-denial will be the light and strength of His people if they follow Jesus fully, trusting in Him at every step. Let it be the language of our hearts, \"Be Thou my pattern.\" He that \"willeth to do His will, \n                                                                           179\nhe shall know of the teaching.\" Nothing is so desirable as to live as Christ lived, to deny self as Christ denied Himself, and to labor with Him in seeking to save that which is lost.",
