    "word": "The Lord would so educate the minds of all who serve Him that we can reflect the light given us, by cultivating our powers to reflect back glory to the Giver. All our powers are entrusted to us to be used in the accomplishment of the work of saving souls. All the powers of the mind are to be used, through sanctification of the truth, to win souls. In such a work God is glorified.--Letter 6, 1911, p. 1. (To Dr. David Paulson, February 6, 1911.)",
