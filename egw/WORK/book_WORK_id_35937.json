Consecrate all you have and are to Him. This is but \u201cyour reasonable service.\u201d Do not delay; for there is peril in a moment\u2019s delay. A few more years at the longest will be yours to work for the Master, and then the voice which you cannot refuse to answer will be heard, saying, \u201cGive an account of thy stewardship.\u201d\u2014Signs of the Times, Jan. 21, 1897.",
