White\n\n                             Norfolk Villa, Prospect St., Granville. \n\n                                          September 25, 1895. \n\n\n                                            W-86-1895 \n\nDear son Edson:- \n     I am sending quite a large mail this month. Marian has had to do the work of preparing the MS, but she has not gone into the matter very critically, as for the work of publication. We are glad to have Bro. and Sr. Prescott with us. I have not been as well as usual for several months: I suppose it is because I feel so intensely over the great events that I know are soon to open before us. We see that the professed believers will be represented by the ten virgins, five of whom were wise, and five were foolish. I fear this is the average the Lord saw of those that would be ready and unready. But a small number of those who have had great light and abundant opportunities and continuous privileges have anything more than a theoretical knowledge of the truth. Many think that such a knowledge is all that is required. They are not doers of the word.",
