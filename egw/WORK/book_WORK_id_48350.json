    "word": "Every one who believes in Christ as a personal Saviour, is under bonds to God to be pure and holy, to be a spiritual worker seeking to save the lost, whether they are great or small, rich or poor, bond or free. The \n\n\n                                    -190- \n\ngreatest work upon earth is to seek and to save those who are lost; for whom Christ has paid the infinite price of His own blood. Every one is to do active service, and if he who has been blessed with light does not diffuse light to others, he will lose the rich grace which has been bestowed upon him, because he neglects a sacred duty plainly marked out in the word of God. As his light diminishes, his own soul is brought into peril, and the ones to whom he should have been a shining light, miss the labor that God intended that they should have through the human instrument. Thus the sheep unsought is not brought back to the fold.",
