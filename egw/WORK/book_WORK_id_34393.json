    "word": "Here is your work \u2014 leading souls to the fountain of the water of life. All who have the truth in their own hearts as a living principle, an all-pervading influence, will have a living testimony to bear to those who are in the darkness of error. There is, thank God, an ever living Spirit to guide us into all truth. But it is to be communicated, not shut up to our own individual selves. This \n71\nSpirit, who will guide us into all truth, must be made known to others, and will guide them. The Word, the precious Word, is to be eaten as the flesh of the Son of God. Let there be no listless, sleepy testimonies.",
