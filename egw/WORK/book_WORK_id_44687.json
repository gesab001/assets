    "word": "My brother, do not represent truth and the situation of things as so formidable that those belonging to the W. C. T. U. will turn away in despair. There are vital truths upon which they have had very little light. They should be dealt with in tenderness, in love, and with respect for their good work. . . .Withhold your condemnation till you and our people have done all that can be done to reach them, not by the learned arguments of ministers, but through women of influence working as Sister Henry worked. Letter 59, 1900, pp. 1-4. (To Elder A. T. Jones, April 18, 1900.)",
