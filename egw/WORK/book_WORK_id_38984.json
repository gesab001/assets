    "word": "Thank the Lord, the subject of beneficence has been made very clear and plain. \"As it is written. He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth forever. Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness.\" The seed sown with full, liberal hand is taken charge of by the Lord. He who ministers seed to the sower, gives his worker that which enables him to co-operate with the Giver of the seed by sowing the seed.",
