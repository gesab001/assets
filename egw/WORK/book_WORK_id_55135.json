    "word": "There is a great work to be done in the proclamation of the gospel. God will call men from the plow and from the vineyard and will send them forth into His service, even as Christ called fishermen from their daily occupation. As the first disciples, in obedience to the call of Christ, left their nets and followed Him, so will men in humble walks of life go forth today with the message for this time. These devoted servants of Christ will not seek the highest seat, but will follow Christ in the path of self-denial and sacrifice, and they will win souls to the Saviour.",
