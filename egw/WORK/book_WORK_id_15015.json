    "word": "Years afterward, Elder Matteson declared that in his efforts in behalf of the colporteur work soon after his return from the Basel conference, he was so fully convinced that his workers must live on a very meager income, that he persuaded each one to keep a strict cash account, and to let him examine this account once a week, and advise economies. Soon the scale was turned, for the colporteurs were spending less and earning more, and a number earned enough to support themselves without drawing anything from the conference treasury. [NOTE.--THE EARNEST ENDEAVORS PUT FORTH TO ESTABLISH THE CANVASSING WORK ON A SUBSTANTIAL BASIS IN SCANDINAVIA, BORE EARLY FRUIT. AT THE 1889 GENERAL CONFERENCE, ELDER O. A. OLSEN WAS ABLE TO REPORT FIFTY CANVASSERS IN SCANDINAVIA, WHO WERE HAVING GOOD SUCCESS. (SEE 1889 BULLETIN, P. 4.) THE BOOK SALES FOR 1889 AMOUNTED TO ABOUT $10,000, AND IN LATER YEARS THESE FIGURES WERE SWELLED TO UPWARDS OF $20,000. DURING THE 1891 GENERAL CONFERENCE, THE GENERAL AGENT FOR SCANDINAVIA DECLARED: \"THE CANVASSERS ARE SUPPORTING THEMSELVES, AND BESIDES THIS, ARE HELPING TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE BY THEIR GIFTS. SEVERAL HUNDRED KRONER HAVE COME INTO THE TREASURY OF THE SWEDISH CONFERENCE THROUGH THE DONATIONS OF OUR CANVASSERS, AND I PRESUME THIS IS ALSO TRUE OF NORWAY AND DENMARK. . . . THE MORE OUR CANVASSERS SELL, THE MORE THEY CAN SELL. . . . MANY HAVE ALREADY ACCEPTED THE TRUTH BY READING OUR PUBLICATIONS.\" (BULLETIN, 1891, P. 84.)] \n                                                                           287",
