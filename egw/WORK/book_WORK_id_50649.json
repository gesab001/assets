    "word": "Those who speak and write concerning the truths of God must have the endowment of the Holy Spirit or they will make great mistakes. Jesus said to His disciples concerning the gift of the Holy Spirit, \"It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you\" [John 16:7]. What is the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart and conscience of the human agent? \"And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment; of sin, because they believe not on Me (that is, in a practical way); of righteousness, because I go to My Father, and ye see Me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged\" [verses 8-11].",
