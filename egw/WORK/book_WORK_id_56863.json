    "word": "A good work has been done in Battle Creek. The Lord has abundantly blessed me, and I desire that every one shall have this blessing; but I have had to fight for every inch of ground that we have gained here at Battle Creek. The brethren were not going to ask Brother A. T. Jones to preach in the tabernacle. I felt deeply stirred with indignation at the persistent efforts to close the door to every ray of heaven's light. I have carried the heaviest load that I have ever borne in Battle Creek, but we have gained a measure of victory. Still there must be a more thorough work done. There must be seen a spirit of conviction that will make it manifest that we have been born again. There must be a spiritual revolution throughout the churches that fruits unto righteousness may be seen in our daily life.",
