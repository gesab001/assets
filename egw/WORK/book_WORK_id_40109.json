    "word": "This is all that I need to say to you now. We have a good place here: the Lord brought it into our hands. Let us regard it as a gift that is to be used to the very best account. If we do this, the Spirit of God will work with us, and we shall receive more and more light as we follow on to know the Lord, Whose going forth is prepared as the morning. You have seen the going forth of the sun in the early morning. Its light grows a little stronger, a little brighter in the heavens, until there is seen the full light of day. So your experience is to grow. Then the visitors and patients who come to this institution will see that the Spirit of God is inditing your words and actions, and an excellent work will be done for God.",
