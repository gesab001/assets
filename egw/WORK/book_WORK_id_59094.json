    "word": "Church members are to be God's instruments in seeking to save those ready to perish. Be they many or few, they are to confer together, laying before one another their designs and plans, and obtaining the benefit of one another's perception and foresight as to the best plan for securing success in the work. There are to be found no separate parties, who shall supply themselves with all the facilities for ensuring success, at the same time leaving those who should have equal encouragement and means with which to carry on the work, with nothing with which to do the work which means the adding of new territory to the Lord's kingdom.",
