    "word": "(932)            Our Duty to Reach Out \n\n     Individually we should stand in freedom before God, serving Him intelligently. The Lord will work through every soul who is consecrated to Him. He will give them knowledge and spiritual understanding; and He will direct their steps. How shall we know that He is leading us? Because we act in accordance with the Holy Spirit and are in harmony with Christ.",
