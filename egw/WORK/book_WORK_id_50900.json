    "word": "MR No. 1088 - Establish Work Solidly in Places Already Entered Before Starting Work in New Places\n\n   (Written June 11, 1902, to R. M. Kilgore, from Petaluma, California.) \n\n\n     I have just read your letter to Willie regarding your work in Graysville, and stating that our brethren have some hesitation about purchasing the 20 acres on Lone Mountain, on which there is a large spring. The opportunity to secure this big spring seems to be a special providence. This spring will be of untold value, and should be secured, even if the investment just now is difficult and delays the building. I advise you to purchase this property. I will stand back of you as may be necessary, and will use my influence to secure the necessary means for the purchase. Do not delay at all in this matter. Close up the trade, even if you have to borrow the money. So many times I have had to breast difficulties, so many times I have had to move forward against remonstrance, that I am prepared to say to you, \"Go forward.\" I know what I am talking about. Have faith in God.",
