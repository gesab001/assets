    "word": "There are souls to be won to Christ. There is a great and solemn work before us to prepare a people to stand in the day of the Lord. We have but little time here, and the best use we can make of our faculties is to consecrate them to the work of God. It is the duty of all, not only of those who occupy the position of watchmen on the walls of Zion, but of the laymen also, to do their utmost to advance the cause of God and save their fellow-men. Opposition must be met. We shall be hated of all men for Christ's sake, and by Satan, because he knows that this work is attended by divine power, which will undermine his influence. But heaven is open before us; we may take hold of divine strength. As children of \n466\nGod it is our privilege and duty to come directly to him, and claim a Father's blessing. He will give it. Iniquity abounds, and for this very reason, God is willing to give more grace, and reveal himself to his people.",
