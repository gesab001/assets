    "word": "The Opening of the Australasian Bible School \n\n\n     During the winter of 1892, Mrs. White watched with eager interest the efforts that were made for the opening of the proposed school. In April, she pleaded with the brethren in responsibility in America to recognize the possibilities of the future, and provide facilities for the training of a large force of workers who could advance into unentered territory. \"O, what a vast number of people have never been warned!\" she wrote. \"Is it right that such a superabundance of opportunities and privileges should be provided for the work in America, while there is such a destitution of the right kind of workers here in this field? Where are God's missionaries?\" \n                                                                           336",
