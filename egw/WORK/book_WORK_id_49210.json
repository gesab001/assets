And of His fulness have all we received, and grace for grace\" (verses 14, 16). The yearning after entire conformity to the will of God, after His holiness and peace, opens the eyes of the understanding to see the doctrines of the Word. Thus God's children are strengthened and established; they are \"steadfast, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord\" (1 Corinthians 15:58). \n\n\n                                  -167-",
