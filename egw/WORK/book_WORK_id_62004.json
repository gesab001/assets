    "word": "In God's dealings, in temporal as well as spiritual things, blessings come to man through the use of means. If the husbandman neglects to till his ground, God works no miracle to make up for his neglect; and when the harvest time comes, he has no crops to gather. As in the natural world, so in the spiritual; God always honors the use of the means he has ordained to do his work. It is by practise that men must be qualified for any emergency that may arise. Men need to become better acquainted with themselves and be discerning in regard to their own weak points of character, and then make every effort to strengthen these points, for God makes this their duty.",
