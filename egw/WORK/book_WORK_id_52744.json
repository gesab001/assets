    "word": "When Christ was about to ascend to heaven, He committed to His disciples the mission that His Father had committed to Him. And He instructed them how to fulfill this mission. He declared that as He had represented His Father to the world, so they were to represent Him. Although He would be invisible to the natural eye, yet all who believed on Him would be able to behold Him by faith. He told His followers to work as He had worked. They were to be a spectacle to worlds unfallen, to angels, and to men, revealing the Father through the Son.",
