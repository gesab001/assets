    "word": "But ministers who bear the last message of mercy to fallen men must utter no random works; they must not open doors whereby Satan shall find access to human minds. It is not our work to experiment, to study out something new and startling that will create excitement. Satan is watching his chance to take advantage of anything of this order that he may bring in his deceiving elements. The Holy Spirit's moving upon the human agents will keep the mind well balanced. There will not be a wrought-up excitement, to be followed by reaction.",
