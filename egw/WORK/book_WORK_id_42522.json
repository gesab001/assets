    "word": "Recently the question was asked me by the Lord: \"Will you do that which many of your ministering brethren would be only too pleased to see you doing? Will you keep silent? Will your voice no longer be heard presenting clearly and distinctly the needs of this long-neglected field? If so, you yourself will share the reproach that rests on the ministers and people who have not done for the Southern field the work the Lord has given them to do, who have passed by on the other side those who are their neighbors, treating them with indifference and cruel neglect.\"",
