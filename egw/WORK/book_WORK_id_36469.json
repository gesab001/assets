In the land of the heathen also were those that looked for Him; they were wise men, rich and noble, the philosophers of the East. Students of nature, the Magi had seen God in His handiwork. From the Hebrew Scriptures they had learned of the Star to arise out of Jacob, and with eager desire they awaited His coming, who should be not only the \u201cConsolation of Israel,\u201d but \u201ca Light to lighten the Gentiles,\u201d and \u201cfor salvation unto the ends of the earth.\u201d Luke 2:25, 32; Acts 13:47.\u2014GC 315.",
