    "word": "You must be at the General Conference. Arrange meetings so this may be. The Lord lead and guide you, is my prayer. Only cling to that hand that is mighty to save and to deliver. Only trust Him and hide in Him, and He will work for you. . . . Ride all you can. Write but little that will tax. Save yourself in every way you can. There is work for all who have a mind to work, and your strength will be needed.  Come closer and nearer to Jesus, and He will give you peace and rest. . . . Be of good courage and do not be faint in spirit or distrust God for one moment.--Letter 4, 1880, p. 2, 3. (To Elder S. N. Haskell, Aug. 26, 1880.)",
