    "word": "May God help us to awake to our duty! If you have hold of the work of God, I beseech you, for Christ's sake, do not let go. If God sees that your souls are in danger, he will send reproof to you. Do not rise up against it. Say, \"I will seek God, I will find him, and will be converted.\" The True Witness says, \"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.\" Yes, repent. It is not for you to be jealous of the reprover. It is not for you to dissect or discount the message that God may send you. It is for you to receive it, and reform, and be thankful that the Lord has not left you to blindness of mind and hardness of heart. May God help you to be converted.",
