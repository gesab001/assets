    "word": "But the standard of the ministry has been greatly lowered, and the minister of the true sanctuary is misrepresented before the world. God is ready to accept men as his co-laborers, and to make them the light of the world, agents through whom he can graciously infuse light into the understanding. If the men who bear the message have not Christ abiding in them, if they are not true,--and some are not,--may the Lord awaken them from their deception before it shall be too late. God wants men to be tender-hearted, compassionate, and to love as brethren. Jesus is waiting for them to open the door, that he may come in and infuse into their hearts the warmth of his love, his goodness, his tender compassion; that the worker may in all his connection with humanity reveal the Saviour to the world.",
