    "word": "The Lord would have all connected with that Office care-takers and burden-bearers. If they are pleasure-seekers, if they do not practice self-denial, they are not fit for a place in the Office. Bro. Amadon has been too willing to take too much upon his hands, when others can take a share, and are better adapted to the work than himself. By taking too many things upon his hands, he becomes confused and makes blunders, which may seriously affect the work in the Office.",
