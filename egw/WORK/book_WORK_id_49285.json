    "word": "The Haskells' Work in Greater New York--We are thankful that in Greater New York doors are opening for the truth to find entrance in many hearts. Elder [S.N.] Haskell and wife are of good courage in the Lord. Certainly they have a grand opening. Before Elder Haskell's special effort was begun, there were some good workers in Greater New York.

This is as it should be. Already a good company has been raised up.",
