    "word": "I have felt glad that you were in the Office at Battle Creek. But you also have a message to bear to the people in the field, and your wife has a work to do in connection with you. She is to be an interested worker, susceptible to the influences of the Holy Spirit. God will help both of you to act a part in His great work if you will discern His teachings. Go forth in humble faith, and the Lord will go with you. But watch unto prayer. The power is of God. Work in all dependence upon Him, bearing in mind that you are laborers together with Him. He is your Helper. Your strength is from Him. He will be your wisdom, your sanctification, your righteousness, your redemption. You can wear the yoke of Christ, daily learning of Him His meekness and lowliness of heart. He will be your comfort, your rest.-- Letter 100, 1902, pp. 1, 2, 4 (July 7, 1902).",
