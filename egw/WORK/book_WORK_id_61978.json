    "word": "God calls upon you to conquer your own spirit, to correct your own mistakes, to confess your sins before God that pardon may be written off against your own names. With earnest prayer seek wisdom of God, and be careful how you judge and pass sentence upon your brother. God has not placed you on the judgment seat. Great and grand truths for this time are to be brought into practical life. Christ says, \"I will sanctify myself, that as head and representative of the human family, the soul may believe on me, and may be sanctified.\" A religion that does not touch the heart, cannot transform the character, and sanctify the life. Religious vigilance can never be laid to rest. We must stand as faithful sentinels over the mind and soul, lest Satan steal away the heavenly gifts. Dare not to cast the first stone at your neighbor, lest Christ shall say to you, as you parade the sins of others, presenting them in an aggravated light, \"Let him that is without sin cast the first stone.\" Would you not then be covered with confusion of face, as you consider the daily record of sins in your practical life, and remember what is written in the books of heaven? It is these things that are bringing the wrath of God on the children of disobedience. The discrepancy of profession and practise is doing a baleful work, and misrepresenting the character of Christ. Oh that all would realize what great harm is done to souls by little acts, and by sinful inconsistencies! Oh that all might see this and be converted!",
