    "word": "There are souls who are willing to make any move for Christ's sake, but they think they are not qualified to do the sacred work of God. They have accepted the truth, and rejoice in it; but they have not come to the point to cry. \"Speak, Lord; for Thy servant heareth.\" They do not seek to make terms with the Lord; if they are convinced that He calls them, they will make any and every sacrifice for the truth's sake. It is just such ones as these who are little in their own eyes, that the Lord chooses to use in the work of saving souls. They are not required to preach doctrinal discourses; but by personal effort they can reach hearts, and win them for Christ and the truth.",
