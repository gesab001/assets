    "word": "\"And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars. I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest, and are dead. Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come unto thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I shall come unto thee.\" How many times the human agent fails and, when the urgency arises, is all unprepared to do service for Christ. Had he watched, he would have proved himself a friend indeed, and an ambassador of Jesus. But the Spirit of Christ is not in him, it is another Spirit.",
