    "word": "I do not suppose I shall ever revisit America. I shall be seventy years old next November. The Lord designed that we should be near the publishing houses, that we should have easy access to these institutions that we might counsel together. Because of the moves that have been made, many publications that should have been issued before this have been retarded. The great amount of writing that has been necessary in order to communicate with America has hindered this work. I never expect to visit Africa. I desire quietude. And yet I am here in Australia with funds low, and straining every nerve and muscle to establish the work here.--Letter 127, 1896, pp. 2-4. (Written Dec. 1, 1896, at Cooranbong, NSW, Australia.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. April 27, 1981",
