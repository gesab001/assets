    "word": "Oh, how my heart aches, that spiritual wickedness should prevail in high places! The working of minds under the inspiration of Satan has come to a high pass. The men have been listening to the suggestions of Satan, and they know not from what source their wisdom came. They know not that that wisdom was from beneath, and would stop at nothing until they saw that all control was in the power of a set of men who were taking the place of God. The principle has been at work either to control or to crush all that cannot be controlled. There has been a spirit of deep, deep heart opposition to the truth of the gospel. Oh, to what obstinacy can the heart of man be brought! I stood nearly three years in Battle Creek. The power of God was revealed. Evidence was piled upon evidence, and on different occasions I hoped for a thorough work to be done.--Manuscript 57, 1895. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. July 9, 1987.
