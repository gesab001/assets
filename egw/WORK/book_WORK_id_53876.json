    "word": "Elder Maxson set up a warfare against the light, determined to oppose; and they have continued to do this. Evidence was sufficient, but the ones who opposed the light gave evidence they were not led of the Lord. This has been a great evil and has hindered the advancement of the work of the Lord in reflecting His light to the world. There were the two parties, and when we returned from doing the work in foreign countries, a state of things existed that had to be righted up; and notwithstanding all the evidence given of the correct work to be done, some men determined to carry things their own way, which made the work exceedingly hard.",
