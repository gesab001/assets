    "word": "Again, confusion is caused by children being allowed to run through the Office. Children belonging to those who are employed in the Office, should not be allowed to visit in the Office when they please. Especially should no plays be entered into, and little children's voices heard through the Office. All these things lower the dignity of the Office, and lessen the sacredness of the work. The church should have especial care not to permit their children to visit the Office, and the children of those who are engaged in the Office should not be allowed to remain in the building, and by their presence encourage other children. The confusion caused by this is all displeasing to God. There should be an entire change in almost every thing in regard to the order of matters at the Office.
