    "word": "Brother Shireman is not to think that he has ability to do the most difficult work, the greatest service. Let him do a small work, and see it grow under his hand. In the past, the Lord has blessed him in doing his God-given work, and He will still bless him, if he continues to work in the same line. Let him keep at the work by which, through faithfulness, he has attained success.",
