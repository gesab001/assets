    "word": "Consideration for an Injured Worker \n\n     When one of your number is injured at his work, as was the case some time ago, deal with him as you would like to be dealt with under similar circumstances. Show Christlike sympathy. This is God's way of dealing. Anything short of this is not true justice or nobility.",
