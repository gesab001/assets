    "word": "Public Confession Not Always Best. But I leave the matter where it is. I could say to you to go to trustworthy persons in the conference (not men, but women), and talk with them; but I am inclined to think that should you do this you would be giving publicity to those things which would cause all to be removed from you; and they would not encourage you or accept you to engage in any branch of the work, when they should understand the matter as it is. I must now leave this matter between you and your God, and please do not trouble me anymore with it. I have no disposition to expose you, but leave you to develop character. I pity you and hope that you will move in discretion, and become altogether that which God would have you.--Letter 95, 1893.",
