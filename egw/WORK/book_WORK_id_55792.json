    "word": "-19- \n\n     Work in love. Walk in unity. Esteem others better than yourselves. Only a little moment longer, only a little moment to spare, and then it is the coming of the millennial year I see. May I behold the King in His beauty, with all His matchless charms. May we follow on in the light until we shall have an abundant entrance into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.--Ms. 5, 1883.",
