    "word": "In all our enterprises and in all our institutions God is to be acknowledged as the great Master Worker. The physicians are to stand as his representatives. The medical fraternity have made many reforms, and they should rise still higher. Those who hold the lives of human beings in their hands should be educated, refined, sanctified. Then will the Lord work through them in mighty power to glorify his name. He will reveal Himself as the Healer of the body and the soul.",
