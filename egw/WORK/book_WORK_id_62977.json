    "word": "Never give up the school work in a place where a church school has been established, unless God plainly directs that this should be done. With God's help, the teacher may do a grand, saving work in changing the order of things. If the teacher works patiently, earnestly, perseveringly, in Christ's lines, the reformatory work done in the school will extend to the homes of the children, creating a purer, more refined, more Christlike atmosphere. This is indeed missionary work of the highest order. Teachers who do this work are doing God service for this life and for the life eternal.",
