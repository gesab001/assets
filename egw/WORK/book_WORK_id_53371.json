    "word": "MR No. 1403 - Calamities and the Great Controversy\n\n     John the Revelator represents the forces of the earth as four winds, which are held in check by angels delegated to do this work. He declares: \"I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads\" [Revelation 7:1-3].",
