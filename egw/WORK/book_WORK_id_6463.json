    "word": "At home and in the school, by precept and example, the children and youth should be taught to be truthful, unselfish, industrious. They should not be allowed to spend their time in idleness; their hands should not be folded in inaction. Parents and teachers should work for the accomplishment of this object--the development of all the powers, and the formation of right character. But when parents realize their responsibilities, there will be far less left for the teachers to do.",
