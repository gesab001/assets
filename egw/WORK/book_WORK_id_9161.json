    "word": "Cosmopolitan Medical Evangelism.--In New York there are many who are ripe for the harvest. In this great city there are thousands who have not bowed the knee to Baal. The angel said, \"Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\" New York contains a part of the \"all people.\" We desire to see the new year open with teachers at work in all parts of New York. There is a work to be done in this city. . . . In our large cities the medical missionary work must go hand in hand with the gospel ministry. It will open doors for the entrance of truth.--Manuscript 117, 1901.",
