    "word": "The Spirit of Authority--In our several callings there is to be mutual dependence on one another for assistance.  A spirit of authority is not to be exercised, even by the president of a Conference; for position does not change a man into a creature that cannot err.  Every laborer entrusted with the management of a conference is to work as Christ worked, wearing His yoke and learning of Him, His meekness and lowliness.",
