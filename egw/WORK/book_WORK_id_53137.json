    "word": "All the gold and the silver is the Lord's. He owns the cattle upon a thousand hills. But we are departing from Him when we bind ourselves in any way \n\n\n                                     -54- \n\nto follow the wisdom of worldly men, in our work, in order to secure gifts from them.

Between God and mammon there can be no union.",
