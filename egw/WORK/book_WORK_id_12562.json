    "word": "In 1516 Zwingle was invited to become a preacher in the convent at Einsiedeln. Here he was to have a closer view of the corruptions of Rome, and was to exert an influence as a reformer that would be felt far beyond his native Alps. Among the chief attractions of Einsiedeln was an image of the virgin which was said to have the power of working miracles. Above the gateway of the convent was the inscription, \u201cHere may be obtained complete remission of sins.\u201d Pilgrims at all seasons resorted to the shrine of the virgin, but at the great yearly festival of its consecration, multitudes came from all parts of Switzerland, and even from France and Germany. Zwingle, greatly afflicted at \n175\nthe sight, seized the opportunity to proclaim liberty through the gospel to these bond-slaves of superstition.",
