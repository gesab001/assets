    "word": "There are many souls to be saved. In words and deed be wise unto salvation, representing Christ to all with whom you come in contact. Let all see that your feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and goodwill to men. Wonderful are the results we shall see if we enter the work imbued with the Spirit of Christ. If we carry the Word forward, in righteousness, mercy, and love, help will come in our necessity. Truth will triumph and bear away the victory.--Pacific Union Recorder, Oct. 23, 1902.",
