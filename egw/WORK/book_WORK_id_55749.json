    "word": "Let us prepare for that life which measures with the life of God. We have not before us the prospect of lying in our graves. Some of us may be translated without tasting of death. Who will not deny themselves in order that they may help to send the truth where it will be received? We have now but a very little time in which we can work, so let us deny ourselves in every way possible that we may give the light of truth to all that can be reached. Every penny that we will invest in this work will be returned to us with large interest.",
