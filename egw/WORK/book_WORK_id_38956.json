    "word": "So it is with God's claims upon us. He places his treasures in the hands of humanity, but requires that one tenth shall be faithfully laid aside for his work. He teaches us the lesson that he requires this portion to be placed in his treasury. It is to be rendered to him as his own; it is sacred, and is to be used for sacred purposes, for the support of those who carry the message of \n\n\n                       - 70 - \n\nsalvation to all parts of the world. He reserves this portion, that means may ever be flowing into his treasure-house, and that the light of truth may be carried to those who are nigh and those who are afar off. By faithfully obeying this requirement, we prove that we realize that all belongs to God.",
