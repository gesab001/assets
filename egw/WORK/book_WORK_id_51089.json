    "word": "(Diary entry for Nov. 24, 1904, San Diego, Calif.) This morning we have still more encouraging, favorable news. What joy is expressed upon every countenance over the promise of a full supply of good, sweet water! There is 14 feet of water in the well, unexpected, all unexpected. Tools are at the bottom of the well. All have worked most earnestly and hopefully, praying in faith that we should not be disappointed. The water is now a certainty. The trees shall have their refreshing portion. Brother Palmer was so pleased. He expressed his gratitude to God for this great blessing, that labor and money invested for machinery for the water plant had brought returns.",
