    "word": "If Bro. W. C., for a few years past, had been walking in the light, he would have felt the value of souls. Had he been cultivating a love for the truth, he might have been qualified to teach the truth to others. He might have helped Bro. B. in his work with the tent. He might, at least, have taken the burdens of the church at home. If he had love for his brethren, and was sanctified through the truth, he could have been a peacemaker, instead of a stirrer-up of strive, which, united with other difficulties, called Bro. A. from his brother's side at a most important time, which resulted in Bro. D.'s laboring far beyond his strength. And yet, after Bro. D. had done all that he could, the work was not accomplished that might have been, had there been the interest there should have been in Bordoville to supply help when it was so much needed. A fearful responsibility rests upon that church for their neglect of duty.",
