    "word": "MR No. 429 - Labor Unions\n\n     I have received and read your letter. I can sympathize with you in your perplexity. I wish that I could see you and talk with you. Do not suppose, from my letter, that I think you have changed in regard to economy. I think no such thing. But I know the danger of those who have not had the experience that you have had, and you will need to guard constantly against the introduction of this and that, which, though seemingly harmless, would lead to the sacrifice of principles that should ever be maintained in our restaurant work.",
