    "word": "15. Let a work of reformation, deep and thorough, take place in the office. Let there be seen a spirit of self-sacrifice. Expend your means carefully. Cultivate economy. Do not act toward Christ as though you believed the wicked accusations of the unfaithful servant: \"I knew thee, that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed.\" As you look to the cross of Calvary, inquire, \"How can I work for the Master?\" Do not calculate how little you can do to reach the very lowest standard, but arouse to grasp the fulness \n                                                                           25\nthat there is in Christ, that you may do much for him.",
