    "word": "Men may be selected by the Conference to connect with the office of publication, but unless these men look to God, and with a transformation of character, unless they realize that eternal vigilance is the price of safety, unless they seek counsel of God in large and small matters, concerning things connected with the sacred work of God, unless they are emptied of vanity and self, they will be turned from the safe path, and will turn others from the path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord. Unless these associated together are converted men, and they . . . realize the sacredness of the work of God for these last times, they will surely imperil the work of God, and discouragement will come upon the people. It is not enough that they assent to the truth. The question is, \"Are they sanctified through the truth? Has the truth been brought into the inner sanctuary of the soul?\" The past, present, and future, were plainly revealed to me.--Ms. 6, 1890, pp. 2-3 (Diary 16, pp. 336-338).",
