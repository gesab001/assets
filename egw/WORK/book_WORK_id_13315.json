    "word": "TO MAKE ALL THINGS NEW.\u2014The work of redemption will be complete. In the place where sin abounded, God\u2019s grace much more abounds. The earth itself, the very field that Satan claims as his, is to be not only ransomed but exalted. Our little world, under the curse of sin the one dark blot in His glorious creation, will be honored above all other worlds in the universe of God. Here, where the Son of God tabernacled in humanity; where the King of glory lived and suffered and died\u2014here, when He shall make all things new, the tabernacle of God shall be with men, \u201cand He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their \n17\nGod.\u201d And through endless ages as the redeemed walk in the light of the Lord, they will praise Him for His unspeakable Gift\u2014Immanuel, \u201cGod with us.\u201dDA 26.",
