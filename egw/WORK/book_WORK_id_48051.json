    "word": "\"In our conversation I spoke to you of the light given me that we were centering too many weighty responsibilities at Battle Creek, and I am of the same opinion now. I have been looking over some of my past writings, and I find that warnings were given to me years ago upon this very point, and we were instructed not to accumulate special interests in Battle Creek. There is danger that it will become as Jerusalem of old, a concentrated, powerful center. The evils that ruined Jerusalem will come upon us if we do not heed these precautions. It is perilous to so largely center in Battle Creek; for while you are expending means in this one center, you are neglecting cities that will become more and more difficult to work as time goes on.\"--Letter 18, 1890.",
