    "word": "\"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" All of Christ's followers bear fruit to his glory. Their lives testify that a good work has been wrought in them by the Spirit of God, and their fruit is unto holiness It is elevated and pure. Those who bear no fruit have no experience in the things of God. They are not in the vine. Read John 15:4, 5. \"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.\"",
