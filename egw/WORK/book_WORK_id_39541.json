    "word": "Those who have turned away from the Battle Creek Sanitarium to get worldly physicians to care for them did not realize what they were doing. God established the Battle Creek Sanitarium. God worked through Dr. Kellogg; but men did not realize this. When they were sick, they sent for worldly physicians to come, because of something the doctor had said that did not please them. This God did not approve. We have the authority of the Bible for our instruction in temperance.",
