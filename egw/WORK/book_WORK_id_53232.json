This work is not a work which every man can do successfully. In the canvassing work there is need of strong, well-educated, experienced men. The Lord desires this work to be done by men who are capable of educating others, who can awaken in promising young men and young women an interest in canvassing, leading them to take up the book work and handle it as it should be handled.",
