    "word": "Let Courage Fail Not.--Never let your courage fail. Never talk unbelief because appearances are against you. As you work for the Master you will feel pressure for want of means, but the Lord will hear and answer your petitions for help. Let your language be: \"The Lord God will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.\" Isaiah 50:7.-- Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 244. (1902)",
