Those newly come to the faith were helping with willing hands, and those who had means were assisting with their means. The very thing was being done that should have been done years ago. I viewed the work advancing. In the basement of the church, above ground, room was provided \n                                                                           47\nfor a school where the children could be educated. Teachers were selected to go to this place. The numbers in the schools were not large, but it was a happy beginning.\"--P.C.",
