    "word": "If the teachers of His Word are willing, the Lord will lead them into close relation with the people. He will guide them into the homes of these who need and desire the truth, bringing them into the situations best suited to their talents. And as the servants of God engage in the work of seeking the lost sheep, their spiritual faculties are awakened and energized. Knowing that they are in harmony with God, they feel joyous and happy. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they obtain an experience that is invaluable to them. Their intellectual and moral powers attain their highest development; for grace is given in answer to the demand.--Letter 95, 1896, pp. 2-5. (To G. B. Starr, August 11, 1896.) Released July 29, 1968.",
