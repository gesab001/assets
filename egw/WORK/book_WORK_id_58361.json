    "word": "As the rich clusters of grapes grow on the living vine, so the fruits of the Spirit will be borne by the man who loves God, and keeps the way of the Lord. Christ is his stronghold. Christ lived the law of God in humanity, and so may he do if he will by faith take hold on the strong for strength. If he realizes that he cannot do anything without Christ by this side, God will give him wisdom. But he must cherish the love of Christ in his heart, and practice his lessons, for is he not to love Christ as Christ loved God? Is he not to demonstrate to all with whom he associates that he has the abiding presence of Jesus Christ more than he has ever had it before. Because of his increased responsibilities, he must have an increased knowledge of God, and must reveal that living faith that works by love, and purifies the soul.",
