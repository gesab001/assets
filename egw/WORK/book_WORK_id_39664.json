    "word": "The Lord can not with impunity allow men to carry on a work that creates variance and unbelief. But these evils will be repeated, unless the one who for years has been bearing the responsible position of physician-in-chief in our medical work, becomes a new man in Christ Jesus. God has given him many, many words of encouragement, as well as words of reproof; but the encouragement has all been given on condition that the man occupying so responsible a position as he has occupied, be changed in mind and judgment, becoming a Bible Christian in purpose and character. So long as he remains unconverted, there can not be brought about a blending of the missionary work of which he has been looked upon as the leader, with the gospel ministry. For years the Lord has instructed me that so long as his associates accept as genuine his representations, the medical missionary work will stand in need of a physician.",
