    "word": "-272- \n\n\n     I have labored more earnestly for the churches than I have this past year, so I have no hesitancy in taking the same salary that I have in the past. In addition to all the labor that I have mentioned, I have also borne testimonies that have been very taxing to me, and have also had much work to do in feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and in paying laborers who are employed in the cause. At the present time I am paying $19 per week in sustaining laborers in Ashfield, Petersham, and Canterbury. In no period of my labors has there been so great a draft upon my financial and spiritual resources as at the present. How long my resources will admit of this constant drain I am unable to say; but I am looking to Him whose resources are unlimited to supply every lack.",
