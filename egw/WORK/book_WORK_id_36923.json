    "word": "Christ will never neglect the work that has been placed in His hands. He will inspire the resolute disciple with a sense of the perversity, the sin-stained condition, the depravity, of the heart upon which He is working. The true penitent has learned the uselessness of self-importance. Looking to Jesus, comparing his own defective character with the Saviour's perfect character, he can say, \n     In my hand no price I bring; \n     Simply to Thy cross I cling.",
