    "word": "Chap. 11 - A Great Opportunity Slighted\n\n\n               St. Helena, Cal., Nov. 18, 1905. \n\n     God designed that the General Conference of 1901 should influence you [the leader of the medical work] to make a decided change in your life-purposes. The testimonies borne before vast numbers of people have as much of a bearing on your life as on any one else connected with the cause and work of God. There were things that you might have righted up on that occasion. These things were presented to me in the light in which heaven viewed them. But you did not change your sentiments. You did not humble your heart, and confess, and become converted. You did not make any radical change in your course of action. I was working hard to bring about an honest change \n                                                                           47\nin regard to the work with which you were connected, and in regard to yourself, fully believing that your future course of action would sustain the impression I was endeavoring to make. I fully believed that if you were an honest man, you would see the need of pursuing an entirely different course of action; that you would accept the light coming to you in the messages that had been given, and work out a thorough change in yourself.",
