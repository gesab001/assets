    "word": "Now when we are just on the borders of the promised land, let none repeat the sin of the unfaithful spies. They acknowledged that the land they went up to see was a good land, but they declared that the inhabitants were strong, the giants were there, and that they themselves were in comparison as grasshoppers in the sight of the people and in their own sight. All the difficulties were magnified into insurmountable obstacles. . . . Thus they leavened the whole congregation with their unbelief. --Manuscript 6, Jan. 5, 1892, \"Work in Christ's Lines.\"",
