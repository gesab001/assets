    "word": "PARENTS TO PRAY FOR GOD\u2019S GUIDANCE.\u2014Parents, humble your hearts before God. Begin a thorough work with your children. Plead with the Lord to forgive your disregard of His Word in neglecting to train your children in the way they should go. Ask for light and guidance, for a tender conscience, and for clear discernment that you may see your mistakes and failures. God will hear such prayers from a humble and contrite heart.\u2014(Child Guidance, 557.)",
