    "word": "No less than seven men should be chosen to carry the large responsibilities of the work of God in the great cities. And these men should humble themselves daily, and seek the Lord most earnestly for sanctified wisdom. They should relate themselves to God as men desirous to be taught. They must be men of prayer, who realize the peril of their own souls. What should be the work of these seven men?--They should investigate the needs of the cities, and put forth earnest, decided efforts to advance the work.",
