    "word": "My husband died in Battle Creek in 1881. For a year I could not endure the thought that I was alone. My husband and I had stood side by side in our ministerial work, and for a year after his death I could not endure the thought that I was left alone, alone, to carry the responsibilities that in the past he and I had carried together. During the year, I did not recover, but came near dying. But I will not dwell upon this.",
