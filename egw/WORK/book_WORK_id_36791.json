    "word": "I have had no claims to make, only that I am instructed that I am the Lord's messenger. . . . Early in my work I was asked several times, Are you a prophet? I have ever responded, \"I am the Lord's messenger.\" I know that many have called me a prophet, but I have made no claim to this title. My Saviour declared me to be His messenger. \"Your work,\" He instructed me, \"is to bear My word. Strange things will arise; and in your youth I set you apart to bear the message to the erring ones, to carry the word before unbelievers, and with pen and voice to reprove from the Word actions that are not right. Exhort from the Word. I will make My Word open to you. . . . My Spirit and My power shall be with you.",
