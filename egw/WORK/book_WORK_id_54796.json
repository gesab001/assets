    "word": "Commercial work should in no case become all-absorbing. The Lord would have the truth go forth as a lamp that is trimmed and burning, because filled with the heavenly oil, in publications to go everywhere, and the business relations conducted by men who are under the great Master-worker. The commercial work should bring the believers in connection with the unbelievers that the truth, by being lived, may be as seed sown and its influence touch the ends of the earth.",
