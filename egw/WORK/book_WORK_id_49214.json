    "word": "Though my heart is pained when I see how little the work given me by God is comprehended, yet I am neither discouraged nor disposed to yield up the work God has given me. I know that God has laid this work upon me. Any course that my brethren may take will not alter my mission or my work. Again and again I have been obliged to stand against those who cry, \"Lo, here is Christ,\" and \"Lo, there is Christ. Lo, this is new truth.\" The crusade against the work of God has been firm and determined, yet those engaged in it have not accomplished their purpose.",
