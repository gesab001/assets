    "word": "\"There is a necessity for individual effort. Give opportunity for all who are in any way troubled, to speak of their difficulties, for they will have them. Arm yourself with humility, pray that angels of God may come close to your side to impress the mind; for it is not you that works the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit must work you. There is a winning, compelling power in the gospel of Jesus Christ; it is the Holy Spirit that makes the truth impressive. The truth as it is in Jesus will subdue the most powerful opponents, bringing them into captivity to Jesus Christ. Christ will take men who possess the strongest spirit of opposition, and if they submit to him, he will connect them with himself in his work. Thus the truth is presented so as to win a decided victory. Keep practical truth ever before the people.\" \n\n\n                          - 15 -",
