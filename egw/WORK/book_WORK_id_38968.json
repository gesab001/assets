    "word": "Those who are united heart and soul in the work of God will put on the wedding garment that Christ has provided. Then they will be prepared to work in Christ's lines. They will not receive the grace of God in vain. With humble, devoted reverence, they will labor on the right hand and on the left, thoughtfully conforming their entire service and all their capabilities to God. With singing and praise and thanksgiving, they rejoice with God and the heavenly angels as they see sin-sick souls uplifted and helped, as they see the deluded and the insane sitting clothed and in their right mind at the feet of Jesus, learning of him.",
