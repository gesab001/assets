    "word": "A Marriage Ceremony in Australia--About 11:00 a.m. Tuesday our large dining room was prepared for the wedding ceremony [of Carrie Gribble and Brother Hickox]. Brother [G.B.] Starr officiated in the service, and it passed off nicely. The request was made by Brother Hickox that Sister White \n\n\n                               -197- \n\nshould offer prayer after the marriage ceremony. The Lord gave me special freedom. My heart was softened and subdued by the Spirit of God. On this occasion there were no light jests or foolish sayings. Everything was solemn and sacred in connection with this marriage. Everything was of an elevating character and deeply impressive. The Lord sanctified this marriage, and those two now unite their interest to work in the mission field, to seek and to save them that are lost. God will bless them in their work if they walk humbly with Him, leaning wholly upon His promises.-Ms. 23, 1894. (New South Wales, April 9, 1894.)",
