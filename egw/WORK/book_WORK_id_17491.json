    "word": "Attain Highest Possible Capacity.--The true object of education should be carefully considered. God has entrusted to each one capacities and powers, that they may be returned to Him enlarged and improved. All His gifts are granted to us to be used to the utmost. He requires every one of us to cultivate our powers and attain the highest possible capacity for usefulness, that we may do noble work for God and bless humanity. Every talent that we possess, whether of mental capacity, money, or influence, is of God, so that we may say with David, \"All \n\n100 \n\nthings come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee\" (1 Chronicles 29:14).--RH, Aug 19, 1884. (FE 82.)",
