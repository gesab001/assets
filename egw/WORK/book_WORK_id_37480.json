    "word": "The Scope of Christ's House-to-House Ministry.-- Our Saviour went from house to house, healing the sick, comforting the mourners, soothing the afflicted, speaking peace to the disconsolate. He took the little children in His arms and blessed them and spoke words of hope and comfort to the weary mothers. With unfailing tenderness and gentleness He met every form of human woe and affliction. Not for Himself, but for others, did He labor. He was the servant of all. It was His meat and drink to bring hope and strength to all \n                                                                           60\nwith whom He came in contact.--Gospel Workers, p. 188.",
