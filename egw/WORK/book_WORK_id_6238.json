    "word": "Diverting Minds from the Truth \n\n     Every movement of this order, which comes in to excite the desire to get riches quickly by speculation, takes the minds of the people away from the most solemn truths that ever were given to mortals. There may be encouraging prospects for a time, but the end of the matter is failure. The Lord endorses no such movements. If this work is sanctioned, many would be attracted by these speculative schemes that could \n                                                                           235\nnot in any other way be led away from the work of presenting the solemn truths that must be given to the people at this time.--Special Testimonies, Series B, No. 17, pp. 15-19.",
