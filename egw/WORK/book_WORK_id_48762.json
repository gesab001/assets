    "word": "Brethren, when perplexities arise in your conference, when emergencies are to be met, do not let these dark clouds drift into the General Conference [THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE 18 YEARS BEFORE UNION CONFERENCES WERE ORGANIZED.] if you can possibly avoid it. The president of the General Conference should not be burdened with the affairs of the State conferences, as has been the case in the past. If you, with your associates in the work, cannot adjust the troubles and difficulties that arise in your conference, how do you think that one man can do this work for all the conferences? Why should you pour \n\n\n                                  -140- \n\nall your perplexities and discouragements into the burdened mind and heart of the president of the General Conference? He cannot understand the situation as well as do you who are on the ground.",
