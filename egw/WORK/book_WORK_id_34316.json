    "word": "25\n     The Captain of the Lord's host cast down the walls of Jericho, and heavenly angels are ever ready to minister to the humble, the meek and lowly ones, to remove obstacles and to save souls. With true courage you can do a mighty work for the Master, a work that, when weighed in the scales of heaven, will be pronounced well and faithfully done. Do not bring hay, wood and stubble to lay upon the foundation stone, but bring the most precious of materials, gold, silver, and precious stones which cannot be consumed. An independent judgment that will show no respect for the judgment of others, must not be cherished in the hearts of any of God's workers; no one should feel that he is a criterion; no one should indulge in self-esteem, for God has told us in His Word that we should esteem others better than ourselves.",
