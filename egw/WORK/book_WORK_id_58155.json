Olsen\n\n                              Norfolk Villa, Prospect St., Granville, \n                                           June 19, 1895. \n\n\n                                                    O-65-95 \n\nDear Bro. Olsen:- \n\n\n     I wish to speak to you in confidence, as a mother would speak with her son. I fear and tremble for you; I know that in your councils you are in danger of acquiescing in the schemes that come from mistaken judgment. If the Lord is in the midst of your councils, beholding your order and love and fear, and your trembling at his word, then you are prepared to do his work unselfishly; but he will not be in partnership with any unjust transaction.",
