    "word": "There is a great work to do, and the Spirit of the living God must enter into the living messenger, that the truth may go with power. The people of God must be aroused from their moral deadness; they must be quickened with power from above. The Lord has promised: \"I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look upon Him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him as one mourneth for his only son.\"",
