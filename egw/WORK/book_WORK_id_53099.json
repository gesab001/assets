    "word": "You are very unhappy yourself and make others unhappy. I fear--yes, have reason to fear--that your course will ruin the influence of your husband and get him down from the work. He should never answer you impatiently but should sincerely pity you, for when one has contracted a habit of fretting it is hard to overcome it. Nevertheless, it must be overcome. And, again, God frowns upon him when he lets your envious feelings against the brethren weigh on his mind and he becomes embittered toward his brethren. Be careful of the influence you exert, for you must meet it again.",
