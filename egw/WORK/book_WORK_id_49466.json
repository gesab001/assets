    "word": "Men Able to Deal With the Sunday Movement (To W. W. Prescott and W. A. Colcord)--I am glad that the Lord has at Washington able men, who can treat this Sunday movement as it should be treated. Let every minister, every evangelist, now put on the whole armor of God, and work and watch and pray. Our church members also should humble their hearts before God, and cry aloud and spare not. Oh, that the Lord would imbue the members of His church with a sense of the importance of the responsibility of being laborers together with Him.--Letter 21, 1905, p. 8 (Jan. 16, 1905).",
