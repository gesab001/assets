    "word": "We found that our tickets could not be changed; therefore W.C.W. joined us on our journey to New York City. I have spoken twice to the mission workers. We have visited Brooklyn, Brother King and his wife, and Sister Tay, who is a member of their family. We had a prayer season with them. We also visited Brother Jayne's family, and had a visit with them, and a season of prayer. It was a very wearisome ride to Brother King's. The continual changing of cars, and having to walk much, wearied me; but that is in the past--not to be undertaken again. Brother King's family live in the third story, and the going up and down the steep stairs was not agreeable. Of the little family, they were all at home but Brother King. They were glad to see us, and we were much pleased to see them.",
