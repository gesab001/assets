    "word": "The religion of Christ is summed up in the words, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart; . . . thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" But through love of the world, through unsanctified ambition, through self-love, and desire for supremacy, many are being conformed to the world, although the command from the gospel of Christ is, \"Be not conformed to this world [and the preventive is given]: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\" You must have a changed mind, a renewed mind. The power of the Holy Spirit must be felt working upon the heart and character, producing a new man in Christ Jesus. You are to prove to God by unselfishly handling His intrusted goods that you can be trusted with His blessings. You are to trade with His talents, to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness--not to seek first your own selfish interests, but to lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.",
