    "word": "When men and women are sent to our schools to learn how to work for the Master, do not teach them that they must have a five years' drill in Latin and Greek. Many who take this course come from the school deficient in a knowledge of the Bible. They know scarcely anything of the reasons of our faith. Teach the students solidly. Teach them how to learn and how to keep learning. Let them become as efficient as possible, that they in their own turn may be educators.  Ministers and those who have been fitting themselves for missionary work should not spend years in medical missionary classes. Little boys and girls need thorough discipline in study, but there are those who need only a short time at school.",
