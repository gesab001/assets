    "word": "A Sword of Fire Over Battle Creek.--Before the fire came which sweep away the Review and Herald factory I was in distress for many days. . . . I saw the representation of danger--a sword of fire turning this way and that way. I was in an agony of distress. The next news was that the Review and Herald building had been burned by fire, but that not one life had been lost. In this the Lord spoke mercy with judgment. The mercy of God was mingled with judgment to spare the lives of the workers, that they might do the work which they had neglected to do, and which it seemed impossible to make them see and understand.-- GCB, April 6, 1903, p. 85.",
