    "word": "We have the Word of God, and this alone can we trust unwaveringly. Let brethren seek God together. Let them fall upon the Rock and be broken. \"We are laborers together with God.\" We must understand the obligations imposed upon us by this cooperation, or we shall never stand approved in the judgment. \"Laborers together with God\" means fellow laborers with those of our own fallen race, but cooperating with divine agencies. It is the work of salvation to accomplish this union of the human with the divine.",
