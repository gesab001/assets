Our drive was too tedious and we took cold, which makes us feel as though we could scarcely move. We had a very pleasant day. We should have enjoyed the scenery had we been less weary. Our camp is in a grove of heavy pines. There is a small open space of ground, with grass for horses. On the south rises a high mountain \n\n\n                                     -209- \n\nof rocks.
