    "word": "Selfishness introduced in any degree into ministerial or medical work is an infraction of the law of God. When men glory in their capabilities, and cause the praise of men to flow to finite beings, they dishonor God, and he will remove that in which they glory. The physician connected with our Sanitariums and medical missionary work have by God's providence been bound to this people, whom he has commanded to be a light to the world. Their work is to give all that the Lord has given them -- to give, not as one influence among many, but as the influence through God to make effective the truth for this time.",
