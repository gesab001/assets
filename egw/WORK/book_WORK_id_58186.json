A. Olsen, \n\nBattle Creek, Michigan, U.S.A. \n\nDear Brother:- \n\n\n     With this letter I send you other important mss. You will see that I have written largely, but as the dates show, not all has been written recently. For three mails some of these writings have been ready, but were not sent. Sr. Bolton has not been able to do this work. Again and again I thought that I would send the mss without copying, and had had them enveloped, but I was dissuaded from doing this. Well, I thought, next mail they will be ready, but there was no more prospect of having them prepared. This mail I am separated from Fannie; she is at Cooranbong, and I here; but Marian is giving the matter such preparation as is possible under the circumstances, and reading it for the typewriter.",
