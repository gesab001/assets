    "word": "Immediately After Christ's Resurrection\n     For a little while Satan seemed sad and showed distress. He held a council with his angels to consider what they should engage in next to work against the government of God. Said Satan, You must hasten to the chief priests and elders. We succeeded in deceiving them and blinding their eyes, and hardening their hearts against Jesus. We made them believe He was an impostor. That Roman guard will carry the hateful news that Christ is risen. We led the priests and elders on to hate Jesus, and to murder Him. Now hold it before them in a bright light, that as they were His murderers, if it becomes known that Jesus is risen, they will be stoned to death by the people, in that they killed an innocent man.\u20141SG 67, 68.",
