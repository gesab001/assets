    "word": "Dr. Kellogg, there is a different, a more exalted experience to be obtained by every worker in every phase of God's work. This experience all will gain if they read the Word of God, and appropriate that Word as the living bread which came down from heaven. But not one in a hundred knows the value of eating the bread of life. The directions given by Jesus Christ, the invisible Leader of Israel, in the Old Testament Scriptures, are full of marrow and fatness. No soul will repine in spiritual hunger if they take these words and eat them. The words spoken in the sixth chapter of John have special reference to the spirituality of the Word.",
