    "word": "In the past the work in the South has been carried on by earnest effort and with limited means. Now more money than is necessary is being invested in building the sanitarium at Nashville. This will not leave a correct influence on the workers in other parts of the field. At this time, when there is so great need of help in many lines of the work, any extravagance in fitting up the Nashville Sanitarium will leave an impression on the workers and on others that will not be healthful. There is great need of means to support the workers in the field, and the strictest economy should\n42\nbe practiced with every advance step that is taken. The tendency to invest large sums of money in the Nashville Sanitarium must be guarded against. There must not be a large showing in one place while very little interest is manifested in other places of great importance.",
