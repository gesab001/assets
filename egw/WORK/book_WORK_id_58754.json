    "word": "Let us make no mistakes. The word declared, \"Many shall come in my name saying, I am Christ.\" There shall arise false prophets and false Christs and shall show great signs and wonders: insomuch that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\" Shall we receive these into our confidence, No no. We are to receive only those who give the surest evidence that they are doing the work appointed them by God.",
