    "word": "\"You should endeavor to train the very best class of workers, who as teachers and ministers of the gospel will be able to educate others. All who are now connected with the work of education must not follow the same, same old methods. Our schools should be more after the order of the schools of the prophets. Be of good courage in the Lord. Do not talk unbelief. Brethren, look not on the dark side. The Lord has a work for you to do. You need more faith, more hope. Commit the soul to God, as unto a faithful creator.\"",
