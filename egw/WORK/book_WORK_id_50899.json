    "word": "The plan upon which our brethren propose to work is to select some of the best and most substantial young men and women from Berrien Springs and \n\n\n                                     -44- \n\nother places in the North, who believe that God has called them to the work in the South, and give them a brief training as teachers. Thorough instruction will be given in Bible study, physiology, the history of our message; and special instruction will be given regarding the cultivation of the land. It is hoped that many of these students will eventually connect with schools in various places in the South. In connection with these schools there will be land that will be cultivated by teachers and students, and the proceeds from this work will be used for the support of the schools.--Letter 215, 1904. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.
