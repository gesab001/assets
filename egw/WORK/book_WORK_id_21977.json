    "word": "Never have I felt more deeply than now the necessity of keeping the way of the Lord, and of doing His will at all times. Now is the time to do thorough work for eternity. We must be humble and trustful. We must make use of every talent that God gives us. We have been blessed with great and precious light from the Word of God, and we should study how to make the best use of this light. Individually we are on test and trial. God is watching to see how we will use His great blessings.",
