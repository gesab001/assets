    "word": "Give other men a chance to get hold with you. Let each be a help to the other. Hold up one another's hands. You cannot expect that all will work in exactly the same way in which you work. It is the Lord's plan that there shall be unity in diversity. There is no man who can be a criterion for all other men. Our varied trusts are proportioned to our varied capabilities. I have been distinctly instructed that God endows men with different degrees of \n\n\n                                   -107- \n\ncapability, and then places them where they can do the work for which they are fitted. Each worker is to give his fellow workers the respect that he wishes to have shown to himself.",
