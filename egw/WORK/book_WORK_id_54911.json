    "word": "There are men of nobility and influence whom the Lord will call into His work and use as His witnesses, if unconsecrated men will not spoil them by flattery and exalt them as gods. There are men awaiting the call to action who will stand for God in true integrity. They will have a hard battle to fight, for they will sometimes stand in sharp contrast with men who have sacrificed His cause and misinterpreted and falsified His Word. God's true witnesses will have fearful odds against them; they will have to meet falsehood after falsehood; but if they heed the message for this time, God will give them strength to conquer. He will enable them to testify, by purity and nobility of character, to the power of unadulterated principles. They honor the Lord God of heaven, and the sunshine of His favor will be distinctly seen amidst the clouds of unfaithful stewardship and the clash of falsehood.",
