    "word": "The child in its simplicity manifests a humility that should be manifest among the children of God. How can we but feel humble when we consider how Jesus Christ, the Majesty of heaven, took it upon Himself, even at the cost of His own life, to rescue a fallen race? In doing this He took upon Himself the nature of weak, sinful humanity, and came to this world to battle with the powers of darkness. In His work of overcoming sin, He opened the way, so that everyone who will receive Him as his Saviour may also be an overcomer.",
