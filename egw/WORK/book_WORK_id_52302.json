    "word": "MR No. 1266 - Church Leaders to be Humble and Spirit-Filled; Board Members Not to Serve Indefinitely\n\n     (Written October 21, 1894, from Ashfield, NSW, \"To the Brethren Who Shall Assemble in General Conference\" [Feb. 15 to March 4, 1895].) \n\n\n     I have a burden upon my mind which I cannot lay off. The home field needs wise men in its councils. \"Without Me,\" said Christ, \"ye can do nothing.\" We can well spare the work of men who are without the imparted wisdom of God, and the sooner this is done the better it will be for the president of the General Conference and for the other members of the Conference, who must carry the work in straight lines, making clean, thorough records and straight laws for the methods and plans of the other conferences. The General Conference needs to consider well whom it places upon its boards as counsellors and planners, for the voice and influence of those whom they select will have much to do in the shaping of the work.",
