    "word": "MR No. 934 - Counsel to G. H. Bell\n\n     Professor Bell has been cautioned again and again in regard to making the Sabbath School work like a machine, but he has not heeded the testimony. He is getting matters so fine, he will have a big reaction by and by. I know whereof I speak. You, working, burden-bearing men, must become [as] level and evenly-balanced as possible. You need to cling more firmly to simplicity.--Letter 1, 1881, p. 4. (To S. N. Haskell, April 22, 1881.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. May 20, 1982",
