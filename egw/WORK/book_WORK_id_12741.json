    "word": "The Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctification is progressive. When in conversion the sinner finds peace with God through the blood of the atonement, the Christian life has but just begun. Now he is to \u201cgo on unto perfection;\u201d to grow up \u201cunto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\u201d Says the apostle Paul: \u201cThis one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\u201d [Philippians 3:13, 14.] And Peter sets before us the steps by which Bible sanctification is to be attained: \u201cGiving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. . . . If ye do these things, ye shall never fall.\u201d [2 Peter 1:5-10.]",
