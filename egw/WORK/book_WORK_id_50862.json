Kellogg, in July, 1886, from Basle, Switzerland.) \n\n\n     Oh, how my soul desires to see those who are connected with our publishing houses, our colleges, and health institutions making improvement through the wise use of every power the Lord has given them. Every faculty belongs to God, and is to be used to His glory. The worthier the Master, the more efficient service should we render as servants.",
