    "word": "God desires that every man shall stand in his lot and in his place, and not feel as if the work was too hard. Why, he is ready to give you strength. He has granted me strength all along the way as we have journeyed eastward. He gave me strength to speak to the people as we visited place after place. At College View, Neb., I spoke on the Sabbath to two thousand people. The glory of the Lord rested upon us.",
