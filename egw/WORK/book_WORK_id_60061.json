    "word": "(515) I have felt very much burdened over the responsibilities connected with the opening of the Loma Linda Sanitarium, because there were so many things to be done at once. And I could not see how I could help the situation. I have felt burdened very much; and I kept all the time planning how we could reach out, and get hold of something that would relieve some of their indebtedness. In the night, the thought came to me, \"Well, what are you worried about? The Lord has made known your duty, and you have done it, by offering the sanitarium the privilege of selling \"Ministry of Healing,\" and applying the proceeds to the reduction of their indebtedness. You have paid your workers; you have paid your typewriters, and then you have given away all that would otherwise have come to you from the book.\"",
