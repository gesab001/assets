    "word": "Genius to Plan and Work.--Genius is wanted, ability to devise and plan and work harmoniously. We want those who will labor, not merely to benefit themselves, receiving all they can get for their work, but who will labor with an eye single to the glory of God, for the rapid carrying forward of the work in various lines. This is a precious opportunity to reveal their devotion to the Lord's work, and their capability for it. To every man is given his work, not for the purpose of glorifying himself, but for the glory of God. --Manuscript 25, 1895.",
