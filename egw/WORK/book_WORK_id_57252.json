    "word": "I tell you in the name of the Lord God of Israel both you and they will fall into the ditch. You know not what work is coming forth from your hands, but it will appear to you one day as it really is. You have evidence of the work God has given me which these men have not. I cannot harmonize with you or with the spirit Elder Butler has manifested. I tell you it is not of God, it is another spirit. And again, I beseech of you to fall on the Rock and be broken, if God has ever spoken by you. You are in the greatest danger and others who believe they must see as you see, believe as you believe, are imperiling their souls. They have light but will not see it. They have evidence, but will not acknowledge it.",
