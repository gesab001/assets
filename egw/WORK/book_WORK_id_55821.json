    "word": "We are to stand in this world as though there were all around us the purchase of the blood of Christ, and as though it depends very much upon our words, deportment, and manner of labor, whether these souls shall be saved or not. There are many who engage in the work who need a different mold of character in order to make a success in any department of the work. Now, it depends very much on the way we take hold to labor whether we shall have souls as the result of our efforts.",
