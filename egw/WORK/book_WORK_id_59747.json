    "word": "The sacred commission given us is to work for all nations. To turn sinners from iniquity is to be the great object of the followers of Christ. In various ways this work is to be done. In our campmeetings, a much more decided effort is to be put forth to accomplish this work. Short discourses right to the point are to be given, and those who hear are to be called to make a decision. The laborers are to be fervent in spirit. During the meeting our periodicals are to be distributed and sold.",
