    "word": "God is angry with those who pursue a course to make the world hate them. If a Christian is hated because of his good works, and for following Christ, he will have a reward; but if he is hated because he does not take a course to be loved, hated because of his uncultivated manners and because he makes the truth a matter of quarrel with his neighbors, and takes a course to make the Sabbath as annoying as possible to them, he is a stumbling block to sinners, a reproach to the sacred truth, and unless he repents it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.--1T 417-420. \n\n\n                                Bibliography \n\nGC 388-390, 536-537                   Babylon full of wine of false doctrine \nTM 20, 23, 32-62                       S.D.A Church not Babylon \nGC 388, 605-606; EW 273-274           Sins of Babylon \n3T 450-451; 5T 107-108; GW 444         Authority of church ordained of God \nAA 587-588; TM 49; 6T 42; 7T 16         Church defective, yet loved by the Lord \nAA 162-164 (GW 443)                  God acknowledges His organized church \nPK 590; COL 298; 9T 228               God's love for the church \nEW 270; 1T 181-183, 186-188; 3T         Laodicean message to cause a shaking, \n  259-260                                 followed by loud cry \nLS 437-439                            God with His ministering servants",
