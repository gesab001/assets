    "word": "From the first you have exercised too much control in all the business matters, and you have not the capabilities to be a wise manager. Our responsible brethren have allowed you to do very much as you pleased. The Lord has given them light in regard to many things. They did not regard the light. Why? Because you were so determined to carry things as you pleased that they let you have your own way. I could have repeated over and over the light given in regard to this matter, but it would do you no good. Your strong, determined spirit would lead you to disconnect from the Retreat, as you did once before, irrespective of the injury done to the institution. The directors had a forlorn hope that you might understand that you were not qualified to assume the duties of the board of directors, the superintendent, and the physician, but they made a mistake. The Lord's work is not to be left to haphazard ventures. Too much is involved in this matter. I am instructed that such movements must in no case be made. We are not to gratify any man's ambitious presumption by giving responsibilities into his hands, when we have reason to know that he will not manage them wisely.",
