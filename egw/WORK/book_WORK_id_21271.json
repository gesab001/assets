    "word": "Again and again we have seen the results of working directly against the plan of God. We have seen how great a mistake it is for men to use their influence to turn aside the counsel of God in order to bring in human devising. Men have been held in Battle Creek who ought long ago to have been out in the fields that are destitute of workers. Shall I not judge for this thing? saith the Lord. Human wisdom has urged the advantage of remaining in Battle Creek, when the Lord had said, Go; make plants in various places near to but outside the large cities.--MS 76, 1905.",
