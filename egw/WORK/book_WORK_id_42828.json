    "word": "The change of heart represented by the new birth, can be brought about only by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit. If it molds and fashions your heart daily, you will have divine insight to perceive the character of the kingdom of God. But pride and self-love have resisted the Spirit of God. Every natural inclination of the soul opposes the change from self-importance and pride to the meekness and lowliness of Christ. It is only through receiving divine light, only through the co-operation of heavenly intelligences that we can discern the spiritual character of the kingdom of God. Only thus can we have a lively sense of the duties due to all with whom we are brought in contact.",
