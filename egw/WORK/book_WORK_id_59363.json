    "word": "\"For years the work in southern California has needed help, and we now call upon our brethren and sisters who have means to spare to put it into circulation, that we may secure the places so well suited for our work. God has not been pleased with the way in which this field has been neglected. From many places in southern California the light is to shine forth to the multitude. Present truth is to be as a city set on a hill which cannot be hid.",
