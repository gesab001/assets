    "word": "A Work Which All Must Do. \n\n     Have faith in God. He gave me the idea of giving Christ's Object Lessons for the relief of the schools. He is testing His people and institutions in this thing, to see if they will work together and be of one mind in self-denial and self-sacrifice. Carry forward this work without flinching, in the name of the Lord. Let God's plan be vindicated. Let His proposition be fully carried out and heartily indorsed as the means of uniting the members of the churches in self-sacrificing effort. Thus they will be sanctified, soul, body, and spirit, as vessels unto honor, to whom God can impart His Holy Spirit. By this means they will accomplish the work God designs to have done.",
