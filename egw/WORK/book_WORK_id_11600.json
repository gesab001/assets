    "word": "The Danger of Formalism\n     There is a great work to be done in the day of God's preparation, in devising and executing plans for the advancement of his cause.

But I have been shown that there is danger of having this work too mechanical, so intricate and complicated that less will be accomplished than if it were more simple, direct, plain, and decided. We have neither time nor means to keep all parts of this machinery in harmonious action.",
