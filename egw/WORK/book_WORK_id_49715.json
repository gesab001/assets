    "word": "MR No. 890 - Counsels to A. T. Jones\n\n     Dear Brother: I did not feel free to bring into the testimony I read while I was in Oakland all that had been shown me concerning your work. But I must tell you plainly that your views in regard to church discipline are not in harmony with the Word of God. You are wide of the mark. God calls upon you, my brother, to weigh your words carefully before you speak them to the congregation.",
