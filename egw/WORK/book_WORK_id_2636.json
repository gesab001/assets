    "word": "Criticism Invites Criticism--The work of judging his brother has not been placed upon any man.  \"Judge not,\" the Saviour says, \"that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged:  and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\"  He who takes upon himself the work of judging and criticizing others, lays himself open to the same degree of judgment and criticism.  Those who are ready to condemn their brethren, would do well to examine their own works and character.  Such an examination, honestly made, will reveal the fact that they, too, have defects of character, and have made grave blunders in their work.  If the great Judge should deal with men as they deal with their fellow workers, they would regard him as unkind and unmerciful.",
