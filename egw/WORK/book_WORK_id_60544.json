We are intensely desirous that all connected with our Sanitariums shall give evidence that they are men and women who believe in Christ as the world's Redeemer. They are to show that they are laborers together with the Saviour, seeking to save the souls of those who are not truly converted, and working to save their own souls by striving to exert a correct example. Do not gather to your working forces men who, if they are tempted, give way to their feelings; men who will not understand that if they are influenced by wrong principles, they will be sure to sow seeds of distrust in other minds.",
