    "word": "The L_____s are good-spirited boys, but have great deficiencies-- no order, neglect the simplest duties in care-taking, leave things undone right before their faces. It is a time now for them to obtain a fitness for the work or give it up and take up that part of their education which has received no attention, until they develop a well-balanced character. Until this is done they will never be fit to go alone and do anything. We all need more of the Spirit of God, more earnest faith, more constant, earnest prayer that we may discern the grievous imperfections of our best works and our entire inability of ourselves to meet the divine standard.",
