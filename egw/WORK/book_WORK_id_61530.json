    "word": "I am trying to do all I possibly can to urge the work forward in new places. The Lord has signified that in different places there are buildings which would be offered to us at a very low price, which we could use in our work. His word to us regarding this has been verified in our experience in opening up medical missionary work in Southern California. Recently the Lord has placed a great blessing within our reach by enabling us to obtain a beautiful sanitarium property known as Loma Linda. This property is sixty miles from Los Angeles, and it is a wonderful place in which to work for the sick, and in which to begin work for Redlands and Riverside.",
