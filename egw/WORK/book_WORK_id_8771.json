    "word": "A Working Force Augmented by Laymen.--How can our brethren and sisters continue to live close to large numbers of people who have never been warned, without devising methods of setting to work every agency through whom the Lord can work to the glory of His name? Our leaders who have had long experience will understand the importance of these matters, and can do much to increase the working forces. They can plan to reach many in the highways and in the hedges. As they put forth calm, steady, devoted effort to educate the church members to engage in personal work for souls wherever there are favorable openings, success will mark their labors.--Manuscript 53, 1910.",
