    "word": "I have been really worried over this matter of Iowa--whether I ought not to go there, and Elder Jones go, and leave some other places. I should have to give up Pennsylvania. Had I thought you would not have attended this meeting at all, I should have made calculations accordingly. Now I do not know what to do. I verily believe it was the work of the enemy that you have not been here all through this meeting. You might have waited here for news from Emma if she was worse, and then matters might have shaped themselves so that you would have had the benefits of this meeting, which I knew you needed. I am sorry, so sorry; but I must close.--Letter 14a, 1889, pp. 1, 2. (To J. Edson White, cir. April 7, 1889.)",
