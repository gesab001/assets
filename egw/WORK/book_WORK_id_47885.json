    "word": "The Lord Jesus declared before the worshipers in the synagogue, \"This is the bread that cometh down from heaven.\" It was necessary that He should speak the truth in regard to His work, that He might test those who claimed to be His disciples. They needed to be proved, and this before He should leave them, lest their apostasy should come as a surprise to the true disciples, and the trial be too severe for them. Christ saw that this test \n\n\n                                    -186- \n\nwas essential for the safety of His future work, that it should not be swayed into wrong paths.--Letter 146, 1900, p. 6. (To Brother and Sister Farnsworth, October 6, 1900.)",
