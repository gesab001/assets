    "word": "Counsel to Parents\n\n     The fathers and mothers who have accepted the truth are to strive to train their\n129\nchildren in the way of the Lord. No harshness, no arbitrary methods are to appear in the management of their children. They are to be guided and controlled by the law of kindness. Their homes are to be filled with the tenderness and love of Christ. Their children are to see plainly that the converting power of God is working on their hearts. When colored men and women reveal the spirit of the slave master in their treatment of their children, they make excuse for the white men who reveal this spirit toward them.",
