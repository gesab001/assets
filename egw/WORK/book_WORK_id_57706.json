    "word": "But what can you expect of men who have no depth of religious experience? I want these men to do as God would have, for their souls sake to others, leaving me entirely out of the question. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. If men are not self-denying, self-sacrificing, if their hearts are not touched with human sympathy or divine sympathy, what can you expect of them. I want these men to have the mind of Christ to act with all that tenderness and consideration for me in my widowhood that should have been given me. They have treated me as a stranger. True they have allowed me to be in debt to their publishing house, and have not pressed me for the means, but have we not invested means above thirty thousand dollars in this \n                                                                           989\ncause? It is God's cause, it is God's work, and not theirs. They do not know how to handle God's work. They do not know how much it has cost my husband, and myself to stand at our post of duty when things went hard. We have suffered anger, we have suffered for suitable clothing, but we would not allow the work to stop. Now men are placed in responsible positions who knew not Joseph. Straight testimonies have been borne to head off their ambitious projects again and again, it has hurt their pride. They have but little faith in me or the messages the Lord has given me. It would not take a very strong movement to have a state of things created as in the days of old, and Korah, Dathan, and Abiram would come to the point.",
