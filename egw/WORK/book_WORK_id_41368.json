    "word": "\"This land by the appointment of God, is for the benefit of the school. You have had evidences of the working of human nature and what it will reveal under temptation. The more families you settled around the school building, the more difficulties you found in the way of the teachers and students. The natural selfishness of the children of men is ready to spring into life if everything is not convenient for them. This land about the school is to be the school farm, and this farm is to occupy much more space than we have thought it would. Work in connection with study is to be given here, according to the counsels given. . . . Then let everything not essential to the work of the schools be kept at a distance, and thus prevent any disturbance or annoyance through the proximity of families and buildings. Let the school stand alone. There must not be this one and that one claiming personal property near it. It would be better for private families, however devoted they may be in \n                                                                           46\nthe service of the Lord, to be located at some distance from the school buildings.",
