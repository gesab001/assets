    "word": "The educational advantages of our school are to be of a distinct order. This school farm is God's lesson book. Those who till the soil and plant and cultivate the orchard are to make the application of nature's lessons, and bring these lessons learned into their actual spiritual experience. Let every individual bear in mind that \"whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" The man who day by day sows objectionable seeds, in words, in deportment, in spirit, is conforming himself to the same character, and this is determining the future harvest he will reap. Then let ministers and their wives, let the teachers of the youth in any line, close the door to jealousy and evil surmising of those whom God uses to do His work.",
