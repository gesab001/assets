    "word": "Our sisters can serve as vigilant workers in writing, and drawing out the true feelings of friends who have received our papers and tracts. . . . Women of firm principle and decided character are needed, women who believe that we are indeed living in the last days, and that we have the last solemn message of warning to be given to the world. . . . These are the ones whom God can use in the tract and missionary work. . . . These can in many ways do a precious work for God in scattering tracts and judiciously distributing the Signs of the Times.--Review and Herald, Dec. 19, 1878.",
