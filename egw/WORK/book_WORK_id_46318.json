    "word": "To young ladies I would say, tight-lacing is a sin, and will bring its sure results. The lungs, the liver, the heart, need all the room the Lord has provided for them. Your Creator understood how much room the heart and liver require in order to act their vital parts in the human organism. Let not Satan tempt you to crowd the delicate organs, so that they shall be trammeled in their work. Do not, because the fashions of this unregenerate world are taken up as desirable, so crowd the life forces that they have no freedom. Satan suggested all such fashions that the human family might suffer the sure results of abusing God's handiwork.--Letter 103, 1897, p. 5. (To Prof. E. A. Sutherland, July 23, 1897.)",
