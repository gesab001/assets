    "word": "Parents, remember that you are molding the characters of your children for eternity. Patiently train them to habits of neatness, usefulness, and purity. By your example show them the charm of becoming behavior. Do not become weary in your labor of love. The angel of mercy pauses not in his efforts till the last sinner has heard the message of grace. Tenderly and untiringly work for your little ones. Think of how young they are, how much they have to learn. Deal gently and lovingly with them. Consider how slow you have been to learn your lessons. Be calm, patient, and tender. By the cords of unselfish love bind them to you and to Christ.",
