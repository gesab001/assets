    "word": "You may weep, my brother, but ever behold through your tears the sunshine and the rainbow of promise. I caution you to heed the words of \n\n\n                                    -14- \n\nChrist to His disciples--\"Come ye apart, and rest awhile.\" You cannot always be in the din of battle and preserve your strength; you may have periods of rest. In the name of Jesus, I beseech you to rest. You will lose nothing; for you will come forth from your rest invigorated with more clearness of thought, more strength of intellect, and better prepared to do the important work committed to your charge.--Letter 23, 1892, pp. 1-5. (To Elder O. A. Olsen, September 20, 1892.) \n\nReleased May 11, 1971.",
