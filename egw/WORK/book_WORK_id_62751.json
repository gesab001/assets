    "word": "The secret of success is not in learning, not in our position, not in our numbers, nor the greatness of our talents; it is not in the will of man. The Lord God of Israel is our strength. The willing and obedient will gain victory after victory. The Lord's workers must feel their inefficiency, must contemplate Christ, and conquer through Him who is the thought of all thought, the strength of all strength. Grasp the hand of Christ, and say, I will not let thee go except thou bless me. He will respond, keep near to me; I will hold your hand. My grasp \n\n\n                                -90- \n\nshall never relax. Possess your souls in patience, in meekness, in humbleness of mind, and yet, \"Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\"",
