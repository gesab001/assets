    "word": "There are many workers in the cause who are not properly equipped for this great work, and when they are given some measure of success, they are in danger of becoming elated and self-sufficient. They work in their own strength, and do not discern their danger, and therefore do not avoid the perils that are in their pathway. Erroneous ideas will be brought into the work, and presented as a part of the truth to the people, but everything that God has not connected with the truth will only serve to weaken the message and lessen the force of its claims. . . .",
