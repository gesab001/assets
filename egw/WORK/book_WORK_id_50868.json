    "word": "Spasmodic, disunited efforts of professed Christians are like a span of horses, both strong and active, but yet they do not pull together. One tries to start the load; the other settles back in the harness and both do not pull at the same time. God would have His workers pull together, not one pulling in one direction and another in [an] opposite direction, for all such efforts are worse than wasted.",
