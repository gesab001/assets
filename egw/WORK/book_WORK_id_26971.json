    "word": "I was shown that God was not dependent upon any man for the advancement of his cause. He is raising up and qualifying men to bear the message to souls. He can make his strength perfect in the weakness of men. The power is of God. Ready speech, eloquence, and great talents, will not convert a single soul. The efforts in the pulpit may stir up minds, the plain \n                                                                           126\narguments may be convincing, but God giveth the increase. The power is of God, and godly men, faithful, holy men, who carry out that which they preach in their every day life, will exert a saving influence. A powerful discourse may be delivered from the desk, which may affect minds; but a little imprudence upon the part of the minister out of the pulpit, a lack of gravity of speech, and true godliness, will counteract his influence every time, and do away the good impressions made by him. The converts will be his. In many instances they will seek to rise no higher than their preacher. There will be in them no thorough heart work. They are not converted to God. The work is superficial. And their influence will be an injury to those who are really seeking the Lord. The success of a minister depends very much upon his deportment out of the desk. When they cease preaching, and leave the desk, their work is not finished. It is only commenced. They must then carry out what they have preached. They should not move heedlessly, but set a watch over themselves, lest something that they may do and say may be taken advantage of by the enemy, and a reproach be brought upon the cause of Christ.",
