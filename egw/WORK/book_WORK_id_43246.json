    "word": "The Lord is coming speedily, yet, notwithstanding his professed people read the signs of the times,--of famines, of thousands being swept away by earthquakes and floods, by fire, by calamities by sea and land, by plague, by war and bloodshed, --the love of self so deadens the spiritual sense that the day of the Lord will come upon them as a thief in the night, and he declares, \"They shall not escape.\" The Lord is to judge both quick and dead at his appearing and his kingdom. Will these stand in their pride and self-glorification before that tribunal, when the judgment will sit, and the books will be opened, and every man shall be judged according as his works have been?",
