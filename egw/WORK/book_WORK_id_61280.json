    "word": "God has not set any man on the judgment seat. \"Judge not,\" He said, \"that ye be not judged.\" The grace of humility should be cherished in the heart. It will modify and mold the words that fall from our lips, into expressions of Christ-like tenderness and care. The Master's work is not to be neglected; but it must be done in love, declaring the Master's message in the Master's Spirit.",
