    "word": "God has called human agencies to be laborers together with him in the work of salvation; and shall we who are ourselves subject to temptation and error, censure and blame others who have been so unfortunate as to make mistakes? Shall \n\n\n                       -9- \n\nwe not rather become so transformed by the grace of God as to become compassionate, touched with human woe? This will cause joy in heaven; for in loving our fallen brother as God and Christ love us, we evidence that we are partakers of Christ's attributes. Angels are interested in the spiritual welfare of all who are seeking to restore the moral image of God in man, and the human family are to connect with the heavenly family in binding up the wounds and bruises which sin has made.",
