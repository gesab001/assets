    "word": "Recognition of a Brother's Gift \n     The positions and offices of those in God's work are appointed by Christ. All our talents are His gifts. Let us not disappoint the Lord by an improper use of the talents entrusted to us. Let us not fail to recognize the position and capabilities God gives to another. Be not envious or suspicious as your brother uses his gifts to do something for the honor of God. In no case should we demerit the gift and work God has given another.--Manuscript 158, 1898 \n                                                                           37",
