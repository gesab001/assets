    "word": "A voice is to be heard in the Tabernacle giving God's word for this time in clear notes of warning. God has human instrumentalities that will not hold their peace. They are to advocate the word and will and way of Jehovah. In a clear, decided manner they are to proclaim the truth in all its beauty and power. No strange doctrines are to be introduced. There is to be no undermining of the fundamental truths that the Lord has submitted by many miraculous evidences. A voice is to be heard in clear affirmation of the truth, in contradiction to the skepticism and fallacies that have been coming in from the enemy of truth. Reformations will take place, and the working out of the principles of divine truth will reveal growth in grace; for the divine agencies are efficient to enlighten and sanctify the human understanding.",
