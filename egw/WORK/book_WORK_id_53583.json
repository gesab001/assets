    "word": "Willie, I want Matteson to stand in a proper light before the conference. We see mistakes and failure in his work and mission, but how much better would others have done under the circumstances? I am thinking he has done, in many respects, a good work. He has suffered privation and taken the work from nothing, and all these things deserve our appreciation, and we will encourage him all we can, and not say one word to discourage. You know that the man is not guilty of that devotion the people give him. They need to see and recognize other talent, and they will do it, and I know that there is much precious material in Christiania, and I want the dear lambs of the flock to be blessed and strengthened. I do not know as I can say anything more.",
