    "word": "The office of minister of the gospel is one of high dignity. True gospel ministers are co-laborers with God in the faithful accomplishment of His great plan. As God's messengers, they speak the truth in love. They are representatives of Christ, and though their work is often made very hard, yet God will sustain them against all criticism if they will be true to principle, whatever this may mean to them.--Letter 29, 1901. \n\nReleased Sept. 1964.",
