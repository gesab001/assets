    "word": "The Lord would have young men and women who are rooted and grounded in the truth take advantage of means that will serve to enlarge their conceptions of His work. Let the youth who have a solid experience in the things of God enter seminaries and colleges, and learn to meet the people on their own ground. In this way they may finish their education, and may become light-bearers to those with whom they are called to associate. They will have to meet obstacles in presenting the truth, but these will but make them \n75\nfeel their dependence upon God, and will lead them to seek wisdom from above in order that they may conduct themselves in a way that will have a saving influence upon those for whose salvation they are working.",
