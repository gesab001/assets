    "word": "Winds and earthquakes and tempests are not capricious outbreaks of unregulated mechanical forces. All nature is in the fullest sense under the control of physical law. It is the expression of a higher will. \"He holdest the winds in His fists;\" \"He gathereth the waters in the hollow of His hands;\" \"He maketh the clouds His chariots;\" \"The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth king forever.\" Let not human wisdom dethrone and defy the great Sovereign of the universe. \"He that made the world, and all things that are therein,\" He is the sustainer. All nature is but the working out of the laws which He has made, a manifestation of His sovereign will.--Ms 10, 1906.",
