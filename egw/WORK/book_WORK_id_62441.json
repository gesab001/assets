    "word": "In the efforts that are made in the South to proclaim the message for this time, the work for the whites and the blacks will have to be done separately.

The colored believers there have a neat, roomy meetinghouse, in which they can worship God in accordance with the light He has given them. Our colored brethren and sisters should be thankful for the privilege of meeting together for the worship of God and of working for their fellow men.",
