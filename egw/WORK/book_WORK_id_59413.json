    "word": "For two years I have been interested in the Potts Sanitarium property, and have advised and urged our people to secure it. Two years ago we thought it could be secure for $12,000. One year ago it was offered for $8,000, and this spring it was offered for still less. I advised those having in charge the medical work in Southern California, to purchase the building, and when they hesitated, because of a lack of funds, I persuaded Sister Josephine Gotzian and Brother J. F. Ballenger to join me, and we have purchased the Potts Sanitarium, and eight acres adjoining for $5,000.",
