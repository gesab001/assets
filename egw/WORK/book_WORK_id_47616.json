    "word": "MR No. 416 - Christ as a Man on Earth\n\n     Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh, by a pure and holy life to condemn sin in the flesh.  He came to our world to represent the character of God, and it is our work to represent the character of Christ.  If we have lost His love out of our hearts, our work is to seek the Lord, that our hearts may be renewed by His Holy Spirit.--Letter 17, 1893, p. 7. (To Elder William Ings, January 9, 1893.) \n\nReleased April 16, 1975.",
