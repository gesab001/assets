    "word": "By the ever-learning student new light, new ideas, new gems of truth will be found, and eagerly grasped. He thinks; the laws of the mind require him to think.

Unless it is made to think hard it will surely lose its power of thinking.--Letter 33, Feb. 27, 1886, to a minister working in Europe.",
