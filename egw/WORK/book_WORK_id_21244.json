    "word": "What Lesson Is God Teaching Us?--We must learn the meaning of the destruction of two of our largest institutions. We cannot afford to look with indifference on these things. What lesson is God teaching us? Is He not trying to show us the need of closely examining ourselves, that we may see whether we be in the faith or not? Is He not trying to lead us to give more thought to the subject of the time in which we are living? The signs of the times fulfilling all around us show us that the end of all things is at hand. Intense earnestness should take possession of us. Our slumbering energies should be aroused by persevering effort. Consecrated workers should go forth into the field and move understandingly forward, clearing the King's highway, obtaining victories in new places.--Lt 43, 1903.",
