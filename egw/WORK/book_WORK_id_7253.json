    "word": "Judas looked upon this act with great displeasure. . . . He asked, \"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?\" . . . The murmur passed round the table, \"To what purpose is this waste? . . .\"  Mary heard the words of criticism. . . . She was about to shrink away, when the voice of her Lord was heard, \"Let her alone; why trouble ye her?\" . . . Lifting His voice above the murmur of criticism, He said, \"She hath wrought a good work on me. For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.\"--DA 557-560 (1898).",
