    "word": "We need so much a deeper piety. We need to receive the holy oil from the two olive branches, \"which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves.\" We need to understand the work that is going forward in heaven. In this the great antitypical day of atonement, we need to be in perfect harmony with the work being carried forward in heaven. We need to repent, and confess our sins. \"Confess your faults \n                                                                           576\none to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed.\" It is too late for us to stand on our dignity. There are those who while they think that it is perfectly proper for others to confess their mistakes, think that their position makes it impossible for them to confess their mistakes. My brethren, if you expect your sins to be blotted out by the blood of Christ, you must confess them. If your brethren have a knowledge of your errors, if your position has given wideness to your influence, it is all the more necessary that you make a full confession. \"If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" Let our sins go beforehand to judgment, that they may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.",
