    "word": "To the leaders in the medical missionary work I must say that no one is to claim kingly power over God's heritage. God's people are to be under Him and Him alone. There is one Shepherd, and he has one flock. The Lord knows the future. He is the one to be looked to and trusted in to guide and guard and direct in the future development of the various branches of His work.",
