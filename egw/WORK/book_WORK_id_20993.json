If they are seen in the house of worship only occasionally, others will excuse themselves on account of their neglect. These businessmen can at any time talk fluently and intelligently on business matters, showing that they have not exercised their powers in this direction in vain. They have put tact and skill and knowledge into their work; but how important it is that their hearts, their minds, and all their powers be also trained for faithful service in the cause and worship of God; that they may be able to point out the way of salvation through Christ in language eloquent in its simplicity.
