But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not, and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, \n                                                                           394\ngentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruits of righteousness is sown in the peace of them that make peace.\"",
