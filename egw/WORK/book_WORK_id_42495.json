    "word": "Let those who have used the talent of speech to discourage and dishearten God's servants, who are striving to advance God's cause, planning and working to master hindrance, ask God to forgive them for the injury they have done to His work by their wicked prejudices and unkind words. Let them think of the harm they have done by spreading false reports, by judging those they have no right to judge.",
