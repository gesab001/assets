    "word": "If men resist the warnings the Lord sends them, they become even leaders in evil practices; such men assume to exercise the prerogatives of God--they presume to do that which God Himself will not do in seeking to control the minds of men. Thus they follow in the track of Romanism. They introduce their own methods and plans, and through their misconceptions of God they weaken the faith of others in the truth and bring in false principles that work like leaven to taint and corrupt institutions and churches.",
