    "word": "We need men who will stand as true to principle as the needle to the pole. God will test the men who are given responsibilities in His work, and unless they show that they have a true idea of what Christlike principles are, He will remove them and put others in their place. God wants us to know what it means to work on the principles of heaven. He wants those in the office to know what it means for everyone to stand in his lot and place obeying the words, \"Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity\" [2 Peter 1:5-7]. Brethren, let us hang these words in the chambers of the mind. If we live on the plan here outlined, we \"shall never fall; for so an entrance shall be ministered unto . . . [us] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ\" [verses 10, 11].",
