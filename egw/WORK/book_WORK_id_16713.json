    "word": "Sanctified Dignity to Be Preserved \n\n     I am instructed that our sanitariums are to be cleansed and purified from those persons whose course of action is a discredit to the sacred work of the sanitarium. Our health institutions should preserve a sanctified dignity. Let not helpers be employed here who have not a sense of true dignity. Employ those who give evidence that they are working to meet the standard of perfection, those in whose lives are seen the marks of the divine similitude. \n                                                                           173",
