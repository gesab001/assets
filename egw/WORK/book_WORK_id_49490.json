    "word": "Some men came in in the prime of life, as well as men of gray hairs, famished for the want of food. They had been unwilling to receive charity, but were driven to it by hunger. This winter will be worse. Work has been less, and men made desperate with hunger will do terrible things. Oh, how glad I shall be to see Jesus, our Deliverer, come and this terrible misery come to an end.--Letter 102, 1886, p. 3. (To \"My very dear children,\" from Copenhagen, Denmark, July 25, 1886.)",
