    "word": "Some go from their homes to labor in the gospel field, but do not act as though the truths which they speak were a reality to them. Their actions show \n64\nthat they have not experienced the saving power of the truth themselves. When out of the desk, they appear to have no burden for the truth. They labor sometimes apparently to profit, but more frequently to no profit. Such feel as much entitled to the wages they receive as though they had earned them; notwithstanding their unconsecration has cost more labor, anxiety, and pain of heart to those laborers who have the burden of the work upon them than all their efforts have done good. Such are not profitable workmen. But they will have to bear this responsibility themselves.",
