    "word": "My brethren, I wish to present before you the necessities of the unworked fields in your sight. In His great mercy the Lord has furnished those fields with laborers who have precious talents. Means is now needed to carry forward the work. I present this matter before the churches in Iowa, and may the Lord impress hearts with the needs of His work, that gifts may flow into His treasury for those barren fields! Our neglect of the fields ripe for the harvest is our condemnation.",
