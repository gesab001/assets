    "word": "Brother and Sister Pocock have nothing. For three years we have supplied them with clothing. They have bought nothing, they say, for they had \n\n\n                                     -95- \n\nno money. We shall now do our best to get them a little home on the school ground, and will help them by giving him work. He has two good trades at his command and will be able to amply support his family. Their experience has indeed been trying, but they have never murmured, never complained. If they had told us anything of their situation, we should have urged them to leave that place three years ago.--Letter 63, 1899, pp. 3-5. (To Brother and Sister John Wessels, April 4, 1899.)",
