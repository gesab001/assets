    "word": "Responsibility to Gather Sheaves.--Let every sister who claims to be a child of God feel a responsibility to help all within her reach. The noblest of all attainments may be gained through practical self-denial and benevolence for others' good. Sisters, God calls you to work in the harvest field and to help gather in the sheaves.... In the various lines of home missionary work the modest, intelligent woman may use her powers to the very highest account.--Review and Herald, Dec. 10, 1914. \n                                                                           161",
