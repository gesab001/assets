    "word": "27. The precious Saviour did not limit his gifts; for when he gave himself, he gave all. He died to bring life and immortality to light, to reveal truth, that men might be drawn to him. All this was done to save fallen man, and individually we have the privilege of becoming his agents, to cooperate with the angels in communicating to the world the knowledge of this great salvation. Man will never be able to comprehend the great work that the heavenly intelligences are waiting to do through the agency of men in behalf of humanity.",
