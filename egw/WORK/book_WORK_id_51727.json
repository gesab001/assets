    "word": "In one of the morning meetings I presented the light given me regarding the Melrose Sanitarium, that all prejudice against it might be cleared away from the minds of those who had been opposed to the removal of the sanitarium work from South Lancaster to Melrose. I spoke of the offer made to our brethren by rich people in South Lancaster to buy the sanitarium property there, and of their offer to give our brethren the sanitarium building if they would move it off the land. I spoke of the desirability of the Melrose property--four large buildings and forty acres of land, situated in the midst of a beautiful park--and the easy terms upon which it was secured. All the circumstances connected with this remarkable transaction, the sale of the South Lancaster property, the removal of the sanitarium building, and the purchase of the Melrose property, constitute an instructive lesson for our prayerful study.",
