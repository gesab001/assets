THEY WERE LED BY GOD TO WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE THEY LOCATED THE REVIEW AND HERALD PUBLISHING HOUSE IN 1903. FUNDS NECESSARY FOR THIS MOVE WERE PROVIDED LIBERALLY BY SDAS, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS OPPOSITION TO THE MOVE FROM BATTLE CREEK BY SOME LOCAL RESIDENTS, INCLUDING A FEW WHO WERE PROMINENT IN THE WORK OF THE CHURCH. IN LETTER 2, 1903, ELLEN WHITE WROTE: \"I HOPE THAT OUR BRETHREN WILL HEED THE LESSON THAT GOD IS TRYING TO TEACH THEM, AND THAT THEY WILL NOT REBUILD THE PUBLISHING HOUSE IN BATTLE CREEK.\"] they are earnestly to seek the Lord. They are to move with great caution, watchfulness, and prayer, and with a constant sense of their own weakness. We must not depend upon human judgment. We must seek for the wisdom that God gives.--Lt 106, 1903.",
