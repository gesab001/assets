    "word": "If the Lord is believed, if the Lord Jesus is accepted as our personal Saviour, it will make us to be honored of all the angelic universe as sons of God, children of the heavenly King. Then may they say, \"Goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\" The Lord will take the humble and contrite soul and bring him into connection with the excellent of the earth. This is the work the Lord Jesus longs to do for every soul that will come to Him.",
