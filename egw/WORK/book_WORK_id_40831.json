    "word": "These women who suppose they possess such sensitive, refined organizations make very useless wives and mothers. It is frequently the case that the affections will be withdrawn from their husbands, who are useful, practical men; and they will show much attention for other men, and will with their love-sick sentimentalism draw upon the sympathies of others, tell them their trials, their troubles, their aspirations to do some high and elevated work, and reveal the fact that their married life is a disappointment, a hindrance to their doing the work they have anticipated they might do.",
