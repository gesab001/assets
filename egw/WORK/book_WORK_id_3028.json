    "word": "Church members, awake to the importance of the circulation of our literature, and devote more time to this work. Place in the homes of the people papers, tracts, and books that will preach the gospel in its several lines. There is no time to be lost. Let many give themselves willingly and unselfishly to the canvassing work, and thus help to sound a warning that is greatly needed. When the church takes up her appointed work, she will go forth \"fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.\"-- Southern Watchman, Nov. 20, 1902.",
