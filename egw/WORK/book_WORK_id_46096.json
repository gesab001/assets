    "word": "I am sensible of the fact that I am mortal, and that I must guard my physical, mental, and moral powers. The constant changing from place to place necessitated by travel, and the taking hold of public labor wherever I have gone, have been too much for me, in addition to the writings that I have been preparing day and night as the Lord has worked my mind by His Holy Spirit. And when I am meeting with evidences that these communications will be treated by some in accordance with the human judgment of those who shall receive them; when I realize that some are watching keenly for some words \n\n\n                                    -65- \n\nwhich have been traced by my pen and upon which they can place their human interpretations in order to sustain their positions and to justify a wrong course of action; when I think of these things, it is not very encouraging to continue writing. Some of those who are certainly reproved, strive to make every word vindicate their own statements. The twistings and connivings and misrepresentations and misapplications of the Word, are marvelous. Persons are linked together in this work. What one does not think of, another mind supplies.--Letter 172, 1906, p. 1. (To Dr. David Paulson and Elder W. S. Sadler, June 14, 1906.)",
