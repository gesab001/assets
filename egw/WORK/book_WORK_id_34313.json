    "word": "Brethren, let all see that you are living out the lessons of Christ. If any one of the workers thinks that his way is perfect, and that the brethren do not appreciate his wisdom and experience, it is a positive evidence that he is not learning meekness and lowliness of heart in the school of Christ. The transforming grace of Christ always leads to meekness and humility. The Lord is not dependent upon us to do His work; He has given us the great privilege of co-operating with Him. You may have diverse temperaments, and yet be labourers together with God, all working in harmony, and when all your ability is put into the work, you will accomplish the best results. In doing the Lord's work we cannot follow our own judgment and peculiar notions. We must work with an eye single to the glory of Christ. Do not talk about that which cannot be done, but of that which can be done through the strength given you of God. \u201cThe silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts,\u201d and \u201cthe cattle upon a thousand hills.\u201d",
