    "word": "From time to time the Lord has presented many things before me regarding the perils of our physicians who are associated together at Battle Creek. At various times Dr. Kellogg has been presented to me as walking in a false show, desiring to have the credit of being the first in medical missionary work. By his remarks he sometimes gives the impression that he is the author of the medical missionary work. But this honor does not belong to any man. It is the Lord, not man, who is the Teacher and Leader of His people. God has moved upon the hearts of men in different places to engage in this work. He has given them wisdom to plan and devise, and they have carried forward the work that He has laid upon them. It is His purpose that Dr. Kellogg shall give close attention to the work devolving upon him, and that he shall leave his brethren free to do their appointed work as the Lord shall direct them.--Letter 256, 1903, pp. 1-3. (To the Officers of the Int. M. M. & B. Association, Oct. 25, 1903.) \n\n\n                                    -53-",
