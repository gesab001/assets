    "word": "MR No. 1282 - An Appeal for a Leader to Repent and Reform\n\n     Throughout every department of His work God will vindicate His honor, His righteousness. Will you not stop right where you are and consider diligently your ways? The Lord cannot endorse your spirit or your course of action. His hand is on the lever. Your plans are not His plans. Do not make others err by leading them to harmonize with your ideas and carry out your plans for the supremacy. Now is your time to repent. Lose not the opportunity. Cherish principles of the purest integrity. Then your spirit will change. You will be upright in your dealings with your fellow men because you are upright in your dealings with God.",
