    "word": "The representation given in Ezekiel 47:1-12 is an illustration of the way in which the truth for this time is to go. A large work is to be done by many who have begun in a small way. Many souls will be reached, not through display, not through any devising on the part of man, but through the working of the Holy Spirit on the hearts of human agencies. The Saviour worked in this way. When His methods become the methods of His followers, His blessings will attend their labors.",
