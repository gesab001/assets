    "word": "I dare not under present conditions do otherwise than as I have stated. While for a time there might be an enthusiasm in presenting books at a great reduction, yet there are only a few who could do this kind of work. And I cannot consent for you to do this in my behalf.

Looking unto Jesus constitutes real excellence of character. If we copy the pattern we shall always be safe; for Christ will be revealed in personal ministry. Let us make no mistakes, for we are sowing for eternity.",
