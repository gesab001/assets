    "word": "Your danger, my dear brother, is in making the grave mistake of supposing that success depends on drawing a large congregation by outward display. To bring anything of a theatrical nature into the preaching of the word of God is to use common fire instead of the sacred fire of God's kindling. . . . Take up your work with greater humility, and carry it forward by Christlike methods. Let the truth have the field. For Christ's sake do not hinder its progress by our own inventions.--Letter 51, 1902, pp. 5, 6. (To Elder E. E. Franke, March 20, 1902.)",
