THIS PLAN OF EDUCATION, WHEN STRICTLY FOLLOWED OUT, PLACED THE ISRAELITES AT THE HEAD OF LEARNING, AND IT IS SAID THAT THEY WERE REGARDED BY THE PAGAN NATIONS ROUND ABOUT, THUS: \"FOR THIS IS YOUR WISDOM AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING IN THE SIGHT OF THE NATIONS, WHICH SHALL HEAR ALL THESE STATUTES, AND SAY, SURELY THIS GREAT NATION IS A WISE AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE.\" DEUTERONOMY 4:6. SOLOMON'S WISDOM EXCELLED THE WISDOM OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE EAST COUNTRY AND ALL THE WISDOM OF EGYPT, FOR HE WAS WISER THAN ALL MEN. HIS FAME WAS IN ALL NATIONS ROUNDABOUT. 1 KINGS 4:29-34. THE BIBLE WAS THE BASIS OF THEIR PRINCIPAL STUDIES, WHICH WERE THE NATURAL SCIENCES (1 KINGS 4:33), THE STUDY OF THE LAW, SACRED HISTORY, SACRED MUSIC, POETRY, AGRICULTURE, AND HORTICULTURE. \"THE LORD HIMSELF DIRECTED THE EDUCATION OF ISRAEL,\" AND HE WISHES TO DIRECT OUR EDUCATION TODAY.",
