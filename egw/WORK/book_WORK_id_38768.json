    "word": "Danger of Undue Personal Responsibilities. \n\n                                Prussia, 1886. \n\n\n     In another letter I have spoken in reference to your accumulating so many responsibilities in -----, when there is so little managing talent that is consecrated to the work of God to take care of these interests. I have spoken in disapproval of the enlargement of the -----, on the ground that so large a share of its responsibilities are resting upon one man. Dr. ----- has to be both physician and manager. Now, my brother, these things are not as God would have them. He is not pleased that so much means should be invested in one locality. Other men should be educated to share in the responsibility that Dr. ----- is burdened with, in order that if he fails, another will be prepared to carry the institution forward. We feel to thank God that Dr. ----- has the good health that he has; but he may not always have it, and the fact that he has it now, is no reason why our people should sleep till the last moment. They should manage this matter wisely. Great interests are at stake, and unless Dr. ----- has less responsibilities, he will not be able to stand the pressure for a great while.",
