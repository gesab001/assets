    "word": "I am sorry for Brother Y, for he is not daily converted. His spirit of criticism and his desire to have control, to run the work, has been a snare to him. God pity him, for he has not the elements of peace of upbuilding in his soul. He needs to be subdued under the hand of God. He is developing the attributes of unsanctified self. He is not a safe adviser or counselor, for he nearly always sees some course to be pursued opposite to the course his brethren desire to follow; and if he can get anyone to favor his views, he makes it hard for those who are opposed to him. When will those who have had great light, great opportunities, learn to work in harmony with their brethren, not to be always pulling on the wrong side? Why cannot they learn that they manufacture a great many burdens for others to carry?",
