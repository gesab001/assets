    "word": "Anointing and Divine Healing\n \n\n     Ministers should not only \"preach the kingdom,\" but also pray for the afflicted.--When the Saviour sent the disciples out to preach the Word, He \"gave them power . . . to cure diseases.\" They were \"to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.\" This was the two-fold command given them. To our ministers the same command is given. They are to offer prayer for the afflicted, that the Lord God of Israel may take these cases under His oversight. If His workers will cooperate with Him, if they will sense the sacredness of\n233\nthe work that Christ did, and the work He would have them do, their ministry will be marked by a sacredness that will give evidence of its heavenly inspiration.--AUCR Feb. 20, 1911.",
