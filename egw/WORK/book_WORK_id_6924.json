    "word": "Early Encouragement and Instruction.--July, 1853, I saw that it was not as it should be, that the paper, owned and approved by God, should come out so seldom. [THE REVIEW AND HERALD PREVIOUS TO THIS TIME HAD BEEN PUBLISHED QUITE IRREGULARLY, AND WAS NOW ISSUED SEMIMONTHLY.] The cause, in the time in which we are living, demands the paper weekly, and the publication of many more tracts to expose the increasing errors of this time; but the work is hindered for want of means. I saw that the truth must go, and that we must not be too fearful; that tracts and papers might better go to three where they were not needed than to have one deprived of them who prizes them, and can be benefited by them. I saw that the last-day signs should be brought out clearly, for the manifestations of Satan are on the increase. The publications of Satan and his agents are increasing, their power is growing; and what we do to get the truth before others, must be done quickly.",
