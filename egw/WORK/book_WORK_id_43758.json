You did not do this. And when the sheep was found, and brought back to the fold with rejoicing, did you rejoice? We tried to arouse you.

You felt that the sheep had done a great wrong in leaving the fold, and instead of rejoicing that he had returned, you were anxious to make him feel that he should be very sorry for leaving, and should come back just according to your ideas. And since the return of the lost sheep, you have had a feeling of jealousy in regard to his return. You have kept your eye out, watching to see if all was right. Some have not felt just satisfied, but have felt an unwillingness in their hearts to have things just as they are.",
