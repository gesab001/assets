    "word": "When the men of Ashdod became convinced that it was the God of the Hebrews who caused their afflictions, because of his ark, they decided that the ark of the God of Israel should not abide with them. \"For,\" said they, \"his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon, our god.\" The great men and rulers consulted together, relative to what they should do with the ark of the God of Israel. They had taken it in triumph, but knew not what to do with the sacred chest; for instead of its being a power and strength to them, it was a great burden and a heavy curse. They decided to send it to Gath. But the destroying angels carried on their work of destruction in that place also. Very many of the people of Gath died; and they dared not retain the ark longer there, lest the God of Israel should consume them all by his curse.",
