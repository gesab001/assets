    "word": "In order to confess Christ, we must have Christ to confess. No one can truly confess Christ, unless the mind and Spirit of Christ live in him. If a form of godliness, or an acknowledgment of the truth, were always a confession of Christ, we might say, Broad is the way that leadeth unto life, and many there be that find it. We must understand what it is to confess Christ, and wherein we deny him. It is possible with our lips to confess Christ, yet in our works to deny him. If we have forsaken all for Christ, we shall manifest in our lives humility, our conversation will be heavenly, our conduct blameless. The powerful purifying influence of truth in the soul, and the character of Christ exemplified in the life, are a confession of Christ. If the words of eternal life are sown in our hearts, the fruit is righteousness and peace. We may deny Christ in our life, by the love of ease, love of self, jesting and joking, and by seeking the honor of the world. We may deny him in our outward appearance, \n                                                                           94\nby a proud look or costly apparel, or by conformity to the world. We shall not be able to exhibit in our character the life of Christ, or the sanctifying influence of the truth, only by constant watchfulness and persevering and almost unceasing prayer.",
