    "word": "Writing from Washington, July 15, 1904, when Sister White had learned of the prospect of securing the Glendale property, she said: \"I am very grateful to my heavenly Father that you have secured a building near Los Angeles for sanitarium work. Your description of the building shows the truth of the testimonies that I have borne, that buildings suitable for our work will be offered to us at a low price. We must make earnest effort to improve the opportunities that God sends us, that His work shall advance as rapidly as possible. Let us have faith that we shall have special help from God. Let us not talk unbelief, but be cheerful in the Lord.",
