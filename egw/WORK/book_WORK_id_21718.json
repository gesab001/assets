    "word": "Men of Influence to Accept Light.--There needs to be a waking up among God's people, that His work may be carried forward with power. We need the baptism of the Holy Spirit. We need to understand that God will add to the ranks of His people men of ability and influence, who are to act their part in warning the world. Not all in the world are lawless and sinful. God has many thousands who have not bowed the knee to Baal. There are God-fearing men in the fallen churches. If this were not so, we should not be given the message to bear, \"Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen. . . . Come out of her, my people.\"",
