    "word": "I hope and pray that the Lord will bless you abundantly in your work in Sydney. I hope that you will have good health. Be assured that we pray for you and for those connected with you, that you may have wisdom to walk wisely in a perfect way. If ever there was a time when we needed to watch unto prayer, it is now. Sin has cast a dark shadow over the earth. In our work we constantly meet with difficulties, but we can hope in God, for we have the assurance that He is light. He is the fullness of light.",
