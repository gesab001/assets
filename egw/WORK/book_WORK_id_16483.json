    "word": "To a Physician in Perplexity \n\n     I have wished so much that I might have an opportunity to talk with you. Could I see you, I should say to you what I have been saying to you recently in the visions of the night. You were apparently undecided as to what you would do in the future. I asked, \"Why are you perplexed?\" You replied, \"I am perplexed in regard to what is the best course for me to pursue.\" Then One who has authority stepped up to you and said: \"You are not your own. You have been bought with a price. Your time, your talents, every jot of your influence, is the Lord's. You are His \n                                                                           45\nservant. Your part is to do His bidding, and learn daily of Him. You are not to set up in business for yourself. This is not the Lord's plan. You are not to unite with unbelievers in medical work. Neither is this the Lord's plan. His word to you is, \"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.\" . . .",
