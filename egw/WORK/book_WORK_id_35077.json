    "word": "All heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of God are . . . marking the deeds of men. They record in the books of God's remembrance the words of faith, the acts of love, the humility of spirit, and in that day when every man's work shall be tried of what sort it is, the work of the humble follower of Christ will stand the test, and will receive the commendation of Heaven. \"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father\" (Matthew 13:43).",
