    "word": "When those who know the truth practice the self-denial enjoined in God's word, the message will go with power. The Lord will hear our prayers for the conversion of souls.

Let us relate ourselves to God in self-sacrificing obedience.--R. & H., Dec. 1, 1910. \n                                                                           303",
