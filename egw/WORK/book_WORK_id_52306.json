    "word": "The Lord has a controversy with them, and yet Elder Olsen treats them as representative men, sending them hither and thither as men of discernment, endorsing them as trustworthy and reliable men, to whom the people shall listen and show respect as the voice of God in the Conference. But when they give unmistakable evidence that they are not taught or led of God, they are not to carry matters as they choose; for they will not work in Christ's lines. Enterprises in this large field of God need much consideration and wisdom from God; but men's ideas, mingled with selfishness, will be enough to drown the voice of God, which will not be heard in the uproar of voices. Thus portions of the field are neglected and mismanaged. No arrangements are to be made to fit the field. We must take them as they are, even though hard and unpromising.",
