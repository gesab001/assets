    "word": "PRAY FOR THE SPIRIT IN THE TIME OF THE LATTER RAIN.\u2014We cannot depend upon form or external machinery. What we need is the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit of God. \u201cNot by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.\u201d Pray without ceasing, and watch by working in accordance with your prayers. As you pray, believe, trust in God. It is the time of the latter rain, when the Lord will give largely of his Spirit. Be fervent in prayer, and watch in the Spirit.\u2014(Review and Herald, March 2, 1897.)",
