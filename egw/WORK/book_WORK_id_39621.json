    "word": "Of the one who has been working with intensity of effort to keep up a name, God says, \"I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.\"  He has been so occupied with keeping up a name that he has neglected responsibilities of a most solemn character. God looks upon the name as dead, so far as correct influence is concerned. Those who follow in his tread will be dead, destroyed by false representations. There is nothing more dangerous to a professing Christian than to have merely \"a name.\"",
