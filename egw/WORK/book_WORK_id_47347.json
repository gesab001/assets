    "word": "I shall give the message and the instruction that has been given me in regard to the work, not as my brethren advise; for they see things with a clouded understanding. I have lost confidence in their spiritual discernment, and in their plans and methods, because the light that they are following is directly contrary to the light that the Lord has given me. If their plans are accepted, the work in the Southern field will be carried forward in a way that is contrary to the way in which the Lord has shown me it should be carried forward.",
