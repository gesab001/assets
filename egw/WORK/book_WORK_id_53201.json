    "word": "When the vitality is needlessly expended in long sermons, weariness is the result. We are to be laborers together with God. We dishonor Him when we do that which unfits and disqualifies us for His service. The Lord desires us to work as intelligent human agencies. We are not our own. We have been bought with a price, and we are to glorify God by a life of intelligent effort, returning to Him His own in sensible, faithful service.",
