    "word": "Connected with every center of influence in our work there should be that spiritual experience that is the mark of the Holy Spirit's guidance; for unless the workers consider where they are drifting, they will lose their burden for the work for which these centers are established. They are to labor under the supervision of holy angels. The sacredness of truth is to be preserved in all its holy dignity and power. The characteristics specified by Christ are to be revealed in our work as the mark of Christian service.",
