    "word": "No compromise with sin can ever be accepted by a pure and holy God. No conversion is genuine which does not radically change the heart, the character, \n\n\n                                   -278- \n\nand every line of conduct. \"If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.\" The gift of the Lord Jesus is a new character, a new creature in Christ Jesus. Not a moment should be wasted on a patchwork religion. We must shine as lights in the world. May the Lord bless you and your family, that you may reveal Christ in a life of faith, purity, true godliness and holiness. Thus it must be with every soul who is a citizen of heaven. Our citizenship is above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. This present life is only our training school; it is to purify us, that we may be without spot, wrinkle, or any such thing--meet for the inheritance of the saints in light.",
