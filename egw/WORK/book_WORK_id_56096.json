    "word": "It is of no use for man to attempt to use his own human wisdom while occupying a high position of responsibility in God's service. His work for the church will be of no value, unless he puts his trust in the wisdom of the great Head of the church. God calls upon us to make our movements in His fear and to walk tremblingly before Him. \"Work out your own salvation,\" He says, \"with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\"",
