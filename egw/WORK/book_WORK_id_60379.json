    "word": "(762) Students who are in training for medical missionary work, should be willing to learn under those of experience to heed their suggestions, to follow their advice. There are many who are in such haste to climb to distinction, that they skip some of the rounds of the ladder, and in so doing, lose essential experiences which they must have in order to become intelligent workers. In their zeal, the knowledge of many things looks unimportant to them. They skim over the surface, and do not go deep into the mine of truth, thus by a slow and painstaking process gaining an experience that will enable them to be of special help to others. We want our medical students to be men and women who are most thorough, and who feel it their duty to improve every talent lent them, that they may finally double their entrusted capital.",
