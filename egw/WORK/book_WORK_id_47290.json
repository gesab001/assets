    "word": "MR No. 364 - On Early Work in Great Britain\n\n     Elder Ings, Sister Ings, and I took the steamer for the Isle of Wight. The day was a little cloudy at first, but the clouds dispersed and we had very pleasant weather. Brother Sargent lives with his family on the island. They are indeed children of God, keeping the Sabbath with all fidelity. Have kept the Sabbath for six years. His work is a captain of ships. The Sabbath has shut him out of positions more profitable, but he rejoices in the truth. We purchased strawberries and bread and Sister Phipson, Sister Ings and I were seated in full view of the water, and took our lunch. The Isle of Wight is a beautiful place. After we had taken refreshments Brother Sargent took us across the bay in his rowboat and we visited his family. They have a numerous little flock. We had a pleasant visit and then had a season of prayer with them. It was a precious season.--Ms 36, 1887, pp. 6, 7. (Diary, July 10, 1887.)",
