    "word": "MR No. 1122 - The Lack of Unity a Cause of Failure\n\n     To those who were working in ______: Dear Brethren: The question has often presented itself to my mind, Why has the labor put forth in _____at such large expense brought such limited results? There is an answer to this question. The Lord has been pleased to reveal to me that the same efforts put forth in another place, by the same persons and in the same spirit, would have brought the same results. The Lord could not give victory while those who taught the truth to unbelievers did not themselves practice that word. The Spirit of God was not cherished, and that union which should exist among God's workmen, was not seen. Disaffection was working, and criticism was heard. The workers got in each other's way. Some earnestly desired to tell what \"I did\" and how \"I labored,\" but said nothing which would show what their fellow workmen had done.",
