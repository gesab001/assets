    "word": "I am instructed to say that the health food work is not at present being conducted as to greatly advance the work of God. The Lord has presented before me many dangers that threaten the management of this business. The Lord never designed that the manufacture and sale of health foods should become such a commercial [business] as it now is. This is not to become a speculative business, in which a few shall receive large personal profits. To many minds God has given wisdom to devise healthful food preparations.",
