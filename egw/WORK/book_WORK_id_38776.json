    "word": "The Lord requires the human agent not to move by impulse in speaking, but to move calmly, speak slowly, and let the Holy Spirit give efficiency to the truth. Never think that in working yourselves up to a passion of delivery, speaking by impulse, and suffering your feelings to raise your voice to an unnaturally high key, that you are giving evidence of the great power of God upon you. All who learn in Christ's school, allowing God to work them, will cultivate the voice, so as to make the very best impression, and to honor the truth which they present to the people. The Lord demands an unreserved surrender of the body, soul, and spirit, that the divine power may work through all your energies and capabilities during the entire period of your service for him.",
