    "word": "The Lord has graciously spared your life to work in His lines. He does not want you to work yourself, independent of the only power which can work successfully to accomplish His designs. Then do not fret, but trust, looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of your faith. Do not be in too much of a hurry. That which you can do without great taxation to your physical and mental powers, do, but do not feel that you must take so many cares and burdens that you cannot keep your own soul in the love of God.",
