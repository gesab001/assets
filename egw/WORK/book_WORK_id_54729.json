    "word": "Elder Rice left the Rural Health Retreat because we urged him to \n\n                                     -323- \n\nresign. Not because of his imprudence with this too great commonness with a married woman, but because of his being so inefficient as a business manager. He has cost the institution thousands of dollars that might, with wise management, have been saved. But now he has worked upon his mother's and sister's sympathy until they charge his separation from the Health Retreat to me rather than to his course of action.",
