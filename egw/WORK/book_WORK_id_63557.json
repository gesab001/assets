    "word": "The Closing of the Southern Field. \n\n     (The assertion has been widely made that the Testimonies state that our work will first be closed in the South. I think this is not true. No one whom I have requested to produce the reference has been able to find it. None of Sister White's helpers know of it. When I was at Sister White's home in 1913, I made a careful search of all the Testimonies on the Southern work, and failed to find this statement. Without saying who was first responsible for it, I think I am correct in ascribing the belief to a careless reading of a statement made by Sister White at the General Conference of 1901, in Battle Creek, Mich., a statement to be found on page 482 of the General Conference Bulletin of that year. I give here a passage containing this statement, which I have underscored. . A. W. S.)",
