    "word": "Dear Brother: I have the most tender love for you, and would that it were otherwise with you; that those pursuing you would let you alone. But, my brother, you must bear in mind that these perplexities and annoying things are included in the \"all things\" that work together for good to those who love God. The Lord's eye is upon you. . . . If you will keep up good courage, if you will stay your soul upon God, if you will trust your heavenly Father as a child trusts its parent, and deal justly and love mercy, God can and will work with you. Then amid all your trials you will honor God, and His promise is sure, \"Them that honour me I will honour\" (1 Samuel 2:30).",
