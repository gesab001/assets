    "word": "MR No. 1071 - Ellen White's Attitude Toward Dr. Kellogg in 1907\n\n     (Written about 1907; copied November 21, 1911. This letter, though addressed to Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, apparently was never sent to him.) \n\n\n     I beg of you no longer to stand apart, and think that the meeting you designed to have in Battle Creek would have been what you represented that it would be. You had every opportunity at Berrien Springs, and yet you were so fully under the control of another spirit that you could not discern how far you were from God. I think you are still unable to see that you yourself have hindered the work of God for years. I know better than anyone else can know that you have worked in various ways to hinder the workers, so that they could do nothing to advantage. The Lord forbids that the representation you would now put upon the past should be regarded as true.",
