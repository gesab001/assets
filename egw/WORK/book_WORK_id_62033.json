Olsen Dear Brother: \n\n\n     Of late I have not addressed so many communications to you as heretofore, fearing to lay upon you responsibilities that would be a tax. When we left Michigan, I placed in your hands Testimonies in regard to matters in the office. They were important and explicit, and I enjoined upon you to have a most faithful work done in reading the Testimonies to those concerned, in order to correct the existing evils. But you did not follow the directions, and the same things went on accumulating in their objectionable features until the matter was again presented to me in an aggravated character, with these words for those in responsible positions: \"Neither will I serve with your sins, nor be with you anymore, unless you put away the wrongs from among you.\"",
