    "word": "ANOTHER QUESTION THEN ARISES: \"IF HE WAS MISTAKEN IN THE EVENT, WAS NOT HIS WHOLE WORK AN ERROR?\" THAT DOES NOT FOLLOW. THE DISCIPLES OF CHRIST WERE UTTERLY MISTAKEN WHEN HE RODE INTO JERUSALEM, AND THEY HAILED HIM AS A KING WITH TOKENS OF VICTORY. THEY THOUGHT HE WAS THEN TO BE CROWNED A KING ON DAVID'S THRONE. BUT IT WAS NOT AN ERROR IN THEM TO ACT ACCORDING TO THEIR BELIEF; IS SO DOING THEY FULFILLED THE PROPHECY OF ZECHARIAH 9:9, WHICH THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IF THEY HAD REALIZED THAT HE WAS GOING TO JUDGMENT AND TO DEATH. BUT THAT SCRIPTURE MUST BE FULFILLED, IF IT WERE NECESSARY TO MAKE THE STONES CRY OUT. LUKE 19:37-40. IN LIKE MANNER IT APPEARS THAT MR. MILLER AND HIS ASSOCIATES FULFILLED PROPHECY, AND GAVE A PROCLAMATION (SEE REVELATION 14:6, 7) WHICH THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HAD THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT YET OTHER PROCLAMATIONS WERE TO BE MADE BEFORE THE LORD SHOULD COME. REVELATION 14:8-14.",
