    "word": "There are individuals who are watching with eagle eyes for his haltings, and all the more intently because of the efforts that have been made by my husband and myself to counteract the influence which was working against him, and to place him in the confidence of our people everywhere. Some have not given up their feelings of suspicion, but have been watching to see Dr. Kellogg make mistakes which shall prove our confidence in him to have been misplaced. When any reproof is given to the Sanitarium, there is in some hearts a throb of joyful triumph; and those who have cherished prejudice, feel a new assurance that they are in the right. God is in no way pleased with this spirit. These feelings are more satanic than divine. If those who complain of the Doctor were one-half as self-sacrificing as he has been, if they would accomplish one-half as much good as he has accomplished, their course would be more pleasing to God than it now is.",
