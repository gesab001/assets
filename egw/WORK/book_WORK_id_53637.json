    "word": "Your ways, your methods, are not God's ways or God's methods. You feel at perfect liberty to complain of those whom God has ordained to work for the upbuilding of His cause. If their ideas conflict with your ideas, you criticize and condemn them; but you have no right to do this. In doing this you are not strengthening the things that remain, that are ready to die. Men who have had a long experience in the cause of truth have not had an easy, self-indulgent experience; they know what hardships and privations are; they know what self-denial and self-sacrifice is. They have had to economize, for they have not worked for riches, but rather invested all in the cause of God.",
