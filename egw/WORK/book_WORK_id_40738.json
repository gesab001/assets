    "word": "In every church the members should be trained so that they will devote time to the work, and win souls to Christ. How can it be said of the church, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" unless the members of the church actually impart light to others? In seeking to point sinners to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world, their own love will be kindled, and by beholding Him they, too, will become changed into His likeness.",
