God's people will not find their safety in working miracles, for Satan would counterfeit any miracle that might be worked. God's tried and tested people will find their power in the sign spoken of in Exodus 31:12-18. They are to take their stand on the living Word--\"It is written.\" This is the only foundation upon which they can stand securely. Those who have broken their covenant with God will in that day be without hope and without God in the world.",
