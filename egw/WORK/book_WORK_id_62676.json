    "word": "There are those who are quick to see and grasp ideas in advance, but who do not weigh every point and apply their ideas in a way that produces the best results. They are heedless; they do not work in opinions, lest they should be obliged to retrace their steps. If they are not careful, their course will be uneven and uncertain. They will fail to make straight paths for their feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way. They will surely lead away those who admire their flashes and brilliancy, unless they determine to know why they know the things they claim to know. They should be careful how they order their steps. They should pray much, fearing to make mistakes. Unless they walk guardedly, they will be losers.",
