    "word": "\"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.\" Many shall say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name; and in thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful works? Then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.",
