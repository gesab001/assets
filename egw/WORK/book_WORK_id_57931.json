    "word": "Wellington, N. Z., Sunday, April 23, 1893 \n\n     I arise early--half past three--and get at work to prepare Melbourne mail, which I am told leaves Monday. Early in the morning the mail bag is brought in and we are so anxious to open it to see what our letters contain; but we will not do this until after our morning worship. Then the mail bag is opened and there is a large number of papers, but no letters from Melbourne or from America. We concluded our mail had gone to Melbourne and we must wait two weeks to get it back to New Zealand. Well, we will make the best of it and not feel sad one minute.",
