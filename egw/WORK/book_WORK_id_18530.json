    "word": "The minds of thinking men labor too hard. They frequently use their mental powers prodigally, while there is another class whose highest aim in life is physical labor. The latter class do not exercise the mind. Their muscles are exercised, but their brains are robbed of intellectual strength; just as the minds of thinking men are worked, but their bodies are robbed of strength and vigor by their neglect to exercise the muscles. . . . Health should be a sufficient inducement to lead them to unite physical with mental labor.",
