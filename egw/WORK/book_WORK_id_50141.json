    "word": "MR No. 969 - Faithfulness in Confessing Christ\n\n     \"Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father which is in heaven\" [Matthew 10:32]. Do you confess Christ in your expenditure of His entrusted means? Is He confessed when most of your income is spent on self, when the Lord's tenth is withheld, and when gifts and offerings are used for your own pleasure and benefit? It would not be out of place for you to head a column in your domestic account book \"Charity.\" Had you done this, and had you put down all that you have spent for self, and all that you have used for charity, the list of that spent for self would make a large amount; but how would your column set apart for charity come out? Again I urge you to ask yourself, Do I confess Christ in my expenditure? Heading a column of your account book \"Charity\" would make a revelation to you. No other human eye may see that book but yourself, but the Lord Jesus Christ sees it, and your reward in the day of reckoning will be in accordance with your works.",
