    "word": "MR No. 1500 - The Needs of the Southern Field\n\n     (Written January 1, 1909, from Sanitarium, California, to W. C. White.) \n\n     I have words to speak to our brethren in the Southern field. All through the South there is a decided work to be done that is not being done. For many years appeals for the South have come before our people, but men in authority have blocked the way. They have piled up difficulties, and have made determined efforts that means should not come to the workers in the South.",
