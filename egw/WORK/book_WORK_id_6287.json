    "word": "A Brake on Wheels of Progress \n\n     The idea that a sanitarium should not be established unless it could be started free from debt, has put the brake upon the wheels of progress. In building meetinghouses we have had to borrow money, in order that something might be done at once. We have been obliged to do this, in order to fulfill the directions of God. Persons deeply interested in the progress of the work have borrowed money and paid interest on it, to help establish schools and sanitariums and to build meetinghouses. The institutions thus established and the churches built have been the means of winning many to the truth. Thus the tithe has been increased, and workers have been added to the Lord's forces.--Letter 211, 1904.",
