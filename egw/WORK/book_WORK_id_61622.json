    "word": "Since coming to the Conference, I have spoken nine times. Up to today I had not made any call for means. At the close of my talk this afternoon, I called for a contribution for the work among the colored people of the Southern field. One hundred and twenty-eight dollars was raised. I was much pleased. When I left my tent, it looked as if I would not be able to get to my room, there were so many who wanted to speak to me. Edson was present, and he felt very grateful for the donation.",
