    "word": "God permits affliction to come on us at times that we may know how to sympathize with others who are passing through sorrow. The Lord has given me my work, and even when physicians have despaired of my life I have felt it my duty to labor on, even if I died at my post of duty. Our heavenly Father gives us experiences so that we can know how to help others. When the youngest branch of my family was broken off and I could no longer have my infant by my side, I knew better how to sympathize with the mourning mother. When I laid away the oldest member of my family, Jesus supplanted him, and now I can tell mothers to go to Jesus. When the unexpected blow came to him who had stood by my side for thirty-six years it was then that I could lean on my Saviour. I was not left alone, for Christ is a father to the widow. Everyone can benefit others by his own experience.",
