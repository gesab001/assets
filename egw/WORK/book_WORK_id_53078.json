    "word": "Selfishness and pride hinder the pure love that unites us in spirit with Jesus Christ. If this love is truly cultivated, finite will blend with finite, and all will center in the Infinite. Humanity will unite with humanity, and all will be bound up with the heart of Infinite love. Sanctified love for one another is sacred. In this great work Christian love for one another--far higher, more constant, more courteous, more unselfish, than has been seen--preserves Christian tenderness, Christian benevolence and politeness, and enfolds the human brotherhood in the embrace of God, acknowledging the dignity \n\n\n                                     -20- \n\nwith which God has invested the rights of man. This dignity Christians must ever cultivate for the honor and glory of God.",
