    "word": "PRAY; THEN LEAVE THE RESULTS WITH GOD.\u2014Work in faith, and leave results with God. Pray in faith, and the mystery of His providence will bring its answer. At times it may seem that you cannot succeed. But work and believe, putting into your efforts\n60\nfaith, hope, and courage. After doing what you can, wait for the Lord, declaring His faithfulness, and He will bring His word to pass. Wait, not in fretful anxiety, but in undaunted faith and unshaken trust.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, 245.)",
