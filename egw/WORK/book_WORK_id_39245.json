    "word": "This building is a three-story structure, of seventy-five rooms. Many of these rooms are arranged in suites, a small one for a bedroom and a larger one for a sitting-room. Many of the rooms are very pleasant. There were two bathrooms on each floor, but they were not suitable for sanitarium work, and new treatment-rooms have been built.",
