[SPECIAL TESTIMONIES TO \n     MINISTERS AND WORKERS (SERIES A, NO. 9, 1897), \n     PAGES 21-31.] \n\n\n                                        September 24. \n\n\n     Everything in our world is in agitation. Coming events cast their shadows before. The signs of the times are ominous, indeed. There is assurance in nothing that is human or earthly. The winds are held by the four angels; a moment of respite has been graciously given us of God. Every power lent us of God, whether physical, mental, or moral, is to be sacredly cherished to do the work assigned us for our fellowmen who are perishing in their ignorance. The warning is to go forth to all parts of the world. There must be no delay.",
