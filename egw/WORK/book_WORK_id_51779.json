    "word": "When Christians do not reveal Christ, of what value are they? Are they not, like savorless salt, \"good for nothing\"? But when they reveal in their lives the saving properties of the truth, poor, sin-hardened souls are not left to perish in corruption. God's works are seen, for the living principles of righteousness cannot be hidden. The gospel acted is like salt which contains all its savor. It is powerful in the saving of souls.",
