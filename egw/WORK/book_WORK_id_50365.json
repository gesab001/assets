    "word": "At this time, when Satanic agencies seem to be triumphing, the Lord calls upon His people to be wide awake, that they may give the enemy no advantage in his purpose to deceive, if possible, the elect. Those who know the truth are to let their light shine, not only to those in the house but to those outside. All who are engaged in the work of the Lord for these last days should lift the voice in no uncertain tones in the message, \"Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" [Matthew 3:2]. \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it \n\n\n                                   -46- \n\ntogether: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it\" [Isaiah 40:3-5]. Difficulties will always be found in the way of the Lord's work, but in spite of every opposing element the believers in Christ are to let the true light shine forth with power.",
