    "word": "These words were brought before me in a forcible manner: Isaiah 29:9-24. This is the very description God has given of the course that has been pursued in Battle Creek by men supposed to be trust-worthy. Again and again I have in Spirit been brought into your councils and have seen that the principles of the ten commandments have been violated by men. Have not shown supreme love to God nor love to their fellowmen as they love themselves. Any one who questioned the course of action they have thought themselves wise to pursue, has been heartily disliked and despised. The very men whom God has entrusted with a message for his people have not been treated with respect; and A.R. Henry had those in harmony with him, \n                                                                           1300\nhad the power been in their hands would have rejected, not only the message, as they have done, but the messengers whom God has sent. These men were intrusted with a work to do for the Master, and had their mouths been stopped, had their voices been silenced, God would have raised up others to do this work. If no human voice could be heard, He could have given a tongue to the stones to proclaim the very message he would have come to men.",
