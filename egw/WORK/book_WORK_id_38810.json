    "word": "Value of a Consistent Life. \n\n     The Lord's workers cannot be too careful that their actions do not contradict their words; for a consistent life alone can command respect. If our practise harmonizes with our teaching, our words will have effect; but a piety which is not based upon conscientious principles, is as salt without savor. To speak, and do not, is as a sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal. It is of no use for us to strive to inculcate principles which we do not conscientiously practise.",
