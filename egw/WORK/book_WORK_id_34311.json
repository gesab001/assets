    "word": "The Lord Jesus Christ is the living vine, and all who are children of God are grafted into the parent stock, drawing sap and nourishment from the one root. The branches are not blended into one, but are diverse, separate branches, yet they all live from the same root. In the words of Christ we find an important lesson which should have a more direct bearing upon the life, the motives, and the experience of those who claim to be children of God. \u201cAbide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.\u201d How essential it is that every one who claims to be a child of God should work in harmony with Christ, catching the divine illumination of His spirit, studying the manner of His labour, and working as He worked, putting self out \n23\nof sight and ever making Christ prominent. We should bring our own ways into harmony with Christ's ways, manifesting the spirit of the Master worker, that Jesus may appear in our work and in our character.",
