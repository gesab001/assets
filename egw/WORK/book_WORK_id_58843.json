    "word": "When at the General Conference in Washington, I had a conversation with you, but it seemed to have no influence upon you. You appeared to feel fully capable of managing yourself. After that conversation scene after scene passed before me in the night season, and I was then instructed that you neither had been nor could be a help to Dr. Kellogg; for you were blind in regard to his dangers and his real standing. You can not be a help to him; for you entirely misjudge his case. You consider the light given me of God regarding his position as of less value than your own judgment. You have upon your soul the guilt of confirming him in his wrong course of action, and building him upon a false foundation. You need the repentance that needeth not to be repented of; for in Dr. Kellogg's case, you have done a work that has encouraged him to resist the light given me of God for him. You are coming to be worked by the same spirit that has been working with Dr. Kellogg.",
