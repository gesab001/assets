    "word": "Chap. 4 - A Country Sanitarium\n\n     Early in the history of the Madison school, it was suggested that a sanitarium might be established on a portion of the property purchased for the school farm. In letters written to those in charge of medical missionary work in the Southern States, I pointed out the advantages that are gained by establishing a training school and a sanitarium in close proximity. These letters were written in the fall of 1904, and, a year later, the principles set forth in this correspondence were incorporated in an article, and sent to the brethren assembled in a Medical Missionary Convention at College View, Neb., Nov. 21-26, 1905.",
