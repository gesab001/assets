    "word": "Now is the time for God's people not to be in a corner, not where they have been over and over, but where their gifts are new. Brother Phillips' gift of exhortation is needed. God calls for it. He calls Brother and Sister P to shake themselves from the last and least particle of that spirit that is mentioned above, for it is against the Spirit of God. God is about to work for His people; a great work is being done. I saw that this call to the Laodicean church will affect souls. A becoming zeal is called for by God on our part. We must repent, throw away our whole feelings, feel our destitution, buy gold that we may be rich, eye salve that we may see, white raiment that we may be clothed.",
