    "word": "God's cause is now in need of the influence that protests against evil, and strives to counteract it--the influence that Christ has always demanded of His people. Let there be no delay, for the message that I am bearing is from God. While He has been calling upon His people to come out from the world, and to be separate and distinct, not touching that which is unclean, human agencies have been counterworking His work, by linking up with worldly men, cultivating the spirit of commerce, and depending on worldly lawyers and worldly methods. The Lord is sorely displeased with these men who have made themselves one with the world.",
