    "word": "The Work for the Present Time \n     I have been shown that you are in danger, in great peril, of becoming just what the enemy desire you to be--unbalanced in mind. It is not pleasant for me to speak of this by letter, but the Lord has used me to do this work, and I dare not keep silent. If I did, I should be as one who saw your danger, and lifted not up his voice to warn you.",
