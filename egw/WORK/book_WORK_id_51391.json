    "word": "Oh, I can see wisdom in thoroughly converted young men and young women engaging in the work of teaching! As they give themselves fully to God, they will learn more and more of Him, till they are \"able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.\" They say, I am the Lord's servant, the property of Christ, sustained by His rich and undeserved mercy. I am His, to glorify Him with my physical, mental, and spiritual capabilities.",
