    "word": "The Christian physician can not maintain a supreme regard for his own individuality, acting in his profession without reference to his fellow physicians, and indifferent or careless in regard to his accountability to God, or the relation he sustains to the cause at large. He should not enter upon important enterprises, such as the establishment of a sanitarium, upon his own independent judgment, pleading his desire to serve the cause of God, but in his works serving himself.",
