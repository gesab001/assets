    "word": "I feel that I cannot be thankful enough for all the precious advantages that have come to us with this property. We have an abundance of wood, and pure water is freely supplied to us from the Lord's treasure house. The buildings we can readily adapt to school work. The dining hall is large, and is well supplied with dishes, cutlery and table linens. A wide veranda extends on three sides of the house. The machinery is in good order. The furniture, though it is not fine, is substantial and in good repair, and there is an abundance of fruit canned and dried for the winter's use.",
