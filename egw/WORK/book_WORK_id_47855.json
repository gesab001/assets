If the opinions of those I love are crossed by them, so it must be; for I dare not turn to the right or to the left to express the mind of God. My life-work is too solemn a matter to be trifled with. I have learned that reproof and correction of erroneous ideas is a most serious business. The demand on any mind or soul is not that he is required to have skill or genius to create, but to have that humility that will be taught, to appreciate the care of God expressed in his behalf, and to step out of a wrong path into a right and safe path, for his own \n\n\n                                    -160- \n\nsoul's interest and for the safety of other souls who will follow him in bringing in wrong principles.",
