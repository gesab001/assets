    "word": "I am very sorry that Hiland does not come to your help. I realize your loneliness, because I have seen it, and I sympathize with you. If Hiland were with you, you could lay part of your work on him, and then you would not have to carry so heavy a burden. You need him, and he should allow nothing to prevent him from going to you and standing by your side. Do not worry that this has not yet been brought about. The word of the Lord to Hiland was that he was to go to you and help you in your work. This has been signified as his duty, and I am sure that erelong God will bring it about, for He lives and reigns. The wheel of God's providence may turn slowly, but it will turn. I may not live to see this, but I know that it will turn.",
