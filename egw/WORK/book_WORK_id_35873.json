    "word": "The victory is not won without much earnest prayer, without the humbling of self at every step. Our will is not to be forced into co-operation with divine agencies, but it must be voluntarily submitted. Were it possible to force upon you with a hundredfold greater intensity the influence of the Spirit of God, it would not make you a Christian, a fit subject for heaven. The stronghold of Satan would not be broken. The will must be placed on the side of God's will. You are not able, of yourself, to bring your purposes and desires and inclinations into submission to the will of God; but if you are \"willing to be made willing,\" God will accomplish the work for you, even \"casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.\" 2 Corinthians 10:5. Then you will \"work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which \n                                                                           143\nworketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Philippians 2:12, 13.",
