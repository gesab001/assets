    "word": "We dare not say, We must not pray for the sick. Let the voice of prayer be heard in our institutions in behalf of the sick, that they may place themselves where they can cooperate with Him who can save both soul and body. Many of those who have been Satan's willing subjects will turn to Christ, the great Healer. All need Bible teaching, line upon line, precept upon precept. Prejudice will give way, and even those who have been seducers of souls will turn to God and be saved. Educate, educate, educate, showing men and women how much relief a change in diet will bring to them. Be always kind and courteous, cheerful and hopeful. Keep praying and working for souls.--Letter 338, 1905, pp. 7, 8. (To J. H. Kellogg, December 22, 1905.)",
