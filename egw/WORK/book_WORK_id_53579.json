    "word": "This training cannot be gained merely by listening to preaching. Young men and women must be brought into our schools. They should have thorough training under experienced managers in the various lines of work. They should make the best possible use of their time in study, and put into practice the knowledge acquired. Hard study and hard work are required to make a successful preacher or a successful worker in any line. Nothing less than constant cultivation will develop the value of the gifts which God has bestowed upon them for wise improvement.",
