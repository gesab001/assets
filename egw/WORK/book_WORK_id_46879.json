    "word": "The rational thought and the right feelings and the faultless life come from the same source and are quiet and strong and sensible in their operation. To possess and enjoy the Spirit of God, there must be a conformity to the life, the actions to the will, of God; the heart must be prepared; the soul temple cleansed from defilement of self and sin. Then the power of grace comes in, and God works with His ministers.--Letter 24, 1880, p. 3. (To \"Dear Husband,\" April 17, 1880.)",
