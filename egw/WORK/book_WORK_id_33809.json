    "word": "Be sure that God has not laid upon those who remain away from these foreign fields of labor the burden of criticizing the ones on the ground where the work is being done.

I protest against the zeal that they manifest that is not according to knowledge, when they ventilate their ideas about foreign fields of labor.",
