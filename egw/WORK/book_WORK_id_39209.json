    "word": "Not for Pleasure Seekers. \nTo Our Sanitarium Workers in Southern California-- \n     I have a decided message for our people in Southern California. The Lord does not require them to provide facilities for the entertainment of tourists. The establishment of an institution for this purpose would be setting a wrong example before the Lord's people. The result would not justify the effort put forth.",
