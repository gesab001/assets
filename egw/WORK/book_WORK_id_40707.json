    "word": "The Example of Nehemiah \n\n     Letters of inquiry have come to me regarding the advisability of carrying out the plan outlined above. In answer, I would refer all to the example of Nehemiah. When about to journey to Jerusalem with the hope of restoring the walls about the stricken city of his fathers, he frankly told King Artaxerxes of the work he contemplated doing, and requested help to insure the success of the enterprise. He obtained a letter to the keeper of the king's forest in the mountains of Lebanon, directing him to furnish such timber as would be needed for the wall of Jerusalem \n\n\n                 -13- \n\nand the buildings that were to be erected. And the means which he lacked he solicited from those who were able to bestow.",
