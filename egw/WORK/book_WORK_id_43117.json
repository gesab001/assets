    "word": "Selfishness, worldly policy, and worldly principles are not consistent with Christian character. No man can live to please himself, and still enjoy the approval of God. Worldly conformity and worldly attachments are expressly forbidden in the word of God. The warning voice is lifted, \"Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\" The mighty power of the Holy Spirit is to work, producing a new character, a new birth, \"that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.\"",
