    "word": "The Lord will work through every soul that will give himself up to be worked, not only to preach but to minister to the despairing, and to inspire hope in the minds of the hopeless. We are to act our part in relieving and softening the hardships and mysteries of this life. The miseries of this life are as dark and cloudy as they were thousands of years ago. We have something to do: \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee\" [Isaiah 60:1].",
