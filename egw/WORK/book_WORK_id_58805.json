    "word": "To all his followers the Lord gives talents; and he calls upon all to work while the day lasts. For everything received from God we must render a strict account. By faithful, diligent use we are to increase our talents. God will expect a return proportionate to the amount we have received. If we have been-given five talents, he will call for the increase of five. It is by the faithful use of our talents that means are to be brought to the Lord's treasury, to supply the necessities of his ever-enlarging work.",
