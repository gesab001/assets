    "word": "If our people would feel more of a burden for the men and women in our cities who have not heard the message of salvation, if they would labor for them with determined energy, they would have less time and thought to give to tearing down what has been accomplished. God is not pleased with the way that things are shaping, and unless more is done than has been done for the cities of America, ministers and people will have a heavy account to settle with the One who has appointed to every man his work.--Letter 211, 1902, pp. 7-10. (To Sands H. Lane, December 24, 1902.)",
