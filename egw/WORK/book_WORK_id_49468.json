    "word": "Elder [E. J.] Hibbard has suggested to me that if Elder A. T. Jones were wisely labored for, he might come back into our ranks. The night after his letter came, a presentation was given to me showing me that we must be careful not to open the way for anyone to spoil the flock of God. Elder Jones has done a work that has destroyed the confidence of many of his brethren in him. He has been persistent in following out his erratic course. He has gone from place to place with falsehoods and misrepresentations, which have had to be followed up and refuted by Elder Daniells and others of our ministers. I was shown that it was by such work as this that Satan seeks to deceive, if possible, the very elect. When Elder Jones will humble himself before God and do a thorough work of repentance, there will be something for us as a people to do. But until that time shall come, it is our duty to let him alone.--Letter 224, 1908, pp. 1-4 (June 24, 1908).",
