    "word": "Oh, I am glad I have a Saviour! We must have the Holy Spirit to combine with man's human effort. We can do nothing without Christ. \"Without Me, ye can do nothing.\" \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\" (Revelation 3:20.) I am so glad that we can be partakers of the divine nature, and that through Jesus Christ we can be conquerors. This is the victory,--even your faith, feelings and good works?--Is that it? No; \"This is the victory. . . , even [your] faith.\" (1 John 5:4.)\n\n\n                                     -9-",
