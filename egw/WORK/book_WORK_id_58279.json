    "word": "This confederacy not to let the true defects of things that Captain Eldridge had not done, which he was paid for doing, was not just nor right. These things, the selfishness that led to them, was the result of his leaving the office. Had he taken the position which the Lord had given light upon as far back as Minneapolis, and acted in accordance with the light God had given and come out clear from the malarious influence that there prevailed, he would not have become so clouded and confused upon the subject of the principles God has given to control matters in the office from its very first establishment. I did not separate myself from Frank, but he separated himself from me and from his God and the result was worked out in his leaving the office. This course of selfishness was brought in through discarding the word of the Lord for human propositions, which had their origin in selfishness and duplicity. This matter is not as it should be now and as it will appear before the universe of heaven, as entirely contrary to the example and character of the work of Christ. There needs to be a cleansing of the soul temple that has been and still is defiled. \n                                                                           1515\nGod will not trifled with. A spirit is and has been at work to make of none effect the voice of reproof and warnings. Those whom we would suppose would not enter into this kind of working to evade the truth, and not to work the line in correct principles, are sowing seeds of doubt and will reap the harvest.",
