    "word": "A man who has the true idea of what constitutes perfection of character will reveal the same fruit which he desires to see in others. He will by precept and example give evidence that he is endowed with a kindly, genial disposition, imbued with refinement and tenderness. He will have the finest touch in seeking to cure the wounds and bruises of the soul. He will be a co-worker with Christ and His Holy Spirit to renew and strengthen, to beautify and bring into conformity to the perfect model.--Letter 78, 1893, p. 2. (To E. J. Waggoner, January 22, 1893.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. May 3, 1979",
