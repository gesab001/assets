    "word": "When trials come to us; when we can see before us, not an increase of prosperity, but a pressure necessitating sacrifice on the part of all, how shall we receive Satan\u2019s insinuation that we are to have a very hard time? If we listen to his suggestions, unbelief in God will spring up. . . . We should look at the work He has done, the reforms He has wrought. We should gather up the evidences of Heaven\u2019s blessings, the tokens for good, saying: \u201cLord, we believe in Thee, in Thy servants, and in Thy work.\u201d\u2014Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, pp. 210, 211.",
