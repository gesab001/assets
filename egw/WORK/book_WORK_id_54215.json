    "word": "Our salvation is not in our own keeping. It has been placed in the hands of our Mediator. We are safe only while we keep a firm hold on the unerring Guide. Our success is sure if we do not weave our natural inclinations into the doing of God's work. When we bring self into our efforts, our feelings are stirred upon the least provocation, and we speak and act with an authority that God does not design His children to exercise toward one another.",
