    "word": "The Lord does not move upon His workers to make them take a course which will bring on the time of trouble before the time. Let them not build up a wall of separation between themselves and the world by advancing their own ideas and notions. There is now altogether too much of this throughout our borders. The message of warning has not reached large numbers of the world in the very cities that are right at hand, and to number Israel is not to work after God's order. There is abundance of earnest work in cities that have not been worked. Let your pen and voice work to enlighten these souls in simple, stirring articles upon faith and love.",
