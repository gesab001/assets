    "word": "There is a matter about which I wish to speak to you. Sometimes you speak words to one another in the presence of others that are not wise. You adopt a little tantalizing way with one another, and speak words that will not provoke to love and good works. You mean no harm by this, but it is something that will not always be understood by those who hear it. I advise you to break this habit.",
