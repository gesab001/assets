    "word": "Bro. Gage came up from his sickness; but how little did he or his family feel humbled under the hand of God. The work of the Spirit of God, and wisdom from him, are not manifested that we may be happy and satisfied with ourselves, but that our souls may be renewed in knowledge and true holiness. How much better would it have been for Bro. Gage if his affliction had prompted to faithful searching of heart, to discover the imperfections in his character, that he might put them away, and with humble spirit come forth from the furnace as gold purified, reflecting the image of Christ.",
