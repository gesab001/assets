    "word": "Religious Activities Should Not Supersede Care of Family.--If you ignore your duty as a wife and mother and hold out your hands for the Lord to put another class of work in them, be sure that He will not contradict Himself; He points you to the duty you have to do at home.

But be sure that those who are neglectful of their duty in the home circle are not prepared to work for other souls.",
