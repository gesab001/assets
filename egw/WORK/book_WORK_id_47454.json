    "word": "Recently letters have come to me asking if I have condemned Elder Haskell and encouraged Elder Franke in the work that he has been doing against Elder Haskell. No, Indeed! The light that has been given me is that Elder Haskell was not sustained by his brethren as he should have been during his labors in New York. It is the Lord's will that when His servants shall go into fields as difficult as New York, that they shall receive encouragement and help for the doing of that which needs to be done.--Letter 203, 1904, pp. 1-3. (To Elder E. E. Franke, October 1, 1903.)",
