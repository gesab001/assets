    "word": "Be Compassionate and Sympathetic.--Let us seek to understand how to reach the people. There is no better way to do this than to be compassionate and sympathetic. If you know of those who are sick and in need of assistance, help them, try to relieve them in their distress. As you do this work, the power of the Lord will speak through it to the soul. --General Conference Bulletin, April 23, 1901.",
