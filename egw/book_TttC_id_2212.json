    "word": "Why the Christian life is so difficult to many is that they have a divided heart. They are double-minded, which makes them unstable in all their ways. Were they richly imbued with Christian zeal, which is ever the result of consecration to God, instead of the mournful cry, \"My leanness, my leanness,\" the language of the soul would be: \"Hear what the Lord has done for me.\" Even if you are saved, which is very doubtful, in the course you are pursuing, how limited will be the good you have accomplished. Not a soul will be saved by your instrumentality. Will the Master say to you: \"Well \n                                                                           235\ndone, thou good and faithful servant\"? What have you been doing faithfully? Hard work in the business and cares of this life. Will this bring from the lips of Christ the gracious words: \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant\"?",
