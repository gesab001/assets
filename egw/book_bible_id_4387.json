{"word": "If the eye is single, if it is directed heavenward, the light of heaven will fill the soul, and earthly things will appear insignificant and uninviting. The purpose of the heart will be changed, and the admonition of Jesus will be heeded. You will lay up your treasure in heaven. Your thoughts will be fixed upon the great reward of eternity. All your plans will be made in reference to the future, immortal life. You will be drawn toward your treasure. You will not study your worldly interest, but in all your pursuits the silent inquiry will be, \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" (Acts 9:6). Bible religion will be woven into your daily life.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 222}
