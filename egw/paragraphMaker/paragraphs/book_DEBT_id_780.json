    "word": "In your letter you complain of the yoke of debt. But there is no excuse for your being in debt. If you would be led by the Lord, you would not incur debt, but, led by the devil, you will draw money from the treasury which is needed to forward the work in its various branches. You should not trust yourself in managing business which will place money in your power to handle. Why? Because you distress others. Your freedom in borrowing, with no reason to suppose that you will be in a position to repay it, is doing great injustice to others, robbing them of their little all, and bringing reproach upon the cause of God. If you realized what you were doing at the time of your action, you would stop. You would see the sinfulness of robbing men, believers or unbelievers, and bringing them into strait places in order to relieve your present necessities.",
