    "word": "By earnest prayer and diligent effort we are to obtain a fitness for speaking. This fitness includes uttering every syllable clearly, placing the force and emphasis where it belongs. Speak slowly. Many speak rapidly, hurrying one word after another so fast that the effect of what they say is lost. Into what you say put the spirit and life of Christ. . . . To those who hear, the gospel is made the power of God unto salvation. Present the gospel in its simplicity.--Counsels to Teachers, pp. 253-255. (1913)",
