    "word": "The time was to come when Jesus should redeem the possession of Satan by giving his own life, and after a season, all in Heaven and earth should submit to him. He was steadfast. He chose this life of suffering, this ignominious death, and, in the way appointed by his Father, to become a lawful ruler of the kingdoms of the earth, and have them given into his hands as an everlasting possession. Satan also will be given into his hands to be destroyed by death, never more to annoy Jesus nor the saints in glory. \n                                                                           54",
