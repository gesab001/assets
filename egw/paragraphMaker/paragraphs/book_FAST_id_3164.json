    "word": "We regret that those who should be a strength to you in your efforts to overcome your love of self, your pride of heart, your vanity, and love of the approbation of worldlings, have only been a hindrance, by their own lack of spirituality and true godliness. We cannot tell you how much we regret that those who should be self-denying Christians are so far from coming up to the standard. Those who should be steadfast, abounding in the work of God, are weakened by Satan, because they remain at such a distance from God. They obtain not the power of his grace, through which they might overcome the infirmities of their nature, and, by obtaining signal victories in God, show those of weaker faith the way, and the truth, and the life. It has been that which has caused us the greatest discouragement, to see those in B. C. who have had years of experience in the cause and work of God, shorn of their strength, by their own unfaithfulness. They are outgeneraled by the enemy in nearly every attack. God would have made these persons strong, like faithful sentinels at their post, to guard the fort, had they walked in the light he had given them, and remained steadfast to duty, seeking to know and do the whole will of God. Satan will, I have no doubt, through his delusions, deceive these delinquent souls, and make them believe they are, after all, about right. They have \n                                                                           9\ncommitted no grievous, outbreaking sins, and they must, after all, be on the true foundation, and God will accept their works. They do not see that they have especial sins to repent of. And they see no sins which call for especial humiliation, humble confession, and rending of heart.",
