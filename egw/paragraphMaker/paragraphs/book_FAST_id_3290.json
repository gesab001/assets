    "word": "(Greenville,) Tuesday, Jan. 28, 1868. Brother Corliss helped me prepare breakfast. Everything we touched was frozen. All things in our cellar were frozen. We prepared frozen turnips and potatoes. After prayers Brother Corliss went into the woods . . . to get wood. . . . I baked eight pans of gems, swept rooms, washed dishes, helped Willie put snow in boiler, which requires many tubsful. We have no well water or cistern. . . . Got dinner for Willie and me. Just as we got through my husband and Brother Andrews drove up. Had had no dinner. I started cooking again. Soon got them something to eat. Nearly all day has thus been spent--not a line written. I feel sad about this. Am exceedingly weary.--Ms 12, 1868",
