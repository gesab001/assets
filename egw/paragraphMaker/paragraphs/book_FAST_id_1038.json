    "word": "Just before his crucifixion, Jesus prayed for his disciples, \u201cSanctify them through Thy truth; thy word is truth.\u201d It is the duty of every one to search the Scriptures for himself. We cannot accept the assertions of men as infallible. To those who oppose and denounce our faith we say, Show us from the Bible that we are in error. God's word is to judge us at the last day, and we want to know what saith the Scripture. We are regarded with jealousy and bitterness because we will not accept as evidence the assertions of men and the testimony of the Fathers; but we cannot purchase peace and unity by sacrificing the truth. The conflict may be long and painful, but at any cost we must hold fast the word of God. \u201cThe Bible, and the Bible only,\u201d must be our watchword.",
