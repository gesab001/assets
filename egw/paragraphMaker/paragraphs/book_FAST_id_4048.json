We are to know more than we do at the present time. We are to comprehend the deep things of God. There are themes to be dwelt upon which are worthy of more than a passing notice. Angels have desired to look into the truths which are revealed to the people who are searching God's word and with contrite hearts praying for wisdom, for greater lengths and breadths and heights of that knowledge which God alone can give.",
