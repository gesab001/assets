    "word": "Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and Thou takest no knowledge?\u201d Here the complaint comes not against themselves, but against God. Listen to the answer: \u201cBehold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labors. Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness; ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?\u201d",
