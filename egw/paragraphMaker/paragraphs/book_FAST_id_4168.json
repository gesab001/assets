    "word": "I have been shown that there is a great want of personal piety among the workers in the office, nearly every one of them, and that their unsanctified wisdom is a result of a lack of connection with God. They take very little time to seek God's counsel with humble contrition of soul, with earnest searching of heart; self-sufficient they walk in the sparks of their own kindling. The spiritual atmosphere which surrounds their soul, does not make manifest that they have constant reliance upon God. The most sacred truths are fast losing their preciousness and sanctity to them, because they do not have a full connection with God, and receive the things that be of God. Unless the converting power of God shall be felt upon the hearts and characters of men in positions of trust, they will not, cannot, be one with Christ, keeping the way of the Lord, but like the Pharisees in the days of Christ, they will teach the doctrines and commandments of men, and the Lord will have no more use for them. They cannot be laborers together with God, while they keep the spirit that has actuated them in the past. They have felt but little respect for those who have stood under the direction of God in seeking counsel from him who is mighty in wisdom, in founding and building up his great work in the earth. The consecration, the vital piety, the humility which God requires, does not exist among them. Self is exalted, and Jesus is not glorified. Jesus, the blessed and only potentate between God and man, is not working with them. Satan's insinuations are credited, and plain commands of God in regard to mercy and tender compassion are ignored. Those who are handling sacred truths in the publishing work or in any branch of the cause of God, are invited of God to put forth their highest mental and moral energies, to study continually, in their business line, not the will of men, but the will of God.",
