    "word": "In the mountains, Colorado, Monday, September 22, 1873. It is a beautiful day. Willie started over the Range today to either get supplies or get the axletree of the wagon Walling is making. We cannot either move on or return to our home at the Mills without our wagon is repaired. There is very poor feed for the horses. Their grain is being used up. The nights are cold. Our stock of provisions is fast decreasing. We have had precious seasons of prayer today. The comfort of the Holy Spirit is with us in a measure, but our souls still cry out for God. We must have more close and constant communion with our Redeemer. Without the light of His love we are indeed in a cold, cheerless world. Nothing can give us happiness. With His love the most dreary desert is a paradise.",
