    "word": "Those who have failed of conforming their life practise to right principles can not do this work. They need to be thoroughly converted. Those who become so confused as to engage in sanitarium work for selfish profit will not be prospered in their spiritual life, and will be unable properly to influence others aright. Let those who have a desire to benefit self and to make self prominent, take up a work that does not involve the cause of God so much as does the establishment of sanitariums. God is not glorified by those who attempt to go faster than He leads. Perplexity, embarrassment, and distress, is the result of acting without due consideration and counsel. The Lord does not desire His representatives to make mistakes.",
