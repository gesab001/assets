    "word": "Dr. Russell should close the door of his mind against the first intimation of unbelief. He doubts the sacred truths of the Bible, and he has no real faith in the testimonies.

If he desires his faith to increase, he must cease talking his doubts; for when he does this, Satan comes close to him, and throws his darkness around him.",
