    "word": "It has seemed really discouraging at first to see how hard it was for some to give up their dependence on their own merits. But as minds were fastened upon the truth presented we were hopeful that the palsy of unbelief which paralyzes all the powers of mind and soul would be broken, and that the words so fitly spoken would not be to the hearer as idle tales. Jesus spoke of those who heard Him, having ears but hearing not, having eyes but seeing not, lest they should be converted and He should heal them. Attentive hearing, with desire to know the truth, will be the opening of the understanding that the soul may really have possession of the truth, that it may be sanctified through the truth. The individual soul must itself accept the truth which the Lord has sent through His messenger to him. You accept the gracious words and thus show honor to God who has sent you a message in love.",
