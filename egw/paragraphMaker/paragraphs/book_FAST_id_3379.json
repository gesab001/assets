    "word": "When the Father gave His Son to live and die for man, he placed all the treasure of heaven at our disposal. There is no excuse for sin. God has given us all the advantages he could possibly give, that we may have strength to withstand the temptations of the enemy. Had man, when tested and tried, followed the example of Christ, he would have given his children and his children's children an example of steadfast purity and righteousness, and the race would not have deteriorated, but improved.",
