    "word": "\"Moreover when ye fast\" - now here is special directions for us: \"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance, for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily, I say unto you, They have their reward.\" It is all they will get. They won't get anything more. What they want is the very spirit of the prayer that they offer, to take it in and let that prayer be carried out in their daily life. \"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face: That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.\" What does Sister White read all this for? you say. Because we have lessons to learn that we have not yet learned. \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" These are lessons that every one of us want to understand and become intelligently upon.",
