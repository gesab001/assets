    "word": "Now we are taking down the trees nigh the house. Most of them run up about one hundred feet--eighty feet, most of them, without one branch. Then there is a branching out at the top and the top is quite heavy. When the wind blows they are often uprooted. We did not want to take out these trees altogether, so Brother Connell puts a rope around his body and after fastening a long ladder about the tree firmly, climbs the ladder, then climbs the straight, smooth trunk until he reaches a limb. Then he ties a rope firmly about the tree above the first limb, goes down again to the top of the ladder, and commences to chip the tree with a hatchet he has fastened in the rope about his waist. When he supposes the tree is cut enough, he goes down and the rope is securely fastened low around a strong tree. Then several lay hold of the rope, and down comes the tall top, leaving a pole--the trunk--about thirty feet high. This will soon put out new branches, low, which will give shade without any danger from the high, heavy top. Seven trees went down yesterday, several Wednesday, and several Tuesday, so we are making everything safe about the house and tents. The orange gum is a very strange-looking tree--all knotted up, gnarled about in every contorted shape. These trees are hollowed by the ants, and on a hot day down come large limbs, perhaps half the tree. Heat or wind break off the limbs and they are dangerous, so these must go, I suppose, but their foliage is very pretty.",
