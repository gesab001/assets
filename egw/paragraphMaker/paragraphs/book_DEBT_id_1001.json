    "word": "In regard to the school work, God does not want it to die, but live. But actions directly contrary to a plain \"Thus saith the Lord\" have been taken. The indebtedness of the school work has been increased by the erection of buildings in places where there were already buildings enough. The reason given for the erection of these buildings were not sound. The money thus used should have been invested in the erection of schools in new localities, thus distributing the light and gathering in a class of students who would not otherwise be reached. The knowledge of the truth should have been extended to places where there are no memorials to tell what truth is.",
