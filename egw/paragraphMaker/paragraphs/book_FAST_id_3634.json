    "word": "In regard to steel springs, I have worn two in my skirts or cords always. Before coming to Colorado, I asked someone to buy me two steel springs to run in my skirt. In the place of doing this, they bought four steel springs fastened with tapes, skeleton fashion. I have worn it a few times, but it is not what I wanted and what I like. I do not wear it, though I consider there is no harm in this for anyone to wear. In my view of the wrong of hooped skirts, it was the deformity and the indecency of their appearance when they were worn so large, that was objectionable. There is nothing indecent or unbecoming in the small hoops or in the steel springs, two of them run into a skirt.",
