    "word": "Sister Dr. Caro, a dentist, came from Napier, a ten hours' journey on the cars, to Wellington to extract my teeth, to prepare the way for an underset of teeth which I greatly needed. There was a minister on the cars \n\n\n                                     -4- \n\nfrom Ormondville, where Brother McCullagh is laboring, and who opposed him fiercely. He was in conversation with a minister from Wellington, and they were comparing notes. One said that McCullagh was doing much harm in Ormondville, but he thought that he had thoroughly settled the business with him. The minister from Wellington said that there had been a Mrs. Starr and a Mrs. White in Wellington trying to fasten their heresies upon the people. But they warned their congregations not to go in to hear. Well, said the minister from Ordmondville, \"I heard they had no success in Wellington.\" And the reply was, \"No, but we find the minds of the people are unsettled, and they managed to get the people uneasy, and they are plying us with questions hard to be answered.\"",
