    "word": "From everyone God demands perfect obedience. Of himself, man cannot obey God's law. Never could he have paid the debt incurred by transgression. The Redeemer came to the world to bring man power to obey. He came in human nature that He might know the temptations and trials to which man is subjected. He who accepts Christ as a personal Saviour will receive divine aid in the struggle against sin. Through the merits of the Saviour he will become an obedient subject of God's kingdom. In the strength of Christ he will overcome every temptation of the enemy.",
