    "word": "Paul declared that he kept his body under, lest after he had preached to others, he himself should be a castaway. Those who in ancient times ran for a prize realized the importance of temperate habits, and how much more should we, who are running a race for a heavenly crown. We should put forth every effort to overcome evil. Christ came to set us an example of how to overcome. He endured a fast of forty days, and he has made it possible for man to overcome on the point of appetite. The battle is before us. We must fight valiantly. If we are successful, we shall one day realize the fulfillment of the promise, \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on His throne.\"",
