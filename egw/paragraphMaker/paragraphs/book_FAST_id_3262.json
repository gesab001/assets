    "word": "July 8, 1887. Left London in company with Brother and Sister Ings for Southampton, on fast train. I lay down most of the way and slept some. We were about two hours and a half reaching Southampton. We met Sister Phipson and took dinner with her. She lives in a good-sized, hired apartment and her mother lives with her. . . . Elder Haskell came on a later train. He spoke Friday evening in the hall hired for meetings.",
