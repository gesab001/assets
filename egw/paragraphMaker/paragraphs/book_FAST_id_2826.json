    "word": "\u201cConfess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,\u201d that ye may be healed of all spiritual infirmities, that sinful dispositions may be changed. Make diligent work for eternity. Pray most earnestly to the Lord, and hold fast to the faith. Trust not in the arm of flesh, but trust implicitly in the Lord\u2019s guidance. Let each one now say, \u201cAs for me, I will come out, and be separate from the world. I will serve the Lord with full purpose of heart.\u201d\u2014Review and Herald, Nov. 8, 1906.",
