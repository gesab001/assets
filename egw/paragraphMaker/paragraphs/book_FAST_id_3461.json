    "word": "But should I attend your meetings, I remember I am fifty-six years old, instead of twenty-five or thirty-five, and no provision is made for me to rest, but to rush from one [camp meeting] to the other as fast as the cars will take me. I do not think your plans very flattering to me. I am not immortal yet, and have cause to remember this every day of my life. If you wish to finish me up this year, I think you have planned excellently for it. I think my best course is to remain in California and not trust myself to your mercies.--Letter 21, 1884, p. 1.
