    "word": "In all our work we need to keep the glory of God in view. The Word of God is our guide. Let this testimony go forth as the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. Let us talk faith, and walk by faith. O what a work is ours, what a privilege, so to speak and so to act as to fasten conviction on the hearts and consciences of men. The Holy Spirit grants us His guidance in this work, and success comes when we have a strict regard for the fear of God. He is the Searcher of hearts, and He gives us the encouragement that, if we will become intelligent in our service for God and will walk humbly in the light He has graciously given, we will not be left to labor in human strength.",
