    "word": "Friday, Jan. 10, 1868. Awoke in the morning on board the sleeping car. Found the train behind time about two hours. It had been a keen, cold, night and the train had to move very slowly for safety of passengers. Took our breakfast about eight o'clock. Changed from sleeping car to one ahead. The sleeping car was pronounced unsafe. We were delayed two hours on the track by a broken-down car ahead. Missed connection at Detroit. Waited there two hours. Had a weary ride until midnight. . . . Found friend with team waiting for us.",
