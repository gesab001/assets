    "word": "Now, my dear brother, I have had matters opened to me in regard to many things that have occurred at the institution at Crystal Springs. Think you that your brother by relationship would have disregarded all the cautions and admonitions the Lord has been pleased to give if you had shown that you respected the testimonies God has given to be a help and blessing to you? Would he have taken the independent course he has, disregarding the counsel of the board, and following his own mind, as he has done, and making the debt larger, if your ideas had not been so thoroughly made known, so that they had a leavening influence upon him? There has been a lack of wisdom in centering in one institution so many members of one family, and the result of this has left its impression upon the institution already loaded down with debt. If its management is left with you, or with your brother, debts will increase, buildings will be created, and the institution will certainly suffer.",
