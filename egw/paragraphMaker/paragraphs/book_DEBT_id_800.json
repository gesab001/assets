    "word": "The very highest kind of education you could give is to shun debt as you would shun disease. For Christ's sake, as the chosen people of God, call yourselves to task, and inaugurate a different system in the school. This is to be your education as churches in every place. As church schools have been established, the best education the people of God can have is to learn how to conduct their school on a basis of financial success. If this cannot be done, close the school until a plan can be devised to carry it on, with the help of God, without the blot of debt upon it.",
