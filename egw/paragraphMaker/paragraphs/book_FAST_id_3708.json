    "word": "The young man who makes the Bible his guide need not mistake the path of duty and safety. That blessed Book will teach him to preserve his integrity of character, to be truthful, and to practice no deception. \"Thou shalt not steal\" was written by the finger of God upon the tables of stone, yet how much underhanded stealing of affections is done and excused by finite beings! A deceptive courtship is maintained, private communications are kept up, until the affections of the daughter, who is inexperienced and knows not whereunto these things may grow, are fastened upon the one who shows by the very course he pursues that he is unworthy of her love.",
