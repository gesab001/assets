    "word": "My sister, you and your husband need at this time the words spoken to the church in Sardis: \"These things saith He that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars, I know thy works. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember how thou hast received and heard; and hold fast, and repent. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments. And they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life; but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.\" It means very much to every soul at this time, what stand they shall take toward the work of God.",
