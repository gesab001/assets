    "word": "The situation is this: There have been some extremely heavy burdens for some of us to bear in Southern California, and apparently but few to bear the burdens. It is all too true that we have not trusted the Lord enough to bear our burdens. I am not here to speak of these burdens, but I want to have an understanding as to just what to do, and what not to do. Now, of course, we have had, as you know, several heavy burdens to bear down there. The matter about our going into debt, was practically the only thing that has been between Brother Burden and me. The only material difference of opinion was about the matter of going into debt at Loma Linda after we took over the property; and I felt as if I was strengthened by almost everybody in the Conference, and in the Union Conference as well, in trying to prevent a heavy debt coming; and I really thought, Sister White, I was strengthened, too, by your writings along that line.",
