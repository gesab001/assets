    "word": "In the days of Christ the established teachers instructed men in the traditions of the fathers, in childish fables, mingled with the opinions of those who they thought were high authorities. Yet neither high nor low could discern any ray of light in their teaching. What wonder was it that crowds followed in the footsteps of the Lord, and gave him homage as they listened to his words! He revealed truths that had been buried under the rubbish of error, and he freed them from the exactions and traditions of men, and bade them stand fast forever. He rescued truth from its obscurity, and set it in its proper framework, to shine in its original luster. He addressed men in his own name; for authority was vested in himself, and why should men, professing to be his followers, not speak with authority concerning subjects on which he has given light? Why take inferior sources of instruction when Christ is the great Teacher who knows all things? Why  present inferior authors to the attention of students, when he whose words are spirit and life invites, \"Come, . . . and learn of me\"? [Matthew 11:28, 29.]",
