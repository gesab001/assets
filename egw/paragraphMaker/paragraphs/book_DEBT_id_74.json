    "word": "Some think it beneath their dignity to look after small things. They think it the evidence of a narrow mind and a niggardly spirit. But small leaks have sunk many a ship.

Although much money may be received, it will be lost in the little wastes of every branch of the work. Economy is not stinginess.",
