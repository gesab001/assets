    "word": "Christmas morning we all took breakfast together--James Cornell; Florence and Clara, their two girls; Brother and Sister Moore and their three children; Sister Bahler and Etta, a girl living with them; and Sister Daniells, our cook, Father, and myself. We had a quarter of venison cooked, \n\n\n                                    -319- \n\nand stuffing. It was as tender as a chicken. We all enjoyed it very much. There is plenty of venison in market.",
