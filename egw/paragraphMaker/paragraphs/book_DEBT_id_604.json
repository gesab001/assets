    "word": "Talk not words of censure. Lay not the blame upon this one or that one. It is a fact that there is now need of the help which all can bring to heal the breach that has been made. Do it cheerfully. Do it nobly. Come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Redeem at once the institution that is in great peril. This can be done if all will take hold interestedly, and redeem this heavily debt-burdened institution; and in doing this the blessing of the Lord will be upon you. It can be done; and in the name of the Lord lay hold of it. Let all work with courage and with cheerfulness and with joy, and this very work will prove a great blessing in the experience of all who lay hold of it and carry it through successfully.",
