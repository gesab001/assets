    "word": "Satan will use his best plans to lead souls to bring in some new theories, some strange, fanciful ideas. These souls will try to substantiate false doctrines, and they will take texts of Scripture and misapply them in order to make their doctrines appear as truth. The theories that Elder Ballenger advocated, which remove the sanctuary truth, are just such as the enemy would bring in as matters of the utmost importance, to shake us from our foundation of faith. But we must heed the word, \"Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast.\" When efforts are made to unsettle our faith in our past experience and to send us adrift, let us hold fast to the truth that we have received.",
