    "word": "I would say to my fellow laborers. The Lord would have us obtain new experiences, a growth in grace and in the knowledge of God, by using for the Master the gifts we have. We are dependent upon Christ for spiritual food and vitality. It is only by feeding upon Christ that we can have sanctification and power, that we can know Christ and be a faithful co-worker with God. Let no man become your substitute. Christ is your substitute. Go to Him who has taken you under his charge. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price.\" All you have in mental, physical, and spiritual capacities comes from God, and you are to render to him perfect service in every line, holding fast the Lord Jesus Christ. This is our availing power for the purity of the soul. This will cleanse and purify us, day by day and hour by hour.",
