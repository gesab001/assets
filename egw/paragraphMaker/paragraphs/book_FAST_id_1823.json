    "word": "Opinions and Practices to Be Conformed to God's Word.--There are many who claim that they have been sanctified to God, and yet when the great standard of righteousness is presented to them they become greatly excited and manifest a spirit which proves that they know nothing of what it means to be sanctified. They have not the mind of Christ; for those who are truly sanctified will reverence and obey the Word of God as fast as it is opened to them, and they will express a strong desire to know what is truth on every point of doctrine. An exultant feeling is no evidence of sanctification. The assertion, \"I am saved, I am saved,\" does not prove that the soul is saved or sanctified. \n                                                                           204",
