    "word": "The Benefits of Schools in the Country--It seems strange to everybody that we should be located in the woods. But we do not want our students to be near the city. We know that even though we bring them into the country we cannot escape from all evil. We have a public house [saloon] here, and not long ago a man left this public house drunk. As he was crossing a bridge he fell from his horse and was killed. But in the country the youth are away from the sights and the sounds of the city. We desire to take the students away from the foul atmosphere of the city. Not that Satan is not here. He is here, but we are trying to do all we can to place the students in the very best circumstance in order that they may fasten their eyes on Christ. . . . \n\n\n                                    -159-",
