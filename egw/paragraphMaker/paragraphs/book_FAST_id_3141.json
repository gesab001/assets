    "word": "Reaching a High Standard \n\n     In becoming a follower of Christ, you need not think it necessary to give up all aspirations to reach a high standard. But if your ambitions have been selfish, and you have sought for the supremacy, and aimed at the glorification of yourself, all this will be changed, and your desire will be to become a diligent, earnest, faithful soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ. The elements of character which lead you to seek for distinction in a worldly life, Jesus will refine and purify and make steadfast, that you may with unselfish purpose seek to become a true coworker with the Majesty of heaven. A holy ambition will take possession of your heart, worthy of the object for which your ability was given. You will have respect to the recompense of the reward that has been purchased for you by the self-denial, the self-sacrifice of the Lord Jesus. . . . \n                                                                           59",
