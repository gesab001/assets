    "word": "The Lord wishes us to exercise faith at every step. He wants us to manifest a faith in His working. Let us trust Him, and seek to work in harmony with His providence. I am confident that the Lord has wrought for us, and that if we will conduct our school in the fear of God, there will never again be upon it such a debt as exists at present. We have determined that the past experience shall not be repeated.",
