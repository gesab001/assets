    "word": "There are young men here who might become successful missionary workers, and to whom Christ says, \u201cGo work today in my vineyard.\u201d Do not, young friends, rob God by withholding from him your time or your talents. Do not be satisfied with reaching a low standard. There are heights of knowledge to which you may attain. The adversary of souls will work through his \n153\nagents to turn you from the path of right. He will present before you many and great temptations; but at such times remember Joseph. When tempted, he said, \u201cHow can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\u201d For his steadfastness to principle he was unjustly cast into prison. By this he was humbled, but not degraded; and, continuing to live in the fear of God, he forgot his troubles in ministering to the wants of his suffering companions.",
