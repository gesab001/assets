    "word": "MR No. 688 - What We Must Do to Receive the \"Well Done\"\n\n     You have but a little time. The judgment is to sit, the books to be opened, and every man to be judged according to what is written in the book, and how stands the record? Have you been trying to maintain a dignity? Have you been trying to fasten the attention of people on you? Or have you been seeking to follow Jesus, to walk before Him in similitude of mind? Have you felt that God has given you talents of importance, and those talents are not to remain just as He gave them to you? They are to be improved.",
