    "word": "The signs which show that Christ's coming is near are fast fulfilling. The Lord calls upon our youth to labor as canvassers and evangelists, to do house-to-house work in places where the truth has not yet been proclaimed. He speaks to our young men, saying, \"Know ye not that . . . ye are not your own? for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. Those who go forth into the work under the Master's direction will be wonderfully blessed.",
