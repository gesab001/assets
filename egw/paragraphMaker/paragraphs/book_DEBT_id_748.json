    "word": "Our college that was in Battle Creek for so many years has been moved to Berrien Springs, a beautiful Michigan town about a hundred miles west of Battle Creek. This school was deeply in debt, and for a time the managers did not know how they could move the school away from Battle Creek; but through the sale of Christ's Object Lessons, this was made possible. They have succeeded in paying a large portion of the debt already, and they hope soon to be free.--Letter 133, 1903, p. 3. (To Mary Foss, August 10, 1902.)",
