    "word": "I saw that it was highly important for those who preach the truth to be refined in their manners. They should shun oddities and eccentricities, and present the truth in its purity and clearness. I was referred to Titus, i, 9. \"Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine to exhort and convince the gainsayers.\" In verse 16 Paul speaks of a class who profess that they know God, but in works deny him, \"and unto every good work are reprobate.\" He then exhorts Titus, \"But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: \n                                                                           156\nthat the aged men may be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded. In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works. In doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.\" This instruction is written for the benefit of all whom God has called to preach the word, and also for the benefit of his people who hear the word.",
