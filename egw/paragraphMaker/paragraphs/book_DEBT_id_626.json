This will be appreciated where means are difficult to obtain. They will reveal that missionaries can become educators in teaching them how to labor.

And wherever they go, all that they have gained in this line will give them standing-room. If the light God has given were cherished, students would leave our schools free from the burden of debt.\" \n                                                                           33",
