    "word": "In the days of Christ, under the guise of the perverse and most rigorous devotion to the forms and the traditions of that which they claimed to be the Mosaic system, the real [meaning of] the precious ceremonies proceeding from God had become obscured. The spiritual and eternal import of the truth in regard to the work and mission of Jesus Christ to our world, prefigured in the sacrificial offerings, became mixed and mingled with the false theories of men. These false theories were the great barriers to the correct understanding of doctrines, and to practical piety. They clung to the type, the shadow, rejecting the antitype and the substance. The deceiving power of Satan wrought upon unconsecrated minds to fasten them in blind suppositions. Their incorrect interpretations fastened them hopelessly in error, because the real, true light shining upon their way was accounted as something they must resist, since it did not substantiate their own ideas and interpretations of the Scriptures. \n                                                                           840",
