    "word": "\"And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all I possess\" [Luke 18:9-12]. Mark you, it was the self-righteous Pharisee who was not in a position of humility and reverence before God; but standing in his haughty self-sufficiency, he told the Lord all his good deeds. \"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself\" [verse 11]; and his prayer reached no higher than himself.",
