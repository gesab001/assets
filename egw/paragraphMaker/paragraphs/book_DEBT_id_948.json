    "word": "I dare not advise you in such large plans as you propose; you need to make the Lord your wisdom in these matters.

I would caution you against gathering a large load of indebtedness. There is the food factory to be completed and set in operation. I call your attention to this enterprise that you may not lay more plans than you can well carry out.",
