    "word": "2. Nature.--\"As fast as their minds can comprehend it, the parents should open before them [their children] God's great book of nature. The mother . . . should find time to cultivate, in herself and in her children, a love for the beautiful buds and opening flowers. By calling the attention of her children to their different colors and variety of forms, she can make them acquainted with God, who made all the beautiful things which attract and delight them. . . . These lessons, imprinted upon the minds of young children amid the pleasant, attractive scenes of nature, will not be soon forgotten.\"--Test., Vol. III, p. 137. (See also C. Ed., pp. 8, 9.)",
