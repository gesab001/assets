    "word": "It is displeasing to God for our churches to be burdened with debt. \"The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Haggai 2:8.

When the people chosen by God embellish their own houses and invest His money in selfish gratification, leaving His cause to languish, they cannot be blessed. \n                                                                           103",
