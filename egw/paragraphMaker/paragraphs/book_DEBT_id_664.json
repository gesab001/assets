    "word": "Economy and Indebtedness. \n\n     11. In order to relieve the office from financial embarrassment, there must be in some respects a different course pursued. In the effort to secure outside patronage, prices have been set so low that the work brings no profit to the office. Those who flatter themselves that there is a gain, have failed to keep a strict account of every outgo. This has been the way things have been going for too many years. If work is brought in, let it be understood that there is to be cutting down prices for the sake of securing the job. Maintain the dignity of the office. Take only such work as will give a margin of profit. If necessary, dismiss some of the workers that you can better spare, and save the wages you pay them. The office needs weeding. There are more overseers than it can afford to sustain.",
