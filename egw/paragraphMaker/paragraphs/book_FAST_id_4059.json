    "word": "Word of Caution \n\n     I am instructed to charge parents to take heed, to keep their children guarded and away from Battle Creek. And let all take heed how they hear. Many things are reported in regard to Sister White. Some say one thing, and some say another. There are those who say that Sister White does not object to our having a college in Battle Creek.
