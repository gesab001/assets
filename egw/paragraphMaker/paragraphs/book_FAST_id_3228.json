    "word": "The students in all our schools should be encouraged to canvass for \"Object Lessons.\" Let them go forth in faith, believing God's promise, and doing their best, and God will give them success. They may meet with difficulties, but let them tell the Lord about it, and then by faith keep a firm hold on the promised blessing. Let them labor hopefully, cheerfully, perseveringly, for the circulation of the book that the Lord bade me give to our schools. Thus they will gain a preparation to canvass for our larger books. Let those who have had no experience in the canvassing work take this book to those who are not acquainted with the truth for this time, and speak to them of the helpful lessons that it contains. But before they take up this work, let them by earnest prayer obtain a blessing from heaven, and hold it fast by faith. Let them be sure that they carry with them the fragrant influence of the life of Christ.",
