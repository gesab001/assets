    "word": "The eye of Jesus, looking down the ages, was fixed upon our time when He said, \"If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!\" It is still thy day, O church of God, whom He has made the depositary of His law. This day of trust and probation is drawing to a close. The sun is fast westering. Can it be that it will set and thou wilt not know \"the things which belong unto thy peace!\"? Must the irrevocable sentence be passed, \"But now they are hid from thine eyes\" (Luke 19:42)?",
