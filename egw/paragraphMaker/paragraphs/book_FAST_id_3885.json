    "word": "Just see what our Saviour says: \"When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\" [Luke 18:8]. Why? Why, because the devil has put his dark mantle to enshroud the people, when we want light, light, brethren, light, precious light from the throne of God. Well, then, you want to be sure that you learn how to tell it when you go from here; you want to be so rooted and grounded in it that when you go to those that are fastened in unbelief that they shall not throw their darkness over your mind; that you shall become so settled as to what is truth that you will not be shaken away from it; but that God can reveal to you His precious, precious light.",
