    "word": "I saw that there was, among our people, a large amount of surplus means, a portion of which should be put into our Health Institute. I also saw that there are many, among our people, of the sick and suffering worthy poor, who have been looking toward our Institute for help, and who are not able to pay the regular prices of board, treatment, &c. The Institute has struggled hard with debts the last three years, and could not treat patients, to any considerable extent, without full pay. It would please God for all our people, who are able so to do, to take stock liberally in our Institute, to place it in condition to help God's humble, worthy poor. In connection with this, I saw that Christ identified himself with suffering humanity, and what we have the privilege to do, for even the least of his children, whom he calls his brethren, we do to the Son of God.",
