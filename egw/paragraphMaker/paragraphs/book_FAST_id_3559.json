    "word": "To teach us how to overcome the temptings of appetite, Christ has given us the record of His own experience of nearly six weeks of fasting, followed by His wonderful victory over the powers of Satan. In this experience Christ broke the power of appetite for all who will accept the aid of the divine power on which He relied. He made it impossible for Satan to destroy the human race through indulged appetite, and made it possible for men and women in His strength to live a Christian life. Those who believe in Christ must, like Him, guard the appetite. \n\n\n                                      -314-",
