    "word": "The Word of God is a revelation of mercy, of peace and good will to man. The teachings of the Word of God open before us the necessity of purity, of holiness. There are jewels of truth, mercy, and righteousness to sanctify our lives, to reveal God in Jesus Christ. All who love God may come to the Scriptures earnestly, prayerfully, with contrition of soul, searching for truth as for hidden treasures, fasting and praying for truth, and they will not be disappointed but be made wise unto salvation.",
