    "word": "Debt Through Overbuilding \n\n     Brother -----, it is not wisdom to become involved in debt. You are a wise man, and do not need this \n                                                                           275\nreminder. A debt is a yoke,--a binding, galling yoke. It would not be wisdom to purchase another place near -----. You have been pressed almost beyond measure in the effort to build and equip the ----- Sanitarium. It would have been wiser to make the building smaller. I have always thought that it would be best to cut down the building plans still more than they were cut down, and then, when means came in, and if more room was needed, the building could have been enlarged. It would cost much less to furnish a smaller building,--Letter 158, 1902.",
