    "word": "The canvassing work is one of the Lord's appointed agencies for extending the knowledge of the truth for this time. The effort made in some schools to circulate Christ's Object Lessons has demonstrated what can be accomplished in the canvassing field by the students. The Lord has blessed the efforts put forth to relieve our schools from debt, and those who have engaged in the work have obtained an excellent experience. As they have taken up the work disinterestedly, great blessing has come to them. Many have thus gained a knowledge of how to handle our larger books.",
