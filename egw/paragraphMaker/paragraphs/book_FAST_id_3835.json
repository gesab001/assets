    "word": "There are times when Christ would say to those in His service whose energies have been overtaxed, \"Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while.\" We have the record on one occasion, after a day of ceaseless toil, that our Redeemer lay, a coil of rope for His pillow, fast asleep in a fisherman's boat. His exhausted human nature cried for rest and sleep. What a lesson for human beings who do nothing to bless others. Behold the Saviour! How pressing were the necessities which sought Him for relief! Teaching in the temple, healing in the temple, explaining the Scriptures in the streets, by the wayside, in His retired walks--the subjects so urgent left Him no time for repose. His sympathies were drawn out for the oppressed, He comforted the mourner, He brought hope to the hopeless, He healed the scars and bruises that sin had made. He went about doing good.",
