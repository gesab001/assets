In the midst of the time of trouble\u2014trouble such as has not been since there was a nation\u2014His chosen ones will stand unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest of God\u2019s saints. Angels that excel in strength will protect them, and in their behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a \u201cGod of gods,\u201d able to save to the uttermost those who have put their trust in Him.",
