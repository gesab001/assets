    "word": "Let there be much praying done and even with fasting, that not one shall move in darkness, but move in the light as God is in the light. We may look for anything to break forth outside and within our ranks, and there are minds undisciplined by the grace of the Holy Spirit, that have not practiced the words of Christ, and who do not understand the movings of the Spirit of God, and will follow a wrong course of action, because they do not follow Jesus closely. They follow impulse and their own imagination. Let there be nothing done in a disorderly manner, that there shall be a great loss or sacrifice made upon property because of ardent, impulsive speeches which stir up an enthusiasm which is not after the order of God, that a victory that was essential to be gained shall, for lack of level-headed moderation and proper contemplation of sound principles and purposes be turned into defeat. Let there be wise generalship in this matter, and all move under the guidance of a wise, unseen counsellor, which is God. Elements that are human will struggle for the mastery, and there may be a work done that does not bear the signature of God.",
