    "word": "14 (Matthew 28:19, 20). Debtor Through Accepting Christ.--In what sense was Paul debtor both to the Jew and to the Greek? To him had been given the commission, as it is given to every disciple of Christ, \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" In accepting Christ, Paul accepted this commission. He realized that upon him rested the obligation of laboring for all classes of men--for Jew and Gentile, learned and unlearned, for those occupying high positions and for those in the most lowly walks of life (Letter 262, 1903).",
