    "word": "Every true follower of Christ has a work to do. God has given to every man his work. A few are now pointing to the roll of fast fulfilling prophecy, and proclaiming, Get ready, show your obedience to God by keeping his commandments. This is not time for the messengers of God to stop to prop up those who know the truth, and who have every advantage. Let them go on to lift the standard and give the warning, \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him.\" Many who \n\n\n                         - 5 - \n\nhear the message--by far the greatest number--will not credit the solemn warning. Many will be found disloyal to the commandments of God, which are a test of character. The Lord's servants will be called enthusiasts. Ministers will warn the people not to listen to them. Noah received the same treatment while the Spirit of God was urging him to give the message, whether men would hear, or whether they would forbear.",
