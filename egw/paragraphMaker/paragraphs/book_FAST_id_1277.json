    "word": "Chronic Invalidism \n\n     Once I was called to see a young woman with whom I was well acquainted. She was sick, and was running down fast. Her mother wished me to pray for her. The mother stood there weeping and saying, \"Poor child; she cannot live long.\" I felt her pulse. I prayed with her, and then addressed her, \"My sister, if you get up and dress and go to your usual work in the office, all this invalidism will pass away.\" \"Do you think this would pass away?\" she said. \"Certainly,\" I said. \"You have nearly smothered the life forces by invalidism.\" I turned to the mother and told her that her daughter would have died of a diseased imagination if they had not been convinced of their error. She had been educating herself to invalidism. Now this is a very poor school. But I said to her, \"Change this order; arise and dress.\" She was obedient, and is alive today.--Letter 231, 1905.",
