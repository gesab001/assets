    "word": "Sources: RH, September 21, 1905\n     To our workers among the colored people, and especially to those who are teaching the children and the youth, I would say, Hold fast. Do not lose courage. We shall all be tried, to see of what material we are made. Work with an eye single to the glory of God. Labor to uplift and ennoble your students. They will be what you make them, largely. Teach them that their souls can be made clean in the blood of the\n150\nLamb. Hold up before them the hope that they can be Christians in thought, in word, in deed. Thus souls will be won to Christ. Tell them, oh, tell them of the love of Jesus, who taketh away the sin of the world.",
