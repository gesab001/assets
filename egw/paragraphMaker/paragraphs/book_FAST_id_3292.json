    "word": "Greenville, Sabbath, March 7, 1868. [It] has rained all through the night. It will be impossible for people to attend meetings today. This is the first Sabbath we have had without laboring, speaking to the people for eight months. . . . The snow is fast disappearing. Water stands in the road. There is a large deep pond where it was never known to be before. Teams come up to the water, look dubious, and finally cross. A road is made through our dooryard to avoid the body of water. It continues to rain, rain. I wrote eighteen pages of important testimony. . . . It is so dark we can see with difficulty. We attended prayers. Read several pages in a pocket Bible. . . . Home is the place for us during this storm. Wind is rising.",
