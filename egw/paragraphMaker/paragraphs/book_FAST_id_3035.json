    "word": "It is not safe to be occasional Christians. We must be Christ-like in all our actions always. Then, through grace, we are safe for time and for eternity. The experimental knowledge of the grace received in times of trial, is of more value than gold or silver. It confirms the trusting, believing one, in faith, in confidence that he has an ever-present helper in Jesus Christ, and gives him a firmness, a boldness in God, that will take him at his word and trust him with unwavering faith, when brought into most trying positions. The Wonderful Counselor will be his strength. Prevarication for the sake of policy, only makes matters worse. Never, never should the physician feel that he may prevaricate. It is not always safe and best to lay before the invalid the full extent of his danger. The truth may not all be spoken on all occasions, but never speak a lie. If it is important for the good of the invalid not to alarm him, lest such a course might prove fatal, do not lie to him, and never say that an honest, truthful physician cannot live. He can live, for he has God and Heaven on his side, and the practice of fraud or deception separates him from the God of truth. \n\n\n                            -26- \n\nSuch statements dishonor the God of truth and righteousness. Let every bribe to dissimulate be sternly refused. Hold fast your integrity in the strength of the grace of Christ, and he will fulfill his promise.",
