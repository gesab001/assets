    "word": "MR No. 813 - Comfort and Assurance for the Afflicted\n\n     My Dear Sister Lizzie Innes: I hear that you are being much afflicted, and I am in deep sympathy with you. Since my acquaintance with you I have felt a tender, loving sympathy toward you. My dear sister, while you are suffering, while infirmities are pressing upon your soul, do not doubt the love of your heavenly Father. Satan will try to cloud your mind with the thought that Jesus does not love you. He will try to make you believe that you are unworthy of being acknowledged before the Father as His child, but do not believe his suggestions for a single moment. I know that the Lord loves you and that there will be souls in the kingdom of God that will be saved as the result of your unselfish labor, your steadfast adherence to the faith.",
