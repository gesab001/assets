    "word": "\"Let your conversation be as becometh the gospel of Christ; . . . stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; and in nothing terrified by your adversaries; which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. For unto you it is given in behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\"",
