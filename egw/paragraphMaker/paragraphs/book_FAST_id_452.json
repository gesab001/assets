    "word": "Mastering the Science \n\n     There is a science of Christianity to be mastered--a science as much deeper, broader, higher, than any human science as the heavens are higher than the earth. The mind is to be disciplined, educated, trained; for men are to do service for God in ways that are not in harmony with inborn inclination. Often the training and education of a lifetime must be discarded, that one may become a learner in the school of Christ. The heart must be educated to become steadfast in God. Old and young are to form habits of thought that will enable them to resist temptation. They must learn to look upward. The principles of the word of God--principles that are as high as heaven and that compass eternity--are to be understood in their bearing on the daily life. Every act, every word, every thought, is to be in accord with these principles.",
