SEE FACSIMILE ON PAGE 88.] \n\n\n     We left South Lancaster yesterday at about two o'clock. Was obliged to remain in Worcester three hours. Left at five o'clock p.m. and arrived at New York City at ten o'clock p.m. Willie had preceded us to the city two days. We were obliged to go to Brooklyn to the Mission. We changed five times, I think, and every change required descending stairs or going up stairs. How thankful I was that the Lord had strengthened my limbs, especially my ankle bones, that I \n\n\n                                    -17- \n\ncould walk as fast and climb stairs equal to any of our party--Willie, A. T. Robinson, Sara McEnterfer and myself. We did not get to rest until midnight. I praise the Lord this morning I can report to those who ask, \"How did you sleep?\" \"Well--notwithstanding the elevated rail cars were rattling over the rails almost by our windows.\"",
