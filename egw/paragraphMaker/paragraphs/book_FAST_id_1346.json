    "word": "Controlled by Will.--You cannot control your impulses, your emotions, as you may desire, but you can control the will, and you can make an entire change in your life. By yielding up your will to Christ, your life will be hid with Christ in God and allied to the power which is above all principalities and powers. You will have strength from God that will hold you fast to His strength; and a new light, even the light of living faith, will be possible to you. . . .There will be in you a power, an earnestness, and a simplicity that will make you a polished instrument in the hands of God.-- 5T 514, 515 (1889).",
