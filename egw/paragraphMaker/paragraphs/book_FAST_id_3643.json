    "word": "Many precious gems of light had lost their lustre; they were buried beneath a mass of tradition and superstition. As the Author of truth, Christ was able to distinguish every precious gem. His hand removed the rubbish of false teaching, and recovered the lost treasures. In all their original freshness and beauty, He sent them in the framework of the gospel, and commanded that they should stand fast forever.",
