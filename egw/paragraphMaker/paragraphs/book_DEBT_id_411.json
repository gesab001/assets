    "word": "Some have thought it would be easier laboring with their hands, and have often expressed their choice to do so. They do not know what they are talking about. They are deceiving themselves. Some have very expensive families that must be provided for, and they lack management. They do not realize that they are indebted to the cause of God for their homes and all that they have. They have not realized how much it costs to live. Should they engage in manual labor, they would not be free from anxiety and weariness. They could not, while laboring to support their own families, be sitting down at their own firesides.",
