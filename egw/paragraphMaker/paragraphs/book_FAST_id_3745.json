    "word": "Nov. 18, 1885. We ate a good breakfast and went on board the boat. [FROM GOTEBORG, SWEDEN, TO FREDERICKSHAVEN, DENMARK. SEE D. A. DELAFIELD, ELLEN G. WHITE IN EUROPE, PP. 127-129.] It was very rough. We were in the nice saloon on the upper deck, enjoying the smooth sailing when the captain came up and said, \"I advise you to go below and lie down.\" We inquired if it would be worse than it was then. He said, \"This is nothing. You can get to the cabin now but you will not be able to get there soon.\" We went down and lay down. We had passed one hour on the boat and were to be five hours more.",
