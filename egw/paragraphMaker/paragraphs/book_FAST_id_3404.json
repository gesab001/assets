    "word": "Brother Butler, reach your hands high and tell Brethren A and B to reach up high and fasten hold upon the Infinite One. Look for great things. Do not get too many things on the mind when important efforts are being made. There is danger of getting the mind diverted from the special work for the time by having too much interest in various other matters. One man has not enough power to carry along several lines of work.",
