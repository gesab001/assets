You should have investigated the work thoroughly, and asked yourselves if five thousand dollars was too large a debt to incur in the important work in which these workers were engaged. Your influence should have been exerted in such a way as to cause the people to see the importance of the work, and to realize that it was their duty to rise to the emergency. You should have done as I wrote of doing, in my notes of travel. But if our brethren feel at liberty to stop the work when they cannot see where money is coming from to sustain it, then the work will not only be contracted in ----- and -----, but in every other state in the Union. If our workers are going forward in any place, do not put up the bars, and say, Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther. I feel sad that you have closed up the school at -----.
