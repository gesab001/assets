I do not know much about the arrangements that are proposed. One thing I do know: I desire to get out of debt, if it be possible for me to do so, without diverting means that would otherwise be used in some branch of the cause. If the circulation of this book could be wisely managed in such a way that the income from it would relieve me of the burden of debt, I should regard the effort made by our people to accomplish this, as a great favor.",
