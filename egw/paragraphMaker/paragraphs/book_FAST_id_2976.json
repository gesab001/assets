    "word": "I address the people of God who today are holding fast their confidence, who will not depart from the faith once delivered unto the saints, who stand amid the moral darkness of these days of corruption. The word of the Lord to you is: \n\n\n                     - 13 - \n\n\"I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people.\" Can we not here see the paternal love of God expressed to those who hold fast to the faith in righteousness? The closest relationship exists between God and his people. Not only are we objects of his sparing mercy, his pardoning love; we are more than this. The Lord rejoices over his people. He delights in them. He is their surety. He will beautify all who are serving him with a whole heart, with the spirit of holiness. He clothes them with righteousness. He loves those who do his will, who express his image. All who are true and faithful are conformed to the image of his Son. In their mouth is found no guile, for they are without fault before the throne of God.              Mrs. E. G. White.
