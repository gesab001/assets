    "word": "Let every minister, every doctor, every medical missionary worker, remember that he is not to put his conscience to the rack to favor any business transaction that is not straight-forward, on the part of any man. Whatever his calling or profession, a man is not a Christian unless he follow the example of Christ, by His grace holding fast to his integrity, humility, not of boasting and parade. His life is to show that he has accepted the invitation, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\"",
