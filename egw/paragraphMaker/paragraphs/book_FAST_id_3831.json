    "word": "We witnessed a burial scene last Friday. There was a large building upon the ground where services were held, and the coffin was placed in a small room connected with the building. Several women were there and one after another would bring upon a waiter very rich bouquets and these were received and fastened upon the coffin until it was entirely covered. There were two clergymen of the State Church with their long black gowns and quilled ruffles about the neck and the wrists.",
