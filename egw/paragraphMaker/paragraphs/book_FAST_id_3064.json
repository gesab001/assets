    "word": "\"There is only one power that can make medical students what they ought to be, and keep them steadfast,--the grace of God and the power of the truth exerting a saving influence upon life and character. These students who intend to minister to suffering humanity, will find no graduating place this side of heaven. That knowledge which is termed science should be acquired, while the seeker daily acknowledges that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Everything that will strengthen the mind should be cultivated to the utmost of their power, while at the same time they should seek God for wisdom; for unless they are guided by the wisdom from above, they will become an easy prey to the deceptive power of Satan. They will become large in their own eyes, pompous and self-sufficient.",
