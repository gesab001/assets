H. Kellogg and his associates in the medical missionary work at Battle Creek. We should feel profoundly thankful for the work that God has wrought through the labors of His faithful servants in the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and especially for Dr. Kellogg's steadfast adherence to and advocacy of the principles of hygienic reform.",
