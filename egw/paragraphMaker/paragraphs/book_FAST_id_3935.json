    "word": "Had you been less authoritative and more gracious, how much better it would have been. The Lord could not co-operate with your unsubdued and determined will. O how many there are whom you could have subdued and won by kindness and tender courtesy, but in those hearts, by your masterly dictatorship you caused hatred rather than love to spring up. Had you been true to yourself and to those you might have kept as fast friends, you would have laid aside your garments of authority, which you wore as if charged with special dictatorship. How many souls you have bruised and wounded and driven from you forever, because you have felt it your privilege to humble them before others.",
