    "word": "While in the wilderness, Christ fasted, but He was insensible to hunger. . . . He spent the time in earnest prayer, shut in with God. It was as if He were in the presence of His Father. . . . The thought of the warfare before Him made Him oblivious to all else, and His soul was fed with the bread of life. . . . He saw the breaking of Satan's power over fallen and tempted ones. He saw Himself healing the sick, comforting the hopeless, cheering the desponding, and preaching the gospel to the poor\u2014doing the work that God had outlined for Him; and He did not realize any sense of hunger until the forty days of His fast were ended.",
