    "word": "Man has a character to form for himself. This character must be formed in accordance with the elevated, divine standard. No human mold will satisfy the measurement of God. He is the essence of all goodness and truth. There is need for every human being to obtain, as fast as possible, an understanding of his relation to his Creator and Redeemer. Daily the life should be assimilated to the Christ-life. Daily the will and the affections should be brought into subjection to the Saviour.",
