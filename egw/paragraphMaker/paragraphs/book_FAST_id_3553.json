    "word": "Enoch was holy because he walked with God in God's way. In him the world had an example of what those will be who when Christ comes are caught up in the clouds to meet Him in the air. As Enoch was, so are we to be. Personal piety is to be blended with the most earnest and energetic warnings and appeals. We are to point to what is, with what is to be following fast after. We are instructed to be \"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord\" (Romans 12:11). We are to be earnest in our efforts to clear the King's highway, to prepare a people for the coming of the Lord. Fervency of spirit must be brought into our service for the Lord. The lamps of the soul must be kept filled and burning.",
