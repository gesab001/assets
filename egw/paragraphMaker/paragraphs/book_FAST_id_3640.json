    "word": "Age, position, or influence cannot save one of us from sudden sickness and calamity if the Lord says, \"It is done.\" Therefore let not those who have had the light of truth be presumptuous. In the midst of cherished enterprises the Lord may speak, and it will be done. It is the wisdom of minister and people to hold themselves always in a spiritual preparation for anything that may occur. Let all follow the example of Hezekiah. Let us pour out the soul in humiliation and fasting and prayer.",
