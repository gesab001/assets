    "word": "One of the Pharisees present, hoping to turn the conversation into another channel, exclaimed with a sanctimonious air, \"Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\" His remark was designed to turn away the minds of the guests from the subject of their practical duty. He thought to turn their minds from the work of the present life to the time of the resurrection of the just. But Jesus read the heart of the pretender, and fastening his eyes upon him, opened before the company the character and value of their present privileges. He showed them that they had a part to act at the present time in order to share in the blessedness of the future. He would have them understand that the privileges of service which they lightly regarded, and the invitation which they were slighting, would be sent to those whom they despised as of little value in the sight of God.",
