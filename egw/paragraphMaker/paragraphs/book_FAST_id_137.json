    "word": "The soul of the Hebrew patriot was overwhelmed by these evil tidings. So great was his sorrow that he could not eat or drink; he \u201cwept, and mourned certain days, and fasted.\u201d But when the first outburst of his grief was over, he turned in his affliction to the sure Helper. The record says that he \u201cprayed before the God of heaven.\u201d He unburdened his heart to God. He knew that the affliction that had come upon Israel was the result of her transgression, and with deep humiliation he came before God to ask for pardon and a renewal of the divine favor. Faithfully he makes confession of his sins and the sins of his people.",
