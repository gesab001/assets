    "word": "There are many things that need to be refined, changed, overcome in you, my dear friends. Indulgence only feeds the appetite and strengthens the passions. I have no hesitancy in speaking on this question. You have the light in the testimonies; are these testimonies of God, or are they from beneath? You do not choose to receive the light. The Lord has spoken plainly in regard to the deleterious effects of a meat diet and its influence upon children. Whenever I have seen children feeding upon flesh meats, since the light was given me from heaven, I have felt that if the parents only knew what they were doing, they would fast and pray for moral courage and God-given wisdom and grace to do right. All who feel their need of His Spirit to educate and discipline self, and to properly train their children, will deny self, and take up the cross and follow Jesus.",
