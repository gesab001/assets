    "word": "A Lack of Economy [SPECIAL TESTIMONIES TO PHYSICIANS AND HELPERS, PAGES 90, 91 (1879).] \n\n\n     As my guide conducted me through the different departments, the lack of economy everywhere stirred my soul with grief, for I had a full sense of the debt hanging over the institution. The petty dishonesty, the selfish neglect of duty, were marked by the recording angel. The waste permitted here and there, in the course of a year amounts to a considerable sum. Much of this might be saved by the helpers; but each will say, \"It does not belong to me to look after these things.\" Would they pass these things by so indifferently if the loss was to be sustained by themselves? No, they would know exactly what to do and how to do it; but it makes all the difference, now that it belongs to the institution. This is the fruit of selfishness and is registered against them under the heading of unfaithfulness.",
