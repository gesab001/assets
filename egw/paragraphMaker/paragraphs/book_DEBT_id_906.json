    "word": "If we build expensively and incur a burden of debt, that would be an example which we do not wish to encourage in other localities, because it would be wrong for them to do this. Then we must build in such a way that we shall not violate the great principle laid down in the word of God that we should love our neighbor as ourselves. We are not to be guilty of absorbing all the means in the treasury in our special portion of the field and thus make it impossible for the work to be built up in other places, and for new territory to be added to the Lord's kingdom. The Lord would have other parts of His vineyard furnished with facilities so that they shall be able to give character to the work. The Lord forbid us to use any selfish schemes in His service, schemes that shall rob our neighbor of facilities which would enable them to act their part in representing the advanced light and clear, decided truth that is to be presented in many places.",
