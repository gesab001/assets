    "word": "There are persons who would be more benefited by abstinence from food for a day or two every week than by any amount of medicine or treatment or medical advice. To fast one day a week would be of incalculable benefit to them. It is foolish for one to keep on eating day after day, and yet wonder why he is in distress. Let such an one relieve himself from distress by changing his diet or by eating less. If he wills  to do so, he can soon obtain relief.",
