    "word": "Experienced Men Needed \n\n\n     The wages offered should be such as will secure the best kind of help. Nothing will be saved in narrowing in this line. Loss will be sustained if inexperienced men become superintendents or managers in the business lines of the institution. It would have been wisdom if there had been an all-round man in business matters to work in the Health Retreat, one who would be prepared to do outside work, and answer the calls made. Then Drs. B and C could have filled their proper positions as physicians, and leave the work of managing to those better calculated to do that class of work. Thus thousands of dollars that have been expended, might have been saved. This devising and planning of men, and running the institution after their own ideas, has increased the enormous debts upon the institution. . . .",
