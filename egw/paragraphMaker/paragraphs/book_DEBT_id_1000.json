    "word": "The carrying of the indebtedness of the school in Battle Creek by the General Conference is plainly stated to be wrong. The Conference has no funds with which to do this, and the missions in foreign lands help which they do not receive. This is the game Satan has been playing to bind about the work of God. Through a disregard of the positive directions given by the Lord in various lines, he has sought to bring in his own methods. By human suppositions men have made the instruction given of God of none effect. They have interpreted the plain words of the Lord to mean something after man's wisdom and not after the wisdom of God. Then they have gone straight forward with their own suppositions and plans.",
