    "word": "Pale at Thought of Withheld Tithe \n\n     Many, many have lost the spirit of self-denial and sacrifice. They have been burying their money in temporal possessions. There are men whom God has blessed, whom He is testing to see what response they will make to His benefits. They have withheld their tithes and offerings until their debt to the Lord God of hosts has become so great that they grow pale at the thought of rendering to the Lord His own,--a just tithe. Make haste, brethren, you have now the opportunity to be honest with God; delay not.--Gen. Conf. Daily Bulletin, Feb. 28, 1893.",
