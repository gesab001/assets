    "word": "Help from Heaven \n\n     The worker in a foreign field must carry in his heart the peace and love of heaven; for this is his only safety. Amid perplexity and trial, discouragement and suffering, with the devotion of a martyr and the courage of a hero, he is to hold fast to the hand that never lets go, saying, \"I will not fail nor be discouraged.\" He must be a close Bible student, and should be often in prayer. If, before talking with others, he will seek help from above, he may be assured that angels of heaven will be with him. At times he may yearn for human sympathy, but in his loneliness he may find comfort and encouragement through communion with God. Let him be cheered by the words of the Saviour, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" [Matthew 28:20.] From this divine Companion he will receive instruction in the science of soul-saving.",
