    "word": "When the servants of God pray for his Spirit and blessing, it sometimes comes immediately; but it is not always then bestowed. At such times, faint not.

Let your trust be fully in God, and often that blessing will come when you need it most, and you will unexpectedly receive help from God when you are \n114\npresenting the truth to unbelievers, and will be enabled to speak the word with clearness and power.",
