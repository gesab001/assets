    "word": "Yesterday (October 30) was a trying day for me, especially in the evening. As we approached New York City it was about ten o'clock. I much dislike the elevated railroad. We changed so often, and had to travel up and down the stairs and be exposed to currents of air, with the cold upon me. I was feeling very disagreeable. We waited at one station more than half an hour while Brother Robinson and Willie White went to seek a place to deposit the calligraph and large luggage. Here I got cold by being exposed to currents of air, and greatly feared the consequences. It was eleven o'clock at night when we reached the mission at Brother Robinson's. It was some time before we could awaken anyone. We succeeded at last and we were welcomed into the mission. Had a cup of warm drink and retired. The elevated railroad was very near our chamber and the noise of travel was continued until late, but I slept the sleep of weariness. As early as possible after breakfast and a season of prayer we started on our journey back to New York \n\n\n                                    -306- \n\nCity to take the cars. We had to go through the same wearisome process, going upstairs and downstairs to ride on the elevated railroad, in order to get to our destination.",
