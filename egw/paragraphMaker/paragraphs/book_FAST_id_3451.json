    "word": "In Australia the people depend almost solely on baker's bread, and meat is used at breakfast, dinner, and supper. So baker's bread, meat, fruits and vegetables generally compose the diet of the people. Now if the health reform diet is presented to them in such a way that they think it will cost more money, time, and labor than the diet to which they are accustomed, I fear we shall make very poor headway in correcting their habits. What we need here is the labor of persons who have a knowledge of practical and domestic economy, who can instruct as to how to prepare a simple, nutritious, palatable diet for the common people.--Letter 19, 1892, pp. 9, 10. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, August 5, 1892.)",
