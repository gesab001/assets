    "word": "MR No. 880 - Steadfastness on our Sanctuary Doctrine\n\n     It is your privilege to know what is truth, because for more than half a century we have been guided step by step by the counsels of the Spirit of God. At this time many efforts will be made to unsettle our faith in the sanctuary question, but we must not waver. Not a pin is to be moved from the foundations of our faith. Truth is still truth. Those who become uncertain will drift into erroneous theories and will finally find themselves infidel in regard to the past evidence we have had of what is truth. The old waymarks must be preserved, that we lose not our bearings.--Letter 395, 1906, p. 4. (To S. M. Cobb, Dec. 25, 1906.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. August 22, 1981",
