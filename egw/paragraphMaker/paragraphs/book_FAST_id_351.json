At the time the light of health reform dawned upon us, and since that time, the questions have come home every day, \"Am I practicing true temperance in all things?\" \"Is my diet such as will bring me in a position where I can accomplish the greatest amount of good?\" If we cannot \n                                                                           20\nanswer these questions in the affirmative, we stand condemned before God, for He will hold us all responsible for the light which has shone upon our path. The time of ignorance God winked at, but as fast as light shines upon us, He requires us to change our health-destroying habits, and place ourselves in a right relation to physical laws.",
