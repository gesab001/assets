    "word": "\"The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\" Bro. and sister Ross, if you had walked in the light as it has shone upon your pathway, had you been drawing nearer and closer to God, steadfastly believing the truth, and walking humbly before God in the light he has given, you would now have an experience that would be of inestimable value. Had you improved the talents lent you of God, you would have shone as lights in the world. But light becomes darkness to all those who will not walk in it. In order to be accepted and blessed of God as our fathers were, we must be faithful, as they were faithful. We must improve our light as the ancient faithful prophets improved theirs. God requires of us according to the grace he has bestowed upon us. He will not accept less than he claims. All his righteous demands must be fully met. In order for us to meet our responsibilities, we must stand on that elevated ground that the order and advancement of holy, sacred truth has prepared for us.",
