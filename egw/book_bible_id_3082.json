{"word": "I feel a deep interest in every one of these little children, and we hope that you will all treat them very tenderly. In the family let those who are older be patient and kind to their younger brothers and sisters. They may help to educate the little ones in a knowledge of the Bible. Do not put the vim into your voice when you speak to them. Put in the blessedness that comes from doing right, from pleasing the Lord. . . .", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 249}
