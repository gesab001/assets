{"word": "We should never let the impression prevail that only a privileged few have a knowledge of the Scriptures and that others must refer to these\\97one or another of their favorite ministers\\97as authority for their doctrines. People should be educated to search the Scriptures for themselves, to dare to think for themselves, taking the Bible as their guidebook, their standard of faith. Although heresy may lift its head boldly, and insult the truth by perverted ideas and false interpretations and misapplication of Scripture, there should be no suppression of religious freedom by reformers.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 332}
