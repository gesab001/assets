{"word": "Then Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His hands and with a loud voice says, \"It is done,\" and all the angelic host lay off their crowns as He makes the solemn announcement: \"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still\" (Revelation 22:11). Every case has been decided for life or death. Christ has made the atonement for His people and blotted out their sins. The number of His subjects is made up; \"the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven\" (Daniel 7:27), is about to be given to the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to reign as King of kings and Lord of lords.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 160}
