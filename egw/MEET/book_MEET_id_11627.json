    "word": "Sister Davis has just called my attention to an article printed in the Youth's Instructor of May 31, 1894. The question asked is, Did I design to have this sentence just as it appeared in the Instructor? I am surprised to see it just as it appears -- \"A meat diet is not the most wholesome of diets, and yet I would take the position that meat should not be discarded by everyone.\" I can not explain why this appears just as it does. Since the campmeeting at Brighton I have absolutely banished meat from my table. It is an understood thing that whether I am at home or abroad, nothing of this kind is to be used by my family, or come upon my table. I have had some representations before my mind in the night season on this subject that I feel that I have done right in banishing meat from my table. I would desire that the sentence should be modified by changing the \"not\" -- \"Yet I would not take the position that meat be wholly discarded by everyone.\"-- for instance, by those dying of consumption.",
