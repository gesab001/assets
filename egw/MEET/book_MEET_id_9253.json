    "word": "Willie, Brother Rousseau, and Sister Bree came from Melbourne last Friday. Willie had been away several weeks attending the convention at Melbourne. Sister Rousseau is staying with us. After the Sabbath the usual inflowing came for council meetings and so forth. My home is the only place in which the people can be accommodated for these meetings. Brother Colcord \n\n\n                                   -163- \n\ncame from Melbourne on Monday. Doctor M. G. Kellogg has made his home with us for some time, by special invitation. There is no place in which to entertain our people but at my home. Last night we lodged seventeen persons. They report this morning that they have all rested well.",
