One says, \"I heard Mrs. White speak at such a meeting.\" The book agent, a fine young man from Colorado, says he heard Mrs. White speak in the large mammoth tent in Boulder City.

Passing Cheyenne, we soon entered snow sheds constantly varying from light to darkness and from darkness to light--the only change for miles.",
