    "word": "Labor in New Fields\n     In order to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth, laborers must have a varied experience. This will be best acquired in extended labor in new fields, in different localities, where they will come in contact with all classes of people, and all varieties of minds, and where various kinds of labor will be required to meet the wants of many and varied minds. This drives the true laborer to God and the Bible for light, strength, and knowledge, that he may be fully qualified to meet the wants of the people. He should heed the exhortation given to Timothy: \u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\u201d \u201cWho then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?\u201d [2 Timothy 2:15; Luke 12:42.] \u2014 Vol. 2, p. 642.",
