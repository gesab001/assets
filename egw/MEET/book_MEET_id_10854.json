    "word": "For half an hour Elder Olsen tried to close the meeting but he could not. They had been gathered together since nine o'clock for their Sabbath school, and it was past five o'clock and none had eaten anything. The meeting was excellent. We could but rejoice in God. He had greatly blessed and strengthened me just as I believed He would do, and I was gratified to find my brethren and sisters whom I had not spoken with for years still walking in the truth. Oh, the depth of the love and compassion of our God to bear long with the perversity of man! The boundless love of Christ is beyond anything we can comprehend. The sinner in coming to Christ, confessing his sins, is placing himself in the way of obedience.",
