    "word": "While we were living at Cooranbong, where the Avondale School is located, the question of amusements came up. \"What shall we do \n\n\n                     -240- \n\nto provide for the amusement of our students?\" the faculty inquired. We talked matters over together, and then I came before the students and said: \"Dear friends, we can occupy our minds profitably without trying to devise methods for amusing ourselves. Instead of spending our time in playing the games that so many students play, let us strive to do something for the Master. We have decided that the best course you can pursue is to do missionary work in the neighborhood. When you are listening to a discourse, take notes, and mark down the passages that the minister uses, so that you can study the subject carefully yourselves. Thus you will be able to prepare for giving a synopsis of the discourse, in the form of a Bible reading, to those who do not come to our meetings.\"",
