    "word": "God wants to pour into your souls the light and glory of His presence. He wants that His joy shall remain in you and that your joy may be full, that when you meet with your brethren and sisters you can say, \"Hear what the Lord has done for me. He has given me a rich experience, and if I seek Him for His blessing it will come.\" Then you begin to talk of Christ's coming, and the end of all things at hand, and how we are getting ready for His appearing. Then you talk of that heavenly city; you talk of the tree of life in the midst of the paradise of God, and you talk of the King in His beauty, with His kingly crown, and of the riches that are to be given to the children of God; you talk of that stream that goeth out from the throne of God; and then you say \"Praise the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me give Him glory.\"",
