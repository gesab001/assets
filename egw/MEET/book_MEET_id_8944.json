    "word": "Yesterday a telegram was received from our workers at Newcastle asking us to send our carriage to the station for a party coming from that place. A family came to see the school, with the purpose of placing in it one of their sons. There were father, mother, daughter about 30 years old, and two boys. They have several stores in Newcastle, in the drapery business. They were much pleased with the place and decided to send their son to the school. These people were interested and deeply impressed at the camp meetings.",
