    "word": "MR No. 806 - Stephen Belden and Norfolk Island\n\n     Plans for the Beldens to go to Norfolk Island--We have now returned to our home in Granville. I left the camp ground on Sunday evening. On Sunday evening we had a very interesting meeting in considering the islands of the sea, and in planning as to what should be done in sending laborers to these fields. Brother Cole, who has been laboring at Norfolk Island, has been with us during the camp meeting. Norfolk Island is said to have a good healthful climate, and the weather is never very hot or cold. The people wear the same clothing all the year around. There are many advantages to be found on this island. Fruit of almost all kinds grows there. Oranges are abundant, and are of a superior quality, as are also bananas, strawberries, and coconuts.",
