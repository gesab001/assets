    "word": "The meeting closed and we were obliged to make a hasty farewell. We were unable to speak at all to a large number of our brethren and sisters, for our time was short and we were compelled to take the cars for the Kansas City depot. We regretted that we could not have been with our people at the earlier stage of the meeting. We had many things of great importance we would have been glad to present to them.",
