    "word": "Attended morning ministers' meeting. I had some things to say upon confessing. The promise is, \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" 1 John 1:9. Here is a work for individuals to do, not only to confess their sins but to put them away. Can they do this in their own strength? No, but this work of crucifixion of self can alone be done through Jesus Christ our Sacrifice for sin. We must come to Jesus in faith and rely upon the merits of the blood of Christ.",
