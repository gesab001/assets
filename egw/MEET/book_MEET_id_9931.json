    "word": "In every camp meeting held in Australia, a call for Bibles has been made by the outsiders attending the meetings. The people have asked for Bibles just like those used by Seventh-day Adventists. Many, with serious faces, have come to us to purchase a Seventh-day Adventist Bible. They had been told that our ministers used a Bible different from theirs. We assured them over and over again that our Bible is just the same as theirs, but to no avail. A new Bible they were determined to have. Large numbers of Bibles have been sold at our camp meetings.",
