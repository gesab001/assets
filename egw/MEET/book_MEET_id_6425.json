    "word": "Monday morning meeting commenced half past five under the tent. I spoke about thirty minutes upon the necessity of economy in dress and in the expenditure of means. There is danger of becoming reckless and careless of the Lord's money. Young ministers who engage in tent labor should be careful and not run up high expenses. The wants of the cause are many, as tents are entering new fields and as the missionary work is enlarging. The most rigid economy should be used in this matter without stinginess. . . .",
