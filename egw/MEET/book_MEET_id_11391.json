    "word": "On the third morning Judge Arthur came in a little late. After I had finished speaking, he rose and bore his testimony. He said that he had felt very tired that morning, and had told his wife that he would not attend the morning meeting. But afterward he felt impressed that he must attend, and he did. During his remarks, he said, \"I could not rest till I had come to this meeting, and I am so thankful that I did not miss it. This message will be a great blessing to me. I have heard the very things I needed to hear.\" He bore an excellent testimony, and we were all very much pleased with the words spoken.",
