    "word": "The younger ministers are not to think, because they are not called to speak to the large congregation, that there is nothing for them to do.  There is work for all to do.  Let them hold meetings in the smaller tents. Let the occupants of several tents meet in one tent for prayer and social meeting.  In such meetings as these the younger ministers can do good service.  Let them speak a few words right to the point, and then give those present an opportunity to speak.  All our people should learn to bear witness for God in social meeting.",
