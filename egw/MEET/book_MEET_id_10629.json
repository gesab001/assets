    "word": "Battle Creek, October 21, 1889 \n\n     I attended early morning ministers' meeting in the Tabernacle. Some important things were said. I had a testimony to bear in regard to our having a living connection with God. In order to have our work effective, we must be daily learning in the school of Christ, the lessons of meekness and lowliness of heart, and as we draw nigh to God His word is fulfilled--He will draw nigh unto us. He will bless us, He will impart to us His grace and His power to work with our efforts. We feel that our morning meetings are precious and none should allow themselves to be deterred from attending them.",
