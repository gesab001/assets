    "word": "In the past I have asked the Lord to send me the one He would choose to help us in the important work we are doing. I have prayed Him to send me one who would not be a continual burden and perplexity to me. When Brother Crisler told me that he had been impressed that he should connect with me, I was greatly relieved, for I knew that the Lord had answered my prayer. I wrote to Brother Crisler some weeks ago and told him that I expected to meet him at the Oakland camp meeting. But I have received no response to my letter. I know not what more I can do.",
