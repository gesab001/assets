    "word": "Wright, Michigan, Sunday, January 26, 1868--Arose refreshed by sleep. It snowed during the night. Wrote several pages of testimony for brethren Atkins and Wilson. Attended meeting. My husband spoke to a crowded house one hour and a half. His discourse was upon \"I and My Father Are One,\" showing the relation the law sustains to the gospel. The people gave the greatest attention. I followed, and spoke about one hour. I thought conviction rested upon many minds. Books were bought and many given away. Brother Andrews spoke in the afternoon with great freedom. These meetings were solemn. We can but think there should be meetings held in Wright.--Ms 12, 1868, pp. 10-11. (Diary, January 1 to 31, 1868.)",
