    "word": "The instruction given in the tenth chapter of Matthew shows how the Lord regards those who go forth to work for Him in new fields. Read this chapter. Study what Christ said in regard to the perils the messengers would have to meet and the hardships they would have to endure. \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves,\" He said to His disciples: \"be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves\" (Matthew 10:16). Today those who labor in new fields have many trials and difficulties to encounter. They need the help and sympathy of their brethren in the home field, where facilities for work are more abundant and means more easily obtained.",
