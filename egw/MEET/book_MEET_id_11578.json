    "word": "The Lord calls for men of a different stamp of character in some respects to connect with the Huntsville School, men who are not only capable teachers, but who can see the needs of the school and meet the situation wisely. In such a school as Huntsville, there is needed keenness of discernment and a knowledge of how to build up the work. Unless those in charge have clear discernment, unless they can see what needs to be done, the school will make an unworthy representation.",
