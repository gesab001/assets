Kellogg.) \n\n\n     We received your letters with pleasure and have read them to others. We have just had a most interesting and profitable Bible Institute. We know that much good has resulted from this meeting. We know that Professor Prescott worked under the influence of the Holy Spirit of God. He is giving the trumpet a certain sound. For fully one month the Word of God was studied, and an interest has been awakened in this place.",
