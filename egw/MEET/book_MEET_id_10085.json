    "word": "Danvers, Massachusetts, Thursday, December 11, 1890 \n\n     I wrote many pages and did not go out to walk as I ought to have done. I need exercise, but the walks are icy and I feared I might slip and wrench my ankles. About noon a messenger came from Ipswich to say that Sister Brickey was dangerously sick about 12 miles from this place. Brethren Fifield and Farman went on the cars, which took them within three miles of the place. A carriage was waiting for them to take them to the afflicted one. She was very low. They offered prayer on her behalf. She was at once relieved and praised the Lord. Her countenance and voice were changed. They left her happy in God. They attended the half-past five prayer meeting.",
