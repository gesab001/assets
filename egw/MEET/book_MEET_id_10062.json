    "word": "We rode in the streetcar about three quarters of an hour to the hall, the place of meeting. This was a commodious place. The hall was full and I spoke with freedom upon the lesson of Christ to His disciples--the vine and the branches. John 15. The Lord gave me much freedom and the trembling of nerves left me after I had spoken about five minutes. His grace strengthened me.--Ms. 46, 1890, pp. 1-2 (Diary 16, p. 310).",
