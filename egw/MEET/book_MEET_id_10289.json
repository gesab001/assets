    "word": "The night before last I slept for only one hour. I was revolving over and over in my mind the matters of which I have spoken this morning. I asked myself, Will I be free when I go from this place if I say nothing about them? Will I stand free before God? I did not mean to say a word. I thought that when the Spirit of God came into our meetings there would be those who would understand that they had something to say in order to remove the reproach of heaven which for years has rested upon the work here. Many of those who acted a prominent part in the wrongs done are not here, but there are those here who have been following the same principles of wrong. To forsake right principles is like taking away the foundation of a house. If men who have grown to manhood cannot understand what pure principles mean, they might better go apart and meditate and pray until they understand this. From the light which I have had, I know that principles which do not meet the approval of heaven have been followed.",
