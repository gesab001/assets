    "word": "Brother Kellogg, the Lord calls for a halt, while you sit down and count the cost, to see whether you will be able to finish the building which you have begun. My brother, you are in danger. You are making many plans that you can never carry through. In your effort to embrace so much in the rescue work, you are in danger of divorcing yourself from the leading and most urgent features of the last gospel message. There must be camp meetings held to reach all classes, and at every place where these camp meetings are held, a home should be established where educated workers can teach all classes of learners how to work in medical missionary lines in connection with the Bible workers. All are to be taught how to carry the work to towns and cities that have not yet heard the message. Thus the light of truth will shine forth in many places. Meeting-houses must be built and humble buildings hired or erected where treatment can be given to the sick. By this means the work of \n\n\n                                    -133- \n\nthe gospel and the medical missionary work will be bound together.--Letter 135, 1899, pp. 1, 3, 7. (To Dr. Kellogg, August 29, 1899.)",
