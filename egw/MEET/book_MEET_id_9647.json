    "word": "MR No. 1468 - A Report on the Australian School; Building W.C. White's Home; Trusting and Praising God\n\n     (Written June 10, 1897, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, to W.C. White.) \n\n     I am able to report sixty students in the school, besides the six teachers. We shall have to have more room. The school needs all the rooms. If we could now build a chapel, then the students could get along for the present with the room that is now used for Sabbath meetings. As it is, they have to be crowded. We have no funds with which to erect a second building, or to build a chapel, but we do not feel discouraged. We are determined to work in faith. The Lord will help His people if they put their trust in Him. I send you copies of the letters which I am sending by the Vancouver boat. I do not know what you will think of them. I am certain that God has funds for us somewhere, and they must come to us here. I am trusting and praying for help and guidance.",
