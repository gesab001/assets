    "word": "I hoped not to be compelled to give you a personal testimony, and shall not now, further than the Spirit of the Lord urges me; but in His name who has sent me and given me words to speak to the people as they need it, I speak to you. Humble yourself under the hand of God, \"seek the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon. I say unto you in the name of the Lord, You will never come to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, until you put away the spirit which has controlled you at this meeting, and has led you to take the place of teacher rather than that of a learner.",
