    "word": "At our camp meetings there is much more preaching than there should be. This brings a heavy burden upon the ministers, and, as a consequence, many things are neglected which require attention. Many little matters which open the door to greater evils are passed \n\n\n                       - 40 - \n\nuncorrected. The minister is robbed of physical strength, and deprived of the time he needs for meditation and prayer in order to keep his own soul in the love of God. And when so many discourses are crowded in, one after another, the people have no time to digest and appropriate what they hear. Thus minds become confused, and the services are a weariness to them.",
