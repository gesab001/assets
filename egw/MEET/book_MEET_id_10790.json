I spoke five times, four times at length, speaking two evenings and Sabbath and Sunday morning at the missionary meeting, and again Sunday afternoon. I am fully satisfied, beyond a question or a doubt, that the Lord has a message for me to bear to the people. I have felt the sustaining power of God while standing on my feet in speaking. I know the power of God has spoken through the human instrument. I know that there is a reception of the word, and hungry souls are fed. Day and night I have a spirit of intercession that the Lord will clothe me with the spirit of the work, and [give me the] meekness and the gentleness of Christ, and that I may be clothed with the righteousness of Christ.",
