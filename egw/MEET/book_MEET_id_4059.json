    "word": "Alpha Presented in \"Living Temple\" \n\n     I am instructed to speak plainly. \"Meet it,\" is the word spoken to me. \"Meet it firmly, and without delay.\" But it is not to be met by our taking our working forces from the field to investigate doctrines and points of difference. We have no such investigation to make. In the book Living Temple there is presented the alpha of deadly heresies. The omega will follow, and will be received by those who are not willing to heed the warning God has given.",
