Little did I suppose that time would linger till I should be nearly seventy years old. The 26th of next November . . . I shall be seventy years of age. I have had a wrestling life, and when we were holding meetings in private houses, when only a few believed the truth, I did not think that time would last, or that my life would be spared, long enough for me to visit Europe and Australia.",
