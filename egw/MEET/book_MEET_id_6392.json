    "word": "Christ is the source of our strength. Let us study His teachings. In giving His only begotten Son to live in our world and to be subject to temptation that He might teach us how to overcome, the Father has made ample provision that we should not be taken captive by the enemy. Meeting the fallen foe, Christ overcame in behalf of humanity. He was tempted in all points like as we are, but He resisted in the strength of divinity, that He might be able to succor us when we are tempted.",
