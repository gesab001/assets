    "word": "Good results are being seen from the efforts that are being put forth at Yountville. One man tells us that as a result of the services held by our people, his life has been changed. He used to spend most of his time in drinking and carousing with his companions, but he is now trying to live a Christian life. Some time ago a copy of Desire of Ages was lent to him, and \n\n\n                                      -317- \n\nhe has read it over and over again. At last, thinking that he must soon return the book, he began to copy portions of it. Hearing of this, we presented him with a copy, and he seemed much pleased. During the week, a little company of soldiers meets together in the grove for prayer and Bible study. One man at the home is observing the Sabbath.--Manuscript 86, 1903.
