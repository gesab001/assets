    "word": "Before the last General Conference, Dr. Kellogg came to St. Helena, and had some conversation with me. I was very weak, and I told him so. I knew that I was not strong enough to talk with him. Nevertheless, he gave me his account of the scene at the meeting at College View. He presented things contrary to the way in which they had been presented to me by the Lord. He related matters as if he were the one who had been wronged. I said, \"The Lord has instructed me in regard to that matter. When I am convinced that it is the Lord's will for me to change my opinions, I will let you know. But I cannot now speak with you, for I have no strength.\" Dr. Kellogg said that he did not expect me to say anything.",
