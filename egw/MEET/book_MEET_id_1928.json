That branch of the cause for which these worn-out laborers have worked should show an appreciation of their labor by helping them in their time of need, thus sharing largely with the sanitarium the burden of expense. Some workers are so situated as to be able to lay by a little from their salary; and this they should do, if possible, to meet an emergency; yet even these should be welcome as a blessing to the sanitarium.",
