    "word": "Delegations from Abroad \n\n     The presence at the 1909 General Conference of over a hundred delegates from abroad, gave Mrs. White opportunity to meet old friends with whom in former years she had been associated in labor. Often during the Conference she was visited by groups of brethren present from some foreign conference or mission field, who conveyed to her personally their greetings, and reported the progress of the third angel's message in the fields they represented. Thus opportunity was afforded nearly all from abroad, both old friends and those who had never before made her acquaintance, to assure her of their courage in God and of their determination to do their part in the finishing of the work.",
