A portion of this manuscript appears in Manuscript Release No. 714.) \n\n\n     Our meeting is nearly closed in this place. We are encamped in a cottonwood grove, in a very pleasant, retired spot although it is only a few minutes' walk to the business part of the city. There is a swift running stream of clear water that half encircles the camp. We are on the bank of the stream very pleasantly located. We have a large tent fifteen by twenty-two. Professor Brownsberger and Willie occupy one end of the tent; Sister Ings and I the other end. We have the best arrangement for meals and for order we have had on any encampment. And we needed good food.",
