He has devoted his interest \n                                                                           98\nalmost entirely to the building up of the cause of God, regardless of his own personal interests, and at the sacrifice of social enjoyment with his family. In his devotion to the cause, he has frequently endangered his health and life. He has been so much pressed with the burden of this work that he has not had suitable time for study, meditation, and prayer. God has not required of him to be in this position, even for the interest and progress of the work of publishing at Battle Creek. There are other branches of the work, other interests of the cause, that have been neglected through his devotion to this one. God has given us both a testimony which will reach hearts. He has opened before me many channels of light, not only for my benefit, but for the benefit of his people at large. The Lord has also given my husband great light upon Bible subjects, not for himself alone, but for others. I saw that these things should be written and talked out, and new light would continue to shine upon the word. I saw that we could accomplish tenfold more to build up the cause, in laboring among the people of God, bearing the varied testimony to meet the wants of the cause of God in different places and under different circumstances, than to remain at Battle Creek. Our gifts are needed in the same field in writing and \n                                                                           99\nin speaking. While my husband is overburdened, as he has been, with an accumulation of cares and financial matters, his mind cannot be as fruitful in the word. And he will be liable to be assailed by the enemy, for he is in a position where there is a constant pressure, and men and women will be tempted, as were the Israelites, to complain and murmur against him who stands in the most responsible position to the cause and work of God. While standing under these burdens that no other one would venture to take, he has sometimes, under the pressure of care, spoken without due consideration and with apparent severity. He has sometimes censured those in the Office because they did not take care. And when needless mistakes have occurred, he has felt that indignation for the cause of God was justifiable in him. This course has not always been attended with the best results. It has sometimes resulted in a neglect to do the very things which they should do, for fear they should not do them right, and then would be blamed for it. Just as far as this has gone, the burden has fallen heavier upon my husband.",
