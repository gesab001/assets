    "word": "At half past five in the afternoon we reached College View where I was made very comfortable. Here I met several of my old friends. I spoke once in the sanitarium and twice at the church. There was a large congregation at the church at every meeting. Many came from Lincoln and from other places for miles around, and all the available space in the church was filled. The first time I addressed the people I spoke for about one hour, presenting the need of harmony in our work. It seems that there has not been harmony between the church and the sanitarium. I can assure you that I am deeply pained as I see that things have been moving in a kind of systematic discord. This service is not acceptable to God, and His name is greatly dishonored. But I am sure that the people will be helped to see matters in a different light than heretofore. I spoke to them about the matter of legal quarreling. This is disloyalty to God and disloyalty to one another.",
