    "word": "Washington, D. C., Friday, December 19, 1890 \n\n     We left Lynn Thursday night at four for Boston, from which place we took cars for Washington. . . . We found in the morning that we would not arrive at Washington until three hours behind time. We stopped one hour in Baltimore. We arrived in Washington about three o'clock and were so thankful to get baggage and all to the mission before the hours of the Sabbath. We decided that we would not start a journey so close to the Sabbath again. We would make arrangements to get to our destination having one day's leeway. There was no one at \n\n\n                                    -47- \n\nthe depot to meet us. The porter put us in a hack and we came to the mission all right, and could commence the Sabbath without anxiety and confusion. The friends had been to the depot twice for us and the delay confused them. They were glad to receive us.",
