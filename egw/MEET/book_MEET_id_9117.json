    "word": "On Friday I had an interview with Sister Williams. She and Mabel could not both be spared from the sanitarium at the same time. Sitting for a long time in meeting seems to make Mabel feel tired and nervous, so Mabel insisted that Sister Williams come to the camp meeting while she carried on the work at the sanitarium. I know that were I in Mabel's place I should have felt the same as she did. Sister Williams told me that she would write to \n\n\n                                 -64- \n\nDr. Whitelock, and that if I desired, Mabel might come to Los Angeles for a few days.",
