    "word": "Brooklyn, New York, Sunday, November 16, 1890. I spoke to a full house at eleven o'clock Sabbath a.m. with much freedom. I do not think I have ever seen a better class of people before me. There was nobility and intelligence. We had a good social meeting. Many excellent testimonies were borne. The sisters Charlotte and Sarah Haskins, whom I knew in my youth, were present to hear me. I was glad to meet them. Spoke from John 15.",
