    "word": "I attended early morning meeting. Notwithstanding we had a shower this morning, there was a good attendance. Again I felt the burden of supplication and the evidence that if we call upon the Lord in faith the promise would be verified, If ye seek the Lord with all your heart He will be found of you. The whole being must be put on the Lord's side, under His control. There must be no reservation of mind, thoughts, or affections. \n                                                                           462\nJesus requires all that there is of us--soul, body, mind, and strength. The Lord blessed me and I felt like praising the Lord. I said a few words in regard to expressing our thanksgiving to God, and many precious testimonies were borne, expressing their thanks for the great mercy and love of God.",
