    "word": "Any Moves Should Leave a Positive Influence on the Cause of God. --After the council meeting [in Stanmore, NSW, Australia] I saw quite a change being made. As I told you, there was a transferring of workers and our Counselor was saying that the same men should not continue a length of time in one place. The health of the Cause and the working out of the plans of God demanded that the same gifts in labor in certain lines of work, should not continue a length of time. There were families with their goods being drawn away to be transported to other places. There was a necessity for this in order to leave a positive influence on the work and the cause of God, and its advancement. I would encourage the movement you suggest, and believe the Lord is in Elder [A.G.] Daniells' moving to Sydney at this time, and the Lord will tell him what to do next.--Letter 63a, 1898, p. 1. (To W. C. White, August 12, 1898.) \n\n\n                                     -11-",
