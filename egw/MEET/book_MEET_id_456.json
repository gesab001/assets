    "word": "We can go to the camp-meeting, not merely to receive, but to impart. Every one who is a partaker of Christ's pardoning love, every one who has been enlightened by the Spirit of God and converted to the truth, will feel that for these precious blessings he owes a debt to every soul with whom he comes in contact. Those who are humble in heart the Lord will use to reach souls whom the ordained ministers cannot reach. They will be moved to speak words which reveal the saving grace of Christ.--Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 43.",
