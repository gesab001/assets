    "word": "Chap. XXXVII - Public Labors in 1877\n\n     May 11, 1877, we left Oakland, Cal., for Battle Creek, Mich. A telegram had been sent to my husband, requesting his presence at Battle Creek, to give attention to important business relative to the cause. In answer to this summons, he went, and engaged earnestly in preaching, writing, and holding board meetings at the Review Office, the College, and the Sanitarium, often working into the night. This wore him fearfully. His constant mental anxiety was preparing the way for a breakdown. We both felt our danger, and decided to go to Colorado to enjoy retirement and rest.",
