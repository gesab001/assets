    "word": "I had some straight messages to bear to different individuals [at Bethel, Vermont] which had their effect. When we parted, we parted in love, and union prevailed among nearly all. Thursday afternoon [Nov. 6] we left Royalton and took the cars for Waterbury. We changed cars at Northfield and as we stepped from the cars, met Brother Baker. He came with us to Waterbury. Found Brethren Loveland and Lindsay waiting for us at the depot. We went about two miles to Brother Butler's, stopped there a few hours for refreshment, and went eight miles in the eve toward Johnson and stopped with Sister Benson that night, and the next day went on to Johnson, the place appointed for the conference. Some had already arrived to attend the meetings.",
