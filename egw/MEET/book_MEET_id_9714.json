    "word": "Christ was tempted in all points as we are tempted. Let those who are bowed down under trial and temptation, and who feel that their friends have forsaken them, think of Christ, of whom God said, \"This is My beloved Son,\" alone in the wilderness, meeting temptations more severe than any that are brought against them. Let them not give up in despair, but reach out a trembling hand of faith to grasp the hand that is held out to save. Let them cast their helpless souls upon Jesus, who, because He has passed over the ground knows how to deliver them that are tempted.--Letter 159, 1903.\n\nEllen G. White Estate\nSilver Spring, Maryland\nMay 10, 1990. Entire Letter.",
