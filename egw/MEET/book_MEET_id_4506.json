    "word": "The celebration of these ordinances is the fulfilling of the command, \"If I, then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. . . .\" What a place is this for hushing controversies, for forgiving those who have done us any injury. This is the time, if one has anything against his brother, to make it right, to settle every difficulty. Let there be mutual forgiveness. Let no strange flame be brought to the altar. Let no malice, no hatred, be cherished by those who meet round the communion table.",
