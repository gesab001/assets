    "word": "The brethren in Melbourne are considering the matter of securing land upon which to build a humble house of worship. The halls which can be obtained are neither convenient nor suitable for the worship of God. We are glad that the number of Sabbathkeepers is increasing to such an extent that the halls are not large enough to accommodate those who assemble on the Sabbath for the worship of God. We should have places of meeting so that on Sunday those who are inclined to hear the truth might come out to the services. The Lord has many souls in Melbourne and its suburbs who have not yet heard anything in regard to present truth. They have not heard the warning message of the third angel, but it must be given to the people, and we must do all that lies \n\n\n                                     -166- \n\nin our power to proclaim the message.",
