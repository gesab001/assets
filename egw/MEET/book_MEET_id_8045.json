    "word": "We had to here meet a party, true immersionists and a party of these spasmodic ones who consider that religion consists in a noise. They shout \n\n\n                                    -60- \n\nand bellow and foam and act like men bereft of their reason. This was called the power, but I told them there was no religion in it. It was a spurious article. This is modern sanctification, but it is as opposite to genuine sanctification as light is in contrast with darkness.",
