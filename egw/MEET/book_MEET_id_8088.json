    "word": "Our camp meeting has been good. One hundred and fifty Sabbathkeepers camped on the ground. It is beautiful encampment upon an island. The falls is within a few feet of the campground, and the fall of water is rather too distinctly heard. . . . It is excessively hot. We are encamped in a grove belted with underbrush, which makes it impossible to get much air. It has seemed as though we should dissolve. . . . I must now go upon the stand to speak. Yesterday, Sunday, I spoke to the crowd for one hour and a half. The people listened with great attention, although there was scarcely a breath of air stirring. My clothing was wet through.--Letter 22a, 1879, p. 1. (To \"Dear Children Addie and May Walling,\" July 14, 1879.) \n\nReleased July 20, 1972.",
