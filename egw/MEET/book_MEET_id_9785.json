    "word": "Sabbath morning early I went into meeting and the Lord gave me a testimony directly to them, all unexpected to me. I poured it out upon them, showing them that the Lord sent His ministers with a message, and the message they brought was the very means God had ordained to reach them, but they felt at liberty to pick it in pieces and make of none effect the Word of God. They had run over Brethren Colcord and Van Horn, but they must hear the words from God we brought them. We did not propose to ask them what we should present before them. We came to bring the message of God to them, and we should not abate one word of the testimony given to please any of them. This had already been done until they felt at liberty to sit in judgment upon every sermon preached. We did not come to have them preach to us but we came with \n\n\n                                     -204- \n\na message to them, and we should give them the word of the Lord.",
