    "word": "Brother Robinson and Farman and Brother Whitters were left at Norwich. They were willing I should come, greatly desired I should be here, and yet felt that it was a pity I could not be at Norwich over another Sabbath. I spoke five times, speaking three evenings and on Sabbath and Sunday. Wednesday night I was to speak. There were not many out. It snowed all forenoon, then at noon it began to rain, and towards night it just poured in torrents, and the walks were icy and very slippery. I had not far to go to get to the meeting, but I had to cross ditches, and the water and slush were over my rubbers, but I meant to be at the meeting. I related some of my earlier experiences in connection with the work and cause of God, and it was thought the meeting did much good.",
