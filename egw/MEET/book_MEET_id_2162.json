    "word": "The Educational Process. \n     125. In reforms we would better come one step short of the mark than go one step beyond it. And if there is error at all, let it be on the side next to the people. . . . We must go no faster than we can take those with us whose consciences and intellects are convinced of the truths we advocate. We must meet the people where they are. . . . But we should be very cautious not to advance too fast, lest we be obliged to retrace our steps. . . . If we come to persons who have not been enlightened in regard to health reform, and present our strongest positions at first, there is danger of their becoming discouraged as they see how much they have to give up, so that they will make no effort to reform. We must lead the people along patiently and gradually, remembering the hole of the pit from which we were digged.-- T., V. III, pp. 20, 21.",
