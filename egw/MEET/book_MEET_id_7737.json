    "word": "We had a pleasant passage on the steamer, and were not at all sick. On Wednesday morning we drew near Launceston, but on account of the low tide we were obliged to anchor out ten miles from the city. While thus anchored a small ferry boat drew up alongside. We were pleased to see on board the ferry Brother and Sister Teasdale. They had been holding some meetings twenty miles from Launceston, and we met them providentially as we lay anchored. We had our baggage placed on the ferry, and boarded it ourselves, and arrived in Launceston about noon. . . .",
