    "word": "A few miles from Redlands there are cities that have never been worked. Riverside is eight miles from Loma Linda. We have treatment-rooms there. They are not extensive, but are large enough to accommodate the people of that city. While we were in Redlands last year, we drove to Riverside, a distance of eleven miles, and I spoke in our church there. At this place our people have a very nice meeting house. We drove over in order to see the country. We passed through acres of orange groves. It was a beautiful and interesting sight; for the trees were loaded with fruit. I never saw anything like it before. We returned to Redlands on the trains, and again we passed through miles of orange land, the trees laden with their beautiful, golden fruit. We saw also large groves of (275) grapefruit and lemon trees.",
