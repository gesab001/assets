    "word": "Sister White.--That is just the way it was in Christ's teaching. There would not be anything like a controversy; and after you have answered their questions, be sure that they acknowledge \n\n\n                        -44- \n\nthat they are answered. Do not let the question drop; do not tell them to ask it again. But feel your way, and find out how much you have gained. When any come in with a spirit of controversy, tell them that the meeting is not appointed for that purpose; but that it is to educate those that have been listening and could not understand some things in the discourses. It is not to get in their doctrinal and controverted points. What are our camp-meetings put in different places for?--It is that the people may be educated; and special effort may be made for the unbelievers. They should be sought out, and you should tell them, Now we would like to have you (the unbelievers) come in to our special meetings.",
