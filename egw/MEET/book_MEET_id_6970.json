    "word": "A Deeper Consecration \n\n     Last night I seemed to be in a meeting where there were present leading men who were asking questions concerning the sanitarium work; and I had many things to say to them regarding the sacredness of this work. I told them that the Lord desired us to consecrate ourselves unreservedly to Him, and that in this work everything like lightness and trifling was out of place, because we are preparing for the serious events that will come in the future. I was deeply in earnest in telling them that they were to take their position decidedly to maintain a high standard as men and women who are preparing for victory. In the future many trying experiences will arise, and we must be ready to meet them.",
