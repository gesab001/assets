    "word": "The Sydney church have not a meetinghouse; they have been dependent upon halls in which to assemble to worship God. But the camp meeting recently held so near Sydney, which is now being followed up by the house-to-house labor of the mission, has brought out fifty souls, and there are yet many interested families. We shall expect no less than one hundred souls will receive the truth. An excellent class of people is interested, and several who have taken their stand are those who depend for a living upon government situations. Some of these own their own houses and have good pay for their work, and here comes the trial of their faith.",
