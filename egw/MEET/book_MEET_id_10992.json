    "word": "Chap. 165 - To F. E. Belden \n\n     Dear Nephew,- I am very glad that the Lord is meeting you where you are, but I was sorry to read your words denying any selfishness connected with your leaving the Office, and charging me with saying that the Lord had shown me things when some one had reported them to me. All that have referred to the matter have had too much respect for me, considering your relation to me, to say much in regard to them. But I have told you the truth. If you deny it, that will not prove you to be correct. My words had no influence upon you when we were at Minneapolis, and they may have no more effect now. But I have explained my meaning.",
