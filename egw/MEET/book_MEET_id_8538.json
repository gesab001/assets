    "word": "How Ellen White Dealt With Her Helpers.--Neither Marian [Davis] nor anyone is required to do just so many hours. Whenever they ask, a day is given off, and not a word said as to whether they have put in their full time, not a question or a criticism made as to time or amount of work done. They are left individually on their own responsibility. Over and over I have repeated, \"Do not work when you do not feel well.\" I make no account of days when they do not do anything for me, whoever it may be. I never question their time, only to say, \"Let their wages go right on, when sick, when attending meetings, or when engaged in work for themselves.\"",
