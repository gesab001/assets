    "word": "4. Waste No Time on Theories of Popular Education.--\"Let no more time be lost in dwelling on the many things that are not essential, and which have no bearing upon the present necessities of God's people. Let no more time be lost in exalting men who know not the truth; 'for the time is at hand.' There is no time now to fill the mind with theories of what is popularly called 'higher education.' The time devoted to that which does not tend to assimilate the soul to the likeness of Christ, is so much time lost for eternity. This we cannot afford, for every moment is freighted with eternal interests. Now, when the great work of judging the living is about to begin, shall we allow unsanctified ambition to take possession of the heart, and lead us to neglect the education required to meet the needs in this day of peril?\"--Test., Vol. VI, p. 130.",
