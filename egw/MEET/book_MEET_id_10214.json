He attended the meeting \n\n\n                -13- \n\nand said, \"That speaker is thoroughly in earnest, and the things uttered seem to be a reality. There must be something in what is presented.\" He stated to our brethren that he was about to sail for South America, and he said, \"I will carry all the papers and pamphlets that you give me.\" Brother Loughborough furnished him with the publications. He took all we gave him.",
