    "word": "Ministers of the gospel are not to be called hither and thither to attend board meetings to decide common business questions. This has been done in the past, but this is not the work in which the Lord wishes them to engage. Let men who have not been set apart to the sacred work of the ministry take the management of financial matters. Too many financial burdens have been placed upon our ministers. When this is done, the great gospel commission is neglected. God looks upon this as a dishonor to His name.",
