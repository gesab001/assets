At the beginning of the morning hour set apart for devotional exercises, Mrs. E. G. White read a communication addressed to the president of the Union Conference, then made the following remarks.] \n\n\n     I desire to say a few words to the workers assembled at this conference. I have been passing through a serious experience. Since I spoke to you on the opening day of the meeting, I have been writing out the things that I was required to write; for the end desired could not be accomplished unless matters were brought before you plainly and decidedly, so that you might understand clearly that on the part of some there has been a disposition to go contrary to the light that God has given. This situation has brought distress to my soul, and I have been sorely perplexed. I must meet these things in the fear of God. When messages come to me for the people of God, I must not conceal them but must write them out and speak of them.",
