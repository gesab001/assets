    "word": "Visit to Scandinavia\n     At the close of the meetings at Basle the question was raised as to when we should visit the Scandinavian missions. I was weary with labor, and needed rest, having spoken twenty-two times through an interpreter, besides writing many pages. We knew that it was late in the season for a visit to these northern countries; June was said to be the best time to travel in the North, and it was planned to hold the Conferences for the next year in that month. But we were not sure that we should remain in Europe till that time, and we felt that the safest course was to visit the leading churches in Scandinavia at the earliest opportunity. The condition of some of these churches had been presented to me in years past, with many things showing that Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were promising fields for labor. We knew that a great work lay before the missionaries in this field. They desired our counsel about the different branches of the work, and we felt that we could advise with them to much better advantage after making them a visit. It seemed unwise to postpone till another summer this part of the work which we had made the long journey from America to accomplish.",
