    "word": "My children, you will meet with deplorable ignorance. Why? Because the souls that were kept in bondage were taught to do exactly the will of those who called them their property and held them as slaves. They were kept in ignorance, and were untaught. Thousands of them do not know how to read. \n\n\n                                     -6- \n\nTheir teachers are, many of them, corrupt in character, and they read the Scriptures to fulfill their own purposes, to degrade in life and practice. They are taught that they must not think or judge for themselves, but their ministers must judge for them. In their teaching the divine plan has been covered up by a mass of rubbish and falsehood and perversion of the Scriptures.",
