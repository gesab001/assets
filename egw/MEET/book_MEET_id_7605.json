But all these things will have to be taken just as they come, and the workers must remember what Jesus \n                                                                           84\ngave in coming to our world.

But if we desire that which the most of our brethren cannot receive, this injures our influence. One brother says, 'Such and such a brother has a certain wage, and I must have a wage to correspond.' And so the wages will climb, and keep climbing, higher and still higher. The fact is, that the wages of some may have to be lower and still lower in order that we may meet the extensive requirements of the work that is before us in warning the world. . . .",
