    "word": "Ellen White Healed to Speak--Sabbath I thought I should rest, for my head was discharging bloody matter all the time and felt strangely. I sent word to Brother Smith not to depend on me at all, for I should not go to meeting Sabbath. But he went out in the country to Athens [Michigan]; a new church is raised up there near Sister Kelsey's. I hated to disappoint the people, so I walked down to the meetinghouse, so dizzy I found myself reeling and near falling. I tried to trust in God. I was all of a tremble, but thank the Lord this passed away, and if the Lord ever gave me the message for the people it was that time. I felt more free than I had hitherto done.--Letter 44, 1874. (To James White, July 17, 1874.)",
