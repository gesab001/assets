    "word": "The words that Christ spoke to His disciples when He sent them forth the first time, will apply to the experiences of the worker today. \u201cBehold,\u201d He said, \u201cI send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.\u201d You will need to understand how to meet all classes. \u201cBe ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\u201d \u201cHe that spared not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all (black as well as white), how shall he not,\u201d the apostle asks, \u201cwith Him also freely give us all things?\u201d Well might the apostle also ask, How shall we not all freely give Him our most devoted service?",
