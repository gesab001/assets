    "word": "Dear children, Jesus loves you and He wants you to reach the highest Christian standard. You must come out from the world and be separate, untainted by its corrupting influences. There is a large class of professed Christians who assimilate to the world, conform to its customs, its practices, its forms. It takes all their time to meet the world's forms and ceremonies and superfluities and parade, and they have no time to pray and study the heavenly chart and learn meekness and lowliness of heart in Christ's school. The outside appearance is the burden of their life. The beauty, the loveliness of character they are not laboring to obtain, for this is not necessary to meet the world's standard.",
