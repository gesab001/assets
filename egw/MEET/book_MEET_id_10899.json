    "word": "We had a very solemn meeting last Sabbath at North Fitzroy. All were so pleased to see me back in Melbourne after being in Adelaide and Ballarat three months. The Lord gave me a message for the people. The congregation was large, and we had a social meeting after the discourse. Another meeting was held in Prahran near the school building, five miles from North Fitzroy. They had a goodly number at Prahran, and an excellent meeting.",
