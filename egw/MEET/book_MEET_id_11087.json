    "word": "You each have capabilities. These have been entrusted to you by God. You are to wisely improve the talents lent you to serve and glorify Him. God knows you all by name; and your every transaction, your every word, is written in His books. This record you must meet in the day of judgment. A burden of responsibility rests upon you to help with all your God-given ability in making this school such as will meet the approval of God. But we have not established the school to be a place where students are permitted to give loose reign to their own ways and objectionable traits of character. If you do not and will not consent to be under control and behave yourselves as gentlemen, you have the privilege of returning to your homes. After we find that the school is of no benefit to you, we will arrange for you to leave by writing to your parents and friends, and those who have arranged for you to come, telling them the reason why you are sent home.",
