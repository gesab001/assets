    "word": "In His providence God impresses people to attend our tent meetings and church services. Some come from curiosity, others to criticize or ridicule. Often \n                                                                           208\nthey are convicted of sin. The word spoken in the spirit of love makes a lasting impression on them. How carefully, then, should these meetings be conducted. The words spoken should be of authority, that the Holy Spirit can impress them on minds. The speaker who is controlled by the Spirit of God has a sacred dignity, and his words are a savor of life unto life. Let not unsuitable illustrations or anecdotes be introduced into the discourse. Let the words spoken be for the edification of the hearers.--Letter 19, 1901.",
