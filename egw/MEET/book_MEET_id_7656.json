    "word": "I inquired Monday evening just before the close of the old year if Homer would be at the meeting for the youth and was told by Sister McDearmon that she feared he would not.

That in company with you he was doing that which she never allowed him to do--going to parties in the evening and not coming home until a late hour in the night. She was greatly burdened and distressed for Homer. She feared that if he did not seek the Lord during the special meetings he would go on as he had done, in careless neglect of his own soul.",
