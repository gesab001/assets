    "word": "12 (2 Timothy 3:14, 15). The Humble Dependence of Timothy.--In the history of Timothy are found precious lessons. He was a mere lad when chosen by God as a teacher; but so fixed were his principles by a correct education that he was fitted for this important position. He bore his responsibilities with Christlike meekness. He was faithful, steadfast, and true, and Paul selected him to be his companion in labor and travel. Lest Timothy should meet with slights because of his youthfulness, Paul wrote to him, \"Let no man despise thy youth.\" He could safely do this, because Timothy was not self-sufficient, but continually sought guidance.",
