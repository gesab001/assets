    "word": "I can write you only a few lines. I thank you for your letter. I was very glad to hear the good news of your camp meeting and to know that interest is still shown. I am glad that the door is not closed by any discussions or controversy. Then there is no taking sides. Those who place themselves on the wrong side seldom change to the right side, therefore there should be no controversies at our camp meetings. We are to use the strength of our words and influence to advance the truth in clear, straight lines, receiving and imparting light. As the leaven of the precious truth is introduced, it silently diffuses itself, imparting its own properties and tendencies, until the whole lump is leavened. Satan's evil leaven of unbelief will often be introduced to prevent the work of reformation [from] going on, but nevertheless the vital current of truth must constantly flow forth and impress minds.",
