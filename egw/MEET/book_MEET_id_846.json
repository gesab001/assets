    "word": "Begin at the Appointed Hour \n\n     Meetings for conference and prayer should not be made tedious. All should, if possible, be prompt to the hour appointed; and if there are dilatory ones, who are half and hour or fifteen minutes even behind the time, there should be no waiting. If there are but two present, they can claim the promise. The meeting should open at the appointed hour, if possible, be there few or many present.--Review and Herald, May 30, 1871. \n                                                                           171",
