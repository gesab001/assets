    "word": "God has sent you two of his ministers in Brethren Bourdeau and Andrews. These are men of marked experience and conscientiousness. Especially is this the case with Brother Andrews. But you have not cooperated with them as God would have you. You had your peculiar ideas, and because our American brethren did not meet your ideas in some particulars, you were jealous of them, and have not assisted them in many instances when you might have done so. The more extensive experience of these men in the workings of the cause of God demanded your respect and a willingness on your part to be instructed by them. You are responsible for making their work very much harder than it would otherwise have been. Unfortunately, Elder Bourdeau became unbalanced, which greatly injured his influence. This has been felt by you. \n\n\n                                 -317-",
