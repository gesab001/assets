    "word": "God would have His workers aim at perfection and strive earnestly for it. As they go out they will meet worldly men. Some are coarse and rough, others are intelligent and having the worldly polish. These all must have the mold of Christ's character. The people have a right to expect that the one who presents himself as a teacher of Bible truths shall be refined in manners. They will pass severe judgment upon the man who claims to be a teacher, and is not refined and courteous. He should be able to command the respect of all. Young men should go forth from the College qualified for this work by diligent study and faithful training. All bad ways and coarse ways should be avoided, and a strict guard should be placed over the mind and manners lest they fall into erroneous ways of speaking and acting.",
