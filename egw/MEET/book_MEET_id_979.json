    "word": "Promoting the Watchman.--The question has been asked, Should the Watchman occupy territory outside the Southern States? One night I seemed to be in a meeting where this question was being discussed. Some argued that it would not be wise for an effort to be made to push the circulation of the Watchman in all parts of the field. They said that the Review and Herald and the Signs of the Times should be given the right of way, and that the Watchman should not be allowed to interfere with the circulation of these two papers which have been so long in the field. They thought that our work with the Watchman should be confined to the Southern States.",
