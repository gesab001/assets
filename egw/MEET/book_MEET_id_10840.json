We have seen the salvation of God. In this round of labor I spoke fifty-five times, and some of these meetings were occasions of most earnest labor, continuing from half past two till five and six o'clock, but always successful. On one occasion I was much perplexed to know and to understand my duty. I had painful gatherings in my ear that with severe colds made it hard for me. At Salamanca, N. Y. I was severely afflicted and thought I must return home. I went to my chamber and bowed before God, and before I had even asked, the Lord heard, and revealed himself; the room seemed to be full of the light and presence of God. I was lifted out of all my discouragements, and was made free and happy. I could not sleep, but I praised God with heart and voice. This blessing was just what I needed; courage, and faith, and hope were again in lively exercise, and I went on my way rejoicing.",
