    "word": "The spasmodic, fitful movements of some who claim to be Christians are well represented by the work of a span of strong but untrained horses. When one pulls forward, an other pulls back, and at the voice of their master one plunges ahead, and the other stands immovable. If men will not move in concert in the great and grand work for this time, there will be confusion. It is not a good sign when men will not unite with their brethren, but prefer to act alone, when they will not take their brethren into their confidence, because they do not just exactly meet their mind. If man will wear the yoke of Christ, they can not pull apart. They will draw with Christ.",
