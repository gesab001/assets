    "word": "Chap. 18 - Newspaper Publicity\n\n     Publishing Discourses.--The truth presented by the living preacher should be published in as compact a form as possible, and circulated widely. As far as practicable, let the important discourses given at our camp meetings be published in the newspapers. Thus the truth which was placed before a limited number may find access to many minds. And where the truth has been misrepresented, the people will have an opportunity of knowing just what the minister said.--Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 37. (1900.)",
