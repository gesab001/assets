    "word": "My brother, we see very much need of ministerial labor in this far-off country, but we are almost destitute of ministers. There is not one qualified to enter our cities and meet the opposition who can properly do honor to the truth in presenting the reasons of our faith. We see that this work must be done, but there is such a lack of ministers that not one hundredth part of the vineyard can be worked. There are cities and villages that have never so much as heard the last message of mercy to be given to the world. There is a terrible dearth of men who will hold forth the words of life to souls who are perishing in their sins. We have the world to contend with. Said Christ, \"I have given them thy word, and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\" The ministers of the denominational churches are, many of them, false shepherds. They deceive the people. They misinterpret the Scriptures and fill the minds of the people with prejudice. While our hearts feel this deeply, we can only pray and depend on the Lord to make a place for His truth.",
