    "word": "Chap. 21 - Independent Publishing\n\n     Danger of Independent Work.--It is necessary that something should be done to guard the interests of those who believe the truth for this time. Christ has given many warnings to the effect that false doctrines, false prophets, and false christs would arise and deceive many. From the light that God has been pleased to give me, His humble servant, I know that these prophecies have been fulfilling, and testimonies have not been few that have been given to meet these things as they have come up all along through our religious experience. Great delusions will arise, and even \"of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.\" Even Satan will disguise himself, and appear as Christ.",
