    "word": "Parents, gather the rays of divine light which are shining upon your pathway. Walk in the light as Christ is in the light. As you take up the work of saving your children and maintaining your position on the highway of holiness, the most provoking trials will come. But do not lose your hold. Cling to Jesus. He says, \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me, and he shall make peace with me.\" Difficulties will arise. You will meet with obstacles. Look constantly to Jesus. When an emergency arises, ask, \"Lord, what shall I do now?\" If you refuse to storm or fret or scold, the Lord will show you the way through. He will help you to use the talent of speech in such a Christlike way that the precious attributes of patience, comfort, and love will be brought into the home.",
