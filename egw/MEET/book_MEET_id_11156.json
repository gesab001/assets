B.-161- '05 \n\nDear Brother and Sister Burden:- \n     It is just daylight, and I am seated on my couch, beginning a letter to you. Our meeting here began a day or two ago, and I think there will be a good attendance of our people. On Sabbath the brethren and sisters at Mountain View turned out well. On Sabbath morning at half past ten I spoke to a large number in the big tent.",
