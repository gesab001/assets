    "word": "The mighty cleaver of truth is separating from the world all who will accept Christ as a personal Saviour. These God brings into His workshop, and day by day with hammer and chisel He works to remove their rough edges, preparing them for a place in His kingdom. Great changes will be made in those who are taken out of the world to shine in the courts of the Lord. There is to be an inward transformation, the results of which are revealed in the outward life.

He shows that the highest aim of his life is to meet the divine standard. . . \n\n\n                                     -373-",
