    "word": "Meanwhile a camp meeting was held in Newcastle. We had feared we should have a small meeting during the holidays, but it proved to be just the time. The tent was crowded night and day. I spoke four times each week and had large congregations. The Lord has hitherto helped us. The health addresses have called out large congregations. Thirty-five have taken their stand for the truth, and they seem to be trustworthy. The net is still cast in the sea for more. I heard last night that forty were keeping the Sabbath in Newcastle, and among these there are many remarkable cases. They were taken right out of the world-men who were smokers and beer drinkers, and who have never made any profession of religion. They are soundly converted. They gave up their tobacco and their beer, and are full of hope and joy and courage in the Lord. This class never attended meetings anywhere before they kept the Sabbath.",
