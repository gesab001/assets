    "word": "I have a sense of your danger, and you need to have a sense of it. If we should sustain you in a wrong course, we would ourselves be committing sin. You may have the confidence and approval of men, but the praise of human beings is no evidence of the approval of God. It furnishes no evidence that they see as He sees. Those who trust to the praise and approval of men will end their lives without having obtained a preparedness to meet God.",
