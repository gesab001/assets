    "word": "Last evening we had several of the ministering brethren together and read a long communication from Elder Butler, which kept us up till ten o'clock at night. This morning they had an excellent social meeting. Today they have a Bible reading upon predestination or election. Tomorrow noon the law in Galatians is to be brought up and discussed. There is a good humble spirit among the delegates as far as we can learn. The letter written by Eld. Butler was a good thing to open this question so we are in for it.",
