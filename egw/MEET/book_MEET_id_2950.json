    "word": "\"We know that our sister is safe. We can leave her with Thee. Thou wilt speak in a little while, and the dead will come forth to immortality. But we pray for the living. We pray for those who are left to meet the struggles and the trials and the conflicts of these last days. How weak we are--how utterly incapable of meeting any of these things! Our hope this hour is in Thee. And we pray that the great God who has called us will fit us for His service; will nerve us for stronger effort; will give us firmer faith, more diligence, and greater grace to meet the trials and the conflicts; that He will save us from all the deceptions and allurements and snares of the enemy; that He will give us a clearer vision to see what God would have each and all to be and to do; and that He will give us speedy triumph at last at the coming of our Lord.",
