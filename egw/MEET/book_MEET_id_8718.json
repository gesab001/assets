    "word": "Oakland, California, July 23, 1880--I have been waiting to know what to write definitely in regard to my plans. I have received three letters from Bro. Burrel and I wrote him that I could not attend any of the camp meetings east. The expense of crossing the plains would be no less than three hundred dollars if I returned for camp meetings here. A dispatch came yesterday with Burrel's and Farget's name signed urging me in no case to disappoint them--my expense should be met. I may come alone. Shall leave here Monday or Wednesday. Why these particular times? So as not to be under the necessity of changing cars on the Sabbath.--Letter 35, 1880, p. 1. (To James White.)",
