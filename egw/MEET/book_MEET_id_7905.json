    "word": "We had another little parting scene. All the colporteurs and workers assembled in the house of Brother Matteson and we had a formal parting meeting. Each one said a few words of their appreciation of the meeting. They had read the books of Sister White and wanted so much to see her, and as they had listened to her testimony they had accepted the message brought to them and had been greatly benefited and much blessed of the Lord. I responded in a short talk through Brother Matteson as my interpreter. We left Stockholm about six o'clock p.m. At the depot we had the third parting scene and the cars bore us away from Sweden. We were favored with the best of accommodations and slept quite well during the night.--Ms 35, 1887, pp. 1-5. (Diary, June 23 to 28, 1887. Third Visit to Sweden.)",
