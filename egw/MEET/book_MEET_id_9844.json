    "word": "I told them that some there present had been at the meetings when the Lord had spoken through His humble servant. They had felt His power on their own hearts, and then if words of unbelief had come from those who were under temptation, inspired from beneath with a spirit of criticism and envy and evil surmising, even words from Africa from some professing our faith, they received and nurtured it, and commenced to sow the same seed of unbelief in other minds far and near, and the truth was a very mixed crop. Their hearts were weak and their faith small, and the ministry of the Word would not profit those who heard, because, like the Pharisees, they have ears but they hear not, because their ears are not sanctified, they have eyes but they see not, because Satan has interposed his hellish shadow between God and their souls.",
