    "word": "Bro. Olsen, I have the tenderest feelings toward you; but I must lay before you plainly the danger of losing your spiritual eyesight. I speak decidedly because I must tell you the truth. I dare not forbear, for there is no longer safety in delay. I have not confidence in your book committee. I have written to you before in regard to their manner of dealing with the authors of books. They should treat them impartially, candidly, as a brother would treat a brother; but they have not done this. The principles and motives of the business dealing in this department are not such as God can sanction. They are not in accordance with strict integrity. Your example has influenced Bro. C. H. Jones in his dealing with authors. In both houses a course has been pursued that is not fair and noble. Such work should be corrected as soon as possible, if you and he desire the Lord to write in regard to your transactions, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" You will be ashamed to meet your present record in the books that shall be opened when the judgment shall sit, and every man shall be judged \n                                                                           1531\naccording to his works, whether they be good or whether they be evil. Better, far better that the work be done with love and justice blended.",
