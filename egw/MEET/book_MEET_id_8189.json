    "word": "In company with Brother and Sister [E. P.] Daniels we went to Fresno, met Willie at Goshen, and he accompanied us on a freight train to Fresno. I spoke twice, Sabbath and Sunday afternoon, and I had great freedom. The hall, owned by Bro. Church, was crowded to its utmost capacity. Sunday afternoon the first men of the place were there, and also Sabbath many outsiders were there. Brother Church told me all were highly pleased. We had a meeting in the forenoon. I read to them something written in regard to the building of a church. Then I talked considerably, and asked them what they would do. Elder [E.P.] Daniels spoke after me. Before the meeting closed, thirty one thousand dollars was pledged, for the building of a church, a school, and a mission. I could not go away and see the people worshiping in a little hall owned by Bro. Church. It has done good service as yet, but it will not contain the people that come to the meetings now. . . .",
