    "word": "God will send by whom He will; His message will not return unto Him void, but will accomplish that whereunto it is sent. And if they refuse the message, the men whom God designed should hold the same relation to the younger workers as did Moses to Joshua, will fail of doing the work the Lord designed they should do. They will be a hindrance in the place of a blessing. The work will go forward; but these brethren, who might have received the richest blessings, will meet with eternal loss, for though they should repent and be saved at last, they can never regain that which they have lost through their wrong course of action. They might have been God's instruments to carry the work forward with power; but their influence was exerted to counteract the Lord's message, to make the work appear questionable. Every jot and tittle of this will have to be repented of.",
