    "word": "Brooklyn, New York, ca. Friday, November 14, 1890 \n                         Letter to Albert Harris \n\n\n     Willie and Sarah and I have been attending a series of meetings. It was a trial trip with me. I did not know how I would endure the fatigue of journeying and the speaking, traveling in all kinds of weather and having to put up with all kinds of conveyances and all kinds of fare. If I have appointments they must be filled, rain or snow or sunshine. I thank my heavenly Father I have been enabled, through Christ strengthening me, to stand at my post and bear my testimony with freedom in the demonstration of the Spirit.",
