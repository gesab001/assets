    "word": "There will be those who will invest their means in our sanitariums, with the understanding that they shall be given a home there as long as they shall live. These should receive kind, Christian treatment. I have in mind a Brother Merrel, with whom we stayed while attending the San Jose camp-meeting. He has no family and lives alone. While I was at his house, he questioned me in regard to our sanitariums. Not long ago I sent him a copy of \"Ministry of Healing,\" and asked him to communicate with you if he had means that he could lend to the Sanitarium. Have you received any word from him? I asked him for a loan of five thousand dollars. If such a man could invest his means in the Sanitarium, and make the institution his home, I think it would be a wise move. He is a business man, and I think is pretty careful as to how he invests his means. I thought that if I asked him to lend me some money, he might respond, but as yet I have received no word from him.",
