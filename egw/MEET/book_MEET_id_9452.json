    "word": "[In essence Jesus was saying], \"I have not come to destroy the law, but to show its immutability, and the holiness of its claims. God could not change His law to meet man in his fallen condition. By suffering the penalty of transgression, I will redeem the race. I have become man's Substitute and Surety. I have taken human nature, and have come to this earth to pass over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell. In humanity I will bear the test and proving of God.",
