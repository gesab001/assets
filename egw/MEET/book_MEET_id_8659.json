    "word": "I will tell you when I know that God helps me. It is when I feel utterly unable physically to speak to the people. I go out so weak at times that it seems to me that I could not utter a word. As I stand before the people the blessing of God never fails me. The Lord uses the frail instrument to speak to the people.--Manuscript 49, 1894, pp. 10-13. (Camp Meeting, Ashfield, Australia, November 3, 1894.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C., Oct. 31, 1980",
