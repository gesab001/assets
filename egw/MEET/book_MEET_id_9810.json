At this time Salem was the largest city in the Northwest, with a population of about 6,000.) \n\n\n     Your card came yesterday. Glad to learn that you were as well as could be expected. I am in some respects improving in health. The meeting opened this morning at six o'clock. We did not get upon the ground till the ten o'clock meeting. Elder Loughborough spoke from these words: \"What think ye, that He will not come to the feast?\" John 11:56. I was not present. In the afternoon I addressed the people with freedom.",
