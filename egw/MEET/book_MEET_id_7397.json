WHITE TO THE GENERAL CONFERENCE \n    COMMITTEE, WITH QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AT THE SUMMER \n    MEETING, LAKE GOGUAC NEAR BATTLE CREEK MICH.. JULY \n    14, 1890. \n\n\n     Our camp-meetings are a power when they are held in a place where the community is stirred: and they have a great deal more power there than they have among our own people. Advantage should be taken of the impression that is made by our camp-meetings. If something is done that will keep up the interest, many souls might be secured. It is as much our duty to look to the after-interest of a camp-meeting as it is to look after the present interests: because the next time you go, if people were impressed and convicted, and did not yield to that conviction, it is harder to make an impression on their minds than it was before, and you cannot reach them again.",
