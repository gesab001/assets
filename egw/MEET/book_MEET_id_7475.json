    "word": "I was shown the case of Bro. Buck. He feels unhappy. He is dissatisfied with his brethren. His mind has been exercised for some time that it was his duty to carry the message. He is capable, as far as his knowledge of the truth is concerned. He has the ability, but he lacks culture. He has not controlled himself. It requires great wisdom to deal with minds. Bro. Buck is not qualified for this work. He understands the theory, but has not educated himself in forbearance, patience, gentleness, kindness, and true courteousness. If things arise which do not meet his mind, he does not stop and consider whether it is not wisdom to take no notice of it, and let it pass for the present until it shall be fully considered. He braces himself at once for battle. He is harsh, severe, denunciatory. He raises disturbance at once, if things do not meet his mind.",
