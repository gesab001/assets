Burden: \n\n\"Dear Brother,-- \n     I am instructed to say that in our educational work, there is to be no compromise in order to meet the world's standards. \n\n\n                              -494- \n\nGod's commandment-keeping people are not to unite with the world, to carry various lines of work according to worldly plans and worldly wisdom. \"Our people are now being tested as to whether they will obtain their wisdom from the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, or seek to the god of Ekron. Let us determine that we shall not be tied by so much as a thread to the educational policies of those who do not discern the voice of God, and who will not hearken to His commandments.",
