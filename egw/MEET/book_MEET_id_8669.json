    "word": "Brother and Sister Prescott, there is a work for both of you to do in reaching souls. Learn what it is. Brother Prescott, the Lord has a message for you to give to His people in regard to the preparation that must be made for the coming of the Lord. In the fourth chapter of Hosea the state of the inhabitants of the land is set forth. \"The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly\" (Zephaniah 1:14). God has given you a message to bear in our camp meetings and in other assemblies. Your work is not in the schoolroom, but before the gatherings of God's people. There are plenty who cannot teach the truth in public. You have a message that will be adaptable for the highest and the most lowly.",
