    "word": "It was arranged that I should go to Roxbury and there relate my message. I found a large company collected in a private house. I felt the opposition that existed in the hearts of my brethren and sisters, yet in the strength of the Lord delivered my unpopular message. As I was speaking, a sister who had been opposed to me, arose and interrupted me. She grasped my hand, saying, \"I said that the Devil sent you, but I can doubt no longer,\" and she declared to those present that I was a child of God, and that he had sent me. All in the meeting were greatly blessed. The power of the Lord attended the testimony, and every heart was comforted and refreshed. T. Haskins who had usually led in their meetings, arose with his countenance beaming with joy, and said, \"The same power attends this, that attended the truth in 1844. I do not expect to find another so green a spot this side of our \n                                                                           68\ndeliverance.\" We next visited Bro. Nichols' family in Dorchester, and had a meeting there of the deepest interest. Again H. testified that the Lord had abundantly blessed him, and that he could go forty days on the strength he there received. But T. was exerting his influence to discourage and close up my way by spreading lying reports concerning me. H., who had been made so happy as he received my testimony, fell under the influence of T., and as his mind turned, he became unsettled, then unstable. It was evident that he was rejecting the counsel of God against himself. He seemed unhappy, and finally went into the spiritual view of the second advent, and received the grossest errors, neglected his family, took a spiritual wife, and his lawful wife died of a broken heart.",
