    "word": "I sometimes think it may not be long before I lay off the armor, but I am not concerned about this matter. I want to work while life lasts. I see a great work to be done near where we are located. In the city of Maitland, a beautiful place twenty-seven miles from Cooranbong, our next New South Wales camp meeting will be held. The roads to Maitland are steep and mountainous, but they are being improved, and will soon be quite passable. \n\n\n                                   -130- \n\nAt the close of our camp meeting in Toowoomba, Queensland, and in Maitland, meetings will be carried on in Newcastle, where a neat house of worship has been built. Hamilton is a large suburb of Newcastle. Adamstown and Lampton, suburbs of the same city, are waiting to be worked. Mr. Arnott, the manufacturer of the Arnott's biscuits, or crackers, resides in Lampton. The homes of many of the wealthy are in this suburb.",
