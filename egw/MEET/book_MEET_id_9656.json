    "word": "God looks for fruit in His church--fruit that responds to the lessons of Christ, worthy of the truth we profess to believe, and revealing the wisdom and the mercy of Christ. The Lord calls for a converted ministry--a ministry that will meet the people where they are, that will agree with them wherever they can, but that will not deny the truth. We are not to keep ourselves shut within four walls, so that our light cannot come to others. There is common ground where we may meet those not of our faith, where we may agree in principles and in regard to the lessons of Christ. Few will become combative over these holy principles.",
