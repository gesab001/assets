Monday, May 22, 1876, On The Train Between Oakland and Sacramento, En Route to the Kansas Camp Meeting, Ellen White to Mary Kelsey-White or Mary Clough \n\n\n     Dear Mary : We are all cheerful and comfortably located in the cars. We like our situation very much. I owe Frank one dollar. Please pay him, and charge to me. Ask Sister Rice to cut out a pattern of the basque she fitted for me. Send a copy to Kansas and have one nicely secured at Oakland. You need not send Walks and Homes of Jesus [BY DANIEL MARCH.] when you send the books I laid out.--Letter 27a, 1876.",
