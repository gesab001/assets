    "word": "Our camp meetings should not be held again and again in the same places. Carry the message into new cities. If necessary, we must expend less means in the few places where the message has been quite fully preached, that we may go out into other places where the warning has not been given, and where men and women are ignorant of the great crisis that is about to come to all who live upon the earth. We have the word of truth-- the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus--to give to the people of this generation.",
