I will get a couple of hundred pounds of grapes, and make [them] into jelly, that they can use on \n\n\n                                 -283- \n\ntheir bread. Now see what others can do. Each can do a little, and send to Brother Hare. When you visit the place, you can take some things, and we will prepare some things and send them before that time. We will make this a thank offering to God because we are permitted to live in localities where we can obtain these things and enjoy them. I think the Lord would bless us in doing this.",
