    "word": "Letter 311, 1904 (To J. H. Kellogg, Nov. 25, 1904, from San Diego, Calif.) You say that you have written me several letters, but have not heard from me. I have not been well for some time. I was unfortunate in taking cold when speaking in the large tent at the Omaha [Nebraska] camp meeting. The ground was high and dry, but still I caught cold. I spoke twice at that camp meeting, and succeeded in making the people hear, though at one meeting there were 1500 present.",
