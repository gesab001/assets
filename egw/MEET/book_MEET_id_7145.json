    "word": "PH038 - Important Testimony (1903)\n\n\n             Important Testimony \n\nDear Brethren and Sisters in the Churches which are always to be united as one Church in Christ Jesus:-- \n\n     You have not received that education which it is the will of God that you should have received, because you have not been eating of the Bread of Life which came down from heaven. Had you studied the Word of God diligently, you would have been convinced that unity and harmonious action is always to be preserved if you would advance in the grace and the knowledge of the truth. If your understanding had been enlightened, and your eye single to the glory of God, your own selfish ideas would have been dispelled; the eyes of your understanding would have been opened to the secrets of the great spiritual agencies in the church. Your drawing apart--one small church from another small church--has grieved the Holy Spirit of God. For years the plan of heaven has not been met, and time has weakened the influence of the Message. The commission to you who have come to a knowledge \n\n                    (2) \n\nof the binding claims of the law of God, is now to reach a higher standard than that which has hitherto been reached. The differences which have existed have left an unfavorable impression upon the minds of those who attend your meetings.",
