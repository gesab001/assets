    "word": "In your council meetings and committee meetings, decisions are made, plans devised and matured, which, when put into practice, will leave an impress on the work at large; and no vestige of a spirit of harshness should appear. Loud, impatient words should never be heard. Remember that in all your council meetings there is a heavenly Watcher. Do not allow one word of vanity to be spoken; for you are legislating for God, and he says to you, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" \n                                                                           1564",
