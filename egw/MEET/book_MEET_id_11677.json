    "word": "Opposition Against Making Nashville a Center. \n\n     In a meeting presented before me for three successive nights while I was in Fresno, I saw that there was a confederacy, as it were, of men in Nashville who were united in sentiment, and who were sustained by some of the brethren in Graysville. The wicked work of this confederacy was laid open before me. There are several who have never been reconciled to the plan of making Nashville a center. I could mention names, but will not do so now. The Lord knows their names, and he can not endorse their works.",
