    "word": "What was my surprise to learn that the light I had in Salamanca was given me some time before this meeting was held. The Lord had prepared the way for me to return to Battle Creek and bear my message in the early morning meeting, directly after the evening meeting. I had been shown that steps would be taken to have the Sentinel no longer speak boldly upon the question of the true Sabbath of the Lord. The circumstances were such that on this occasion the excuse could not possibly be used, \"Somebody has told her.\" No one had an opportunity to see me or speak with me between the evening meeting and the morning meeting that I attended. [ELLEN WHITE'S POSITION IS VERY CLEAR. SHE BELIEVED THAT GOD SUPERNATURALLY LED IN THIS EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THE DETAILS OF THE SECRET MIDNIGHT MEETING WERE REVEALED TO HER BEFORE IT TOOK PLACE, AND BECAUSE SHE WAS ABLE TO RELATE THAT INFORMATION PUBLICLY BEFORE ANYONE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HER ABOUT IT. SHE MADE NO POINT OF THE TIME WHEN SHE RECORDED THESE DETAILS IN HER DIARY.]",
