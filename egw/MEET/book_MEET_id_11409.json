    "word": "The time spent by the officials of San Francisco in investigating the frauds of some of their officers has been, in the providence of God, a precious opportunity for Brethren Simpson and Hibbard to present the truth to large congregations in the city of Oakland. Before these brethren began their series of meetings, Elder Haskell and wife were holding meetings in the large tent in Oakland, following up the work of the camp meeting, and instruction (classes) some who wished to learn how to do Bible work. This was a successful meeting. The Lord manifested His power and grace. Elder Hibbard assisted Elder Haskell in his work, speaking at the evening meetings. This brought the truth before the people of Oakland in clear lines; and the work was continued until Elder Simpson commenced his tent effort.",
