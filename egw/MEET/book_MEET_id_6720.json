    "word": "Guard the Work Sacredly.--Many things have been presented to me. I was shown that there is a work to be done for the most depraved class, but that this matter must be most carefully guarded, so that the labor put forth shall not be in vain. Young men and young women should not be exposed, as many have been, in meeting the abandoned classes. Decided restraints are to be made, for there are positive dangers to be met. There is need of sacredly guarding the work. In the work for the lower class the strongest precautions should be observed. There are many who should not go into the large cities to work for the most depraved.--Manuscript 17, 1901.",
