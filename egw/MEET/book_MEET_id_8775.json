    "word": "MR No. 899 - Filled with the Spirit of Christ's Second Advent\n\n     We are looking for the second coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. We are not only to believe that the end of all things is at hand. We are to be filled with the spirit of Christ's advent, that when the Lord comes, He may find us ready to meet Him, whether we are working in the field, or building a house, or preaching the Word; ready to say, \"Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us\" (Isaiah 25:9).-- Letter 25, 1902, p. 7. (To Those in Positions of Responsibility in the Southern Field, Feb. 5, 1902.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. December 10, 1981",
