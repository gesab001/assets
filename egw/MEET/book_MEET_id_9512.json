    "word": "Your letter came, and I have read it carefully. I am surprised that Miss Sanderson should do as she has done. I have no recollection of ever meeting Miss Sanderson, and as I have not the slightest recollection of her nor of any interview I may have had with her, of course I cannot speak of what I have said to her. I only remember that I have been consulted by several in regard to the five-years course, and in every case they presented facts of circumstances, of duties at home to parents, or some sensible objection.",
