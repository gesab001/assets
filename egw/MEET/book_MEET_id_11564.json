This is a living subject with me. I hope that our people will not stop to question about everything that does not exactly meet their ideas before giving to the work that needs their help so much. I have tried to bring before our people the needs of the Training School at Huntsville. This school should have special advantages, and our people should understand that liberal gifts made to this enterprise will be money well invested.",
