    "word": "Counsels Regarding Caring for One's Health.--I hope you will guard carefully against taking cold. It made me very sad to read what you wrote about being able to talk just a little to the students while at Berrien Springs. You must not expose yourself. It is too serious a matter for you to run any \n\n\n                                     -48- \n\nrisks. It pays to cherish every jot of strength that you have. Refuse to sit up late at night on committee meetings. Give your body a fair chance, and you will then have much clearer spiritual discernment. I hope that you will be more concerned in regard to standing on vantage ground physically.-- Letter 199, 1902, pp. 2,3. (To W. C. White, December 14, 1902.)",
