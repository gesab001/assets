    "word": "Read the eighth chapter of Second Corinthians in the churches, and see if they will not catch the inspiration of liberality. God will help His people to see things in a correct light, and to meet the pressing emergencies which arise in aggressive warfare. As they give liberally of the Lord's entrusted means, they will learn that as they impart they receive. God will give to them that they may give to others.",
