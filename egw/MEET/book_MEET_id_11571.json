    "word": "The meeting at Berrien Springs was an occasion of great perplexity to many of our brethren. It was a time of heavy burden and taxing labor for me. The Lord strengthened me and gave me power to stand before the people and speak words of counsel and encouragement. A special message of hope and courage was given for the men at Battle Creek. Oh, why did they not lay hold of it! There was opportunity for them to be placed upon vantage ground. Why did they not appreciate this opportunity? Greater evidence will not be given them that God is calling for a change of attitude. Some good confessions were made, but some chose to justify themselves and demanded confessions from their brethren.",
