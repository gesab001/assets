    "word": "We are praying for the Lord to open the way for His work to be accomplished in this place. We must first bend all our energies to have our school buildings completed. The Lord will make a way for us to do this. The meetinghouse will have to wait until more money comes in. Then our Health Home must be thoroughly established. A meetinghouse must be built in Sydney also. All these things we shall accomplish as the Lord opens the way. We shall ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally. We have Daniel's prayer and its results to help us in our conceptions of the willingness of God to help all who come unto Him. \"Watch and pray,\" are the words of Christ, \"lest ye enter into temptation.\"",
