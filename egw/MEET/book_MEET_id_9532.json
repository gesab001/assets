    "word": "The same interest is still manifested in the meetings in Stanmore. During the coming week, there is to be a baptism. Since the camp meeting I have visited Stanmore often, and have spoken eight times on Sabbath and Sunday afternoons. The interest is wide and extended. Brother Wilson and wife, Brother Starr and wife, and Brother Haskell and wife are all working in the mission, educating workers to give Bible readings. Brother Baker has the care principally of the churches in Ashfield, Parramatta, and other places. Two men are employed to care for the tent in Stanmore. There is quite a large family in the mission. One room, a large front parlor, is a meeting room. One room has been fitted up very pleasantly for me. I furnish it.",
