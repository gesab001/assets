    "word": "Basel, Nov. 21, 1885. Sabbath. At the close of Sabbath I opened my diary again. Today has been a day of weariness to me. Sabbath school was held in the forenoon. Brother Aufranc spoke to the people in French. In the afternoon I spoke to those assembled from John 3:14, 15. The Lord gave me strength and grace to address the people. Brother John Vuilleumier and an educated German \n\n\n                                    -330- \n\ntranslated into both languages for the benefit of the French and of the Germans. The Spirit of the Lord seemed to be in our midst. We then had [a] social meeting. Many good testimonies were borne. These testimonies were translated to us.",
