    "word": "[Verses 16-19, quoted.] \n     I send you these words that you may be encouraged to press forward when great difficulties arise. Preserve your health. We must be prepared to meet every conceivable form of the working of Satan. I am called upon to lift the danger signal, and I call upon you, Elder Butler, to bear a plain testimony before the people. But do not speak lengthily, for this wearies you, and those who hear cannot remember what is said so well as if the talks were shorter. Let your discourses be short and right to the point. May the Lord help you and me to speak the word of truth plainly and clearly.--Letter 219, 1903. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Sept. 3, 1987. Entire Letter.",
