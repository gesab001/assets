    "word": "Be sure, my brother, that the testimonies of reproof that the Lord has given to Battle Creek are to be carefully considered. Avoid everything that \n                                                                           323\nin the past has made such reproofs necessary. Healdsburg College need not now have been loaded with debt if the expenses had been carefully considered, and the outlay made proportionate to the income. It will not answer to incur debt during the very first term of school [Avondale]. This warning was given to Battle Creek, but it was not heeded. Debts were piled up which should never have been incurred. Term after term the same mistake has been made, yet they continue to follow former arrangements. This is not wise management. Much more careful pioneering must be done here [Avondale] than was done at Healdsburg or at Battle Creek. It is an easy thing to place the expense of the students very low, but it is not so easy to make the outgo meet the income. Haphazard work cannot be done in this school. We have not the funds to draw that the schools in America have, and there is need for the greatest economy. Those who are traveling, in the place of favoring themselves with a meal at an expensive hotel, should buy some bread and fruit, and thus save a shilling. Letter 89, 1897, pp. 8, 9.
