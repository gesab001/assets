We have had excellent meetings, but I cannot give you a full report, for I have gone to those meetings only at which I have spoken. I came to the Conference with fear and trembling, but determined to do my best. I have spoken ten times, and have done considerable writing. Night after Night I have been up writing as early as two o'clock, and yet I am doing well healthwise.",
