    "word": "When there are those who condescend to take this position, any words would be lost upon them. I will not answer them. They shall not drag me into the mire of Satan with them. If they think that the testimonies originate as Canright claims--that he could give me a testimony--then the sooner they take their position on the dragon's side of the question the less danger of others being deceived by their disguised words. There are now everywhere surmisings of evil that have not the slightest foundation in truth, yet hearts opened to receive darkness have darkness to form chapters in their experience that lie registered in the heavenly courts. Yet the most wonderful lies Satan could invent were received as truth. If indeed the truth sanctifies the soul, much more of its divine principles was needed at that meeting to soften hearts, to mold character, to reveal Christ abiding in the heart by living faith.",
