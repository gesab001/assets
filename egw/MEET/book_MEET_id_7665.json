    "word": "We had a special meeting of deep interest after I had spoken and many excellent testimonies were borne, especially from those who were earnestly seeking the Lord. It was a good meeting. On Sabbath I spoke from Matthew 11:16-27. \n\n\n                                      -6- \n\nI made a decided application of this lesson to those who had great light, precious opportunities, and wonderful privileges, and yet their spiritual growth and advancement was not in accordance with the blessings of the light and knowledge given of God. There was a solemn impression made upon the congregation, and fully two thousand persons were present. I had great freedom in speaking. In the afternoon the meetings were divided, and I hear there were excellent meetings in these divisions.",
