    "word": "When I returned home from Europe, I donated $1600.00 to the Chicago Mission and other enterprises. Since coming to this country, I have been giving almost constantly. The amount paid me for my labor by the Conference is all I would be willing to take, but it cannot cover my yearly expenses, travelling as I do, taking with me the help I must have, and making the donations I am called upon to make in nearly every place where meetings are held. I have pledged one thousand dollars towards the purchase of land for the school. Willie is in a situation similar to my own as regards giving; he has to put his name to subscriptions nearly every where we go. We are constantly meeting persons who must be helped, and if I depended alone upon that which I receive from the Conference, I should be brought into most trying places. But thank God for the light he has given me; I will take heed to it, and will endeavor to be a faithful steward.",
