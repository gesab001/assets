Prescott, February 17, 1900, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N. S. W.). \n\n\n     I have commenced several letters to you, but have not been able to finish them before something else has come in and taken all my time. I would be very much pleased to have the privilege of seeing you again here in Cooranbong. I was very sorry that Elder Waggoner did not come, but I knew that he was needed in London, and therefore we could not feel as aggrieved as we otherwise would have been. I know that there is a great work to be done in London, and I would be pleased to be with you and help you in the work.",
