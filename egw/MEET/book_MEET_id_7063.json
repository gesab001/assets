    "word": "The truth as spoken by the living preacher will have greater influence than the same matter will have when published in the papers. But both methods combined will have still greater force. It is not best plan to follow one line of efforts year after year. Change the order of things. When you give time and opportunity, Satan is prepared to rally his forces, and he will work to destroy every soul possible. Work after the meeting rather than before. Do not arouse opposition before the people have had opportunity to hear the truth and know what they are opposing. If a press could be secured to be worked during the meeting, printing leaflets, notices, and papers for distribution, it would have a telling influence.",
