    "word": "Since coming to this place, I have spoken several times. A campmeeting is in progress about a mile from the Sanitarium, and on Sabbath and Sunday afternoons and during the week I spoke. The Lord gave me strength, and there was much of His Spirit in the meeting. We leave Melrose before the meeting closes to attend a meeting in Connecticut. I shall be there for a few days only, as I am to attend a meeting in Omaha.",
