    "word": "Every one who is honored in being a steward of God should carefully guard the tithe fund. The Lord does not sanction the borrowing of this money for other purposes. It should not be drawn upon to meet the incidental expenses of the church. Let a fund be raised by regular donations for this purpose. If the members of the church exercise economy and self-denial in dress and in all their expenses, as God requires, there will be no lack of funds. The tithe will be increased, and there will be donations sufficient for all church expenses.",
