    "word": "I have received letters from Africa in which it is stated that they are willing to postpone their campmeeting to any time that we will specify, in order that they may have our presence at the meeting. They urge that we make no delay. But arrangements have been made here for the campmeeting, so that if we remain for that meeting, we must make a delay. We do not feel clear to break away from this field of labor so suddenly. After the campmeeting, I think we will join you in Africa. I have not consented to go to Africa until within a few days; but the turn that things have taken leads me almost to prefer to come to Africa, rather than to remain in this country. I dread the future, and have little courage to remain.",
