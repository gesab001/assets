    "word": "We had arranged for a meeting of the ministers alone in the evening. This was carried out and we had about seventeen assembled--ministers and their companions. Brother Bourdeau was present. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon me as I prayed for light and grace from heaven. My faith laid hold upon the promises of God.

Oh, what can we do without Jesus! How dark and lonely would be our lives! He is our only helper.",
