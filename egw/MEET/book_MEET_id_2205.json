    "word": "The Piedmont valleys have been spoken of. From the light that I have  had, there are, all through these valleys, precious souls who will receive  the truth. I have no personal knowledge of these places; but they were  presented to me as being in some way connected with God's work of the past.  He now has an advance step for this people to take. Those who labor in these  valleys must take a deep interest in their work, or they will not succeed.  The third angel is represented as flying through the midst of heaven. The  work is one that must be done quickly. They must keep in working order,  laboring intelligently and with consecration, and be prepared by the grace of  God to meet opposition. They are not only to preach, but to minister. As they  go forth to labor, they are to make personal efforts for the people, coming  heart to heart with them, as they open to them the Scriptures. There may at  first be only a few here and there who will accept the truth; but when these  are truly converted, they will labor for others, and soon, with proper  efforts, larger companies will be raised up, and the work will move forward  more rapidly.",
