    "word": "From MS. 83, 1908                    Written June 25, 1908 \n\n\n     I wish to make some statements regarding our sanitariums which I hope will not be misunderstood. The light given me is that where a sanitarium is established, there should also be a school. This can be placed near enough to the sanitarium so that the medical teachers can meet often with the students, yet it should not be so near that there will be danger of the students disturbing the patients or patrons of the health institution being a means of hindrance to the students.",
