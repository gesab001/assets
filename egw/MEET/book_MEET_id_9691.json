    "word": "Health institutions, rightly conducted, give character to our work as genuine. In every city where health reform is presented to the people there should be a limited ministry of the benefits of practical health reform, and a place provided where the sick may be treated for common ailments. The building may not be all that could be desired, but it may be fitted up to give treatment in simple lines. This simple work will prove a blessing. A good physician, who understands the simple means we used in our first practice of health reform, has done wonders even in our camp meetings. This work has always proved a blessing. If carried on under the labors of physicians and nurses, such work has given a practical sermon on health reform.",
