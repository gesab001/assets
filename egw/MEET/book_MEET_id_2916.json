    "word": "Another Test of Faith \n\n     As the school term advanced, and families gathered in so that their children might have its advantages, the Sabbath congregations became much too large for the temporary chapel above the dining-hall, in which seats had been provided for one hundred. In former years the Sabbath meetings had been held, first, in the dining-room of the Healey Hotel; and later on, in the dark, uncomfortable loft of the sawmill. The little chapel was a much better meeting-hall than the mill loft; but now it was too small. There was much discussion as to what could be done; and finally the brethren determined to erect a neat and commodious church, sufficiently large for the needs of all.",
