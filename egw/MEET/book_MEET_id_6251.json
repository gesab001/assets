CHURCH AS BABYLON: REFERENCE IS MADE TO A PAMPHLET ENTITLED, \"THE LOUD CRY OF THE THIRD ANGEL'S MESSAGE,\" PUBLISHED BY A SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST LAY MEMBER, MR. STANTON, IN THE YEAR 1893. THIS MAN, IN HIS STUDY OF THE BIBLE AND THE TESTIMONIES, FOCUSED HIS ATTENTION PRIMARILY ON THE MESSAGES OF REPROOF AND REBUKE, FORGETTING THAT GOD HAD SAID THAT \"AS MANY AS I LOVE, I REBUKE AND CHASTEN.\" REVELATION 3:19. HE CONCLUDED THAT THE TESTIMONIES OF REPROOF CONSTITUTED A MESSAGE OF REJECTION, AND THAT THOSE WHO WOULD JOIN IN SOUNDING THE LOUD CRY MUST WITHDRAW FROM THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH. THE CHURCH, HE ASSERTED, HAD BECOME BABYLON, AND THOSE WHO WOULD FINISH GOD'S WORK IN THE EARTH AND MEET THEIR LORD IN PEACE MUST SEPARATE FROM THE BODY.",
