    "word": "I have recently sent very earnest, decided Testimonies to men in responsible positions, which they should not have occupied up to this time without evidence of a thorough transformation of character. Whatever their business tact, these men who have so long been evidently resisting light and evidence, fighting against God, should have been separated from the work, both for their own soul's sake and for the sake of the cause. For while they are kept in positions of trust, their voice and influence sway many things in the wrong direction. When matters of the greatest importance have come up for decision, their judgment on the questions has depended on the state of mind they chanced to be in. The mind and heart are not under the influence of the Spirit of God. They are men of strong temperament, decided preferences, and much force of character, and their will and influence have decided matters under the control of another spirit than the Spirit of God. \n                                                                           418\nIf these men had a sense of what they have been doing, of what they must meet in that great day, when all shall see as they are seen, and know as they are known, they would feel an anguish of heart, an agony of soul, that would be somewhat proportionate to the harm they have done the cause of God. At times temptations come into such minds with overpowering force, for Satan never sleeps, and never takes a vacation. He is always watching his chance to crowd into your important meetings, to reveal his own attributes through the workers, and make of no effect the spirit of testimony that has been appealing to them in reproof and warnings for many years.",
