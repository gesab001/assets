    "word": "Cultivate Tact and Gentleness \n     Unless you who are placed in important positions in the church shall cultivate tact far more than you have done in dealing with human minds, there will be great loss to yourselves and to the church. There is work for one in your position to do as he shall meet with alienation, bitterness, envies, jealousies. There is need of wise, well-directed, Christ-like labor, that things may be set in order.",
