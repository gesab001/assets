    "word": "I saw that the message \u201csell that ye have and give alms,\u201d had not been given, by some, in its clear light, and that the object of the words of our Saviour \n46\nhad not been clearly presented. I saw that the object of selling was not to give to those who are able to labor and support themselves, but to spread the truth. It is a sin to support and indulge in idleness, those who are able to labor. Some have been zealous to attend all the meetings; not to glorify God, but for the \u201cloaves and fishes.\u201d Such had much better been at home laboring with their hands, \u201cthe thing that is good,\u201d to supply the wants of their families, and to have something to give to sustain the precious cause of present truth.",
