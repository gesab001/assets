    "word": "EGW Shown Spiritual Condition of Many at Minneapolis-- I related in the Thursday morning meeting [at Ottawa, Kansas] some things in reference to the Minneapolis meeting. I told them by what means the Lord had opened to me the spiritual condition of many of those who came to that conference. They came under a delusion, with false impressions upon their minds. This was Satan's work, for the Lord was to revive His people and give them light in clear distinct rays that would lead to the magnifying of Christ. The Lord's \n\n\n                                  -257- \n\ncommand to His people through His messengers was, \"Go forward.\" And now Satan determined to hold the people away from the light that the rich blessing of God should not come upon the delegates. . . . Satan raised an alarm. They thought the law in Galatians would come up and they would go armed and equipped to resist everything coming from those men from the Pacific Coast, new and old.",
