    "word": "In the testimonies sent to the Denver meeting, the Spirit of God dictated a message that should have prevented the carrying out of plans which would result in disappointment. If our brethren should persist in carrying out their plans regarding the proposed enterprise, they would be going contrary to the expressed will of the Lord. God does not at one time send a message of warning, and later another message encouraging a movement against which He had previously given warning. His messages do not contradict one another. Cautions have been given that should cause our brethren to stop and consider their course. All the reasons for these cautions were not given: for this would not have been for the present and future good of those who were urging this matter.",
