    "word": "Enoch formed a righteous character, and the result was that he was translated to heaven without seeing death. When the Lord shall come the second time, there will be some who will be translated without seeing death, and we want to know if we will be among that number. We want to know if we are wholly on the Lord\u2019s side\u2014partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust\u2014not by trying to make a clear path for our feet where we shall have no trials or difficulties to meet, but by placing ourselves in right relation to God and letting Him take care of the consequences.\u2014Manuscript 83, 1886.",
