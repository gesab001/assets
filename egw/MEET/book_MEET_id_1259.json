    "word": "Leaving the Harvest Ungarnered.--It would be better, and accomplish more good, if there were fewer tent meetings, and a stronger force, or company, with different gifts to labor. Then there should be a longer tarry in a place where an interest is awakened. [NOTE. --THE TENT MEETING WHEN THIS WAS WRITTEN WAS OF ONLY A FEW DAYS' DURATION.--COMPILER.] There has been too much haste in taking down the tent. Some begin to be favorably impressed, and there is need that persevering efforts be put forth till their minds become settled, and they commit themselves on the truth.",
