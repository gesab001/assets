    "word": "Sunday, May 29. Brother Conradi spoke in the morning upon missionary work. At three o'clock I spoke to those assembled from 1 John 3:1-3. I felt much freedom, although weak for want of food which I could not take upon my stomach. Brother Conradi labored with them faithfully, and I think with good success. There was a healing of their difficulties, except with one brother who left the meeting. Brother Conradi went after him and labored with him until 2:00 a.m., with a good prospect of the difficulties being healed.",
