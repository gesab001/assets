    "word": "My appointment was at half past two. I tried to speak right to the point, and then invited those who desired to give themselves fully to the Lord, those who were backslidden, and those who desired to seek the Lord for the first time. The large tent was full and it was difficult to secure seats, to vacate the front seats to accommodate those who came forward. A large number presented \n\n\n                                    -132- \n\nthemselves. Opportunity was given for them to express their feelings and good testimonies were borne with weeping. A season of prayer followed. This was followed by meetings in the tents and children's meetings, which were good.",
