    "word": "The night after I had decided not to remain longer in Minneapolis, in a dream or vision of the night--I cannot tell certainly which--a person of tall, commanding appearance brought me a message and revealed to me that it was God's will for me to stand at my post of duty, and that God Himself would be my helper and sustain me to speak the words He should give me. He said, \"For this work the Lord has raised you up. His everlasting arms are beneath you. From this meeting decisions will be made for life or for death; not that anyone need to perish, but spiritual pride and self-confidence will close the door that Jesus and His Holy Spirit's power shall not be admitted. They shall have another chance to be undeceived, and to repent, confess their sins, and come to Christ and be converted that He shall heal them.\"",
