    "word": "MR No. 901 - Gather Up the Fragments\n\n     One thing I know--my wrestling in Australia has been as severe as any place I was ever in.

Light came to me, you remember, before you left for America, \"Gather up the fragments. Let nothing be lost.\" [See John 6:12.].--Letter 200, 1897, p. 3. (To W. C. White, Nov. 25, 1897.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. December 10, 1981",
