    "word": "Feb. 3. The Hearts of the Fathers to Their Children.-- I did not attend morning meeting. In the early hours, while the others in the house were sleeping, I wrote to Elder Lindsay and to his erring son. I see the necessity of parents dealing in the wisdom of Christ with their erring children. Their hearts should be filled with the longsuffering of the Saviour, \n                                                                           577\nthat they may draw their children to Him, not drive them away from Him. The father is to be a tender shepherd, drawing his children to Christ with the words of love, laboring untiringly for the erring. It is the unpromising ones who need the greatest patience and kindness, the most tender sympathy. But many parents reveal a cold, unpitying spirit, which will never lead the erring to repentance. Let the hearts of parents be softened by the grace of Christ, and His love will find a way to the heart. Then will come a Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Spirit.",
