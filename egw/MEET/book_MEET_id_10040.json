    "word": "Adams Center, New York, Friday, October 10, 1890 \n\n     We arrived at this place from Syracuse at about half past four o'clock p.m. Brethren Lane, Wilcox, and Place were at the depot waiting for us. We were glad to meet them. A horse and carriage took us to Sister Green's. There we found a comfortable home in every respect. Meetings had been in session two days. I was very nervous Friday night and could not sleep until about midnight.--Ms. 41, 1890, pp. 3-4 (Diary 16, p. 174). \n\n\n                                     -6-",
