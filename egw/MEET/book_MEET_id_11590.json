    "word": "We are not to take the position that white believers are to worship by themselves and colored believers by themselves. But neither are we to say that they are to worship together. In some places prejudice against the association of the races is so strong in the minds of the whites that they would not attend meeting if colored people\n126\nwere present.

When the mingling of whites and colored believers brings offense to the whites, other plans must be adopted; for both classes must hear the message that means so much.",
