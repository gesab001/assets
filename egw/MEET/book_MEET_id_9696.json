    "word": "Friday morning there had been a little rift in the cloud now and then during the meeting, but to be covered again in blackness and darkness. I arose unrefreshed with a broken night's sleep. Four nights I had but little sleep. While I was speaking to the people, one minister was left to open the meeting; the rest resorted to a grove to plead with God in prayer. They were blessed and had faith that we should see of the salvation of God.",
