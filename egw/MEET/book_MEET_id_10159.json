White at the California Camp Meeting, Healdsburg, California, Sabbath, September 26, 1891.] \n\n\n     [Acts 1:3, 12, quoted.] And we read in another place, \"They returned to Jerusalem with great joy\" [Luke 24:52]. Now, what made that joy? Was it because their Lord was leaving them? No, it was not that. It was because of the promise that He would come again, and that the Holy Spirit should come upon them.",
