    "word": "Battle Creek, Monday, January 5, 1891 \n\n     Again my time was taken up in conversation with visitors. But my burden is for this church in Battle Creek. So large a church--fully two thousand. Many were convened last Sabbath. It is almost impossible to separate them for a social meeting because there are not convenient places to gather them together. There is no place to hold so many worshipers, and they should be out in other places as missionaries, doing service to the Master, and not be crowded together here.",
