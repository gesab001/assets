    "word": "This is the first day I could say I know certainly I am in the way of my duty in coming to Oregon. But I know now I have a testimony for this people. This has been a day, a Sabbath, I shall never forget, for Jesus has come very near to me. I felt enshrouded in light, and peace and joy filled my soul. All at this meeting will look back upon this Sabbath as one of the best of their lives. Truly God has spoken to the hearts while we were speaking to the ears of the people.",
