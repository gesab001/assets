    "word": "The dealing in regard to \"Gospel Primer\" was unjust. Another book, \"His Glorious Appearing,\" \n\n\n                     -5- \n\nwas crowded in to kill the sale of the Primer. The way in which \"The Gospel Primer\" was handled has left a record on the books of heaven which those concerned in the matter will not be pleased to meet in the judgment. The young men who were handling the books did not understand the diplomacy and scheming, but some knowingly took part in these wrong practises, diverting from the Southern field a book specially prepared for that field. The profits from this book should have gone into that field. Not a penny should have been charged for the publication of the book for that field. This donation would have been small enough for the Office to make to the Southern field.",
