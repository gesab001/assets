    "word": "Bro. Andrews has had much sympathy excited in his behalf, because he worked so hard, and was exhausted, when in many instances he could have done the labor easily, if he had taken his usual hours of sleep, and if he had eaten more sparingly of even the simple food which forms his diet. He should have taken a portion of time for physical exercise, which would increase his power of endurance. The amount Bro. Andrews has at times placed in his stomach has called the brain nerve power to that organ, to carry on the work of the stomach, and has robbed him of vitality that he might have preserved. Bro. Andrews has a sacred duty to preserve the health God has given him. When engaged in writing, he enjoys the study of books, and does not give himself sufficient recreation and change. To read and write steadily is not best for the health, or for the clearest productions of the mind. Physical exercise should be united with mental effort. To write, then change and attend meetings, preaching the word, would invigorate and refresh the mind, and keep the brain in a better condition to put forth its strong efforts. B. C.
