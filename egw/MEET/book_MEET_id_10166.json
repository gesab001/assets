    "word": "I beg of you to institute the inquiry, How many of you have the Holy Spirit of God, represented as oil in the vessel with the lamp. Here is the light; you have the truth, the precious gems of truth offered to you--the glorious unfolding of the truth from the Word of God. The coming of the Lord is presented before you, \"Prepare to meet thy God.\" This subject is not dwelt upon half as much as it should be; preparation is essential. God has not given us any time to stop.",
