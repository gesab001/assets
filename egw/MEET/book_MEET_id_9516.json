    "word": "We want in our experience to value the souls for whom Christ died. When we meet with ingratitude and betrayal of sacred trusts, we are stirred to retaliate and show how we despise such a course; and this the guilty expect to meet, and they are prepared for it, for it suits their mean course of action. But Christians should disappoint their expectations by showing a calmness under injuries, and give kindness in return for abuse. Such a righteous course will surprise them, and it places their own wrong course in contrast, and makes them ashamed. The Lord Jesus has imputed to us His righteousness. When undeserving He took our guilt, and the Innocent suffered for the guilty, else we should have perished.",
