    "word": "After a time, as the work advances, schools will be established in many cities, where workers can be quickly educated and trained for service. The students and their teachers can go out with our publications and spread the truth by means of the printed page. Desirable places can be secured for meetings to be held, and here the people can be invited to gather. Let those who are fitted for the work, the young and middle-aged, act a disinterested, unselfish part in laboring for the fields white for the harvest that are yet unworked.--MS. 11, 1908.",
