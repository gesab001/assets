    "word": "We found our tent well furnished, floor and carpet, upholstered chairs, washstand and two beds, one for Elder Butler, one for Father and me. This was an excellent meeting. I was not well any of the time. My cold was very severe. The discharges from my head were fearful, yet I labored carefully and did not break down. I had very great freedom in speaking. The Lord has sustained me.",
