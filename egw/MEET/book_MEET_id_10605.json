    "word": "I was never more certain that the Lord strengthened me, than at the Kansas meeting. Bro. A.T. and D. T. Jones, and others, had wrought perseveringly to impress the people with the truth, but it seemed difficult for the people to realize the necessity of exercising living faith. In a vision of the night, my work was laid open before me, and though weak and faint and trembling, I attempted to follow the directions given. No one but myself can know how difficult it was for me to engage in the work when my heart was in so feeble a condition. But the comforting assurance came to me, \"Fear not, I am with thee. I have a message which must come to this people.\" And strength was given me at every effort. At times I was greatly depressed in spirit, and on leaving my tent I would struggle with weakness; but as I stood before the people, strength, freedom, and power from God rested upon me, and I could say with assurance, \"I know whom I have believed.\" I knew that God alone could accomplish the work that was necessary to be done at this meeting. Christ has said, \"Without me, ye can do nothing.\" How vain are the wisdom and help of man!",
