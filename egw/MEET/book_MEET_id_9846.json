    "word": "MR No. 1561 - Counsel on Open-Air Meetings\n\n          (Remarks at a European Council, Sunday, September 20, 1885.) \n\n     I would like to speak a word in regard to open-air meetings. There is no one who can long bear the taxation to the throat and lungs of speaking in the open air. I have spoken thus more or less for the last forty years, and I know how trying it is. And in this country, it must be especially taxing on account of the dampness of the air.",
