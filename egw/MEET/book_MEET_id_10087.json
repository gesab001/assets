    "word": "Danvers, Massachusetts, Friday, December 12, 1890 \n\n     Rose at half-past four. Sara and I had but little rest last night. In coming down the steps after closing the door she thought there was only one step. Her heel caught on the second step. She wrenched her ankle and for a few moments we thought she could not walk. She did walk to the meeting, came back, and after her shoe was removed her foot pained her considerably. She could not rest; neither could I. She was obliged to get up at midnight and bathe her foot. She is relieved of pain but it is not wisdom to use her foot in walking at present.",
