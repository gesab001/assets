    "word": "Walling's Mills, Tuesday, September 2, 1873. We went to Rollinsville to the raspberry ground. We took our tent and stove and a change of clothing. We did not go out to pick berries until late. We brought home about 25 quarts. Willie was not with us. He was obliged to go for Brother and Sister Downs, who wrote us that they would be at Black Hawk Tuesday. Willie came for us about six o' clock. We were glad to meet Brother and Sister Downs. Our visit with them was pleasant.",
