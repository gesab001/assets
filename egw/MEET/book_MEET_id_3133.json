    "word": "As a Lamp that Burneth \n\n     I am instructed to speak words to our people that will give them courage to do diligently the work that shall come to them in this their day of opportunity. I am instructed to urge the necessity of personal consecration, and the sanctification of the whole being to God. Let each one inquire, Lord, what wouldst Thou have me to do, that the vigilance of Christ may be seen in my life, that His example may be followed by me, that I may speak sincere words, which will help souls in darkness? Oh, how I long to see church members clothed with their beautiful garments, and prepared to go forth to meet the Bridegroom! Many are expecting to sit down to the marriage supper of the Lamb, who are unprepared for the coming of the King. They are like the blind; they do not seem to discern their danger.",
