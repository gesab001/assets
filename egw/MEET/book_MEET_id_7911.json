    "word": "I spoke last--yesterday--at six p.m. to a hall full to overflowing. I spoke from Revelation 20:11-15. We had a very solemn meeting and there seemed to be much feeling--some weeping. It was my last discourse. I have now done what I could and the Lord will do that which I cannot possibly do--water the seed that has been sown. But speaking through a translator loses--taxes me--but when you read the reports they come to you about as they are spoken. Good is done and many testimonies are borne stating the impressions that have been made so that I know my labor has not been in vain in the Lord.",
