    "word": "Last night I spoke in the city of Walla Walla. Brethren had camped on the Walla Walla River. They heard of the appointment and came to the meeting. One wagon-load of men, women and children we met en route for Brother Woods'. Sister Maxson's daughter with her three children were in the wagon. Had been three days on the road. Came more than one hundred miles. Part of their company turned back to Walla Walla and attended our meeting.",
