    "word": "From the Diary of 1868. Bucksbridge, N.Y., Wednesday, Jan. 1, 1868. We. . . rode upon a rough road through pastures and over a body of water on our way to take the cars at St. Albans. . . . We were in season for the cars that were due at six A.M. In the cars we suffered with heat. Arrived at Brother Hilliard's at one o'clock P.M. We were very weary, yet consented to meet with the few believers in this place.",
