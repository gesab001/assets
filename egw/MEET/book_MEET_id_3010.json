    "word": "God has given every man talents, that His name may be exalted, not that man may be lauded and praised, honored and glorified, while the Giver is forgotten. All have been entrusted with God's gifts, from the lowest and most poverty stricken to the highest and wealthiest. . . . Let none waste their God-given time in regrets that they have only one talent. Spend every moment in using the talents that you have. They are the Lord's, to be returned to Him. It is not your own property you are handling, but the Lord's. One day He will come to receive His own with usury. Faithfully fulfill your appointed stewardship, that you may meet Him in peace (Review and Herald, Sept. 12, 1899). \n                                                                           367",
