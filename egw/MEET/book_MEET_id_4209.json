Of some of these subjects I could speak, because at sundry times and in divers places many things have been presented to me. . . . As my brethren read the selections from letters, I knew what to say to them; for this matter has been presented to me again and again in regard to the southern field. I have not felt at liberty to write out the matter until now. . . . The light that the Lord has given me at different times has been that the southern field, where the greatest share of the population of the colored race is, cannot be worked after the same methods as other fields.--Letter 73, 1895.
