He interrupted the meeting, and the boys from the city crowded him out of the tent and pushed him until they got out of the gate into the road, and then got up three or four indignation meetings over him. But the meetings move along just the same, and the people who have long been in the truth testify that they thought they knew the truth, but they have heard and learned so much since these meetings commenced that it seems they knew very little before.",
