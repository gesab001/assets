    "word": "The Dunkard minister was in this morning and begged of me to write to some of his church a letter that will encourage them. They meet with great opposition from their Dunkard friends, and he says they would regard a letter from me as from their mother in Christ, and it would be next thing to their coming to meeting. They could not come to this meeting, for several are sick and need these to care for them. I would go to this church if I could, but it is seventy-five miles by private conveyance over a rough road. Dayton is half-way. There is a church at Dayton.",
