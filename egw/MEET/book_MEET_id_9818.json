    "word": "This afternoon I spoke about two hours upon the subject of temperance. I had perfect freedom, and my words made a deep impression. I spoke upon intemperance in dressing as well as in eating and drinking. We shall frame a pledge including dress here at this camp meeting. Our sisters need this as much as our brethren need the pledge upon tobacco and liquor. The pledge was circulated and thirty names signed to it.",
