    "word": "It is impossible for man to measure the ingenuity shown by Satan in deceiving human minds. As Christ saw the working out of Satan's plans to deceive man in many ways, He gladly came to our world as an infant, to live in this world, to meet the wily foe in every stage of human life, and to counterwork his Satanic wiles. No one could understand as Christ did the enemy's power of deception. He saw that the world was being captivated by the delusive power exercised through commercialism of various kinds. He came to take human nature, and to stay this overwhelming power of deception, which was leading souls to their ruin.",
