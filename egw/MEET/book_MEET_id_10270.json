    "word": "When the leaven of truth is hidden in the heart it becomes a vital working power to bring into conformity to itself all the capabilities of the being. The mind, the affections, the motives--all the powers--become converted through the truth. And all are worked by the same Spirit. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace. The truths of the Word of God meet in one grand practical necessity--the conversion of the soul through faith.",
