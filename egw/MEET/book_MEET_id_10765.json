I was glad that you expressed your mind in regard to California. I suppose you read the letters that came from California. You read, doubtless, the letter from Elder Fulton desirous for me to come to the camp meeting. You mentioned you thought it might be duty for me to spend the winter in California. I thought if this was my duty it must certainly be the best thing to be at the camp meeting where I could reach the most people at once and would accomplish more than to have matters drag all through the winter, and I think so still, but I am not very well settled to go to California under existing circumstances.",
