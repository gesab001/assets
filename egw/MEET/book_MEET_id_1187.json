    "word": "The holy salutation mentioned in the gospel of Jesus Christ by the apostle Paul should ever be considered in its true character. It is a holy kiss. [SEE APPENDIX.] It should be regarded as a sign of fellowship to Christian friends when parting, and when meeting again after a separation of weeks or months. In 1 Thessalonians 5:26 Paul says: \"Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.\" In the same chapter he says: \"Abstain from all appearance of evil.\" There can be no appearance of evil when the holy kiss is given at a proper time and place.",
