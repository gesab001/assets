    "word": "We found the atmosphere was better than in Melbourne. All were much pleased to meet us and we were well entertained. Our dining tent was under a canopy. Tablecloths were spread upon the ground and the camp of more than thirty seated themselves upon the ground to enjoy their repast. Brother Prismall came while we were eating and he enjoyed the dinner with us. All ate as if they relished the food. Excellent raspberries were obtained fresh from the vines, and they were so nice and fresh, I enjoyed them much. There were new potatoes and green peas and rice pudding. All ate with good appetites.",
