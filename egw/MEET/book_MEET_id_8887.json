    "word": "There is a large interest in Stanmore since the camp meeting. The tent has been crowded most of the time. Meetings have been held every night with the exception of Monday evenings. Now and then they have dropped out the evening after the Sabbath, for so many calls come in for visiting that they have to give up that evening to holding Bible readings. Brother and Sister Haskell, Brother and Sister Starr, and Brother and Sister Wilson are the chief workers. Brother and Sister Haskell have charge of the mission, where quite a number are being educated as Bible workers, and others are being educated to sell papers and tracts, that the work may be made as far as possible self-sustaining.",
