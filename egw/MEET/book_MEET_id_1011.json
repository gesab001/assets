    "word": "In the inspired record we are told that \"Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,\" yet after He received the message [that Lazarus was sick], \"he abode two days still in the same place where he was.\" Guided by divine wisdom, He did not go at once to His beloved friends. The message that came to Him did not meet with an immediate response. Mary and Martha did not say, \"Lord, come at once and heal our brother.\"  They had confidence in Jesus, believing that He would do what was best for them. At length He said to His disciples, \"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake\n59\nhim out of sleep.\"--21MR 111 (1892).",
