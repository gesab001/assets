    "word": "When Bro. Andrews applies himself to the study of subjects, he concentrates his entire mind upon the matter before him, and neglects real duties which some one must do, whether they love to do them or not. Bro. Andrews applies himself to the study of subjects, and then is lost to everything else, which results in the neglect of the real duties which need to be done. When Bro. Andrews takes hold of matters, he frequently carries them too far. He concentrates his mind upon the matter before him, and is of no practical advantage for anything else. He engaged at one period in reading exercises, and robbed himself of necessary sleep in order to read. This pleasurable exercise was carried to extremes, and was a serious injury to his health. His habits were not in harmony with physical law. This extra tax unfitted Bro. Andrews for doing many things which ought to have been done, and that he positively could not do without injury to his health. His physical nature called for the sleep that his reading and study had deprived him of. In meetings, and upon important occasions, nature required the sleep she had been robbed of, and sleep would come upon Bro. Andrews like an armed \n                                                                           80\nman. It seemed an impossibility to shake off the stupor that would take hold of his senses. Frequently, when his labors were very much needed, and when his senses needed to be fully awake and keenly sensitive, he was utterly unable to do anything requiring mental exertion. Yet at the same time, Bro. Andrews did not reason from cause to effect. He was much attached to his own routine of very early rising, and extending his labors far into the hours apportioned for sleep.",
