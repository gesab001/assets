    "word": "Ashfield, Nov. 23, 1896. Sunday was a very busy day with us all. My workers are with me, and they worked hard all day. On that day I had my subject, \"The Armor of Jesus Christ,\" ready to present in the little chapel in Ashfield, which is only a minute's walk from our hired house. But when I stood before the people, I spoke upon a subject that I had not looked at at all--1 Corinthians 9:24-27. When I was preparing for meeting, I said, \"I would feel relieved if someone would take my place,\" for I had been writing all day, and was weary both in body and mind. But I had not been upon my feet one minute when I felt that an angel of God stood by my side and strengthened me. I talked more than one hour, and all listened with interest. The blessing of the Lord was upon me.",
