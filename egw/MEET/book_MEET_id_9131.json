    "word": "Then let us labor and love. I point you to the Rock of Ages, Christ Jesus. You can be saved only through Him. Let the praise of God be upon your lips when you meet together in little companies to worship God. Let not one man do much of the talking. Let several take part. He who heard the voice of Christ and did His will was the wise man that built upon the rock, and storm nor tempest could not destroy this structure. We are workers for time and for eternity.",
