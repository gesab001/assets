    "word": "The Lord understands all things, and He is my only dependance. I need His power back of every effort I shall henceforth make, as it has been back of the efforts I have made in the past. I wish to be prepared to meet the falsehoods that are coming in. The Lord is good, and He is my stronghold. He understands the situation, and He will never leave me as long as I cling to Him. He will guide me in judgment.",
