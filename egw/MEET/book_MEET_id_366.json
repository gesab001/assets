    "word": "VISIT TO MAINE\n \n     July 28, 1849, my second child, James Edson White, was born. When he was six weeks old we went to Maine. September 14 we attended a meeting at Paris. Brethren Bates, Chamberlain, and Ralph were present, also brethren and sisters from Topsham. The power of God descended something as it did on the day of Pentecost, and five or six who had been deceived and led into error and fanaticism, fell prostrate to the floor. Parents confessed to their children, and children\n131\nto their parents and to one another. Brother J. N. Andrews with deep feeling exclaimed, \"I would exchange a thousand errors for one truth.\" Such a scene of confession and pleading with God for forgiveness we have seldom witnessed. That meeting, the beginning of better days for the children of God in Paris, was to them a green spot in the desert. The Lord was bringing out Brother Andrews to fit him for future usefulness, and was giving him an experience that would be of great value to him in his future labors.",
