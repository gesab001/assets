    "word": "We have closed our third camp meeting. We were well cared for on the ground. We had a small tent, carpeted and swept clean each day. Our friends at Monroe were attentive to all our wants. They furnished us two bedsteads and bedding. . . . Our table was set in our tent and well furnished through the meeting. Sister Gillet was as a mother to us, kind, thoughtful, and ever willing to do all she could for our rest and comfort. . . .",
