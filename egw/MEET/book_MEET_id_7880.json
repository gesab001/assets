    "word": "Sabbath and Pleasure Seeking. God would have all His gifts appreciated. All fragments, jots, and tittles are to be treasured carefully, and we are carefully to become acquainted with the necessities of others. All that we have of Bible truth is not merely for our benefit, but to impart to other souls, and this is to be impressed upon human minds, and every kindly word spoken to prepare the way to make a channel through which the truth will flow forth in rich currents to other souls.  Every working of Christ in miracles was essential, and was to reveal to the world that there was a great work to be done on the Sabbath day for the relief of suffering humanity, but the common work was not to be done.  Pleasure seeking, ball playing, swimming, was not a necessity, but a sinful neglect of the sacred day sanctified by Jehovah.  Christ did not perform miracles merely to display His power, but always to meet Satan in [his] afflicting suffering humanity. Christ came to our world to meet the needs of the suffering, whom Satan was torturing.--Letter 252, 1906, p. 3. (To Brother and Sister O. A. Olsen, July 25, 1906.)",
