    "word": "Letter to a Schoolgirl  \n     We held quite a number of meetings in Dallas but could not remain long, as would appear best, on account of the promise to speak to the people in Denison. We left Dallas last Wednesday morning with two heavy wagons, loaded, two two-seated wagons called \"hacks,\" and our phaeton. . . . We had our large family tent and pitched it and for two nights occupied it. Fifteen composed our caravan: Elder Kilgore, and his brother Scott, Brother and Sister McDearman, their two children--Hattie and Joseph--their niece Nettie Cole, \n\n\n                                -300- \n\nand grandson Homer Salisbury, Brother More and his son Willie, Brother and Sister (A. G.) Daniells, Sister Davis, Brother and Sister White. . . .",
