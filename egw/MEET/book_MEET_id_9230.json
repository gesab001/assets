To use up all the strength we have, and leave nothing from which to draw in times of emergency, is the height of folly. Matters will be forced upon the attention unexpectedly which cannot be set aside, and unless the physician has complete control of himself he will make serious blunders, which he can never remedy. When the physical power is lowered, self is more likely to exhibit itself, and through an unadvised word or an impatient manner souls may be turned aside from the path of right.",
