    "word": "God requires personal service at the hands of every one to whom He entrusts His truth. Not one is excused. Some may feel that if they give of their substance they are excused from personal efforts. But God forbid that they should deceive themselves in this. Gifts of means do not fully meet the requirement of God, for the duty is but half done. He will accept nothing short of yourselves. You must work to save souls. You may not be called to go to foreign missions, but you may be missionaries at home in your own families and in your neighborhoods.--True Missionary, Feb. 1874. \n\n\n                                                (19)",
