    "word": "Message About the Fruitless Fig Tree--Afternoon. I have just returned from the services in the tent. I have spoken twice today, nearly one hour in the half-past-six morning meeting, and again this afternoon. I generally speak on Wednesday afternoons because it is a holiday, but this week I consented to speak on Tuesday because it is Cup Day. . . . The tent was full. Extra seats were furnished, and some had to stand.",
