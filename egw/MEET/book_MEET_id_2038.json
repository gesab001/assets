    "word": "IF ANY NATION MIGHT JUSTLY BE EXPECTED TO KEEP CLEAR OF ROMISH INFLUENCES, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE THE ONE ABOVE ALL OTHERS, AS IT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PLEDGED TO HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO DO TOWARD \u201cAN ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGION OR PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF.\u201d YET THIS NATION IS IN NOWISE BEHIND THE OTHERS IN PAYING ASSIDUOUS COURT TO ROME. WHEN THE PAPAL DELEGATES CAME TO AMERICA BEARING TO CARDINAL GIBBONS THE TRAPPINGS OF HIS ROMISH DIGNITY, A GOVERNMENT VESSEL WAS DISPATCHED DOWN NEW YORK HARBOR TO MEET THEM, WITH THE PAPAL FLAG, INSTEAD OF THE STARS AND STRIPES, FLYING FROM THE PLACE OF HONOR. AND AT THE INVESTITURE OF CARDINAL GIBBONS WITH THE PURPLE OF A PAPAL PRINCE, PRESIDENT CLEVELAND SENT HIM A LETTER OF CONGRATULATION. THE CONVERTED CATHOLIC SAYS THAT A LARGER NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES SEND THEIR SONS TO THE JESUIT COLLEGE AT GEORGETOWN\u2014ONE OF THE SUBURBS OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL\u2014THAN TO ALL THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING AT WASHINGTON, WHICH PROVES EITHER THAT THE LARGER NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ARE CATHOLICS, OR THAT ROME HAS MORE INFLUENCE WITH SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES THAN HAVE ALL THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN WASHINGTON PUT TOGETHER. IN VIEW OF THIS FACT, IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT ROME DECIDED TO BUILD HER NATIONAL UNIVERSITY AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL.",
