    "word": "\"Since receiving the communication of the General Conference we have gone into the matter as fully as time and opportunity would permit, to obtain definite information on these four points. First, we find that the way is open for the students of Loma Linda College to take advanced standing in other medical schools, provided we secure a charter from the state, which would cost us about $75. Second, That in order for our students to enter other medical colleges after the charter is secured, we would \n\n\n                          -13- \n\nneed to strengthen our course of study in the first two years about three hundred hours, or one hundred and fifty each year. The students would have to meet the State requirements for entering the College, which is at present a high school education or its equivalent. Third, almost any regular medical college in America would receive our students for advanced work if these requirements were met. Fourth, in reference to the outlay financially, to do this work acceptably to the State, about $3000. Then, to meet what we feel is necessary to give practical work, we should have a small sanitarium, costing not more than $6000 or $7000. This would make an outlay of about $10,000.",
