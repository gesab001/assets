    "word": "If in our camp meetings we will only walk humbly with God, if we will work in the spirit of Jesus Christ, none of us will carry heavy burdens. We will lay them upon the great Burdenbearer. We may expect triumphs in the presence of God in the communion of His love, from the beginning to the end. The camp meeting may be a love feast, because we have the assurance of God's presence. We shall have a signal manifestation of His glory.",
