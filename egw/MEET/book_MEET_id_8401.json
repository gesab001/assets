    "word": "We stopped (Brethren Holt, Wheeler, James, and self) a few days and wrote. Wednesday Brethren Holt and Wheeler went to Vergennes, Vermont, to inform them that we should be there Sabbath and Sunday. Brother Butler carried us to Vergennes Thursday, forty-four miles. Sabbath day it was very stormy, but he went three miles to Brother Evarts; there were but few who could attend that meeting on account of the storm. Brother Evarts is a blessed brother, but has been in the age-to-come all over, and he said he could not give it up. When we were there he was in a very dark place.",
