    "word": "In my sleep I seemed to be speaking before large congregations in Oakland and other places. I was reading to them the words found in the 40th and 41st chapters of Isaiah, and dwelling upon their significance. The Spirit of the Lord seemed to come upon me in large measure. I knew that holy angels were in the meeting. Although some in the congregation seemed to be indifferent to the words spoken, there were others who were making an effort to be free in Christ. The faces of these were lighted up. The Lord was in our midst.",
