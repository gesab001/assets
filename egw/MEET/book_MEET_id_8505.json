    "word": "MR No. 712 - Ellen White Had a Sense of Humor\n\n     Not Immortal Yet.--There are many urgent calls coming from all the conferences for me to come East and attend the camp meetings. They gravely state they have arranged them so that I could go from one to the other without loss of time. One meeting laps over on to the other, and I do not admire your judgment in this arrangement. Better have a set of camp meetings one year full and thorough, in selected places, and then next year take up the places left, and have those well manned, full and thorough. . . .",
