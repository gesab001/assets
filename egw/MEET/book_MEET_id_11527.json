    "word": "\"But of how many will Christ say in the judgment, \"Good and faithful servant.\" I think of how the angels must feel seeing the end approaching and those who claim to have a knowledge of God and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, huddle together, colonize, and attend the meetings, and feel dissatisfied if there is not much preaching to benefit their souls, and strengthen the church while they are doing literally nothing. If they are branches really and truly of the true vine, nourished by the sap which flows from the vine to the branches, they are indeed partakers of the divine nature. They have moral power from Christ to overcome Satan, to hate sin; and these cannot be silent. Souls are perishing for the light and knowledge of the truth which they have. It is their duty to put that knowledge to use to save souls. \n                                                                           347",
