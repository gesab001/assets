    "word": "After the community has been stirred by a well organized camp meeting, then shall the workers pull up stakes and leave to attend another camp meeting and let the work ravel out?

This will not leave the work to ravel out. The good impressions the messengers of God have made upon hearts and minds will not be lost.",
