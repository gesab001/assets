    "word": "On Tuesday I called the ministers together and told them I could not speak in the morning as I had done; the atmosphere in the large tent has no vitality in the morning, and it takes away my strength. I eat no suppers, and in the morning I have no strength to go to meeting. If I eat, that unfits me to take my breakfast. Without eating I exhaust my strength. If they would give me one hour in the afternoon, then I would improve it to the best of the ability granted me by God. So this afternoon I spoke to hundreds, who were just as quiet and well-behaved as in any church building. May the Lord water the seed sown.",
