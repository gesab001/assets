    "word": "When God Asks, \"Where Are the Children?\"-- Parents who have neglected their God-given responsibilities must meet that neglect in the judgment. The Lord will then inquire, \"Where are the children that I gave you to train for Me? Why are they not at My right hand?\" Many parents will then see that unwise love blinded their eyes to their children's faults and left those children to develop deformed characters unfit for heaven. Others will see that they did not give their children time and attention, love and tenderness; their own neglect of duty made the children what they are.",
