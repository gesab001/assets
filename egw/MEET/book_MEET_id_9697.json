    "word": "Friday morning at five o'clock we commenced our meeting, and I arose and talked a short time telling them we had waited for these leading men to take a position which God could approve and let His Spirit into the meeting. We had no more appeals to make to them and no more time to lose in waiting for them. They had stood directly in the way of our work from the first, and now our work was for these who had come to this meeting to be benefited. I had two front seats cleared and asked those who were backslidden from God and those who had never started to serve the Lord, to come forward. They began to come. Other seats were cleared, and finally there was the whole body (of) seats of the tent filled; about one dozen were in the side seats.",
