Daniells.) \n\n\n     I was made sorry by your request that Brother [Crisler] remain with you until we go to the Eastern camp meetings. All that it is my duty to say on this subject I said to you when I was with you. I have no more to say, except that you understand all about the matter and know what my expectations were when I left Battle Creek.",
