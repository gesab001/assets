    "word": "MR No. 248 - E. G. White's Report of Minneapolis Conference\n\n     Our meeting is closed. I have on last Sabbath given my last discourse. There seemed for the first time to be considerable feelings in the congregation. I called them forward for prayers although the church was densely packed. Quite a number came forward. The Lord gave me the Spirit of supplication and His blessing came upon me. I did not go out to meeting this morning. This has been a most laborious meeting, for Willie and I have had to watch at every point lest there should be moves made, resolutions passed, that would prove detrimental to the future work.",
