    "word": "Brethren and sisters, do we believe the Word of God, or not? Do we not see the signs fulfilling all around us? Do we realize that we are standing on the very verge of eternity, that we have no time to make crooked paths and blundering movements involving the worth of the soul? When the last call shall be made, Behold the bridegroom cometh; go ye forth to meet him, shall we represent the foolish virgins, who had no oil in their vessels with their lamps? Whatever our line of work, let us remember that we cannot carry it ourselves. Let us be sure that we are making every possible effort to save souls. Self and self-serving have no place now and never had in a true religious experience. Everything we do must be done to the glory of God. Work and pray, and God will cooperate with your efforts.",
