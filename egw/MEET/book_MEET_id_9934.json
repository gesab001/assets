    "word": "I have now spoken four times in the morning and business meetings, and for one hour last evening to the canvassing class. This morning Brother Chadwick leaves us and returns to Battle Creek. He is in danger through the prevailing influences which exist there. Willie leaves late in the week for Battle Creek. Sara and I shall attend meetings at Norwich, Connecticut, and at Danvers [Massachusetts]. Brother Asa Robinson will be in attendance at these meetings, but it seems to be necessary for him to go to Battle Creek at this time to attend to important matters. I ought to have him with me in my work, but if the presence of the Lord goes with us we shall have profitable and successful meetings. I send large packages of important matter to be used during the remnant of the year 1890. I want to arouse and break the silence of the churches, that they may have a sense of their work. This burden is on my mind constantly.",
