    "word": "Look to Calvary. That tells you the story. He wants us to be saved with an everlasting salvation.

I believe \n\n\n                                    -53- \n\nit is sacred ground. I believe the angels of God are walking up and down this encampment. I know they are, for I have seen the interest that all heaven has in the assembly of the saints when they come together; how with intense interest they are watching and seeking to make impressions upon human hearts. Will we let them be made? Will we open the door? Will we let Jesus in? May the Lord help us on this blessed holy Sabbath and in this sacred place, made sacred by His presence, for He has revealed Himself unto us since we have been here, to take up the tokens of God.",
