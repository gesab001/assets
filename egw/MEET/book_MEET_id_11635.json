    "word": "If the companion of a minister is united with her husband in the work of saving souls, it is the highest work she can do. But the care of a little child would absorb her attention, so that she could not attend the meetings and labor successfully in the visiting and personal effort. Even if she accompanies her husband, the child is too often the burden of thought and conversation, and the visits are made of no effect. Those whom God has called to be colaborers with him, are to have no idols to absorb their thought and affection which he would have directed in other lines. . . . . .",
