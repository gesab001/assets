    "word": "I will write no more now, but this work must come first of everything. Those who occupy the room in the school building should have a place in which to meet and worship God. The work of God would have been largely advanced if in the place of occupying the room above the mill, we had shown our respect and our view of the holiness of God by building a house of worship. When Abraham was sojourning in his own country, the Lord told him he must leave his kindred, and go into a strange land, and that wherever he pitched his tent his first work was to build an altar for God, where he could worship God with those who were accompanying as pilgrims and strangers. The Lord would have wrought for us if we had shown our faith by our works, if we had considered the greatness and glory of our God and our obligations to Him. This could have testified to the character of our work as nothing else could have done. We have this neglect to repent of, and if the Lord will forgive our neglect and our stupidity we will never repeat this mistake, but will make God first, and exalt His service in everything we do.",
