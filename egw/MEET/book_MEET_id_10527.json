    "word": "In the morning all nature seemed to be full of joyfulness. We assembled at half past five for social meeting. The Spirit of the Lord was in our midst. Many stated that they came to the meeting with hearts as hard as a stone, but as soon as they opened their lips to confess their faith in the love of Jesus, the light came in and their hearts were melted and subdued with the love of Jesus. One brother said he would bear his testimony for he knew it to be right, but he had no feeling. But his heart was broken; he fell upon the Rock and he was so impressed with the love of Jesus that he wept aloud. Ministers bore testimony that when they came to the meeting they were cold and their hearts hard, but when by faith they confessed to God their backslidings they knew Jesus \n                                                                           285\nforgave their sins and they were happy, newly converted, and they now bear a testimony that is free and joyful. \"Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.\"",
