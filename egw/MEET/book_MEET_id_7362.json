    "word": "This distrust of self will lead us to be circumspect in actions. Christ had travail of soul. All who are co-laborers with him will have travail of soul, will be burden-bearers. Their anxiety will not be to tear one another to pieces and exalt themselves; but their work will be to help one another, to strengthen one another in the most holy faith, while they will be diligent to make their own calling and election sure. They will also be earnest and faithful to do their work for God, that others shall not fail of everlasting life. Pride and ambition will be humbled in the dust. We are to meet those we associate with when the Judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, and when all shall be judged according to their works. How can we meet those we have treated with neglect, those we have envied, those we have tried to tear down, the souls we have wounded and bruised, destroyed their influence and awakened a spirit of hatred against them, that caused them to be crippled and hedged up in doing the work God would have them do? God is in earnest with us. God help us to be wise unto salvation. \n\n\n                                   E. G. White.",
