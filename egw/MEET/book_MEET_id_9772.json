The only way for you to meet the difficulties which seem to be hedging up your way to usefulness is to walk humbly with God. When self is hid in Jesus, we are shielded from the darts of the enemy. Consistency of life alone can command respect, and sincerity of counsel alone be effectual to persuade.",
