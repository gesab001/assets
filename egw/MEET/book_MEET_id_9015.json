    "word": "The influence of letter writing is a power for good or for evil. My soul is sick and disgusted with the contents of very many letters. I hope that all our household will have an eye single to the glory of God in the letters they write as well as the testimonies which they bear in meeting. Let not one sentence appear upon the pure paper to soil its purity. Let every word traced be of a character to elevate, ennoble, and lead upward to heaven and the better life. Let our influence in every respect, and all our \n\n\n                               -404- \n\nactions, be of a high, elevated character that shall meet the approval of Him whose servants we profess to be, whose work we profess to be doing.",
