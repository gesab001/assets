    "word": "About this time we received a special invitation to attend a conference in Waterbury, Vt. We decided to go, but let brethren R. and A. have our horse to visit the brethren in Canada East and Vermont, while we took the cars for Boston and New Ipswich. It took us two days to go forty miles to Washington, N. H., by private conveyance. The blessing of the Lord attended our meetings in Washington. We then rode fifteen miles to visit Bro. S. who was befogged with spiritualism. We were anxious he should attend the conference at Waterbury. But he had no horse, and to help him, we told him if he would get a horse we would ride in the sleigh with him, and give him our fare which would be about five dollars on the cars. He purchased a horse for thirty dollars. It \n                                                                           145\nwas in mid-winter, and we suffered with cold, but we were anxious to see Eld. J. Baker who was shut up at home, and encourage him to attend the meeting in Waterbury. Weary, cold and hungry, we arrived at Bro. B.'s. Next morning we had a solemn season of prayer, and Bro. B. was deeply affected. We urged him to attend the conference. He said he had not health and strength to drive his horse through the cold. My husband handed him five dollars to pay his fare on the cars. He was very reluctant to accept it, but said, \"If it is your duty to give me this, I will go.\" We  were the greatest part of three days more in reaching Waterbury. There were three of us in an open sleigh, without a buffalo skin or even a horse-blanket to protect us from the cold.",
