    "word": "I was told this spirit had been gathering strength for years and the leavening influence was at work and spiritual life was going out of the churches. In their gatherings for meeting there was lightness, trifling, jesting, joking,--a spirit that God frowns upon. I was promised that if I stood faithfully at my post of duty the Lord would sustain me to do the work given me of God. His everlasting arms would be beneath me, but I must bear the message the Lord gave me whether men would hear or forbear. I have tried to do this. I sent word that I would speak Sabbath forenoon and I did speak and I did not leave the meeting until my work was ended. I bore my testimony in Battle Creek but there was not one of my brethren who had the moral courage to stand by my side and take back or confess that they had pursued a wrong course and misjudged their brethren and misjudged me.",
