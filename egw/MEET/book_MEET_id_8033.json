    "word": "Tramelan, December 26, 1886. There were meetings in the morning on business. We saw men collecting around some object some little distance from the house on one of the country roads. We were told it was the body of a man who was frozen to death. He started Saturday evening from Tramelan intoxicated and was unable to proceed through the deep snow because of being intoxicated, and lay down and died. He had a mother living. He had been a great grief to that mother, and now there will be mourning for this poor son who died in consequence of strong drink. Sunday afternoon I spoke in a large, commodious hall to about three hundred people. Brother John \n\n\n                                    -27- \n\nVuilleumier interpreted. The audience was attentive and intelligent, and may the Lord bless the word spoken to their good. Tramelan was the place where the truth first found entrance. This was the first church raised up in Switzerland.--Ms 72, 1886, pp. 1, 2. (Labors in Switzerland--No. 7. Diary, December 24-31, 1886.)",
