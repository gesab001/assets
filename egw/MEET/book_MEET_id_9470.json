    "word": "I have only a little time to write to you. I have been writing hours before daylight. I may not be able to get this copied, but I want to say, We thank you that you assisted us in our time of necessity. We did need help so much, and we thank the members of your mother's family that they sent relief in our time of need, so that we were enabled to build our meetinghouse without a debt upon it. Thank the Lord, O my soul, and praise Him for all His benefits!",
