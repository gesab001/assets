C. \n                                                  May 23, 1905 \n\nDear Brother and Sister Burden: \n\n\n     I feel very grateful to the Lord that he has strengthened me to speak six times at this meeting. When I left my home in St. Helena, I was suffering from a severe cold, and I thought it rather a risk to run to attempt to attend the meeting. But I decided to start with the party, thinking that I would go as far as Los Angeles, and then, if I could not go any further, I would return to St. Helena. The Lord strengthened me, and I have been able to bear my testimony six times since the meeting began. All seem surprised that my voice is so clear and strong. I have said many things that the Lord has given me to say, and I still have more to say. I attend only those meetings in which I can bear my testimony.",
