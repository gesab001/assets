Sometimes when a man is having success in his efforts and the interest continues good, the question of moving him to another field ought not to come to him at all, because it only confuses him. If the Lord is mightily stirring the people of Los Angeles, through the tent meetings, let nothing interrupt the work. . . . Let no one try to draw Brother ----- away from the place where there is a deep interest and an extraordinary opening to present the truth. This is Los Angeles' opportunity.--Letter 193, 1905.",
