    "word": "Dr. Gibbs made his acknowledgments. Elder Rice made no confession, only admitted that which he was compelled to admit before the board. But I should say, he made quite a number of confessions to me at Oakland, at the time of the camp meeting. Dr. Gibbs confessed to his wife too, in a most thorough manner. He confessed to me, and then to the board. He has done all that he could do to make wrongs right. He asked the forgiveness of the board, and then a vote was taken by all the board. Brother and Sister Maxson and Elder Rice raised their hands in unison with the board to vote their acceptance of the confession and their forgiveness.",
