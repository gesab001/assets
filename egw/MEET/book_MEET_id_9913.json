White.) \n\n\n     This morning Mother is rather weary. I spoke one hour under the tent. The weather has been cool and very nice for the meetings. I tried to forget we might have been much better situated, and made a much better impression than we have made. Our tent has been full and the children were in a meeting in another tent.",
