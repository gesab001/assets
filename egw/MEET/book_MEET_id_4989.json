    "word": "The Final Reckoning.--When parents and children meet at the final reckoning, what a scene will be presented! Thousands of children who have been slaves to appetite and debasing vice, whose lives are moral wrecks, will stand face to face with the parents who made them what they are.

He made them in His image, a little lower than the angels.--Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 568. \n                                                                           180",
