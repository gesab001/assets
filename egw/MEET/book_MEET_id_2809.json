    "word": "Kansas Camp Meetings \n\n     Accompanied by my daughter-in-law, Emma White, I left Battle Creek, October 23, for the Kansas camp meeting. At Topeka we left the cars and rode by private conveyance twelve miles to Richland, the place of meeting. We found the settlement of tents in a grove. It was late in the season, and faithful preparation had been made for cold weather. Every tent had a stove.",
