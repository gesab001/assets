    "word": "The Lord has preserved you, that they could not do you harm, but you now know what you will meet. It is enough to meet this against the enemies of the Truth, but when those of our own faith show so little interest and their hearts are as selfish and unsympathizing as a stone, the Lord would not have you exposed to perils without and unsanctified, unconsecrated elements in responsible places of trust. They have not yet hearts that have been worked by the Holy Spirit.",
