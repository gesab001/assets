    "word": "About two months ago we made a trip to Melbourne and Adelaide, tarrying at Sydney, where I spoke twice. I spoke twelve times in Adelaide, once in Ballarat, once in Williamstown, and twelve times in the new church at North Fitzroy. Our meetings were a success in Adelaide. We worked hard, and had large congregations on weekdays and evenings, as well as Sabbath and Sunday. Not only was the tent crowded, but a wall of people surrounded it on the outside.",
