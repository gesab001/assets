    "word": "May 7, 1895. \n\n                  Observance of the Sabbath. \n\nDear Brother: -- \n\n\n     Sister May Lacey and myself left Granville, March 14, going by train to Melbourne on our way to Tasmania. It was necessary that I should be in Melbourne over the Sabbath. I had freedom in speaking to the people assembled on the Sabbath, and was urgently requested to again address them in the missionary meeting on Sunday afternoon. The hall was well filled on these occasions, and the Lord blessed me in speaking to the people. An appointment was made that I should again speak to the people on Tuesday evening, and present important matters before them.",
