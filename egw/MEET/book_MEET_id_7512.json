    "word": "These brethren, by remaining in a family community, are being dwarfed in mental and spiritual strength. It is not the best policy for children of one, two, or \n                                                                           74\nthree families, who are connected by marriage, to settle within a few miles of each other. The influence is not good on the parties. The business of one is the business of all. The perplexities and troubles which every family must experience, more or less, and which, as far as possible, should be confined to limits of the family circle, are extended to family connections, and have a bearing upon the religious meetings. There are matters which should not be known to a third person, however friendly and closely connected they may be. Individuals and families should bear them. But the close relationship of several families, brought into constant intercourse, has a tendency to break down the dignity which should be maintained with every family. The delicate duty of reproof and admonition given, will be in danger of injuring feelings unless done with the greatest tenderness and care. The best models of characters will be liable to errors and mistakes, and great care should be exercised that too much is not made of little things.",
