    "word": "Abridged\n\n5 - Love and Mercy\n\nDate: June 15, 1904 Location: Huntsville, Alabama Source: Letter 243, 1904 Status: Portions published\nContext: While visiting Oakwood for the first time, Mrs. White penned this letter to the Union Conference presidents.\nTo Union Conference presidents,\n     During the past night, scenes that clearly outline our present situation were vividly presented to me. Scenes that had passed before me while we were on the steamer Morning Star were again presented. These representations, with the instruction given me, make clear to my mind the experiences of the Berrien Springs meeting and of the councils which followed in Battle Creek. The long-suffering patience of God, and His wonderful forbearance, were manifested during the Berrien Springs meeting. Once more the Lord held forth to men who have been linking up with worldlings and working with unbelieving lawyers the words of love and mercy that He has been speaking for years.",
