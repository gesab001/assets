    "word": "Brother and Sister James are going to take into the mission home an old lady who embraced the truth at the campmeeting. She was, I believe, the first one to keep the Sabbath. She is an invalid, and will be one as long as she lives, but she is always cheerful and will not accept charity. She supports herself by her own handiwork. She will be a blessing in the mission house.",
