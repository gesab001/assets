    "word": "Another objection to holding open-air meetings is the fact that the congregation is constantly changing, and one cannot come close to them by personal effort. One might preach in the open air till the Lord comes and then be unable to show definite result. Then, too, this kind of labor has a tendency to make the laborer not obtain that kind of experience that is fitting him to be a perfect workman, for he becomes negligent in regard to following up his own work and binding it off securely. He does not obtain that experience that will make him an able minister of Christ. He has very little encouragement to grow in the truth, to obtain a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures, and he does not obtain that experience that will make him an able minister for Christ.",
