    "word": "Those who, when they graduate from college, think that they have learned all they need to learn have a very imperfect idea of education. If they looked at the matter in a right light, they would see that their education in practical life was just commencing. They must now use their knowledge and skill in new and untried ways. They will meet with many disappointments. They will be confronted by disagreeable duties. There will be need for patient, persevering effort. They are now to put their education to practical use. Day by day they will need divine power.",
