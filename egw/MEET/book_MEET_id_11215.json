    "word": "On Sabbath, May 18th, the members of several churches gathered at Loma Linda, and we held meetings under the pepper trees on the lawn at the back of the sanitarium. In the forenoon I spoke for one hour, and the Lord helped me wonderfully. Before closing my remarks, I presented to those present the needs of the sanitarium, and expressed the desire that sufficient money might be received to complete the payments on the additions that have been made to the main building. Before we purchased the property, the main building had been used mostly as a hotel, and the bathroom facilities were limited. In order to do efficient work in the sanitarium, it was necessary to make additions to the buildings already standing. (363) Dr. White, Brother and Sister Burden, and the sisters of Sister Burden, invested in the sanitarium at Loma Linda all that they could possibly spare, but there still remains an indebtedness that must be cleared off.",
