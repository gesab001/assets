    "word": "A Letter to Mrs. White's Sister, Monday, December 22, 1890 \n\n     Dear Sister Mary Foss: [MARY WAS SIX YEARS OLDER THAN ELLEN WHITE. IN 1842 SHE MARRIED SAMUEL FOSS, AN ELDER BROTHER OF HAZEN FOSS. SEE PP. 89-92, BELOW, FOR A FACSIMILE OF THIS ENTIRE LETTER.] I wrote to you a few days ago and now another matter comes up. Elder Loughborough is writing me asking if I know of anyone now alive who was present at the meeting I have mentioned held at Maguire's Hill, where I related the first visions I had. . . . Mary, you were at the meeting, were you not? Your memory is so good. Do you have any remembrance of this? If so, state on paper what you do know in regard to it.",
