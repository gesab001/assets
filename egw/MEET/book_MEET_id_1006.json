    "word": "Deborah\nJudges 4 and 5\n     DEBORAH  THE PROPHET GOVERNED ISRAEL DURING THE REIGN OF JABIN, A CANAANITE KING WHO WAS VERY CRUEL TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. LIFE IN THE VILLAGES WAS HARSH. THE PEOPLE WERE PLUNDERED AND FLED TO THE FORTIFIED CITIES FOR PROTECTION. THEN THE LORD RAISED UP DEBORAH, WHO WAS LIKE A LOVING MOTHER TO ISRAEL. GOD SENT A MESSAGE THROUGH HER TO BARAK THAT HE SHOULD PREPARE TO MEET SISERA,\n37\nJABIN'S GENERAL, IN BATTLE. BARAK REFUSED TO GO UNLESS DEBORAH WENT WITH HIM. SHE AGREED, BUT WARNED HIM THAT BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF FAITH IN THE WORDS OF THE LORD, THE HONOR OF KILLING SISERA WOULD GO TO A WOMAN, NOT TO BARAK.",
