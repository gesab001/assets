    "word": "Chap. 13 - Importance of Receiving the Holy Spirit\n-\n\n     During the night of the first Sabbath of the Newcastle meeting, I seemed to be in meeting, presenting the necessity and importance of our receiving the Spirit. This was the burden of my labor--the opening of our hearts to the Holy Spirit. On one occasion Christ told His disciples, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" Their limited comprehension put a restraint on Him. He could not open to them the truths He longed to unfold; for while their hearts were closed to them, His unfolding of these truths would be labor lost. They must receive the Spirit before they could fully understand Christ's lessons. \"The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,\" Christ said, \"whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"",
