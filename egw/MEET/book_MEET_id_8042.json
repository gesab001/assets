I left the Alma camp meeting sick. I had a high fever all night and all day Monday. Yet we went to B. C. and the doctor told me it was certainly not my duty to go to Magog. He said much now depended on me and I should feel that the cause of God demanded that I should keep myself in the very best condition for labor. He made so urgent a plea I really was on the point of giving up going, but I thought I might have fully as wearing labor to remain, as Father was anxious to go. We were two days and two nights on this trip. We had to wait several hours at Sherbrook, for the stage. They loaded on a very large barrel of alcohol, several boxes and any amount of bundles. Our two large trunks and hand baggage and we stowed ourselves in amid all these and rode sixteen miles to Magog. When we came upon the ground the meeting was in session, but they gave a loud shout of victory. There was a joyous welcome for us. \n\n\n                                    -59-",
