    "word": "We can use the small volumes of Sabbath Readings and other works to good advantage in orphans' homes and in many other places where these little books will be highly valued. We could use some of them in the Soldiers' Home at Yountville, where many hundreds of old soldiers are provided for in large government buildings. We are giving these men every attention possible. Every other Sabbath a party from the sanitarium and the St. Helena churches visits them, to sing religious hymns and to speak to them. They are interested in these meetings, and seem delighted with everything that our people do for them.",
