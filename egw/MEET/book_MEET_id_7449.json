    "word": "Brother and Sister Daniels, must I conclude that the word of the living God has no special weight with you? Must I decide by your course of action that the testimonies of warning, reproof, and entreaty, calling you to God's word, to listen to his voice, are set aside by you as unworthy your notice, as an idle tale? I have not spoken to you my own words, but the words given me of God. You speak your own words, and with such intensity and assurance that you make those whom you address believe error to be truth, and that the testimonies which God has set in the church are of but little weight. Tell me, if you can, what will have weight with you? Tell me what reserve force the Lord has to meet your case? You ride over all counsel, you pay not the least heed to advice unless it pleases you and accords with your mind. When you happen to be so disposed, you will make of none effect the testimonies of the Spirit of God, if they reprove and correct your course. \n\n\n                     [77]",
