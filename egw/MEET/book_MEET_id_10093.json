    "word": "Lynn, Massachusetts, Monday, December 15, 1890 \n\n     We left Danvers at about ten o'clock a.m. Called on Mrs. Emma Morrison and said good-bye to her. She felt disappointed that I could not visit her, but I was altogether too weary to do the visiting many hoped I could do. There were two meetings Wednesday and Thursday evenings. I must speak in Lynn, learn the best route that would take us to Washington, D. C., purchase our tickets, and have everything in readiness for the journey to Washington.--Ms. 52, 1890, p. 1 (Diary 16, p. 399).",
