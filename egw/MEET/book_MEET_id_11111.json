    "word": "It is not the Lord's plan that you should wholly disconnect from the Sanitarium; but it is His plan that in connection with your wife, you should go into the cities and seek to reach the people with the message of present truth. This work will help to make known the work at the Sanitarium, and it will also establish confidence in the minds of the people in the institution. The acquaintances you make as you attend meetings and present the truth from the physician's standpoint, will help to give you an influence; and this line of work will be the means of bringing to our sanitariums a class of people who can be greatly benefited. Arrange your plans so that you can engage in this line of work with freedom, and so that your absence will not hurt the work of the institution.",
