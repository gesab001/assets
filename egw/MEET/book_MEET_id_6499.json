    "word": "Christ has given His life for us; we are His property. \u201cKnow ye not,\u201d He says, \u201cthat your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d God\u2019s children are to show their love for Him by meeting His requirements, by giving themselves to Him. Then only can He use them in His service, that others, through them, may discern the truth and rejoice in it.",
