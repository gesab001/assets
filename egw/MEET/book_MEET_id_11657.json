    "word": "It can not be otherwise than that uneasiness will exist in regard to Brother W. O. Palmer or J. E. White handling the means given and loaned by our people for the work in the South. Should they do their very best, any mistake made would be most severely criticized. Brethren, you have both been too free in the expenditures of means. To meet the pressure of circumstances you have incurred obligations, hoping that means would come in, and sometimes you have been disappointed. Your only safety is in God. If you place your dependence wholly upon Him, there will be more safety in your management. But there is much that will have to be out away from your characters before there can be perfect safety in either of you occupying a position on which so much depends.",
