    "word": "MR No. 608 - Counsels on Hoarding Resources\n\n     The gifts of God both of mind and body are to be brought into the service of Christ. We need to understand their value in order that we may use them in such a way that the Master may not meet with loss. We rob the Lord's treasury when we spend money needlessly, and fail to put it at His command. God has not designed that thousands of pounds should be locked up in banks or in investments, but that they should be put to a wise use.--Letter 99, 1895. (To O. A. Olsen, May 7, 1895.)",
