    "word": "Brethren and sisters, pray as you have never prayed before that the Holy Spirit may come into this meeting, and that every heart may be softened.

They have watched for failings in others, even while they had many failings \n\n\n                    -267- \n\nthemselves. Had they watched themselves, they would have found that they were cherishing a spirit which was not of Christ.",
