    "word": "Christ is the complete system of truth. He says, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\" All true believers center in Christ, their character is irradiated by Christ, all meet in Christ, and circulate about Christ. Truth comes from heaven to purify and cleanse the human agent from every moral defilement. It leads to benevolent action to kind, tender, thoughtful love toward the needy, the distressed, the suffering. This is practical obedience to the words of Christ.",
