    "word": "Be able to say with Paul, \"I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. . . . I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God\" [Acts 20:20, 21, 26, 27]. There is most earnest work to be done, in order that you may so search the Scriptures that you may be able to declare unto those with whom you meet the whole counsel of God.--Ms. 39, 1895. (MR 900.46)",
