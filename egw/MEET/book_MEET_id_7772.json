    "word": "[Jackson, Mich.] Sabbath, April 2, 1859. Brother Meade's family came to the meeting. Also Brother Burwell and wife and a near neighbor who has recently commenced to keep the Sabbath. May the Lord enable them, Brother and Sister Gregory, to persevere. They seem good. The meeting was profitable. Nothing of particular interest occurs. In the evening attend to the ordinances. My mind was particularly depressed. A horror of great darkness settled upon me. James felt it, also Brother Palmer. We commenced to follow the example of our dear Saviour to wash one another's feet. While in this act the dark clouds parted and revealed to us again our Saviour. James and Brother Palmer were also set free. Our mourning is turned to rejoicing. We feel a peace of mind which is ever desirable to be felt by the Christian.--Ms 6, 1859.",
