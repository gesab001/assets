B.-34-'06                       January 19, 1906. \n\nDear Brother and Sister Burden:- \n\n\n     I received your letter yesterday, and was very glad to hear from you. I have been very busy of late. The Lord has sustained me in preparing matter to meet the unbelief and infidelity expressed regarding the Testimonies He has given me to bear to His people. He has given me words to write. I may have to visit Battle Creek when the unsettled weather is over.",
