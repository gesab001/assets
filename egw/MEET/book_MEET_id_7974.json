    "word": "I cannot express to you the pain I have felt to see you accompanying Mattie, sitting by her side and coming to the meetings together, notwithstanding all that has been shown and all the advice given you. . . .

You are placing yourself in the way of temptation, and God will leave you to follow the carnal promptings of your own mind.",
