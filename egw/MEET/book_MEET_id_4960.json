    "word": "I would here call especial attention to the view of this subject given on pages 45, 46. Here is a short extract:--\"The object of the words of our Saviour [Luke 12:33] had not been clearly presented. I saw that the object of selling was not to give to those who are able to labor and support themselves, but to spread the truth. It is a sin to support and indulge in idleness, those who are able to labor. Some have been zealous to attend all the meetings; not to glorify God, but for the \"loaves and fishes.\" Such had much better have been at home laboring with their hands, \"the thing that is good,\" to supply the wants of their families, and to have something to give to sustain the precious cause.\"",
