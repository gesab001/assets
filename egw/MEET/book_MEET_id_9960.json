[JAMES EDSON WHITE'S LETTER TO HIS MOTHER, DATED MAY 11, 1900, INVOLVED CRITICISMS OF THE SIZE, FORMAT, PRICE AND ILLUSTRATIONS OF DESIRE OF AGES. HE ALSO  OBJECTED TO THE APPENDIX IN THE FIRST EDITION, ASKING \"WHAT IS THE USE OF PITCHING INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S BELIEFS IN THE WAY IT IS DONE IN THIS APPENDIX?\" HE ARGUED THAT SUCH MATERIAL MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR LITERATURE EVANGELISTS TO SELL THE BOOK.] In regard to The Desire of Ages, when you meet with those who have criticisms to make, as will always be the case, do not take any notice of the supposed mistakes, but praise the book, tell of its advantages. The Desire of Ages would have been the same size as the two former books had it not been for the strong recommendation of Brother B_____ who was then General Canvassing Agent. What you say about the appendix is the first objection we have heard regarding that feature. Many have spoken of the great help they have found in the appendix. If people are prejudiced against anything that makes prominent the Sabbath, that very objection shows the necessity of it being there to convict minds.",
