    "word": "I spoke Tuesday evening to an interested audience. There was a large number of children and youth present, and children from eight years old and upward sat \n\n\n                                     -262- \n\nwith their eyes wide open, listening with apparent great interest to the words spoken. My heart went out in love to these dear children, and I could not forbear addressing words to them especially who need words of invitation and encouragement, to give their hearts to Jesus. Is it not children and youth who help compose our assemblies? God wants the children and youth to join the Lord's army. I told them I was pleased to see them in the meeting and they could become soldiers of the cross of Christ. . . .",
