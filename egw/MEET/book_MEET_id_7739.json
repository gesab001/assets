    "word": "Brother and Sister Corliss went to Bismarck one evening and held a meeting, and the next day returned with a conveyance in which we all took passage for Bismarck. The whole party, excepting myself, walked up the high, graded road over the mountains. We hired a small, furnished cottage in Bismarck, and I spoke in the meetinghouse on Tuesday evening and Wednesday afternoon. The little church was filled with our brethren and sisters who seemed to come in to receive the bread of life. Brother Colcord spoke Wednesday evening. On Thursday we visited some of our brethren who live upon small farms among the hills or in the woods. Many of them cultivate fruit for a living. We saw that many of them had to travel several miles in order to attend the meetings, and return again to their homes. On Thursday evening I again spoke the message of truth to the people, especially dwelling upon the truth that is appropriate to these last days. Believers and unbelievers seemed greatly interested. There were those listening who were children of God, who were seeking to obey His commandments. They came from their humble homes, bringing their little children with them, but \n\n\n                                     -259- \n\nnot one eyelid drooped in slumber. Every eye was directed toward the speaker, and they manifested whole-hearted interest. I addressed words to the children and youth that were especially adapted to them, and I believe that many of the little ones understood the invitation of Jesus. I spoke to them from the words that Jesus addressed to His disciples when the mothers brought their little ones to Him, and when they rebuked them for troubling Christ with the children. Christ had said, \"Suffer the little children to come unto Me and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" He took the little children in His arms and put His hands upon them and blessed them.",
