    "word": "Those who talk unbelief may have a little enthusiasm when the sky is bright, and everything encouraging; but when the battle goes hard, when we have to hope against hope, and urge our petitions to the throne of grace through deep darkness, then the unbelieving ones will not talk of the good land of Canaan, but will make prominent the dangers to be encountered. They will dwell on the strong walls, and the giants we shall meet, when the language of faithful Caleb should be heard: \u201cThe land . . . is an exceeding good land. If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us.\u201d  [Numbers 14:7, 8.]",
