    "word": "The truth is not to languish. Medical missionary work is not to be done only in the slums of our large cities. It is possible to sway the work so heavily in the line of working for the hopelessly degraded that the fields ripe for the harvest will be neglected. Yet this work is not to be neglected. At our camp meetings there should be men who devote themselves to the work of rescuing those held by Satan in the slavery of appetite. God says, \"Bring in hither the lame, and the halt, and the blind.\" In the meetings the subject of temperance is to be presented. Angels of God pass through the congregation, convicting and converting souls.",
