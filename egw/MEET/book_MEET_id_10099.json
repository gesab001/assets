    "word": "We had beautiful weather. The air was cool and bracing and the cars were not overheated. We found in the morning we could not reach Washington on time at eleven o'clock, for we were three hours behind time. We tarried one hour in \n\n\n                                    -50- \n\nBaltimore and reached Washington at three o'clock p.m. As there was no one to meet us, the porter secured a hack and the hackman took us to the mission. We were thankful to get trunks and all arranged before the Sabbath. After this we shall always endeavor to make arrangements to get to our place of destination on Thursday.",
