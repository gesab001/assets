    "word": "Expensive Family No Reason for Higher Wages.-- Men have written to me saying that they must have high wages, and pleading as an excuse an expensive family. And at the same time the institution with which they were connected was obliged to figure closely to meet running expenses. Why should anyone plead an expensive family as a reason for demanding high wages? Is not the lesson that Christ has given sufficient? He says, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:24).--2SM 183. \n\n248",
