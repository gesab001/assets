    "word": "\"I commenced speaking at the stand but the wind blew so hard, \n     swaying the trees and rustling the leaves, we thought best to \n     repair to the tent. . . . After speaking above one hour I called \n     those forward who were unconverted and also the backsliders and \n     those who felt that they had sins upon them that separated them \n     from God. Before our effort closed sixty-five came forward. Deep \n     feeling pervaded the meeting. There was much weeping, many \n     confessions made, well wet down with tears. Parents were pleading \n     for their children and youth were soliciting the youth to give \n     their hearts to God. In speaking and entreating sinners, I stood \n     upon my feet about four hours.\"--Letter 44, 1876.",
