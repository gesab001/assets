    "word": "My brethren, you are required by our Saviour to take heed how you witness for Him. You need to go deeper and still deeper in the study of the word. You have all classes of minds to meet, and as you teach the truths of the sacred word, you are to manifest earnestness, respect, and reverence. Weed out storytelling from your discourses, and preach the word. You will then have more sheaves to bring to the Master. Remember that in your audience there are those who are constantly harassed by temptation. Some are wrestling with doubt, almost in despair, almost hopeless. Ask God to help you to speak words that will strengthen them for the conflict.--Review and Herald, December 22, 1904.",
