    "word": "Study carefully the method of taking the donation, as suggested by the experience of Brother Corliss and the Pacific Press employees. It may seem best to you to follow the suggestions by distributing envelopes to old and young in your meeting. Urge the members to make the subject a matter of family study and prayer during the week, and then bring their gifts the following Sabbath. The dedication of the gift by a season of prayer will bring a blessing to the church. We pray that this may be more than an ordinary collection. This gift should be a beautiful one-- large in proportion to the need.",
