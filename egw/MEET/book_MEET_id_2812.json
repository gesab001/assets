    "word": "Tuesday morning the meeting closed, and we went to Sherman, Kansas, where another camp meeting had been appointed. This was an interesting and profitable meeting, although there were only about one hundred brethren and sisters present. It was designed for a general gathering of the scattered ones. Some were present from southern Kansas, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, and  Tennessee. At this meeting my husband joined me, and from here, with Elder Haskell and our daughter, we went to Dallas, Texas.",
