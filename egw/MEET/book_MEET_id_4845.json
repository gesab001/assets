    "word": "Chapter XXXV - Visit to Ohio.\n\n     In the spring of 1858, we visited Ohio, and attended conferences at Green Springs, Gilboa and Lovett's Grove. Bro. Tillotson took us from Green Springs in his carriage to the places of meeting. At Lovett's Grove the Lord met with us, and his blessing rested upon us. First-day afternoon there was to be a funeral at the school-house where our meetings were held. My husband was invited to give a discourse on the occasion. The people could not all get into the house. My husband was blessed with freedom, and the power of truth seemed to affect the hearers.",
