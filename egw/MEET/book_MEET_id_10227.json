    "word": "We want, as we enter houses, to approach the inmates in a spirit that will show to them that we do not mean them harm. This is the example that Christ laid down, and we are to do as He did. \"We are co-laborers together with Christ.\" My heart yearns for you today; I know there is a work for you to do. I know that there are persons here who are not converted, and that, when they are, there will be a light in their countenances that we do not see now. You must put away from you the cheap, low talk; get hold of Jesus Christ; search the Scriptures until they will dwell in your memory, and until you get your conversation away from the cheap gossip, and tattling, and talking about those who expect to meet their Lord in a little while.",
