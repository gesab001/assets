    "word": "A Swedish Home\n     When we came to Stockholm we were taken to the home of Bro. Norlin, who, living near the meeting-hall, had secured extra rooms in order to entertain us. Neither he nor his wife could speak English; Bro. Matteson, who came with us from Copenhagen, acted as interpreter. But our good friends had just moved into a new brick house, \n190\nwhich was not thoroughly dry; in some parts of the building the masons were still at work, and the chill and dampness rendered it unsafe for me to remain there, I thought of taking a room at a hotel for myself and Sister McEnterfer; but neither of us could speak the Swedish, and how were we to make our wants known? While we were thus in perplexity considering the situation, Sister Johanneson, who had lived in America and could speak English quite well, came in to invite us to her home. This invitation we gladly accepted. Her house was pleasantly situated on a hill in the suburbs of the city. A cosy little parlor on the third floor was appropriated to our use. I had become much reduced in strength by the pain I had endured and still continued to suffer from my teeth, and the rest and quiet of this home was very grateful.",
