    "word": "MR No. 244 - Sanitariums\n\n     The Lord has presented before me very many fields in which we have no sanitariums. Medical institutions are to be established in many places. In every city the gospel of Christ is to be proclaimed. The brethren in charge of the work should now be making arrangements to do the work that must be done in places where nothing has been done. Camp meetings must be held to open the way for our workers. In all our camp meetings earnest efforts should be made to arouse the people. The best ministerial talent must be obtained for these meetings. The third angel's message is to be presented in its fullness, including the testing truths of the Sabbath question.",
