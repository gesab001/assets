    "word": "Elder Franke has been laboring in New York City for the worldlings and all who would hear the message, and a number embraced the truth; but other \n\n\n                                -196- \n\ngifts were needed to engage in the same kind of mission work which has been [carried on] in Australia. I said to Elder Haskell, Will you go and take hold of the work in New York City after the conference? He said he had a burden for New York City, and if I would come and bear [the] testimony the Lord has given to me, to those who were professing to believe the truth, he would take hold in New York. I consented to do this after the conference should close; but my work was marked out to visit Indiana, Des Moines, College View, Denver, Colorado, and Oregon. I had appointments in this round of meetings, and then attended the camp meeting in Oakland. So it was made impossible for me to go to New York as I had purposed to do.",
