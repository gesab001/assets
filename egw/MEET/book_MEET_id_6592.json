    "word": "You may bear a testimony the opposite to that which Satan would have you bear. You may keep heart and mind sanctified by obedience to the truth. Look to Him, at morning and at noon and at night. Keep heart and mind fastened upon Christ. This is your privilege. The suffering and death of Christ has paid the price for your redemption, and through faith in Him you may overcome. . . . Let the love of Christ dwell in your hearts. . . . We must graduate sensibly in this life if we would be transferred to the higher school of the courts above.--Manuscript 79, Aug. 26, 1909, \"That I May Bring Forth More Fruit,\" sermon preached at Council Grove, Kansas, camp meeting.",
