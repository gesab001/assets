    "word": "Last Sunday an all-day grove meeting was held on the school grounds. The weather was beautiful, and about two hundred and forty people came. I had been sick, and it was feared that I could not speak. But in the afternoon, with fear and trembling, I took my stand before the people. The Lord gave me a tongue and utterance, and I spoke for an hour. Oh, I was so glad that I could speak to the people on this occasion. Quite a number of those not of our faith were present, and their interested faces showed their pleasure and satisfaction.",
