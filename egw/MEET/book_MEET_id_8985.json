    "word": "The promise had been made to hold the camp meeting in Ballarrat this season, but when the brethren came to see me while I was at Brother Israel's last April to plan about this meeting, I told them I had something to say. From the light God had graciously given me, this season the camp meeting should be in Melbourne. I said, I know what you will say, brethren, We are short of means and cannot bear such expense. But I presented my reasons and everyone say that they were sound, and the matter was settled right then and there.--Letter 83, 1895, pp. 3, 4. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. April 12, 1984",
