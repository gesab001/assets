    "word": "My brethren, you have no time to fill your mouths with arguments to prove that someone is doing wrong. Leave Satan to do his own work of accusing. Do not furnish him with arguments to show the defects in your brethren and in your sisters. All have come far short of the glory of God. Our individual powers need to be elevated, purified, sanctified, then the moral taste will be changed. The scent of self will not spoil our influence. All our talents are to be cherished as a precious, entrusted gift. They are to help us to meet the very highest standard. Every effort should be made to bring other minds under the power of the truth.",
