    "word": "Since the Brooklyn meeting I no longer talk of feebleness and infirmities. I never had such freedom from pain. I am sleeping nights as I have not slept for twelve years. The peace of God abides in my heart. To speak the words God has given me is more than my meat and my drink. There is a thankful heart full of praise ascending to God all the time. Sabbath, that blessed Sabbath in Brooklyn, from early morning hours all through the day and constantly since, I have been eating of the heavenly manna.",
