    "word": "Seeking Wisdom Regarding Burdens--The past night has been a night of great perplexity. Many things were represented to me which cause me much distress of mind. I have not been able to sleep after half past twelve o'clock and there is much to think of. How shall we avoid spiritual difficulties we must meet if things are ever set in order? I leave my bed, but do not feel refreshed as I would like to feel. I build my fire, seek the Lord and ask Him to help me to do His will and not to take on burdens I can avoid.--Ms 177, 1903, p. 2. (Diary, Dec. 10, 1903.)",
