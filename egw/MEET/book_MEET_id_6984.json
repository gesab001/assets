    "word": "AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CONSTITUENCY HELD LATE IN MARCH, 1911, THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING THIS PROPERTY WAS PRESENTED. A NUMBER LOOKED OVER THE TRACT, BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. AT THE CLOSE OF THIS MEETING SISTER WHITE VISITED PARADISE VALLEY. WITHIN A FEW DAYS SHE RETURNED, SAYING THAT HER WORK AT LOMA LINDA WAS NOT YET FINISHED. SOON AFTER HER RETURN SHE TOOK UP THE MATTER OF THE PURCHASE OF THE BALANCE OF THE KELLY TRACT OF EIGHTY-SIX ACRES WEST OF PEPPER DRIVE. THREE OR FOUR TIMES SHE RODE OVER AND AROUND THE PROPERTY, EACH TIME STATING SHE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED THAT WE SHOULD SECURE THE LAND ADJOINING THE SANITARIUM, AND URGING THAT WE ASK THE BRETHREN TO PRAY OVER THE MATTER, SO THAT WE MIGHT HAVE LIGHT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. SHE MENTIONED THAT WE NEEDED THE PROPERTY, AND EMPHASIZED PARTICULARLY THE TROUBLES THAT WOULD COME TO US IF OTHERS WERE ALLOWED TO SECURE THE LAND AND SELL IT TO UNBELIEVERS WHO WOULD CROWD IN ABOUT US.",
