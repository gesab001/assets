    "word": "MR No. 1024 - An Invitation to Attend Meetings in Michigan\n\n     Our people are attending the meetings being held by those assembled here, and they are greatly pleased. Elder Corliss says he never heard sermons equal to some that he has heard here. I wish you could both be here. There is plenty of room for you in the house, and when our tent comes we shall have things remarkable to our minds. We get along very well.",
