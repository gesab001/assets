    "word": "We must remember that in every place in which we work on the Lord's side, we counterwork the efforts of Satanic agencies. You have passed through trials; and you will have trials to meet to a greater or less degree, wherever you may be. Satan will watch every weak point of character, and will strive for the mastery; but we cannot afford to lose our chance of gaining a victory for the Lord's side. Constantly we encounter foes, and unless we are on guard, we shall lose precious opportunities of obtaining victories. . . .",
