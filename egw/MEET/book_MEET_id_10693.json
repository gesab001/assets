    "word": "Feb. 8, \"He Shall Teach you All Things.\" I spoke twice on Sabbath, and again this afternoon. For three weeks I have spoken every day, with one or two exceptions. Some of the meetings that I have attended have called for earnest labor. My powers have been taxed to the utmost limit of endurance. At times I think that I have said all that is necessary, and then the burden rolls upon me, and I confer not with flesh and blood, but in the name of the Lord speak the words He gives me, leaving the consequences with Him.",
