    "word": "The message preceding the public ministry of the Son of God was, Repent, publicans; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees, \"for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" (Matthew 3:2). Our message is not to be one of \"peace and safety\" (1 Thessalonians 5:3). As a people who believe in Christ's soon appearing, we have a work to do, a message to bear--\"Prepare to meet thy God\" (Amos 4:12). We are to lift up the standard, and bear the third angel's message--the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. \n                                                                           151",
