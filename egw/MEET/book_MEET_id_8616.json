    "word": "Oh, shall we not listen to the words of God? Here are our directions. I present them to you, and ask you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth to \n\n\n                                 -106- \n\narouse to the work that God is giving you to do. Shall we not arouse from our sleep, and do this work intelligently? God bids us work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, declaring that God works in us to will and to do of His good pleasure. Let us seek to honor our Redeemer, and to glorify His name. I may not be able to speak to you again on this subject, but let fathers and mothers bear in mind that they have a solemn record to meet in the judgment. Consider your children, and the judgment that must one day be passed upon them. Has your example been such that they will have no excuse for their wrong course of action? You are to counsel and reprove in the fear of the Lord. You are to seek the Lord in prayer for a spirit that He can commend. May the Lord's blessing rest upon this congregation. May the word that has been spoken make a deep impression on your minds, leading you to form correct habits, and make a record that you will not be ashamed to meet in the judgment.--Ms. 27, 1911, pp. 1-8.
