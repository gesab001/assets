    "word": "We had our old family tent which we purchased from Brother Hickox at the Brighton camp meeting. This was occupied by members of my family. We also had a dining tent and a cooking tent. W. C. White had a tent on the ground. We also had two pleasant rooms about two minutes' walk from the ground. I had one of these, and the other was occupied by W. C., May, and the twins.
