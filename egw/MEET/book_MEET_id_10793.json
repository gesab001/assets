    "word": "I tell you, the churches are hungering and starving, and how readily they grasp the word of God and the encouragement He gives them. I cannot hold back and refuse to visit the churches, for I know I have a message for them from the Lord. After the season of prayer we asked those who had a desire to testify, and although many had been in the church from nine o'clock in the morning until night without anything to eat, they were in no hurry for the meeting to close. There were many testimonies borne. Earnest supplications were made to God for ministers and people, and the testimony of many was, The Lord is in this place.",
