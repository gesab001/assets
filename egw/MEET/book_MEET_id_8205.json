    "word": "MR No. 389 - Mrs. White's First Automobile Ride\n\n     At the Chicago railway station we found one of your automobiles waiting to take us to the Sanitarium. It was a covered carriage, shaped like a street-car, and I lay down on one of the seats running along each side. It was great relief to me to be able to lie down. . . . I was pleased to meet, while in Chicago, several of the members of the firm with which you are connected.--Letter 11, 1902, pp. 1, 2. (To H. W. Kellogg, January 28, 1902.) [H. W. Kellogg was connected with the Chicago-based motor vehicle company which manufactured the \"Worth\" car.] \n\nReleased December 2, 1974.",
