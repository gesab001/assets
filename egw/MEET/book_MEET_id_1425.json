    "word": "Camp Meeting Bible Class Conducted by Women. --Our camp meetings are to be conducted in such a way that they shall be schools for the education of workers. We need to have a better understanding of the division of labor, and educate all how to carry each part of the work successfully. . . . Let short discourses be given, and then let Bible classes be held. Let the speaker be sure to rivet the truth upon minds. \n                                                                           474\nIntelligent women, if truly converted, can act a part in this work of holding Bible classes. There is a wide field of service for women as well as for men.--Letter 84, 1910.",
