    "word": "Letter 394, 1904. (Written to Ella May and Mable White, November 23, 1904, from San Diego, California.) I did not meet your father last night. He did not come until eight o'clock. This morning your father and Brother Palmer came into my room very early. Brother Palmer was somewhat excited. Said he, \"There is 15 feet come in the past night and we have, with our pumping apparatus, tried to lessen the depth but we have to send for a larger pipe to take out the water.\" They say the water is soft and clear. \n\n\n                                   -267-",
