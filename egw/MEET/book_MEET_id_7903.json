    "word": "Stockholm, Sabbath, June 25, 1887. I went to the early morning meeting and spoke from John 13:34, 35. We had a precious season. Many excellent testimonies were borne and all seemed to feel deeply. Many tears were shed, showing that hearts were softened. One brother lives quite a distance from here. He lives on the borders of Denmark. He has lived in America; received the truth in Indianapolis and has come back to Sweden to labor with his countrymen. He is a very plain, unlearned man. He has not buried his talent but used it to the very best of his ability, and he has worked in a silent way until he has been the means of bringing eighteen to the truth. He is sincere and humble and the Lord blesses him.",
