    "word": "Dr. Kellogg occupies a position of great responsibility. Many are looking to him as one able to comprehend the truth. But he often misleads minds in regard to his work. He can not meet his high responsibilities unless he is converted. That which he most needs is a knowledge of God's will concerning himself,--a knowledge of how to speak, how to teach, how to control his spirit. He needs to learn how to place in the Lord's ministers the confidence that he desires them to place in him. The Lord calls upon Dr. Kellogg and his associates to step into line with their brethren, to become united in spirit with the ministers and teachers who are carrying forward the work that the Lord has given them to do. Many of these workers are conscientiously trying to serve the interests of the cause of God, and they should have the sympathy and support of the medical workers.",
