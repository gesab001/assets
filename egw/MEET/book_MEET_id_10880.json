    "word": "The long strain, coming upon me as it did since the Minneapolis meeting, had no let up. My work was made tenfold harder by the course pursued by those who ought to have stood by me.

I question not His promises. He will do the work of restoration for His word is pledged. I am not disappointed that the work was not done immediately.",
