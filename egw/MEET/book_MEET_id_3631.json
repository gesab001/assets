    "word": "Brain nerve-power to resist temptation\n     We hope that at this meeting those who understand the principles of health reform will exert a strong influence on the side of temperance.

Parents, teach the members of your household that indulgence of appetite is the work of the enemy. Teach them to guard against his deceptions. Such instruction should be given by everyone who takes the responsibility of bringing children into the world; and especially at this stage of the world's history fathers and mothers should realize that their children are the property of God, and that He holds them accountable to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.",
