We must now work with determined effort. We must not prescribe the precise steps which he must take, but we must lay hold of the man himself, and let him see that the spirit of God and the spirit of soul-saving are in us. Satan has worked to bind him up with himself, but shall we stand by and make no effort to pull him away from Satan? Shall we not in the name of the Lord call for Dr. Kellogg to come to this meeting, not that we may make accusations against him, but that we may help him and all of us draw with Christ.",
