    "word": "God weighs every man in the scales of the sanctuary. Each one may have his own individual standard, but God's holy, immutable law, in which there is no variableness neither shadow of turning, is the standard that all must meet. Read, and take heed, lest ye perish in the way of your own choosing: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\" God requires the powers of heart and mind and body. All these are the Lord's talents, lent by him to human beings that they may be used to his name's glory. Life itself is a talent of great value; for when health is once lost, it may be gone for good as far as this world is concerned. Just as long as life is granted to a human being, that human being, whether man, woman or child, is under obligation to employ his entrusted talent in God's service, keeping himself in the most healthful conditions, that he may offer to God an acceptable sacrifice, \n                                                                           1674\nwhich is his reasonable service. When man by faith walks with God, he uses the great talent of life to the best advantage. As far as possible, he should keep mind, soul, and body in a healthful condition, that his discernment may be clear, that he may understand spiritual things. He must not be so devoted to common business things that he will make no difference between the sacred and the common, and like Nadab and Abihu neglect the special requirement that associates his service with a holy God. He is not to think that he is at liberty to use his own supposedly superior qualifications, without the holy fire, the vital, sanctifying element that makes his service acceptable to God.",
