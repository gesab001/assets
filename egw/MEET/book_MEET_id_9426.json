    "word": "We go to Italy next Thursday. Mary accompanies me. Ella will remain at home with Sarah and Christine. Brother Whitney goes with us to Italy. Sister Bourdeau goes with us, to remain a few weeks. I think it will not be best to remain long now; a few weeks will be enough. If we see occasion for remaining sixty days, the length of our ticket, we can do so. Brother Whitney thinks [that] when I shall return here Brother Ertzenberger better commence meetings here and Brother Conradi join him and make a regular effort to bring souls to the knowledge of the truth.",
