    "word": "Many Might Be Intellectual Giants.--Many of our laborers might today be intellectual giants had they not been content to meet a low level but been diligent and let their thoughts and investigations plow deep. Many of our young people are in danger of being superficial, of failing to grow up to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. They consider that they have a sufficient degree of knowledge and understanding of subjects, and if they do not love study they will not plow deep to obtain all the treasures possible for them to acquire.--Lt 33, 1886.",
