    "word": "In the meeting held in California two years ago, the Lord wrought in our midst. The very last night of the meeting, there was earnest seeking of the Lord. There was the breaking of hearts as the Spirit of the Lord came into the meeting. And at three o'clock a.m., before the meeting closed, we prayed with subdued and humble hearts having faith in God to work with us, by us and through us. I attended the meeting at Minneapolis, the history of that meeting has passed into eternity with its burden of record and when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened there will be found registered a history that many who were at that meeting will not be pleased to meet. \n                                                                           707",
