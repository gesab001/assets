    "word": "When Paul wrote, \"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly,\" he did not exhort his brethren to aim at a standard which it was impossible for them to reach; he did not pray that they might have blessings which it was not the will of God to give. He knew that all who would be fitted to meet Christ in peace, must possess a pure and holy character.",
