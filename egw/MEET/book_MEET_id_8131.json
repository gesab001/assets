    "word": "Brother Geyment, an Italian, is doing what he can. We tried to educate him. He can talk both French and Italian, so he is fitted for this field. This brother walks up the rugged mountains through the defiles in paths where precipices are on either side, and where in fogs, which are so common to these mountains, a stranger would most surely imperil his life, but one who is accustomed to these trails can find his way, but he dare not go alone. He is holding meetings in three different villages, one five miles away, another seven, and another three. He goes on foot to these places, holds his meetings commencing at eight o'clock and then walks home, getting to his bed about midnight. This is done night after night. . . .",
