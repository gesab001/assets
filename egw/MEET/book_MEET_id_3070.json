    "word": "There stands the risen host. The last thought was of death and its pangs. The last thoughts they had were of the grave and the tomb, but now they proclaim, \"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\" . . . Here they stand and the finishing touch of immortality is put upon them and they go up to meet their Lord in the air. . . .

Oh, what music! There is not an inharmonious note. Every voice proclaims, \"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.\" He sees the travail of His soul, and is satisfied.",
