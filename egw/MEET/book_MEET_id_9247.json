    "word": "Elder Van Horn accompanied us to Portland. He returned yesterday to continue his labors. He is to visit. We urged him to this before he left, and he will keep it up now. We think personal effort will do more in such a place as Salem than pulpit effort. I think I never felt a greater burden than in Salem, or had a more solemn testimony to bear to the people. At every meeting when it was given out that I would speak, the tent seats were well filled. But evenings are so cold that it is almost dangerous to attend evening meetings in a tent.",
