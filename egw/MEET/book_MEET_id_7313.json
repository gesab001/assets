    "word": "There is no time to spend in frivolity. Deny self, and dress and live simply. Remember that there is a message to be borne to those who are in darkness, a work to be done for the Master. The Lord will bless all who will take part in the work of preparing a people to meet Him in peace. We should be terribly in earnest. Lay your plans before God. Tell Him that you desire to serve Him; give up your desires to Him, and He will teach you His way. [UNPUBLISHED LETTER, SEPT. 23, 1907.]",
