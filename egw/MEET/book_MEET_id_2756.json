    "word": "\"Tuesday evening I spoke an hour with great freedom. Brother Andrews talked in an earnest, touching manner. The Spirit of the Lord was in the meeting. Angels of God seemed drawing very near, driving back the evil angels. Minister and people wept like children. We felt that we had gained ground, and that the powers of darkness had given back. Our meeting closed well.",
