    "word": "There is danger that our brethren and sisters will become careless, and will be blinded to their spiritual needs, so that they will not be on their guard at these general meetings; and when they should grow strong by accepting light, they will become weak by refusing it, because they neglect to watch and pray. Wherever the people of God are assembled, Satan and his angels are found to exercise their power through human agencies. If the evil one can find one soul open to his suggestions, he presses his advantage. When earthly tendencies control the mind, the spiritual nature is benumbed, and men, \"seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.\" The natural current of the thought is not spiritual, and it is difficult for those whose minds are open to suspicion, evil surmisings, envy, and unbelief, to receive the truth, or to be impressed with the message of God.",
