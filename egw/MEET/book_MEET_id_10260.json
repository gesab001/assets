    "word": "[Sister White:] That is just the way it was in Christ's teaching. There should not be anything like controversy. And after you have answered their question, be sure that they acknowledge it is answered. Don't let it drop. Don't tell them to ask that again. But feel your way, how much you have gained. When any come in with a spirit of controversy, tell them that the meeting is not appointed for that purpose, but it is to educate those who have been listening and could not understand some things in the discourse. It is not to get in their doctrinal and controverted points.",
