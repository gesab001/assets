My brethren, the Saviour has revealed Himself to you in manifold ways; He has filled your heart with the sunlight of His presence while you have labored in distant lands and in the homeland; He has kept you through dangers seen and unseen; and now, as you meet once more with your brethren in council, it is your privilege to be glad in the Lord and to rejoice in the knowledge of His sustaining grace.",
