    "word": "Washington, D. C., Thursday, December 25, 1890 \n\n     I attended morning meeting in the hall. We listened to the readings, which were made very interesting. Then I was asked to lead in prayer and several prayers were offered. I felt like pressing my prayers to the throne of grace for the Lord to open the work in Washington. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon us as we prayed. Many were blessed.",
