    "word": "My brethren and sisters, you are soon to go away for the summer's work, some to the ministry, some to teaching, and others to various lines of work. Before you leave this meeting, you should receive the testimony of the Holy Spirit that you have taken hold of the divine power and have made peace with God. Your hearts should be filled with the peace which passeth all understanding.",
