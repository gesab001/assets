    "word": "ANOTHER WORD ABOUT HER CHARACTER: I REGARDED HER AS ONE OF THE STURDIEST CHARACTERS I EVER MET.  I CAN COMPARE HER LIFE ONLY TO THE STURDY OAK THAT MEETS THE WIND AND BEARS ITS SEVEREST PRESSURE; OR THE MOUNTAIN THAT LAUGHS AT THE STORM.  SHE MET TRIAL AND OPPOSITION FROM THOSE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY; AND SHE MET IT IN THE KINDEST, SWEETEST SPIRIT, BUT WITH THE FIRMEST DETERMINATION \n                                                                           219\nTO CONQUER, ALWAYS CONQUER.  I NEVER KNEW HER TO BE CONQUERED.  HER FAITH IN GOD WAS INVINCIBLE IN THIS COUNTRY, OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY.  UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD HAVE SWAMPED THE FAITH OF MANY, SHE TRIUMPHED UNDER TRIAL.",
