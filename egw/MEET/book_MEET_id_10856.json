    "word": "I have today had earnest talk with several of our ministering brethren. I had hoped to be able to attend the meeting in Carlton, but this is impossible. It would be presumptuous. But I would so much like to go. I have a message to bear and I am full of important things which I wish to speak to the people. I carry a burden which I wish to lay off upon those who really believe the truth but I know do not comprehend its import. There is a nominal assent to the truth but its deep spiritual meaning is not understood.",
