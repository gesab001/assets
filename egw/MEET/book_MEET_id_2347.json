    "word": "Some people seem to think that upon entering the church they will have their expectations fulfilled, and meet only with those who are pure and perfect. They are zealous in their faith, and when they see faults in church members, they say, \"We left the world in order to have no association with evil characters, but the evil is here also;\" and they ask, as did the servants in the parable, \"From whence then hath it tares?\" But we need not be thus disappointed, for the Lord has not warranted us in coming to the conclusion that the church is perfect; and all our zeal will not be successful \n                                                                           62\nin making the church militant as pure as the church triumphant.--TM 47 (1893).",
