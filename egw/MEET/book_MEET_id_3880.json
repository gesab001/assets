    "word": "What is needed is men of action for the time, prompt, determined, firm as a rock to principle, and prepared to meet any emergency. Why we are so weak, why there are so many irresponsible men among us, is because they do not connect with God; they have not an indwelling Saviour, and do not feel the love of Christ ever fresh and new. . . . No earthly relationship is as strong as this love. Nothing can compare with it.--Review and Herald, Aug. 28, 1879.",
