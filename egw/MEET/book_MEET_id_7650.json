    "word": "We are now at Lodi, attending the camp meeting. The meeting is drawing to a close, and we expect to leave here Sunday morning. We are leaving the grounds a little before the meeting closes, hoping to meet some of the brethren who are looking for a site for the Healdsburg school. The lot of land that the brethren have in mind is near Sebastapol. Professor Reed is very anxious that Willie and I shall see the place and give advice as to whether we should settle the school there. Letter 146, 1908, pp. 1, 2. (To Mrs. H. G. Bree, May 9, 1908.)",
