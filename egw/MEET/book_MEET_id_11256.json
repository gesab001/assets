(Interview on Southern California Conference Matters.--Part I.) \n\n\n       The Responsibilities of a Conference President \n\n\n     Report of an interview, Sabbath afternoon October 5, 1907, \n     at the home of Mrs. E. G. White, Sanitarium, California. \n     Present: Mrs. E.G. White, Elders G.W. Reaser, J.A. Burden, \n     and W.C. White, and C.C. Crisler. \n\n\n     J.A. Burden: Brother Reaser and I came here to talk over some matters. The communications that have been sent us by you have been very stirring, very touching, and Brother Reaser, it seemed to me, was taking a somewhat wrong view of them, and I felt that others were influencing him in wrong ways concerning them. Of course, in his position, when leading men talk to him in the line that he is inclined to feel like following, it even urges him on' and so I advised him to come and talk with you. But he did not want to come, unless I should come along with him. I had all confidence to come to headquarters, and that you would meet him here, and tell him whether there was any further light for him.",
