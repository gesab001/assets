God does not prevent the plottings of wicked men, but He causes their devices to work for good to those who in trial and conflict maintain their faith and loyalty.  Often the gospel worker carries on his work amid storms of persecution, bitter opposition, and unjust reproach.  At such times let him remember that the experience to be gained in the furnace of trial and affliction is worth more than all the pain it costs.  Thus God brings His children near to Him, that He may show them their weakness and His strength.  He teaches them to lean on Him.  Thus He prepares them to meet emergencies, to fill positions of trust, and to accomplish the great purpose for which their powers were given them.",
