C. \n                                                  June 2, 1905 \n\nDear Brother Burden: \n\n\n     I am much encouraged by the letters that I have received from you regarding Loma Linda. From your description of the place, I believe it meets the representation which I have seen of what we should seek for as sanitarium locations. Such a place was presented to me a few miles from an important city. The city has recently been built up.",
