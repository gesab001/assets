    "word": "\"They that Feared the Lord.\" \n\n     In Malachi 3:16 an opposite class is brought to view, a class that meet together, not to find fault with God, but to speak of his glory, and tell of his mercies. These have been faithful in their duty. They have given to the Lord his own. Testimonies are borne by them, that make the heavenly angels sing and rejoice. These have no complaints to make against God. Those who walk in the light, who are faithful and true in doing their duty, are not always complaining and finding fault. They speak words of courage, hope, and faith. It is those who serve themselves, who do not give God his own, that complain.",
