    "word": "A night's journey by rail from Malmo brings us to Stockholm. Here we have a church of ninety members, the result of Eld. Matteson's labors and some colporter work.  This church seemed to prize very highly the privileges afforded by the meetings. Their hall, which had seats for some over two hundred, was crowded every evening. Every foot of standing room was occupied. I spoke to them on the Sabbath and at three evening meetings. Our brethren and sisters gave earnest attention, and all were prompt to respond.",
