    "word": "\"Take my yoke upon you,\" Christ said, as in human nature He lived and worked upon this earth. Constantly He wore the yoke of submission, meeting the difficulties that human beings must meet, bearing the trials that they must bear. The enemy will continually assault us as he assaulted Christ, bringing against us strong temptation. But for everyone there is a way of escape.--Manuscript 88, Aug. 9, 1903, \"Be Not Weary in Well-doing.\"",
