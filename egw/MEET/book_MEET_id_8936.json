    "word": "MR No. 1013 - The Newcastle and Brighton Camp Meetings in New South Wales\n\n     Newcastle has been considered the hardest place where we could begin to labor, but during our camp meeting we had special evidence that the Spirit of the Lord had prepared the way before us. There has been nothing like it in our entire experience. There was such perfect order among those who came to the grounds. There was very little of the usual strolling about the grounds for sightseeing. There was no murmuring or complaining. There seemed to be a holy hush, a quietude, upon the entire encampment.",
