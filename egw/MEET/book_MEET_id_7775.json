    "word": "When men have these views of Jesus, they always have very humble views of themselves. It is when men lose sight of Jesus, His purity, His spotless perfection, that they lift up themselves, and are self-sufficient, self-inflated; and if others do not give them all that deference and respect that they think they should have, they are uneasy, unsatisfied, think themselves ill-used and unappreciated. They reveal their true character in an unmistakable manner, showing their defects in faultfinding, complaining, ready to combat anything that does not meet their mind, even when assembled to worship God.",
