    "word": "A large class of the human beings we everywhere meet are a curse to the world. They live only for self-indulgence, and are given up, soul and body, to corrupt and \n128\ndissolute habits. What a terrible rebuke are such lives to the mothers who have worshiped at fashion's shrine, and have neglected to cultivate their own mind and to form their own character after the divine Pattern; and who have thus been unprepared to fulfill the sacred trust committed to them,\u2014to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.",
