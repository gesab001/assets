    "word": "Conference President to Concentrate on Spiritual Interests \n     Brother_____, it is not your duty at our camp meetings to engage in manual labor. That belongs to the laymen. They should be educated to attend to the fitting up of the grounds. As president, you should apply yourself more thoroughly to plan for the spiritual interests of the meeting, consulting with your ministering brethren. Let your efficiency be seen in this direction. --Letter 29, 1890, pp. 1, 3. \n\n\n                                   -174-",
