    "word": "Ellen White's Concerns While at Ottawa, Kansas--If I can possibly get off from the appointment to the Scandinavians I will do it and return home and see what you are all about. I shall be glad to have No. 33 [NOW TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH, VOL. V. PP. 477-754.] out, for the people need it. I am up writing at three o'clock in the morning. There are many questions to be considered and settled. It is understood that you are going to the Kansas meeting. I cannot lay out the matter clearly in my mind.",
