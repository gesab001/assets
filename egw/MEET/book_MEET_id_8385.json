    "word": "Willie has been having a long siege of council meetings and committee meetings. While pitching our tents, in driving a stake, he missed his stroke or his finger got in the way of the iron sledge, and he smashed his finger, splitting open the flesh to the bone in three places, but not breaking the \n\n\n                                    -145- \n\nbone. The nail had to be drawn out. This finger needed considerable care. Brother Simmons dressed it carefully every day, but as this finger difficulty was in a fair way of recovery, a small pimple appeared on his wrist which increased to great inflammation, and after more than one week of suffering, the core came out and the second gathering appeared. Hops [poultices] and Elder Blow soon brought that to a head and he now has some peace. He concluded to take my span of horses and platform wagon and Brother McKenzie and himself came to this place.",
