    "word": "I have read letters telling of the meetings held in New York City regarding the city work. As you see the magnitude of the work that needs to be done, you can better understand why I have felt so keenly the necessity of having our people arouse that they may sense the situation.

I shall now feel more courage. \n\n                                               -",
