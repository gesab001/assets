    "word": "September 24. I went into the early morning meeting. I engaged in prayer, and my burden was for a special blessing upon the laborers, that they might be fitted up for the great work before us. I bore my testimony in regard to coming up to our high privilege. I presented before them the words of Christ, \"if any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.\" The promise is, \"The water that I shall give shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life.\" I was afraid the meeting would close and we fail to receive all the good that the Lord has in store for us. I urged upon my brethren to make the most of the present opportunities to exercise greater faith that they would receive help and strength from the great Source of strength. \n\n\n                                    -361-",
