    "word": "In sending means for the missionary work for the colored people, conducted by the Southern Missionary Society, be careful to state distinctly that this is the object for which the money is to be used, and let it be passed quickly to those having this work in charge. If you desire to give to the Huntsville School, the colored sanitarium, the building of schools and meetinghouses, or to other specific lines of work for the colored people, be very careful to state your wishes plainly. If care is not taken in regard to this, the money will not always find its way to the places where it is so much needed. There is yet much to be done in this field.",
