    "word": "In Vermont and New York \n\n     The meeting at West Enosburgh, Vt., was one of deep interest. It seemed good to meet again with, and speak to, our old, tried friends in this State. A great and good work was done in a short time. These friends were generally poor, and toiling for the comforts of life where one dollar is earned with more labor than two in the West, yet they were liberal with us. In no State have the brethren been truer to the cause than in old Vermont.",
