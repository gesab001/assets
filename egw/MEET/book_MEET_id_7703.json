    "word": "We can but pronounce this meeting a marked success. The news of it will be carried everywhere in these kingdoms--to Sweden, Norway, and Denmark--and will open the way for camp meetings in other places. Many came to these meetings with great fear and trembling. They thought it must be at great risk to live in tents, but when they saw the arrangements--stoves in the tents if it should be cold and rainy--they had naught to fear. They were so charmed with the beautiful, fragrant grove and the neat, comfortably furnished tents that they said if they had only known it was like this they would have prepared to occupy a tent themselves. The terror and dread of camp meeting is all removed and the way opened for camp meeting in these regions.",
