    "word": "I cannot see why this place has received no more attention. If there is a place in Michigan where there should be a mission both summer and winter, it is in Petoskey.

If something had been started years ago, at this time there would have been a flourishing church and mission. There are those who reside here who are friendly and who are really convinced of the Sabbath but there have been no meetings in Petoskey since last fall. But since we came there is an awakening among all the scattered Sabbathkeepers at the thought that they are not to be left and neglected. Dr. Lay and Dr. Douse and myself are talking together and planning. Dr. Lay has no help, as you well known, in his wife or in his children.",
