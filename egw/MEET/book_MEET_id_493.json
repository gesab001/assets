    "word": "It is a lamentable fact that many professed Christian women take the lead in patronizing the fashions; and those who make no pretensions to religion, follow in their steps. Some who are in humble circumstances, in their efforts to keep pace with the ever-changing styles of dress, endure privation, and work far beyond their strength, in order to retain their place in fashionable society. This temptation is so strong that some, in trying to gain their object, are guilty of dishonesty and theft. Many are led to ruin by the desire for self-adornment. Professed Christians who have, by their example, opened a door of temptation to their weak sisters, will have a fearful account to meet in the day of final reckoning. Inexperienced ones, charmed with the respect paid to those who dress stylishly, become so infatuated that nothing is too precious to exchange for artificial decorations.",
