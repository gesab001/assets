    "word": "In our training-schools, the Bible is to be made the basis of all education. And in the required studies, it is not necessary \n\n\n                         -344- \n\nfor our teachers to bring in the objectionable books that the Lord has instructed us not to use in our schools. From light that the Lord has given me, I know that our training-schools in various parts of the field should be placed in the most favorable position possible for qualifying our youth to meet the tests specified by State Laws regarding medical students. To this end the very best teaching talent should be secured that our schools may be brought up to the required standard. . .",
