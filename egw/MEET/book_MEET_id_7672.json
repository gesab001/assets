    "word": "In the visions of the night I was in a council meeting where were being discussed some matters pertaining to the medical work in the District of Columbia. Some present expressed it as their best judgment that when the sanitarium buildings in Takoma Park were completed and equipped, the  sanitarium in the city should be closed. Then One of divine wisdom and  understanding spoke of the importance of maintaining in the city every  possible agency for exalting the principles of Bible truth. The seeds of truth should be sown among men of influence in the nation's capital.",
