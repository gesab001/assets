June 2, 1905. \n\nDear Brother Burden:- \n     I am much encouraged by the letters that I have received from you regarding Loma Linda. From your descriptions of the place, I believe it meets the representation which I have seen of what we should seek for as sanitarium locations. Such a place was presented to me a few miles from an important city. The city has recently been built up.",
