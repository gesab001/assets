    "word": "If God has given Dr. Kellogg wisdom from His immense fountain of supplies, if He has given him means \n47\nand scientific knowledge to meet the emergencies of the present time, does this impartation give him a patent right to this gift bestowed on him to show that God has not forgotten His people? This gift belongs not to Dr. Kellogg, but to the great Power beyond. Dr. Kellogg has forgotten that he is a man who has to be trained and educated like other men. God has greatly honored him, and will continue to honor him as long as he will wear Christ's yoke and learn in Christ's school His meekness and lowliness. But Dr. Kellogg did not create himself. He is not the only one who can drink from the fountain of knowledge. The Lord has other men whom He will instruct. Dr. Kellogg was not given his knowledge from God that he might carry it as a product of his own creating.",
