The propositions made in this meeting regarding the publishing work were originated in blindness, and throw no light on the situation. A time of great perplexity and distress is not the time to be in a hurry to cut the knot of difficulty. In such a time are needed men of God-given ingenuity, tact, and patience. They are to work in such a way that they will 'hurt not the oil and the wine.'",
