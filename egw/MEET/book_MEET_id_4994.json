    "word": "Importance of Prominent Men Signing the Pledge.--I dreamed that there was a large company assembled together in the open air, and a tall young man that I have often seen in my dreams, when important matters are under consideration, was sitting near the chairman of the meeting. This young man arose and passed to the men that seemed to be at the head of the company and said, \"Here is a paper I wish you to attach your names to, every one of you.\" He presented it to Brother A first. He looked at it and read aloud, \"You here pledge yourselves to abstain from all fermented wines and spirituous liquors of any kind, and use your influence to induce all others that you can to follow your example.\" \n                                                                           201",
