    "word": "Before I came to this Conference, I was in doubt as to where to stay during the meeting. Dr. Kellogg had courteously invited me to make his house my home.

They have said it before, when there was no more reason for it than there is now.\" Still, as I wished to remove every possible excuse for talk, I decided not to go to the doctor's.

I had been sick, and was still sick. I did not wish to attend the Conference at all, because I knew that the exertion would be a terrible strain on me.",
