    "word": "Holding Small Meetings \n\n     Those who know not the truth should be prayed with and instructed. Many can take up this work. Small meetings should now be arranged for, in which two or three workers unite in explaining the truth to the people. Such meetings have been held in many places, and as a result, people have been brought into the truth, and meeting-houses have been built. At first, the work may have to be carried on in a room in a private house. Perhaps, if the weather is favorable, the meeting can be held out-of-doors. Give a kindly welcome to all who come. Draw near to God and to one another. Let songs of praise be sung. Let the Word of God be simply and clearly explained. Such a service will make a lasting impression. B-66-1902.",
