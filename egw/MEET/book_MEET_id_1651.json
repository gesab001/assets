    "word": "For sinful men, the highest consolation, the greatest cause of rejoicing, is that Heaven has given Jesus to be the sinner's Saviour. . . .

Forty days and forty nights He fasted, enduring the fiercest assaults of the powers of darkness. He trod the \"winepress alone; and of the people there was none with\" Him (Isaiah 63:3). It was not for Himself, but that He might break the chain that held the human race in slavery to Satan.",
