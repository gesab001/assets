    "word": "\"Let Edson White and Brother Palmer stand on their feet, not in their own strength, but in the strength of the Lord God of Israel, prepared to breast every difficulty that shall arise. Edson White is to stand with William Palmer, and William Palmer is to stand with Edson White. Let them take hold of the work with renewed consecration and prove themselves men prepared to meet the demands of the hour with all the talents that God has given them. Encourage faith. Persevere. Work with all humility. The future is in the hands of God.",
