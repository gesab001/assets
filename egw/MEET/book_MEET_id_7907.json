    "word": "I have now spoken six times. Sabbath we had a good meeting, and I had freedom in speaking. Sunday at six o'clock the hall which holds four hundred \n\n\n                                        -397- \n\npeople was densely packed. I could scarcely press my way through to get to the stand. It was thought that more than a hundred had to go away because they could not get in. I had much freedom in speaking. The crowd listened with the greatest attention, and I hope and pray that they will take heed to the word spoken. I have spoken four times in the morning meeting, and from the testimonies borne in the morning meetings which Brother Matteson has interpreted to us, they appreciate the words spoken as much as in America.",
