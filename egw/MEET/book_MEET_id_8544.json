    "word": "Father needs to be a boy again. Roam all around. Climb the mountain steeps. Ride horseback. Find something new each day to see and enjoy. This will be for Father's health. Do not spend any anxious thought on me. You will see how well I will appear after the camp meetings are over. God lives, and because He lives, I hope to live also. I am debilitated just now, but this does not discourage me one bit. I shall lean heavily upon the divine arm, and I shall not faint nor fall. And I assure you that you will be gainers, if you will all determine to be free as boys and girls again. Strive to make each other happy. Then angels will look on and smile, and they will write for you a record that you will not be ashamed to read.",
