    "word": "If the truth of God be not deep rooted in the heart, you cannot stand the test of temptation. There is only one power that can keep us steadfast under the most trying circumstances--the grace of God in truth. The ungodly are lynx-eyed to mark every inconsistency, and prompt to pour contempt on the weak and halting ones. Let the youth make their mark high. Let them seek in humble prayer for that help which Christ has promised, that they may exert an influence upon others that they will not be ashamed to meet in the great day of final settlement and rewards. Those who have exemplified the loftiest Christian principles in every department of business and religious life will have the inexpressible advantage, for they will enter the Paradise of God as conquerors. \n                                                                           311",
