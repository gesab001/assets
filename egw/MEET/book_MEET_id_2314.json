    "word": "Only by knowing God here can we prepare to meet Him at His coming. . . . In His lessons and His mighty works Christ is a perfect revelation of God. This Christ declares through the inspired evangelist. \"No man hath seen God at any time,\" He says; \"the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him\" (John 1:18). \"No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\" These words show the importance of studying Christ's character. Only by knowing Christ can we know God.",
