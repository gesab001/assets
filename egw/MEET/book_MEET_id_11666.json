    "word": "The brethren in this meeting were counselling in regard to the work in Nashville. Matters were presented in a strong light. Some of the brethren present had gathered up the testimonies of those who were unfavorably inclined toward the Nashville publishing house. If actions had been taken based upon these misrepresentations, great injustice would have been done to the Southern work. Decisions would have been made that would have had a most discouraging effect, and that would have seemingly upheld as right all that the Lord has condemned in regard to the Southern field.",
