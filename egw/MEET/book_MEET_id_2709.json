    "word": "Meeting at Port Gibson \n\n     The meeting at Port Gibson was held in Brother Hiram Edson's barn. There were those present who loved the truth, but were listening to and cherishing error. Before the close of this meeting, however, the Lord wrought for us with power. I was again shown in vision the importance of the brethren laying aside their differences, and uniting upon Bible truth.",
