    "word": "London, July 4, 1887. We left Kettering about 9:00 a.m. Reached London in about two hours. We again met our brethren and sisters who were soon to leave for South Africa. We took the train for Holloway. It is a pretty village in the suburbs of London. . . . We called at the house occupied by our sisters who were giving Bible readings and trying to get access to the higher classes. We found them well situated and doing what they can in fitting up for the work. We called on Sister Marsh, who has kept the Sabbath quite a number of years. Her husband is a warden in the prison. They live close by the prison. It looked sad, indeed, to see the large number of prisoners taking their half hour of exercise within the glowering prison walls, guarded at every step with officers. We had a little meeting with our friends going to South Africa, and some plain talk about how the work should be commenced and carried forward in their new field. We had a praying season and the Spirit of the Lord came into our midst. We knew it was our parting meeting.",
