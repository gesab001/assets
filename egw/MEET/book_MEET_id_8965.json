    "word": "The Lord desires His Holy Spirit to come into this meeting. He declares that every vestige of sharpness in dealing must be removed, for He hates it. No sharpness is to be exercised toward His servants who are working for Him, bringing the tithe into the treasure that His cause may be sustained. God's treasury is to be supplied by the tithe, which is to be regarded as a sacred fund. It is God's, and it is to be liberally given, that the work may be sustained. Those in responsible places are to act in such a way that the people will have firm confidence in them. These men should not be afraid to open to the light of day everything in the management of the work. \n\n\n                               -199-",
