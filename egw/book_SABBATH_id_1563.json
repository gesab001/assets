{"word": "Worship Service When No Pastor Present\n \n\n     Long, prosy talk does more harm than good.--The same course is frequently pursued in the Sabbath meetings. When there is no preacher present, the one who is appointed to lead the meeting feels it his duty to try to supply the lack as best he can, and starts out with a long, prosy talk that kills the meeting on the start. And yet he is often distressed because there is so little interest manifested by those who attend these meetings. He sees that the interest is waning, and he begins to inquire what he shall do. To such I would say, Cease your efforts to sermonize. Many love to talk; but their speeches are long and dry; there is none of the heavenly moisture in them. I can but sympathize with the listeners when such a one has charge of the\n265\nmeeting. He thinks that so much talking ought to do a great amount of good, but it is a positive injury.--SSW Oct. 1, 1885.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 264}
