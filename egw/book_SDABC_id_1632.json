Circumstances Sowed Seed.--The conviction forced upon many at the time of Christ's trial, at the time when the three hours' darkness enshrouded the cross, without any natural cause for it, and when the last sentences were uttered, \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" \"It is finished,\" \"Into thy hands I commend my spirit,\" was seed sown that ripened into harvest when at a future date the gospel was boldly proclaimed by His disciples. The shaking earth, the piercing cry, the sudden death which called forth in no whispered tones the cry, \"It is finished,\" forced from many the words, \"Assuredly this man was righteous\"; \"Truly this was the Son of God.\" Many who had scoffed and jeered at, and taunted the Son of God were terribly afraid that the shaking earth, the rent and trembling rocks would put an end to their own lives. They hastened away from the scene, beating upon their breasts, stumbling, falling, in awful terror lest the earth should open and swallow them up. The veil of the temple rent so mysteriously, changed the religious ideas of many of the Jewish priests, and a large company changed their faith. After the day of Pentecost, we read that \"the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people (MS 91, 1897).",
