{"word": "As those who profess to follow the meek and lowly Jesus, Christian parents should never permit temper to gain the mastery over them. Never should they strike their children in haste or anger. When they have done wrong, and you feel that they need correcting, take the matter to God in prayer. Kneeling before the Lord, tell your Father your grief because the Spirit of the Lord has been grieved. Seek for God's blessing and guidance in the training of your children. . . . When through the aid of the divine Spirit parents succeed in turning their young hearts to Him, God and angels rejoice.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 186}
