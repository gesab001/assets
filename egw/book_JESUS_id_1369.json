{"word": "Patience \n\n     To be a coworker with Jesus, you should have all patience with those for whom you labor, not scorning the simplicity of the work, but looking to the blessed result. When those for whom you labor do not exactly meet your mind, you often say in your heart, \"Let them go; they are not worth saving.\" What if Christ had treated poor outcasts in a similar manner? He died to save miserable sinners, and if you work in the same spirit and in the same manner indicated by the example of Him whom you follow, leaving the results with God, you can never in this life measure the amount of good you have accomplished.-- Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 132.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 230}
