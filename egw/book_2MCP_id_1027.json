{"word": "Faith vs. Unbelief.--We do not realize how much we lose through unbelief. Without faith we shall be engaged in a losing battle. We have a Saviour who understands every phase of our life. He knows of our discouragements, and He knows just what help we need. We want a faith in Him, a faith that works by love and purifies the soul.--MS 41, 1908.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 673}
