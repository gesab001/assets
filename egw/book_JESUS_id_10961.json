{"word": "Nor can we trust impressions. The voice or spirit that says to a man, You are under no obligation to obey the law of God; you are holy and sinless, while he is trampling on the divine law, is not the voice of Jesus; for He declares: \"I have kept my Father's commandments\" (John 15:10). And John testifies: \"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\" (1 John 2:4).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 49}
