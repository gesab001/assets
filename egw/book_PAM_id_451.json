{"word": "Effective prayer meeting results when each who attends feels personally responsible for its success.--Before leaving home, go to God in secret prayer. Plead with Him for His blessing, and He who \"seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.\" With your heart softened by the love of Jesus, go to the meeting, feeling that you are personally responsible for its success. If but few attend, you should feel under double responsibility. You are in the service of God, and should do what you can with your talent, tact, and skill to make His worship interesting.--ST Dec. 4, 1884.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 184}
