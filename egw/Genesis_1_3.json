                    "Then was a teacher sent from God, even Him who was the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Christ came to unveil divine truth to the world, to restore it in all its original freshness and beauty. He gave fresh manna to the hungry soul. He presented the pure, rich truths of heaven to shine amid the moral darkness and gloom of earth. God had said, \"Let there be light,\" and the light of the glory of God was revealed in the face of Jesus Christ.",
                    "He causes \"the light to shine out of darkness.\" 2 Corinthians 4:6. When \"the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep,\" \"the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.\" Genesis 1:2, 3. So in the night of spiritual darkness, God's word goes forth, \"Let there be light.\" To His people He says, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" Isaiah 60:1.",
                    "\"Behold,\" says the Scripture, \"the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee.\" Isaiah 60:2.",
                    "It is the darkness of misapprehension of God that is enshrouding the world. Men are losing their knowledge of His character. It has been misunderstood and misinterpreted. At this time a message from God is to be proclaimed, a message illuminating in its influence and saving in its power. His character is to be made known. Into the darkness of the world is to be shed the light of His glory, the light of His goodness, mercy, and truth."
