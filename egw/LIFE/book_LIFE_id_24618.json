    "word": "The Lord Jesus said to Peter, \"When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren;\" and just before his ascension, he said to his disciple, \"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou \n                                                                           9\nknowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\" This was a work in which Peter had had but little experience; but he could not be complete in Christian life unless he learned to feed the lambs, those who were young in the faith. It would require great care, much patience and perseverance, to give those who were ignorant the suitable teachings, opening up to them the Scriptures, and educating them for usefulness and duty. This is the work that must be done in our churches at this day, or the advocates of truth will have a dwarfed experience, and will be exposed to temptation and deception. The charge given to Peter should come home to every minister. Again and again the voice of Christ is heard repeating the charge to his under shepherds, \"Feed my lambs, feed my sheep.\"",
