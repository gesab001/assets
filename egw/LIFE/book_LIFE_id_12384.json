    "word": "Life is not made up of great things alone; it is the little things that make the sum of life\u2019s happiness or miseries. It is the little things in life that reveal a person\u2019s real character. Oh, if all youth and those of mature age could see as I have seen the mirror of person\u2019s lives presented before them, they would look more gravely upon even the little duties of life. Every mistake, every error, unimportant though it may be regarded, leaves a scar in this life and a blot on the heavenly records.",
