    "word": "Every one of us is upon probation, in school, where we are required to be diligent students. It is enjoined upon us to walk in the light, as Christ is in \n\n\n                                     -266- \n\nthe light. It is by walking in the light that we learn of God, and \"This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent\" [John 17:3]. These are the words of Him who was with the Father before the world was, and He uttered these words while praying for all those who should believe in God through the words of His disciples. To know God in His works is true science. Let us follow on to know the Lord till we shall know that His goings forth are prepared as the morning.",
