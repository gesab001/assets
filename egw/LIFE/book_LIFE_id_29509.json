    "word": "It is a wonderful and grand fact that in the laws of God in nature effect follows cause with unerring certainty. The seed sown will produce a harvest of its kind. So it is in human nature. He that sows to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption. He who sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. If human beings would consider that they are making their own harvest, they would be careful what seed they sow.",
