    "word": "O what deceptions are upon those who are looking for the beautiful and poetic in their speculations. They hear not the voice of the One who gave his life to self-denial, to humiliation, to suffering and a cruel, ignominious death to make it possible for human beings to keep the law of God. They can do this only by heeding the invitation, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" (Matthew 11:29, 30.) These are the lessons the great Teacher has given us. We are to take his yoke of submission, restraint, and obedience, in meekness and lowliness of heart. Those who yoke up with Christ will find rest and peace.",
