    "word": "\"THE PRESENT DIFFICULTY IS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT BROTHER E SHOULD BE MADE ELDER OF THE BIRMINGHAM CHURCH, THE LARGEST, AND NOW THE MOST INFLUENTIAL CHURCH IN THE CONFERENCE, AS THE CONFERENCE HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN BIRMINGHAM. THE CHURCH IS DISAGREED UPON THE POINT IN QUESTION, AND IT IS HAVING A BAD INFLUENCE UPON THE WORK IN THE CITY AND A MORE OR LESS DELETERIOUS EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE CONFERENCE. THE MAJORITY THINK, BECAUSE OF HIS CAPABILITIES AND HIS LATE WORK IN THE CITY (AS STATED IN ELDER MCVAGH'S LETTER, A COPY OF WHICH IS HEREIN ENCLOSED), THAT HE SHOULD BE MADE ELDER OF THE CHURCH AND ACT AS ITS PASTOR, OR LEADER, WHILE OTHERS DO NOT FAVOR IT BECAUSE OF HIS LIFE RECORD, AND ALSO THINK THAT THOSE WHO HAVE DEALT WITH HIM IN THE PAST SHOULD GIVE COUNSEL, AND ADVISE AS TO HIS BECOMING ELDER OF THE CHURCH.",
