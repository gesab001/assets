    "word": "MR No. 702 - Preparing the E. G. White Books\n\n     As Marian Davis' life was coming to a close in 1904, Ellen White made another reference to her faithful work, stating: \n\n\n          We have stood side by side in the work, and in perfect harmony \n     in that work. And when she would be gathering up the precious jots \n     and tittles that had come in papers and books, and present it to \n     me, \"Now,\" she would say, \"there is something wanted. I cannot \n     supply it.\" \n\n\n          I would look it over, and in one moment I could trace the line \n     right out. We worked together, just worked together in perfect \n     harmony all the time.--Manuscript 95, 1904.",
