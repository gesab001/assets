    "word": "The Lord Jesus came to the world to live the life that it will be for the interest of every being on earth to live\u2014that of humble obedience. Those to whom Christ has given a probation in which to form characters for the mansions He has gone to prepare are to enter into His life example. If they are indeed learners in the school of Christ, they will not exalt themselves because they are possessors of houses and lands, because the Lord has in His providence lent them His goods to trade upon. . . .",
