    "word": "If all that appears to be divine life were such in reality; if all who profess to present the truth to the world were preaching for the truth, and not against it, and if they were men of God, guided by his Spirit, --then might we see something cheering amid the prevailing moral darkness. But the spirit of anti-christ is prevailing to such an extent as never before. Well may we exclaim, \"Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men.\" I know that many think far too favorably of the present time. These ease-loving souls will be engulfed in the general ruin. Yet we do not despair. We have been inclined to think that where there are no faithful ministers, there can be no true Christians; but this is not the case. God has promised that where the shepherds are not true he will take charge of the flock himself. God has never made the flock wholly dependent upon human instrumentalities. But the days of purification of the church are hastening on apace. God will have a people pure and true. In the mighty sifting soon to take place, we shall be better able to measure the strength of Israel. The signs reveal that the time is near when the Lord will manifest that his fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor. \n                                                                           63",
