    "word": "The Subtle Temptations \n\n     Christ sees the danger; He knows the subtle temptations and power of the enemy; for He has experienced Satan's temptations. He gave His life to procure a period of probation for the sons and daughters of Adam. With the result of Adam's disobedience and transgressions before them, with greater light shining upon them, they are invited to come unto Him and find rest unto their souls. But the greater the light and the plainer the danger signal, the greater the condemnation of those will be who turn from light to darkness. The words of Christ are too serious in their import to be disregarded.",
