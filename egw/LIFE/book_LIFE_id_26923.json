I find it a very difficult thing being in the mountains with my husband and [now] in the mountains without him. I am fully of the opinion that my life was so entwined or interwoven with my husband's that it is about impossible for me to be of any great account without him.--Letter 17, 1881, p. 1. (To \"Dear Son Willie\" [W. C. White], September 12, 1881.)",
