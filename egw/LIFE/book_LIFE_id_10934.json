    "word": "Contrast our tame, lifeless, half-paralyzed efforts with the work of the Lord Jesus. Listen to His words, to His prayer to the Father, \"I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them\" (John 17:26). What language is this! How deep, how broad, how full! The Lord Jesus desires to shed abroad His love \n\n246 \n\nthrough every member of the body, His church, that the vitality of that love may circulate through every part of the body and dwell in us as it dwells in Him. The Lord then can love fallen man as He does His own Son; and He declares that He will be satisfied with nothing less than this in our behalf.--MS 11, 1892.",
