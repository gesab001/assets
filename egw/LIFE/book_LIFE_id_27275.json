    "word": "So many have this self-satisfied feeling, and manifest this inclination to uplift self unto vanity; thus giving evidence that they are clothed with the filthy rags of their own self-righteousness. If they do not seek most diligently for the heavenly anointing they will not, cannot, see Jesus. Neither can they see their own poverty. Their spiritual defects are hid from their eyes. They have a name to live, but give not the slightest evidence that their life proceeds from God. The true spiritual life is a reflection of the life of Christ. The meekness and lowliness of our Saviour is apparent in their daily life. The gentleness of Christ is revealed. Such a life is constantly speaking of His love, and telling of the power of His grace. In beholding Christ, there is a continual change wrought in the human agent; his conversation is made fragrant with His grace. . . . Perpetually looking unto Jesus, the human is assimilated by the divine. The believer is changed into His likeness.--Ms 64, 1895, pp. 2, 3, 6. (\"Sanctified Humility,\" 1895.)",
