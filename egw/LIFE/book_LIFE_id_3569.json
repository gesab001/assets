    "word": "Follow Your Leader \n\n     To every medical missionary worker I am instructed to say, Follow your Leader. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He is your example. Upon all medical missionary workers rests the responsibility of keeping in view Christ's life of unselfish service. They are to keep their eyes fixed on Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith. He is the source of all light, the fountain of all blessing. \n\n\n                                                    (513)",
