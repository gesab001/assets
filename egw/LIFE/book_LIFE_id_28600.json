    "word": "I was shown the case of R. He has been blind to himself. There is in him a great lack of self-government and spirituality. I was pointed back and saw how it used to be with him--the passionate, willful temper, the stubborn will, the fitful moves. There has been something of a reform, but he has been very slow to learn. The work is not thorough. He makes an idol of himself, indulges his appetite, and lives principally for himself. Oh, that he could look back upon his past life and could see it as it is! He would be ashamed and alarmed at the little good he has done.",
