    "word": "In the charge to feed the flock of God there is a threefold duty. \"Feed the flock of God\"--by preaching to them His word, by giving them earnest, personal labor, by setting them a right example. \"Feed the flock of God,\" \"taking the oversight thereof,\" having a personal care for the blood-bought heritage committed to your charge, \"being ensamples to the flock\"--following Christ in self-denial and self-sacrifice, in the life revealing holiness to the Lord. All this is to be done of a ready, cheerful mind, \"neither as being lords over God's heritage,\" tyrannizing over them the human tests. The truth of God's word is to be the test.--Letter 108, 1902. (To N. D. Faulkhead, July 14, 1902.) \n\n\n                                     -451-",
