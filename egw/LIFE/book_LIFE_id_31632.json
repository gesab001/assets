    "word": "Looking Unto Jesus \n\n     You need not be surprised if everything in the journey heavenward is not pleasant. There is no use in looking to our own defects. Looking unto Jesus, the darkness passes away, and the true light shineth. Go forth daily, expressing the prayer of David, \"Hold up my goings in Thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.\" All the paths of life are beset with peril, but we are safe if we follow where the Master leads the way, trusting the One whose voice we hear saying, \"Follow Me.\" \"He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" Let your heart repose in His love. We need sanctification, soul, body, and spirit. This we must seek for. . . .",
