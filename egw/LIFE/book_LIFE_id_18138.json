The penalty will fall upon the mental as well as the physical powers. And it does not end with the guilty trifler. The effects of his misdemeanors are seen in his offspring, and thus hereditary evils are passed down, even to the third or fourth generation.

Whom will it affect besides yourselves?--Signs of the Times, Dec. 6, 1910.",
