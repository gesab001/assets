    "word": "THERE WAS ONE CLASS WHO SOON RENOUNCED THE IDEA THAT \"THE DOOR OF MERCY WAS SHUT,\" BECAUSE THEY DISCOVERED THAT OTHER MESSAGES WERE TO BE PROCLAIMED AFTER THAT DECLARING, THE HOUR OF JUDGMENT IS COME; AND THAT THAT OF THE THIRD ANGEL, THE LAST ONE, WAS TO GO TO \"MANY PEOPLES, AND NATIONS, AND TONGUES, AND KINGS.\" THEY LEARNED THAT THE JUDGMENT SITS IN HEAVEN BEFORE THE COMING OF THE LORD; THAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS FULLY ACCOMPLISHED WHILE JESUS IS YET THEIR ADVOCATE BEFORE THE FATHER'S THRONE; THAT ETERNAL LIFE IS INSTANTLY GIVEN TO THE SAINTS WHEN THEIR SAVIOUR COMES, WHICH IS PROOF THAT THEY HAVE BEEN JUDGED AND ACQUITTED. AS THE HOPES OF THE DISCIPLES REVIVED, AND THEY WERE \"GLAD WHEN THEY SAW THE LORD,\" AND DECLARED HIS MESSIAHSHIP WITH YET GREATER CONFIDENCE, SO DID THESE REJOICE WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THE TRUTH OF THE THIRD ANGEL'S MESSAGE, WHICH, TO THEM, WAS LIKE LIFE FROM THE DEAD. WITH RENEWED ZEAL AND STRENGTHENED CONFIDENCE THEY BEGAN AGAIN TO PROCLAIM THE SOON COMING OF THE LORD.",
