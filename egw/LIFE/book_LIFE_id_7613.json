    "word": "253\n     Baxter, Flavel, Alleine, and other men of talent, education, and deep Christian experience, stood up in valiant defense of the faith which was once delivered to the saints. The work accomplished by these men, prescribed and outlawed by the rulers of this world, can never perish. Flavel's \u201cFountain of Life\u201d and \u201cMethod of Grace\u201d have taught thousands how to commit the keeping of their souls to Christ. Baxter's \u201cReformed Pastor\u201d has proved a blessing to many who desire a revival of the work of God, and his \u201cSaint's Everlasting Rest\u201d has done its work in leading souls to the \u201crest that remaineth for the people of God.\u201d",
