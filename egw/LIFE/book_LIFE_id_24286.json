Those to whom God has entrusted \n\n\n                       - 61 - \n\nthe treasures of his grace are to be made the living, responsible agents; but what is their position? -- They have lamps, -- a knowledge of the truth, -- but how few have communicated the precious light God has given them; how few have borne fruit to the glory of God! They do not improve the light and privileges given. They do not \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" They have no fruit, and the condemnation of God is upon them. The Lord will not open the eyes that refuse to see. The moistening revives, the sunshine God has given to quicken into life, continues, but they remain fruitless. Shall those for whom the Lord has done so much, have the form of godliness, and stop there? 2 Timothy 3:1-5.",
