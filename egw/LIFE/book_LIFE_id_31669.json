    "word": "Effort and Labor Required \n\n     Effort and labor are required on the part of the receiver of God's grace; for it is the fruit that makes manifest what is the character of the tree.

That which is considered morality in the world does not reach the divine standard and has no more merit before heaven than had the offering of Cain. --MS. 26a, 1892. \n\n                                               -",
