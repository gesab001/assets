    "word": "The heart of infinite love pities those who are in perilous places--when He sees men exalt by word, by confidence, by action those who have faith in human law and force, who have no pity and who cannot discern the sufferings of the needy, to whom souls may cry in their agony of distress but whose hearts remain as hard as adamant. We may turn away from this picture, and look to God, and Him alone. God desires that men shall feel their dependence upon Him, and trust to that Hand that can save to the uttermost, that Heart that throbs in response to the appeals of suffering humanity. We must not trust in man, or make flesh our arm. Our trust must be placed in a Hand and a Heart that is warm with life, that throbs with love for the helpless.",
