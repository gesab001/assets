    "word": "Remember, now is the time to work with God. Enoch was translated because he walked with God. Now as we approach the end of time we must walk with God as did Enoch. We must feel that He is at our right hand, that He knows the thoughts of my heart, that He knows whether we are loyal and true in our business. He knows all our conduct. We must feel that we have a witness, a watcher that is dear, one who knows our motives, and one who knows [whether] our manner of life is holy, and whether we are clean and ready for the white linen, which is the righteousness of Christ; He knows whether it is imputed to me; He knows whether I am prepared to join company with the holy angels in the kingdom of glory.",
