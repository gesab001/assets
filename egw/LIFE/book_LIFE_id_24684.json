    "word": "The Kind of Education to be Given \n\n     Where are the families who will become missionaries, and who will engage in labor in this field? Where are the men who have means and experience so that they can go forth to these people, and work for them just where they are? There are men who can educate them in agricultural lines, who can teach them to sow seed and plant orchards. There are others who can teach them to read, and can give them an object-lesson from their own life and example. Show them what you yourself can do to gain a livelihood, and it will be an education to them. S. W. 23, 24.",
