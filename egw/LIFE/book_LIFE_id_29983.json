Arose at five o'clock and sought the Lord in prayer, and I am comforted and blessed. My life seems to be a continual battle with infirmities, but the Lord strengthens me to bear my testimony for Him. He helpeth my infirmities. His strength is made perfect in my weakness. And when so very weak that it seems impossible for me to speak, He makes me courageous and strong and joyful. He imparts His Spirit and His life that I can impart the same to others and comfort them with the consolation wherewith I am comforted.",
