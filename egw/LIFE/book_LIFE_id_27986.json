    "word": "JHK Reproved for Confederating with Worldlings--Is it possible that you do not realize that Satan is playing the game of life for your soul? You \n\n\n                                 -314- \n\nare certainly in danger. You have not walked perfectly before the Lord. You have been ambitious, and have opened before worldlings that which you should not have opened to them. You have made with them a confederacy wholly displeasing to the Lord.--Letter 52, 1903, p. 1. (To J. H. Kellogg, April 5, 1903.)",
