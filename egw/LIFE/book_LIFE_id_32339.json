    "word": "If we expect the Lord to work with us and for us as his people, if we expect him to reveal his light and power to us in these last days, we must work in accordance with the mind and will, the mercy and compassion, of the Lord God of Israel, who so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. The Lord calls upon those at the head of his work to send the first of the overflow that has come in on the Washington fund, to the work in Nashville; for the work there, which is as essential as the work in Washington, is in need of assistance. The Lord's servants who are laboring there should receive encouragement.",
