    "word": "I would exhort the church to encourage faith and talk faith and act faith. This experience through which you are passing is of God to give you a genuine experience in the things of God. Putting on the robe of humility, we must take our position as learners in the school of Christ. If we will listen to His words to be repeated to us in this age of this earth's history, there must be silence in the soul; the clamorous pretensions to self-sufficiency must be cut away from our life. Learn of Me, says Christ, for I am meek and lowly of heart and ye shall find rest to your soul.",
