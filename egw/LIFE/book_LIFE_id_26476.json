    "word": "Brother Matteson suggests that it would please the people if I speak less about duty and more in regard to the love of Jesus. But I wish to speak as the Spirit of the Lord shall impress me. The Lord knows best what this people needs. I spoke in the forenoon [Sabbath, Oct. 17, 1885] from Isaiah 58. I did not round the corners at all. . . . My work is to elevate the standard of piety and true Christian life, and urge the people to put away their sins and be sanctified through the truth.--Ms 26, 1885, p. 5. [Diary, Oct. 15-30, 1885.] \n\nReleased January 7, 1960.",
