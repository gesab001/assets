    "word": "The Lord does not accept the service of those who live an inefficient, do-nothing life. They exert an influence that leads away from Christ. Self-denial and nobility of purpose marked His life. From the beginning to the close of His earthly ministry He went about doing good. In His life no sin appeared. No selfishness marred word or act. \"Which of you convinceth me of sin?\" (John 8:46), He asked the Pharisees, knowing that they could find nothing of which to accuse Him. And at His trial, Pilate declared emphatically, \"I find in him no fault at all\" (John 18:38).",
