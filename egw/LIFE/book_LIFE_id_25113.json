He possessed divine excellence and greatness. He was equal with God. It pleased the Father that in him all fullness should dwell. He \"thought it \n                                                                           33\nnot robbery to be equal with God.\" Yet he \"made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\" In order to more fully realize the value of salvation, it is necessary to understand what it cost.
