    "word": "The commission of any known sin, the neglect of the duties of life at home or abroad, will destroy faith and disconnect the soul from God. Sin is a heinous and offensive thing. It is highly offensive to God. There is a sad history in the life of Peter, which should be a lesson to all. He had been warned by his Master of approaching danger, but, self-confident and presumptuous, he affirmed a constant fidelity and zeal superior to the other disciples and declared himself willing to follow his Master to prison and to death. The test came for Peter when the storm of opposition came upon the followers in the humiliation of their Master. Mournful words traced by the pen of inspiration, \"They all forsook Him and fled.\" And Peter, the ardent, self-confident, zealous Peter, repeatedly denied his Lord. He afterwards bitterly repented, but this example should admonish all to beware of self-confidence and self-righteousness. Mark the lesson of Christ upon humility and of the tenderness and care which should be manifested for the erring and those who need sympathy and love.",
