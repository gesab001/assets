    "word": "The Lord God of Israel is the only hope and refuge of His people. The people of God who will make use of His Word, who will have faith in His promises, shall see of the salvation of God. Because so little faith is exercised, there is little deep, earnest, abiding experience. There is need of constant dependence upon God, as well as constant faith and earnest fervency of spirit. All heaven is interested in those who have received Christ, in whatever position in life they are placed.",
