    "word": "Christ lived the simple life of a poor man's son, and thus became acquainted with the childhood life of the poor. And when, during His ministry, children were brought to Him that He might bless them, He thought of the mother who gave Him birth, and honored the mothers of these children, blessing them and their children also. Christ gave Himself to a life of humiliation and poverty, that He might be able, from childhood to manhood, to leave to all an example of what life should mean to every member of the human family.",
