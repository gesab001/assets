    "word": "Students, there is a work for you to do. You can labor where we cannot, in places where the existing prejudice forbids us to labor. Christ left Jerusalem in order to save His life. It is our duty to take care of our lives \n\n\n                                   -212- \n\nfor Christ's sake. We are not to place ourselves, unbidden, in danger, because He wants us to live to teach and help others.",
