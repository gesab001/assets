    "word": "The life of Christ was an ever-widening, shoreless influence, an influence that bound Him to God and to the whole human family. Through Christ, God has invested men and women with an influence that makes it impossible for them to live for themselves. Individually we are connected with other human beings, a part of God\u2019s great whole, and we stand under mutual obligations. No one can be independent of their fellow beings; for the well-being of each affects others. It is God\u2019s purpose that each person shall feel necessary to others\u2019 welfare, and seek to promote their happiness.",
