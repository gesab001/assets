    "word": "God's holy Word gives us the principles that form the standard of correct management in temporal as well as spiritual things. God's will is to be made the will of the human agent, and this will is to be kept prominent. Men are not to act as though there were one rule for the master and another for the servant. Christ was a servant. He lived not to please Himself, and by His life of service He has exalted all service. \n\n\n                                    (Signed) E. G.
