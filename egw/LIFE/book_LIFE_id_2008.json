    "word": "Let the business man do his business in a way that will glorify his Master because of his fidelity. Let him carry his religion into everything that is done, and reveal to men the Spirit of Christ. Let the mechanic be a diligent and faithful representative of Him who toiled in the lowly walks of life in the cities of Judea. Let every one who names the name of Christ so work that man by seeing his good works may be led to glorify his Creator and Redeemer. --Bible Echo, June 10, 1901.",
