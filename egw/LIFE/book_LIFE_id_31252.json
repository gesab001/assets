    "word": "To all Christ says, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest (in the daily experience) unto your souls.\" Rest will come to all who follow the example given them in the life of Christ. The one whose life practise shows that he has savingly embraced the gospel of Christ will gain access to many souls. This is true of both men and women, and especially of the youth.",
