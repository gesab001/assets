    "word": "Study the life of Jesus, and try to be like Him. A mere theory of truth will avail you nothing. You must be purified, and made a vessel unto honor. Whatever others may say or think of you, say, Lord Jesus, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He gave his life for you, and if you will serve Him faithfully, you will be purified from every stain of sin, because Christ will abide in your heart.--Letter 106, 1896, p. 10. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.
