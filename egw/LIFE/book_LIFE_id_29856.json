    "word": "God's word is immutable. Jesus has proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" Today He stands in the heavenly courts as our High Priest and Advocate. By faith we may grasp the promise that His mediation secures for us all things. When God gave Jesus to our world He gave all heaven. This gift has secured for us our adoption into God's family. God's promise is Yea and Amen in Christ Jesus. Never will He falsify. Never will He alter the thing that has gone out of His mouth.",
