    "word": "The Messengers\n     The Lord has often given me a view of the situation and wants of the scattered jewels who have not yet come to the light of the present truth, and that the messengers should speed their way to them as fast as possible, to give them the light. Many, all around us, only need to have their prejudices removed, and the evidences of our present position spread out before them from the Word, and they will joyfully receive the present truth. The messengers should watch for souls as they that must give account. I have seen that theirs must be a life of toil, and anguish of spirit, while the weight of the precious, but often-wounded cause of Christ rests upon them. They will have to lay aside worldly interests and comforts, and make it their first object to do all in their power to advance the cause of truth, and save perishing souls.",
