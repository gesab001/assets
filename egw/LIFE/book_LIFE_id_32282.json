    "word": "\"Then said Jesus unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto Him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life; he which cometh to Me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen Me, and believe not.\"",
