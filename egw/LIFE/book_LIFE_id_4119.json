    "word": "The Saviour in His teachings ever showed the relation between cause and effect. To His followers in every age He speaks, saying, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:16. The man or woman who has a knowledge of the truth, but whose life does not express its principles, is hiding his light. My brethren, let the light be brought from under the bushel, that it may make known the truths of the gospel. \n                                                                           399\nInvisible agencies will work through the visible; the supernatural will co-operate with the natural, the heavenly with the earthly; unknown things will be revealed through the known. Let the grace of Christ be revealed to teach that man may be renewed in the likeness of God.",
