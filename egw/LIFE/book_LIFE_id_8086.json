    "word": "Those who, while having all the light of truth flashing upon their souls, should have works corresponding to their avowed faith, but are allured by sin, setting up idols in their hearts, corrupting their souls before God, and polluting those who unite with them in sin, will have their names blotted out of the book of life, and be left in midnight darkness, having no oil in their vessels with their lamps. \u201cUnto you that fear My name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in His wings.\u201dTM 445.",
