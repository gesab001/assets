    "word": "All human ambition, all boasting, is to be laid in the dust. Self, sinful self, is to be abased, not exalted. By holiness to God in the daily life here below, we are to manifest the Christ-life. The corrupt nature is to become pure and undefiled; subdued, not exalted. We are to be humble, faithful men and women. Never are we to sit upon the judgment-seat. God demands that his representatives shall be pure vessels, revealing the beauty of sanctified character. The channel is always to remain unobstructed, that the Holy Spirit may have free course; otherwise, spiritual leaders will gloss over the work that must be done in the natural heart in order to perfect Christian character; and they will present their own imperfections in such a way that they make of none effect God's truth, which is as steadfast as the eternal throne. And while God calls upon all his watchmen to lift the danger-signal, at the same time he presents before them the life character of the Saviour as an example of what they must be and do in order to be saved. \n\n\n                                      -314-",
