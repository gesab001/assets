    "word": "Whole-hearted Service \n\n     I address you, young men: Be faithful. Put heart into your work. Imitate none who are slothful, and who give divided service. Actions, often repeated, form habits, habits form character. Patiently perform the little duties of life. So long as you undervalue the importance of faithfulness in the little duties, your character-building will be unsatisfactory. In the sight of Omnipotence, every duty is important. The Lord has said, \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\" In the life of a true Christian there are no non-essentials.",
