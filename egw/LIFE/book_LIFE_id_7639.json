    "word": "The proclamation of Christ's coming should now be, as when made by the angels to the shepherds of Bethlehem, good tidings of great joy. Those who really love the Saviour cannot but hail with gladness the announcement founded upon the Word of God, that he in whom their hopes of eternal life are centered, is coming again, not to be \n340\ninsulted, despised, and rejected, as at his first advent, but in power and glory, to redeem his people. It is those who do not love the Saviour, that desire him to remain away; and there can be no more conclusive evidence that the churches have departed from God than the irritation and animosity excited by this Heaven-sent message.",
