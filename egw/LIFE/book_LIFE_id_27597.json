    "word": "Christ took with Him to the heavenly courts His glorified humanity. To those who receive Him, He gives power to become the sons of God, that at last God may receive them as His, to dwell with Him throughout all eternity. If during this life they are loyal to God, they will at last \"see His face, and His name shall be in their foreheads.\" And what is the happiness of heaven but to see God? What greater joy could come to the sinner, saved by the grace of Christ, than to look upon the face of God, and know Him as Father? \"Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known\" (1 Corinthians 13:12).",
