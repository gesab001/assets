    "word": "A Letter to Ellen White's Son, December 12, 1890 \n\n     Dear Willie: . . . I feel grateful to the Lord that I am as well as I am. I write some every day. I am troubled with the coal stoves, but while it is mild weather I manage to get air from opening the windows. But the gas will trouble me some, of course. I cannot do the writing I desire to do being so broken up, changing from place to place, having all times of eating and all kinds of beds; but none of these things trouble me to keep me wakeful. Sara and I sleep together and I keep her awake sometimes and she me, but we have nothing to complain of except I cannot do much, broken up as I am on the life of Christ. . . .",
