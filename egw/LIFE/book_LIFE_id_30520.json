Ellen White's last recorded sermon.] \n\n\n     \"Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, l would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go Ye know, and the way Ye know. Thomas saith unto Him, Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. If ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also: and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him\" [John 14:1-7]. I want you to keep these words in mind.",
