    "word": "MR No. 503 - Entire Consecration of the Household\n\n     It is a terrible thing for a man or woman to have his own way. May my way be God's way, my will God's will. Self shall not enter me. I will submit my will, my way, my life into the hands of God. He will keep that which is committed to His trust. I hope the entire [E. G. White] household will not fail to watch unto prayer and allow nothing to divert their minds from God. He is our strength and our shield and in Him we may trust implicitly. Just in accordance with our obedience and faithfulness will He prosper and strengthen and bless us in all our undertakings. We are all aware how easy it is to conform to the world and separate our affections from God. Let us guard this point. Let your prayers come up before God like sweet incense because of their sincerity and earnestness mingled with faith.",
