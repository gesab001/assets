    "word": "We need to sense deeply that all influence is a precious talent to be used for God. . . . We need to appreciate every capability we possess, because it is lent capital, to be improved to God's glory. . . . There is constant temptation for human beings to consider that any influence they have gained is the result of something valuable in themselves. The Lord does not work with these, for He will not give to any human being the glory that belongs to His own name. . . . He makes the humble, trustful servant His representative--the one who will not lift himself up and think of himself more highly than he ought to think. The life of such a one will be dedicated to God as a living sacrifice, and that life He will accept and use and sustain. He longs to make men wise with His own wisdom, that that wisdom may be exercised in His own behalf. He manifests Himself through the consecrated humble worker. . . .",
