    "word": "Charles Beecher, in a sermon in the year 1846, declared that the ministry of \u201cthe evangelical Protestant denominations\u201d is \u201cnot only formed all the way up under a tremendous pressure of merely human fear, but they live, and move, and breathe in a state of things radically corrupt, and \n445\nappealing every hour to every baser element of their nature to hush up the truth, and bow the knee to the power of apostasy. Was not this the way things went with Rome? Are we not living her life over again? And what do we see just ahead?\u2014Another general council! A world's convention! evangelical alliance, and universal creed!\u201d When this shall be gained, then, in the effort to secure complete uniformity, it will be only a step to the resort to force.",
