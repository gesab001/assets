    "word": "During the past night I seemed to be standing before a large congregation, speaking to the people the words of life. (433) I long to understand more perfectly about this meeting that was presented to me. I seemed to hear the sweet melody of praise to God, and expressions of gratitude were coming from souls that were the recipients of the grace of Christ. The voice of praise and thanksgiving was heard, and countenances were aglow with the light of the love of God. It seemed that angel's voices united with those in the meeting who were offering praise to God.",
