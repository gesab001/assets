    "word": "June 23: . . . I long to follow on to know the Lord, that I may know that His going forth is prepared as the morning. I desire the words of my lips to be right words, the meditations of my heart to be of God. I desire to be strengthened with genuine faith. I do not want one vestige of presumption or self-confidence to appear in my life. I want faith, simple, trustful faith. I am determined to rely wholly on the promise of God, asking Him to keep my lips from evil, and my tongue from speaking guile. . . .",
