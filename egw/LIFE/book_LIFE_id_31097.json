    "word": "There are earnest, prudent, warm-hearted, God-fearing, loving workers in the Sanitarium, but there are many helpers who are not reliable. They are affected by the worldly element that pervades the worldly class who patronize the institution. They thirst for applause; they wish to be flattered; they want to invest their wages in dress. They may claim to be Christians, but they do no honor to Christ. These lukewarm, covetous ones, who do not consider that they are making their record for eternity, will be no help to worldly visitors. If all who claim to be Christians would be so in heart, many stumbling blocks would be removed out of the pathway of those who make these poor sinners their excuse for the neglect of the great salvation which Christ has brought to light in our world, and given his own precious life to save, that all who believe in him shall do his works and have eternal life.",
