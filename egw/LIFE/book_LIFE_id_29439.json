    "word": "He only who makes righteousness a part of his life is prepared rightly to estimate the truth. The truth is no truth to the one who merely makes a profession, who is not sanctified by its power, upon whose heart the pure image of truth is not stamped. Such a one keeps the truth in the outer court. His love for Christ is tame, superficial, exercising no controlling power over his reason.",
