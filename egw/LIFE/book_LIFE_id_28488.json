    "word": "These words show plainly that God's promises are fulfilled on condition of obedience to God's commandments. These commandments are not grievous. God has given them for the good of His people. His law is the hedge which He has built around His vineyard for its protection. The Lord has plainly stated the laws of His kingdom, and has declared that He will abundantly bless His people if they will obey them. It is their life to obey. In keeping God's commandments there is great reward.",
