    "word": "I was very young when I began to serve the Lord. I am now eighty-five years old. In my childhood, affliction came to me and I have been a sufferer all my life. But the Lord has been my strength to do His service, and I have been able to speak again and again to congregations numbering thousands of people. For a great many years I have been engaged in active labor, speaking to the people and writing out the instruction opened before me.",
