    "word": "Look, thirsty, bewildered souls! Can ye not see the fountain of life opened for the weary, wayworn traveler? Can ye not hear the voice of mercy as she beckons to you, saying, \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters\"? \"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\" The waters of this fountain contain medical properties which will heal spiritual and physical infirmities. All are invited to wash away their pollution in this fountain. Drink deeply from the fountain opened for Judah and Jerusalem. Then you can take the refreshing cup to parched, fainting souls.",
