    "word": "But who will press the question of entire exclusion? Both white and colored people have the same Creator, and are saved by the redeeming grace of the same Saviour.

The Lord has not made two heavens, one for white people and one for colored people. There is but one heaven for the saved.--Letter 304, 1908, pp. 2, 3. (To \"Our Churches in Washington,\" D. C., October 19, 1908.)",
