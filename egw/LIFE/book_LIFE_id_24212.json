    "word": "Christ has Made the Yoke Easy. \n\n     Instead of toiling to prepare set rules and regulations, you might better be praying and submitting your own will and ways to Christ. He is not pleased when you make hard the things he has made easy. He says, \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" The Lord Jesus loves his heritage, and if men will not think it their special prerogative to prescribe rules for their fellow-laborers, but will bring Christ's rules into their life and copy his lessons, then each will be an example, and not a judge.",
