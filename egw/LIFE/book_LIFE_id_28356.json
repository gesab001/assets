    "word": "If you walk with Jesus here in humble obedience, you will share His triumph and His joy. The shades of darkness will soon pass away; the morning cometh; the conflict is well-nigh ended. There is a crown of life laid up for every one who has been a partaker with Christ in His suffering. The imagination in its most exalted flight cannot picture the glorious destiny that awaits the overcomer. He thought himself humbled in the dust, and his pride and ambition were put to shame, but the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory is his through the ceaseless ages of eternity.-- Letter 21a, 1893. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 16, 1984 Entire Letter Released",
