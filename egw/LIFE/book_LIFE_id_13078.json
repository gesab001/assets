    "word": "Christlikeness means living to love and serve--especially the unlovely.--What a wonderful reverence Jesus expressed in His life mission for human life! He stood not among the people as a king demanding attention,\n38\nreverence, service, but as one who wished to serve, to lift up humanity. He said He had not come to be ministered unto, but to minister. I am sure that the great lesson of forgiveness must be learned more perfectly by us all, and we must practice the Christian graces. Wherever Christ saw a human being He saw one who needed human sympathy. Many of us are willing to serve certain ones,--those whom we honor,--but the very ones to whom Christ would make us a blessing if we were not so cold-hearted, so unkind and selfish, we pass by as unworthy of our notice. We do not help them, though it is our duty to do this,--to bear with their rudeness, while seeking to cultivate the opposite traits of character.--RH April 12, 1887.",
