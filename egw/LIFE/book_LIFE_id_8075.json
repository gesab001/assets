    "word": "CHRIST\u2019S HUMANITY PLEDGES GOD\u2019S FAITHFULNESS.\u2014We have everything we could ask to inspire us with faith and trust in God. In earthly courts, when a king would make his greatest pledge to assure men of his truth, he gives his child as a hostage, to be redeemed on the fulfillment of his promise; and behold what a pledge of the Father\u2019s faithfulness; for when He would assure men of the immutability of His council, He gave His only-begotten Son to come to earth, to take the nature of man, not only for the brief years of life, but to retain his nature in the heavenly courts, an everlasting pledge of the faithfulness of God. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and love of God! \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God\u201d (1 John 3:1).\u2014RH December 22, 1891 quoted in 1SM 258.",
