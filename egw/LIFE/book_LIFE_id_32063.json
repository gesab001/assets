    "word": "I had hoped that our brethren in the South would recognize the Lord\u2019s hand in leading our brethren to begin work in Nashville, making this a center. In this city buildings offered at a low price were purchased, and fitted up for use. Advantages were taken of circumstances favorable for a beginning. An excellent company of workers was brought together to labor in the publishing house. The Lord God looked upon the lovingly and approvingly. Had the brethren in the South appreciated the situation and been converted by the Holy Spirit of God, their influence would have been a savor of life unto life. If they had done more praying, and less talking with one another, each deferring, this company of workers in the office of publication would have had peace and contentment and rest of soul. But the clashing of words has brought evil. This is one of the reasons that so little has been done in the South. The Lord calls upon His people to be converted, and instead of hindering the work, to help it, so that it shall advance.",
