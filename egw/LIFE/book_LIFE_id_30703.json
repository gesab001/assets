    "word": "When in meeting of counsel, you should be under the influence of the spirit of God. You should be ready to advance along the line, keeping step with the soldiers of Christ. There is a great work to be done, and will you not take hold with heart and soul to do this work as a faithful sentinel for God? Will you let others carry the load, and then seek to hinder them to the extent of your ability; or will you be baptized with the spirit of God, and let the truth have its moulding, fashioning power upon your life and character, that you may come into union and harmony with your brethren?",
