    "word": "Family Members Are Separated \n\n     Those who have been members of the same family are separated. A mark is placed upon the righteous. \"They shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him\" [Malachi 3:17]. Those who have been obedient to God's commandments will unite with the company of the saints in light. They shall enter in through the gates into the city, and have right to the tree of life.",
