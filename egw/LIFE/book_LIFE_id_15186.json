    "word": "Avoid Cultivating Expensive Tastes \n\n     The workers must arouse themselves to see afar off. With many self-denial and self-sacrifice are dead, and these elements must be raised to life again. Men must understand that the large wages which they demand are sapping the Lord's treasury. They are binding up God's money in private interests, and by their actions are saying to the world, \"My lord delayeth his coming\" (Matthew 24:48). Shall not this thing be changed? Who will come up to the great example of the Master Worker?--Letter 120, 1899.",
