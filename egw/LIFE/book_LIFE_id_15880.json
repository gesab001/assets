    "word": "(Revelation 22:14.) Glory Gives Way to Greater Glory.--There is no discord between the Old Testament and the New. In the Old Testament we find the gospel of a coming Saviour; in the New Testament we have the gospel of a Saviour revealed as the prophecies had foretold. While the Old Testament is constantly pointing forward to the true offering, the New Testament shows that the Saviour prefigured by the typical offerings has come. The dim glory of the Jewish age has been succeeded by the brighter, clearer glory of the Christian age. \n                                                                           1096\nBut not once has Christ stated that His coming destroyed the claims of God's law. On the contrary, in the very last message to His church, by way of Patmos, He pronounces a benediction upon those who keep His Father's law: \"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" (ST July 29, 1886).",
