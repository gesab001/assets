    "word": "God could not abolish His law to save the human race, for this would immortalize transgression and place the whole world under Satan\u2019s control. But He \u201cso loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d In this wonderful gift is shown the depth of God\u2019s goodness. He so loved sinful people that He gave Himself in His Son, that they might have another opportunity, another trial, another chance to show their obedience. He so loved men and women that in order to save them He gave His Son to the world, and in that gift He gave all heaven! This was the only provision God could make. By this gift a way was provided for sinners to return to their loyalty.",
