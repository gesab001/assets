    "word": "I often think that if those who are church members in Battle Creek would do their best, and realize that the work of saving souls is of the utmost importance, the work would move more rapidly. The banner of truth must \n\n\n                                    -357- \n\nbe held firmly, and in the spirit of Christ. Open the Word, and present from it the lines of truth that concern the salvation of souls. The truth is to be presented as it is in Jesus. We need hearts filled with love and tender compassion. Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost. If all in Battle Creek would stand firm, separating from the world, and drinking from the water of life, they could refresh thirsty souls.--Letter 6, 1898. (Written to Miss Emily Campbell, January 12, 1898, from Sunnyside, Cooranbong, N.S.W.)",
