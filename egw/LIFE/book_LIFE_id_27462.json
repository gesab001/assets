    "word": "My brethren and sisters, do you feel the sanctifying power of sacred truth in your heart and life and character? Have you the assurance that God, for the sake of His dear Son, has forgiven your sins? Are you striving to live with a conscience void of offense toward God and man? Do you often plead with God in behalf of your friends and neighbors? If you have made your peace with God, and have placed all upon the altar, you may engage with profit in soul-winning service.--Ms 2, 1914 pp. 1, 3, 4. (\"Consecrated Efforts to Reach Unbelievers,\" June 5, 1914.) \n\nReleased December 6, 1977.",
