    "word": "The Children Understood.--Christ's way of presenting truth cannot be improved upon. . . . The words of life were presented in such simplicity that a child could understand them. Men, women, and children were so impressed with His manner of explaining the Scriptures that they would catch the very intonation of His voice, place the same emphasis on their words, and imitate His gestures. Youth caught His spirit of ministry, and sought to pattern after His gracious ways by seeking to assist those whom they saw needing help. --Counsels on Health, pp. 498, 499.
