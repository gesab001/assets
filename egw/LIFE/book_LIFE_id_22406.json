    "word": "When souls, convicted, and aroused to their danger, began to inquire, \"What shall I do that I may have eternal life?\" Satan was present, to stir up the minds of the priests and rulers to oppose the Saviour's work, to hedge up His way. But Christ ever proved Himself superior to Satan. Rebuking the Satanic agencies, He set free the poor souls who were bound by his chains, and bade them go free.--Letter 292, Sept. 4, 1906, to Dr. and Mrs. D. H. Kress, at the Sydney Sanitarium in Australia.",
