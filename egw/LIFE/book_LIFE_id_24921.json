    "word": "Students may receive their diplomas, and yet their education has but just begun. But generally the student who knows nothing of what it is to bear responsibility anywhere, that has not taken the burden of thinking, the burden of caretaking, of studying complicated cases, feels that he is a ripe scholar. It is because such know so little that they think they know so much. If they knew considerable more, they would sense their inability. The one who best knows himself will work in all humility, He feels like making no proud boasts; he bears a weight of responsibility as he sees the woes of suffering humanity, and he will not take human life into his hands to deal with even the bodies of men, without connecting with the experienced physician, regarding him as a father and himself as a child to be instructed and nourished and corrected, if in error. Our medical students should get an experience by beginning at the lower round of the ladder, and by careful, earnest, thoughtful exertion, climbing round after round, religion--Bible religion-- being the mainspring of action.",
