    "word": "It is unsafe to trust to feelings or impressions; these are unreliable guides. God's law is the only correct standard of holiness. It is by this law that character is to be judged. If an inquirer after salvation were to ask, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" the modern teachers of sanctification would answer, \"Only believe that Jesus saves you.\" But when Christ was asked this question He said, \"What is written in the law? how readest thou?\" And when the questioner replied, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, . . . and thy neighbour as thyself,\" Jesus said, \"Thou hast answered \n                                                                           53\nright: this do, and thou shalt live\" (Luke 10:25-29).",
