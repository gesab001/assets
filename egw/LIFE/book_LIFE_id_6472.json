    "word": "A course of study at Ann Arbor may be thought essential for some; but evil influences are there ever at work upon susceptible minds, so that the farther they advance in their studies, the less they deem it necessary to seek a knowledge of the will and ways of God. None should be allowed to pursue a course of study that may in any way weaken their faith in the truth and in the Lord's power, or diminish their respect for a life of holiness.

Let every selfish desire to distinguish yourselves be set aside; take every suggestion from humanity, to God, trusting in the \n                                                                           348\nguidance of the Holy Spirit; every unholy ambition should be blotted out, lest the Lord shall say: \"I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.\" Every one should move so that he can say: \"Thou, O Lord, knowest me: Thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward Thee.\" \"Thou God seest me.\" The Lord weighs every motive. He is a discerner of the thoughts and intents and purposes of the heart. Without God we are without hope; therefore let us fix our faith upon Him. \"Thou art my hope, O Lord God: Thou art my trust from my youth.\"",
