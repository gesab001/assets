He has sent His messengers to present to you the treasures of His Word. He has opened the Scriptures to your understanding, and you have felt that it was your privilege to take them just as they read. We have felt to thank the Lord that from you has gone forth the word of God, because you have been holding forth the words of life to others. It is a precious privilege to be entrusted with work for God, to be laborers together with God.",
