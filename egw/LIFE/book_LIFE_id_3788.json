    "word": "The Givers Rewarded Though Gifts Are \n                     Misappropriated \n\n\n     Families in poverty, who had experienced the sanctifying influence of the truth, and who therefore prized it, and felt grateful to God for it, have thought that they could and should deprive themselves of even the necessaries of life, in order to bring in their offerings to the treasury of the Lord. Some have deprived themselves of articles of clothing which they really needed to make them comfortable. Others have sold their only cow, and have dedicated to God the means thus received. In the sincerity of their souls, with many tears of gratitude because it was their privilege to do this for the cause of God, they have bowed before the Lord with their offering, and have invoked His blessing upon it as they sent it forth, praying that it might be the means of bringing the knowledge of the truth to souls in darkness.",
