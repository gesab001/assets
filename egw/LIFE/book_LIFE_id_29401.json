    "word": "We need to cherish a constant realization of God's love and goodness. We need to remember that He holds us accountable for the use that we make of the gifts that He has bestowed on us. We have been bought with a price; therefore we are to glorify God in our body and in our spirit, which are His. We are not to deny Him by one act of intemperance, because the only begotten Son of God has purchased us at an infinite cost, even the sacrifice of His life. He did not die for us in order that we might become slaves to evil habits, but that we might become the sons and daughters of God, serving Him with every power of the being.",
