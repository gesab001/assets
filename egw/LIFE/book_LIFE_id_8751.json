    "word": "It is not what is around us, but what is in us; not what we have, but what we are, that makes us really happy. We want a cheerful fire on the altar of our own hearts; then we shall view everything in a happy, cheerful light. We may have the peace of Christ. . . . If we will be obedient, trustful in God, as a child in its simplicity trusts its earthly parents, we shall have peace--not the peace that the world gives, but that peace which Jesus gives. . . . Life, this life, has much brightness in it if we will gather the flowers and let the briers and thistles alone.",
