    "word": "EDSON WAS THE SECOND OF ELLEN WHITE'S \n     FOUR SONS. BECAUSE OF HER EXTENSIVE TRAVEL \n     AND OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES THROUGHOUT HER \n     BUSY LIFE, SHE HAD TO BE AWAY FROM HER \n     CHILDREN. A LARGE COLLECTION OF HER LETTERS TO \n     THEM HAS BEEN PRESERVED. THE FOLLOWING \n     LETTER WAS WRITTEN TO EDSON AND EMMA IN \n     1870 SHORTLY AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE, AND \n     REPRESENTS A MOTHER'S HOPES AND PRAYERS FOR \n     THE HOME THAT HAS JUST BEEN ESTABLISHED. \n     THE COUNSEL SHOWS A LOVING MOTHER'S CARE \n     FOR HER SON, BUT CARRIES THE ADDED DIMENSION \n     OF HER OWN EXPERIENCE IN RECEIVING \n     DIVINE MESSAGES FROM THE LORD IN VISIONS.",
