    "word": "\"Then said they unto him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God?\" Jesus answered and said unto them, \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\" \"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And this is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given unto us.\" \"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\"",
