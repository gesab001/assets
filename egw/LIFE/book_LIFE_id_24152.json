    "word": "The expression \"he that overcometh\" indicates that there is something for every one of us to overcome. The overcomer is to be clothed in the white raiment of Christ's righteousness, and of Him it is written: \"I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.\" Oh, what a privilege it is to be an overcomer, and to have our names presented before the Father by the Saviour Himself! And when, as overcomers, we shall be \"clothed in white raiment,\" the Lord will acknowledge our faithfulness as verily as in the days of the early Christian church. He acknowledged the \"few names even in Sardis\" who had \"not defiled their garments\" (Revelation 3:4); and we shall walk with Him in white, for through His atoning sacrifice we shall be accounted worthy.",
