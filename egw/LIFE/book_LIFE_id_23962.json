    "word": "It is just as much sin to violate the laws of our being as to break one of the Ten Commandments, for we cannot do either without breaking God's law.

We are daily lessening our strength to glorify God, when He requires all our strength, all our mind. By our wrong habits we are lessening our hold on life, and yet professing to be Christ's followers, preparing for the finishing touch of immortality. . . .",
