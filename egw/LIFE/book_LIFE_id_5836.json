    "word": "When truth becomes an abiding principle in the life, the soul is \"born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.\" This new birth is the result of receiving Christ as the word of God. Then by the Holy Spirit divine truths are impressed upon the heart, new conceptions are awakened, and the energies hitherto dormant are aroused to cooperate with God. . . . Christ was the revealer of truth to the world. By Him the incorruptible seed--the Word of God--was sown in the hearts of men.",
