    "word": "Those thus born again will go from our institution prepared to speak to others of Him who has done so much for them. Jesus says of them, \"Ye are my witnesses.\" God grant them a renewal of life and health that they may go forth to impart to others the knowledge they have obtained, to tell their friends that they may keep well by eating temperately and drinking temperately, discarding tea, coffee, drugs of all kinds, and alcohol in all its forms. They go from the sanitarium as newborn souls, converted and enlightened, knowing that by being temperate in all things, and depending on Him who gave His life for them, they may work for God.",
