    "word": "Brother_____, your work in the past will not bear the test of trial. You have an incorrect understanding of yourself and your dangers. But the Lord has looked pityingly upon you. The Saviour has a boundless love for every human being; and, notwithstanding that you were spotted and stained by self-indulgence, which has nearly ruined your physical, mental, and spiritual strength, He reached down His arm to save you. In every human being He sees a boundless capacity for improvement. With divine energy and hope He greets those for whom He has given His life. He places within their reach the riches of eternal life. In His strength they can live a life rich in good works, filled with the power of the Spirit. But they must separate from all scheming, all dishonesty. The true Christian will not keep up an appearance that is not real.",
