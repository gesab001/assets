    "word": "The divine beauty of the character of Christ, of whom the noblest and most gentle among men are but a faint reflection; of whom Solomon by the Spirit of inspiration wrote, He is \"the chiefest among ten thousand, . . . yea, He is altogether lovely\" (Song of Solomon 5:10-16); of whom David, seeing Him in prophetic vision, said, \"Thou art fairer than the children of men\" (Psalm 45:2); Jesus, the express image of the Father's person, the effulgence of His glory; the self-denying Redeemer, throughout His pilgrimage of love on earth, was a living representation of the character of the law of God. In His life it is made manifest that heaven-born love, Christlike principles, underlie the laws of eternal rectitude.",
