    "word": "Study the instruction found in Matthew 25:14-46. Compare this instruction with your life record. Let every man put away his boasting. . . . Let us walk in the footsteps of Christ in all the humility of true faith. Let us put away all self-trust, committing ourselves, day by day and hour by hour, to the Saviour, constantly receiving and imparting His grace. I beg those who profess to believe in Christ to walk humbly before God. Pride and self-exaltation are an offense to Him. \"If any man will come after me,\" Christ declares, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:24). Those only who obey this word will He recognize as His believing ones. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God\" (John 1:12, 13).",
