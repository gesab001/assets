    "word": "Remember that you will make this meeting what it is. You can have heaven as you come and as you go. But in order for this to be, self must be lost in Christ. We must eat the bread of heaven. This is like taking each day the leaves of the tree of life. These will restore in us the moral image of God. This image has been obliterated, but it can be restored by the eating of the bread of life.",
