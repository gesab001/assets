    "word": "ABRAHAM \n\nDAILY PRAYER TO ASCEND TO GOD AS SWEET INCENSE.\u2014The life of Abraham, the friend of God, was a life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was built an altar, upon which \n124\nwere offered the morning and the evening sacrifice. When his tent was removed, the altar remained. And the roving Canaanite, as he came to that altar, knew who had been there. When he had pitched his tent he repaired the altar and worshiped the living God.",
