    "word": "Children and youth need the influence of a cheerful example. They need pleasant instruction. . . . By an example of patience and forbearance, the Christian parent is to teach that evil temper and harshness have no place in the life of the believer in Christ, that these qualities are displeasing to God. As your children see you bringing into your lives the principles of truth, they too will be led to fight against wrong habits and practices, and with you will reflect the goodness and love of God.--Signs of the Times, Nov. 14, 1911.",
