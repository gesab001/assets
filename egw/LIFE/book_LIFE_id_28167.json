    "word": "I am very sorry that you should have allowed yourself to think that because he has treated me with great kindness and respect that he was prompted in this by motives of selfishness. I believe he had confidence in me, and in the work God has given me to do. He has treated me with all the courtesy that he would show toward his mother, while at the same time I have not shunned to reprove and warn and entreat when he was in danger or under temptation. I am grieved at these words coming from your pen. If the Lord puts it into the hearts of my brethren, especially those whom I have known from their childhood, to show me respect, and to bring, if possible, a little sunshine into my life, I thank the Lord for this. When I have been at Battle Creek I have been always worn down with labor. I have had no home and I have needed care. In my widowhood I have had sorrows and trials which God alone knows, and I have felt grateful that the Lord has put it into the heart of Dr. Kellogg to show me kindness, and to seek to do me good physically. And not Dr. Kellogg alone, but many others of my brethren and sisters. I do not forget one of their favors, and hope they will receive a full reward for what they have done for me.",
