    "word": "Paul's Final Witness\n \n\n     Paul was led in a private manner to the place of execution. His persecutors, alarmed at the extent of his influence, feared that converts might be won to Christianity even by the scene of his death. Hence few spectators were allowed to be present. But the hardened soldiers appointed to attend him listened to his words, and with amazement saw him cheerful and even joyous in prospect of such a death. His spirit of forgiveness toward his murderers and unwavering confidence in Christ to the very last proved a savor of life unto\n317\nlife to some who witnessed his martyrdom. More than one erelong accepted the Saviour whom Paul preached, and fearlessly sealed their faith with their blood.",
