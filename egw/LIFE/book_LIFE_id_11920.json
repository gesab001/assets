    "word": "The education of Christ, during the time He was subject to His parents, was of the most valuable kind. . . . The physical and mental exercise that was necessary to the performance of His tasks developed both physical and mental strength. His life of industry and retirement closed the avenues through which Satan could enter to tempt Him to the love of vanity and display. He waxed strong in body and spirit, thus gaining a preparation for the duties of manhood and for the performance of the important duties that afterward devolved upon Him.",
