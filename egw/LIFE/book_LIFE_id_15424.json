    "word": "Our Saviour took up the true relationship of a human being as the Son of God. We are sons and daughters of God. In order to know how to behave ourselves \n                                                                           136\ncircumspectly, we must follow where Christ leads the way. For thirty years He lived the life of a perfect man, meeting the highest standard of perfection. Then let man, however imperfect, hope in God, saying not, \"If I were of a different disposition I would serve God,\" but bring himself to Him in true service. . . . That nature has been redeemed by Me. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:12)--you are not degraded, but raised, ennobled, refined by Me. You can find refuge in Me. You can obtain victory and be more than conquerors in My name.--Letter 69, 1897.",
