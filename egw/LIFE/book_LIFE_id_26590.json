    "word": "The souls of men are valued by the Son of God, and if we do not value eternal life sufficiently to make a sacrifice for it, then we shall lose eternal life. What is it to lose life? It is when the truth is clearly set before us and we refuse to accept it because a cross is involved. The Creator of heaven has a right to the faculties He has given us and it is for our own good and advantage that we give these powers to God and to His service.",
