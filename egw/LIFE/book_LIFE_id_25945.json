    "word": "The Macedonian cry is coming to us from all directions. Send us laborers, is the urgent appeal from East and West. All around us are fields, \"white \n                                                                           69\nalready to harvest.\" \"And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal,\" Is it not folly to turn from these fields, to engage in a business that can yield only pecuniary gain? Christ wants not selfish workers, who are seeking only for the highest wages. He calls for those who are willing to become poor for his sake, as he became poor for them. What were the inducements presented before Christ in this world? Insults, mockery, poverty, shame, rejection, betrayal, and crucifixion. Shall the under-shepherds seek for an easier lot than that of their Master?",
