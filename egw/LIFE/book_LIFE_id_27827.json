    "word": "The reception of the truth as it is in Jesus will make melody in the heart. Men will be blessed in receiving the One in whom their hopes of eternal life are centered. And as far and as fast as possible the standard of truth is to be uplifted among all nations. God never designed that the light of truth should be centered and bound up in one locality. For a time the Jewish nation was required to worship at Jerusalem. But Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, \"Believe Me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in truth\" (John 4:21-24).",
