    "word": "Christians Are God's Helping Hands.--God's promises to the obedient are \"good tidings of great joy.\" They are gladdening to the humble, contrite soul. The life of the true Christian is radiant with the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. If men and women would act as the Lord's helping hand, doing deeds of love and kindness, uplifting the oppressed, rescuing those ready to perish, the glory of the Lord would be their rereward. . . . They would call, and the Lord would answer, \"Here am I.\" They would turn to the One close beside them, who has given them the promise, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\"--16MR 73, 74 (1901).",
