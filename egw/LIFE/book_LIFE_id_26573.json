    "word": "The question is, Are we learners in the school of Christ? Are we making advancement in divine life? Are we better acquainted with our duty today than in the past? Are we ready to confess Christ to our fellow men? If so, then we are learning the lessons required, and as Christ knows every one of our sorrows, He stands ready to render that help that we need. But if our lives are not in harmony with our divine Master then the yoke galls. If Christ tells us to come unto Him with our burdens, why not come and find rest in Christ? We have a heaven to win. We must be sanctified through the truth in obedience.",
