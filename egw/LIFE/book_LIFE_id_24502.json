    "word": "Church-members, the world is your field, and it is white unto the harvest. \"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest.\" Christ said \n                                                                           5\nto His disciples: \"Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor.\"",
