    "word": "Eloquent Sermons \n\n     The minister may make a high range into the heavens, by poetical descriptions, and fanciful presentations which please the senses and feed the imagination, but which do not touch the common life experience, the daily necessities; bringing home to the heart the very truths which are of vital interest. The immediate requirements, the present trials, need present help and strength,--the faith that works by love and purifies the soul, not words which have no real influence upon the living daily walk in practical Christianity.",
