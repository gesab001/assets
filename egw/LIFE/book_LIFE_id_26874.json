    "word": "And I pray for you, my brethren, that you may make sure work for eternal life. As a messenger of Jesus Christ, I entreat of you to let love come into your hearts. Every soul that shall be saved must be holy and pure in this world. Every soul that falls upon the Rock and is broken, Christ with His everlasting arms gathers them to His bosom. Put your heart into the work.--Ms 4, 1885, pp. 3-6, 8. (Sermon, \"Christian Fellowship,\" November 9, 1885.) \n\nReleased March 24, 1971.",
