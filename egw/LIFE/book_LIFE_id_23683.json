    "word": "Chap. 53 - The Real Proof of Preaching\n\n     Evidence of a Godly Life--It is not enough to argue in defense of the truth. The most telling evidence of its worth is seen in a godly life; and without this the most conclusive statements will be lacking in weight and prevailing power; for our strength lies in being connected with God by His Holy Spirit, and transgression severs us from this sacred nearness with the Source of our might and wisdom.--2BC 998.",
