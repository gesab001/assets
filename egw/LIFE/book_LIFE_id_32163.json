    "word": "In their rooms, students are apt to speak words that are frivolous. A great deal of this is done. Foolish talking, jesting, and joking are indulged in. Cheap remarks are made, which create a spirit of careless disregard for order. This cheap nonsense shows that the heart contains no treasure that is good. Thus minds are turned from the important subjects that have been presented before \n\n\n                                -76- \n\nthem. This cheap stuff, wood, hay, stubble, some choose to put into their character building. The Lord Jesus gave his life to save these precious souls, and he has given them ability to learn, and power to obey his requirements. Students are not given the privilege of making wise improvement of their time. The truth is able to make them wise unto salvation.",
