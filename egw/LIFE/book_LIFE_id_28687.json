    "word": "I pray that the Lord will help in every line of work, in every business transaction, that the principles of Christ may be carried out. There must be no unfair dealing. God's workers are to do to others as they would be done by. It has been most painful to see those who profess to believe present truth following in their business transactions a course directly opposed to the directions that the Lord gave Moses to give to the children of Israel. We are to carry out these principles. We are to be representatives of truth and righteousness. We are called to be sons and daughters of God, to live the Christ-life.",
