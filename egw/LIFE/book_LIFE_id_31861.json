    "word": "And we are to be sharers in His glory; for Christ says, \"The glory which thou givest me I have given them.\" What is that glory? The character of Christ. Can we ask any greater endowment? To have any place in heaven, to be in the presence of Christ, seems a blessing too great for sinful human beings to enjoy. But the marvelous mercy and goodness and love of God are beyond our comprehension. By accepting Christ as his personal Saviour, man is brought into the same close relation to God, and enjoys His special favor as does His own beloved Son. He is honored and glorified and intimately associated with God, his life being hid with Christ in God. O, what love, what wondrous love! Read the scriptures referred to; copyist left them out for want of time.",
