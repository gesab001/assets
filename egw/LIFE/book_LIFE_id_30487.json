    "word": "May God help you to labor for eternity. He wants you to have eternal life, and you may have it. If you will come to Christ, confess your sins in humility and put them away, He will use you and will enable you to help others. You may be workers together-- together [with God]! If you separate from God you can do nothing. Workers together with Him--that is our privilege. May God help us as we strive for the victory.--Ms. 37, 1908.",
