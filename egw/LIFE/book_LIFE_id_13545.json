IF WE ARE FAITHFUL IN WORKING ON THIS PLAN, GOD WORKS FOR US ON THE PLAN OF MULTIPLICATION.\u201d (ITALICS SUPPLIED.) HERE GOD'S PROPHET IS REFLECTING HEAVEN'S OPTIMISM ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND GROWTH IN HUMAN BEINGS. GOD STANDS READY TO DO HIS PART, BUT \u201cGOD IS WATCHING INTENTLY TO SEE WHAT KIND OF TIMBERS PARENTS AND CHILDREN PUT INTO THEIR CHARACTER BUILDING.\u201d",
