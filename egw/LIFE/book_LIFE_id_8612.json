    "word": "Those who are obedient to the will of God will not have a hard and miserable time in this life. Hear again the words of Christ: \"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full\" (verse 11). This is the witness which it is the privilege of all to have--the joy of Christ in the soul through appropriating the word of God . . . and bringing the requirements of Christ into the practical life. There is full assurance of hope in believing every word of Christ, believing in Him, being united to Him by living faith. When this is his experience, the human being is no longer under the law, for the law no longer condemns his course of action. . . .",
