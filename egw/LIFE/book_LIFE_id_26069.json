    "word": "Bro. H----- L-----, you are backslidden from God. Your views of God's requirements have never been too well defined nor too strict. It is no excuse for you to become lax in your duties and less vigilant because the course of so many professed Christians is wrong. You have not been consecrated to God. You have not felt your dependence upon him to keep you, and therefore you have been overcome and brought into the slavery of doubt; and the bondage of unbelief has chained your soul. You do not glorify God in your life. Our faith sometimes looks to you very questionable. The reason of this is with yourself. In the world truth and falsehood are so mixed that one is not always clearly discerned from the other. But why has one who professes the truth so little strength? Because he understands not his own ignorance and his own weakness. If he knew this, if he was distrustful of himself, he would feel the importance of Divine help to preserve him from the wiles of the enemy. We need to be active, working Christians, unselfish in heart and life, having an eye single to the glory of God, Oh! what wrecks of weakness we meet everywhere! Silent lips, and fruitless lives! This, said the angel, is because of falling under temptation. Nothing \n                                                                           22\nmars the peace of the soul like sinful unbelief.",
