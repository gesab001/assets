    "word": "There is nothing said or done or even thought that God does not know; nothing can escape His infinite eye. There is a Witness to every thought and word and action of our lives, and that Witness is the Holy One, a sin-hating God. The God of heaven is measuring character and weighing moral worth in the golden balances of the sanctuary. How many in these gatherings of the secret society are weighed and found wanting--wanting in the fruits of a life of piety and heart service! I speak that which I do know. To be found wanting when God, the Creator of heaven and earth, weighs character, is a terrible thing. Christ died for every individual soul of them, that He might draw them to Himself. God has made every provision, bestowed every gift, even heaven itself. Having given Jesus, He withholds nothing for the benefit of man. Your mind needs to dwell upon these things.",
