    "word": "If you would secure the grand aim and purpose of life without mistake in your choice or fear of failure, you must make God first and last and best in every plan and work and thought.

The voice of the Lamb of God is heard speaking to us, \"Follow Me, and ye shall not walk in darkness.\"",
