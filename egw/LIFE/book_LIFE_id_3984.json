    "word": "Chap. 27 - The Intermediate School\n\n\n\"Understanding is a wellspring\nof life unto him that hath it.\"\n\nIntermediate Schools\n\n\n     Intermediate schools are highly essential. In these schools thorough work is to be done; for many students will go forth from them directly into the great harvest field. They will go forth to use what they have learned, as canvassers and as helpers in various lines of evangelistic work. Many workers, after laboring for a time in the field, will feel the need of further study, and with the experience gained in the field will be prepared to value school privileges and to make rapid advancement. Some will desire an education in the higher branches of study. For these our colleges have been established.",
