I was ashamed, distressed, agonized, that such should ever bear the name of disciples, or profess the name of Christ. I saw that they should cheerfully say, \u2018Here, Lord, is the little of earth's treasures thou hast lent me; take any portion of it; take it all; it is thine. Let me do my part in saving my fellow-men, and let me be raised up with the redeemed to dwell with thee forever.\u2019 Tremblingly will such disciples lean upon the strong promises of God. Earth fades before their vision; Heaven is magnified, and no sacrifice is too dear \n338\nfor them to make for the \u2018far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\u2019",
