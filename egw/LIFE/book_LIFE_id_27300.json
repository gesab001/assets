    "word": "MR No. 463 - The Senses and Sensuality\n\n     The result of pure and undefiled religion in the heart will be to change the whole character, If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature. We will not, must not, be double-minded, unstable. The renewing grace of Christ renounces everything bad in action, in emotion, in thought. That which was good is purified from its selfishness and every taint of impurity. There is a decided change in the whole life.",
