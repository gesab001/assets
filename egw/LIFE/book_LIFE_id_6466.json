    "word": "Christ said, \"Blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.\" The bread of life alone can satisfy the hungering soul. The water of life alone will quench the thirst of the thirsty soul. The minds of the disciples were often excited by curiosity, but instead of gratifying their desire to know things which were not necessary for the proper conduct of their work, he opened new channels of thought to their minds. He gave them much needed instruction upon practical godliness.",
