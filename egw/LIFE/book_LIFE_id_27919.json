    "word": "Let no friendship, no influence, no entreaty, let not the smiles, the confidence, or the rewards of any man, induce you to swerve from the path in which the Lord would lead you. Let Christlike integrity and consistency control the actions of your life. The man who sits most at the feet of Jesus, and is taught by the Saviour's spirit, will be ready to cry out, \"I am weak and unworthy, but Christ is my strength and my righteousness.\"",
