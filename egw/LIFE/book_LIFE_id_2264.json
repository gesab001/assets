    "word": "Let invalids have an exalted aim in life, seeking to be useful and efficient in their own families, and to become useful members of society; let them not require the attention of the whole family to be centered on themselves, nor draw largely upon the sympathies of others; let them do their part in bestowing love and sympathy upon the unfortunate, remembering that each has woes and trials peculiar to himself. In thus blessing others they will realize an abundant blessing themselves.",
