    "word": "Professed Christians of today who reject light will be no more favorable to those who receive and rejoice in the light of truth than were the Jews in the days of Christ. If they had known that He was the Prince of life, they would not have crucified Him. Why did they not know? Because they refused every evidence given them that Christ was the Messiah. . . . They will look upon the believers as a little, weak people, a few fanatics, and will speak derisively of them.\u2014Letter 35a, 1877.",
