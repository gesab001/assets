    "word": "[2 Corinthians 8:7-15 and 9:6-8, quoted.] \n     Christ demands the entire service of the soldiers in His army. In His Word he has given the principles of action: \"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord\" [Romans 12:11]. These principles should govern our conduct at all times. No allowance is made for lazy, negligent work, or for want of zeal. God has a righteous claim to constant service and supreme love. Your body, your soul, your life, all your God-given capabilities should be consecrated to God for the promotion of His glory. No one can be a sincere Christian unless he is a laborer together with God, unless he belongs to the family of workers. We must ever bear in mind that we are in copartnership with God. His work and His cause demand the first consideration. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\" [Matthew 6:33].--Ms 13, 1896. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. February 3, 1983",
