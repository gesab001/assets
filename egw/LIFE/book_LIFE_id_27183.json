    "word": "MR No. 395 - Counsel to a Newly Wed Couple\n\n     Live for the glory of God. Be tender, kind, and courteous to each other. The happiness of your life will consist in making God your trust, and in seeking to make each other happy. Practice self-control. It is so easy to speak thoughtlessly, words that grieve and wound. Do not venture to trifle with each other's feelings. Practice patience, encourage love, discipline yourselves to guard every word and action, and study how you can be a blessing to each other.",
