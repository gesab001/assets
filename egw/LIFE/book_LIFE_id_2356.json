    "word": "A Call to Youth.--The Lord calls upon our youth to labor as canvassers and evangelists, to do house-to-house work in places that have not yet heard the truth. He speaks to our young men, saying, \"Ye are not your own. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" Those who will go forth to the work under God's direction will be wonderfully blessed. Those who in this life do their best will obtain a fitness for the future immortal life.--Review and Herald, May 16, 1912.",
