    "word": "(1890) C.T.B.H. 150\n     14. Health is a treasure. Of all temporal possessions it is the most precious. Wealth, learning, and honor are dearly purchased at the loss of the vigor of health. None of these can secure happiness, if health is lacking. It is a terrible sin to abuse the health that God has given us; such abuses enfeeble us for life, and make us losers, even if we gain by such means any amount of education. \n     [EXAMPLES OF SUFFERING DUE TO DISREGARDING LIGHT--119, 204]",
