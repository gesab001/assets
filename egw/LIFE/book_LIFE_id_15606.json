    "word": "Chapter 10 \n\n     18-27 (Ecclesiastes 1:14). Pity the Man Who Was Envied.--Many envied the popularity and abundant glory of Solomon, thinking that of all men he must be the most happy. But amid all that glory of artificial display the man envied is the one to be most pitied. His countenance is dark with despair. All the splendor about him is but to him mockery of the distress and anguish of his thoughts as he reviews his misspent life in seeking for happiness through indulgence and selfish gratification of every desire (ST Feb. 7, 1878). \n                                                                           1031\n {2BC 1030.10} \n \n                            Chapter 11 \n\n     1. Unsanctified Marriages Cause Downfall.--All the sins and excesses of Solomon can be traced to his great mistake in ceasing to rely upon God for wisdom, and to walk in humility before Him. . . .",
