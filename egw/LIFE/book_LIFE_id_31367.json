    "word": "In Christ God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\" This we are to believe. These words are not merely to be read as a lesson. They are to be received in the heart, understood, believed, and lived. They will bring us spiritual life. Christ's teachings are to be brought into the daily experience. We have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of our sins. Spiritual life comes to us as we receive and practice his words.",
