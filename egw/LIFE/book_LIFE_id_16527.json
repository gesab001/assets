    "word": "The wonderful symbol of the living bird dipped in the blood of the bird slain and then set free to its joyous life [Leviticus 14:4-8], is to us the symbol of the atonement. There were death and life blended, presenting to the searcher for truth and hidden treasure, the union of the pardoning blood with the resurrection and life of our Redeemer. The bird slain was over living water; that flowing stream was a symbol of the ever flowing, ever cleansing efficacy of the blood of Christ, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. . . .",
