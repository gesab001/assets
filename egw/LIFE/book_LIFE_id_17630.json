    "word": "The following lines occasioned by his death, were written by Sr. Annie R. Smith: \n\nGone to thy rest, brother! peaceful thy sleep; While o'er thy grave bending, in sorrow we weep, \n                                                                           179\nFor the loved and the cherished, in life's early bloom, Borne from our number, to the cold, silent tomb. \n\nSweet be thy slumber! in quiet repose; Beneath the green turf, and the blossoming rose; O, soft is thy pillow, and lowly thy bed; Mournful the cypress that waves o'er the dead. \n\nDark though the opinion that shaded his brow, The truth which he followed illumined it now; In the arms of his Saviour he fell to his rest, Where woes that await us pervade not his breast. \n\nWeep not for the Christian whose labor is done; Who, faithful to duty, the treasure has won. The jewel was fitted forever to shine, A gem in the casket, immortal, divine. \n\nNot long will earth's bosom his precious form hide, And death's gloomy portals from kindred divide; For swiftly approaching, we see the bright day, That brings the glad summons, Arise! come away! \n\n                                               -",
