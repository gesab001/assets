    "word": "You do not want this matter to stand just where it is. It will be the saddest experience in the life of those who have traveled over many places in Michigan; but do not let God's displeasure rest upon you. I do not believe that you mean it shall be so.

There is enough in Michigan to sustain every aggressive movement that shall be made in Michigan; but there are some who feel that if the cause can get along without it, they will invest it in their own special interests. God forbid that they should do this. Let us clear the King's highway. Let us make intelligent efforts to do everything in the sight of heaven we ought to do to bring His approbation and love upon us. I have more to bring before you, but I will say no more now. \n\n\n                                    -169-",
