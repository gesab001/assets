    "word": "The pure in heart shall see God. This seeing God in a clear, spiritual light is salvation to the soul of every believer. As soon as a soul decides to die to self, the new light begins and grows stronger and more decided until he is able to endure the sight of Him who is invisible. And as he sees God, he becomes fashioned in character after the divine similitude. His words, his attitude, his spirit, his actions in everything testify to the clearness of his judgment. In proportion to the seeing of God will be the spiritual force of his character. The consecration to God of the life and time and powers of every converted soul is the result.",
