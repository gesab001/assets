    "word": "David was humbled and greatly distressed. He fled from Jerusalem to save his life. He went not forth with confidence and kingly honor, trusting in God as in previous battles; but as he went up by the ascent of the mount of Olivet, surrounded by his people, and his mighty men, he covered his head in his humility, and walked barefoot, weeping, and his people imitating the example of deep humility manifested by their king, while fleeing before Absalom.",
