    "word": "Christ says to us, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" He is our Example. During His life on earth, He was ever kind and gentle. His influence was ever fragrant, for in Him dwelt perfect love. He was never sour and unapproachable, and He never compromised with wrong to obtain favor. If we have His righteousness, we shall be like Him in gentleness, in forbearance, in unselfish love. Shall we not, by dwelling in the sunshine of His presence, become mellowed by His grace?",
