    "word": "My brethren, we must reach the people through God. We must not plan and devise how to bring ourselves into notice, but how to work, be it in ever so humble a way, to present the matchless love and grace of Christ to the people. Let the \n\n\n                                     -303- \n\nsanctifying power of truth be expressed in your life and revealed in your character. Let Christ mold you, as clay is molded in the hands of the potter. Lay every burden at the feet of Jesus. Your health, your soul, your children, all are the Lord's; and you must relate yourself to them in such a way that you may present a well-ordered family to the Lord, children who are a pattern of good works. This is the special work of parents who have any connection with the sacred work of God.",
