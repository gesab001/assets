    "word": "Notwithstanding your life has not been in accordance with the will of God, your works and ways have been offensive to him, yet such is his great unwillingness to leave you-- such is his love toward you, that the Majesty of Heaven condescends to beg the privilege of making you a visit, and leaving you his blessing. \"Behold I stand at the door and knock.\" The mansions in glory are his. His the joy of the heavenly abode; yet he humbles himself to seek an entrance at the door of your heart, that he may bless you with his light, and make you to rejoice in his glory. His work is to seek and save that which is lost, and ready to perish. He wishes to redeem from sin, and death, as many as he can, that he may elevate them to his throne and give them everlasting life.",
