    "word": "As the condition of the Sanitarium was presented before me in vision, an angel of \n                                                                           88\nGod seemed to conduct me from room to room in the different departments. The conversation I was made to hear in the rooms of the helpers was not of a character to elevate and strengthen mind or morals. The frivolous talk, the foolish jesting, the meaningless laugh, fell painfully upon my ear. The young are in danger, but they are blind to discern the tendencies and result of the course they are pursuing. Young men and girls were engaged in flirtation. They seemed to be infatuated. There is nothing noble, dignified, or sacred, in these attachments; as they are prompted by Satan, the influence is such as to please him. Warnings to these persons fall unheeded. They are headstrong, self-willed, defiant. They think the warning, counsel, or reproof does not apply to them. Their course gives them no concern. They are continually separating themselves from the light and love of God. They lose all discernment of sacred and eternal things; and while they may keep up a dry form of Christian duties, they have no heart in these religious exercises. All too late, these deceived souls will learn that \"strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\"",
