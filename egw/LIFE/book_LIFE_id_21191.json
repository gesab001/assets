    "word": "Names in the Book of Life. John in Revelation, in his description of the New Jerusalem, says, \"And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life\" [Revelation 21:27]. Well may you ask, \"Is my name written there?\" It is registered in that book of life if you have a character that is pure and holy like the character of Christ. Faith in the truth alone will not save us. We must be like Christ if we shall one day see Him as He is. \n                                                                           135",
