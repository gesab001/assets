    "word": "A Letter to Martha Bourdeau. My mind goes to you, Martha, in Torre Pellice. . . . We want to see you, and we want to see you trusting fully in the precious Saviour. He loves you, who gave His life for you because He valued your soul. I had a dream not long since. I was going through a garden and you were by my side. You kept saying, \"Look at this unsightly shrub, this deformed tree, that poor stunted rose bush. This makes me feel bad for they seem to represent my life and the relation I stand in before God.\" I thought a stately form walked just before us and He said, \"Gather the roses and the lilies and the pinks, and leave the thistles and unsightly shrubs, and bruise not the soul that Christ has in His choice keeping.\"",
