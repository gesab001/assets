    "word": "Sister Kress, talks to mothers given by you will be all the more appreciated because you are a mother. Oh, if only we could make those in ignorance understand that mothers--yea, fathers too--are themselves to a high degree responsible for the texture of the fabric of character that they give to their children! By their own words and actions, by the temper they manifest, they exert over their little ones a molding influence. If they \n\n\n                                -42- \n\nwould only receive the help that Jesus offers them, both fathers and mothers may be a blessing to their children, by giving studious attention to the cultivation of right habits and practices physically, intellectually, and morally. True education is thus brought into the practical life.",
