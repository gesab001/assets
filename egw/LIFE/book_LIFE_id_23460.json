    "word": "The Lord loves you, and just as long as you will follow in the footsteps of Jesus, you will walk securely. It is essential that every soul that names the name of Christ should make straight paths for his feet. Why? Lest the lame be turned out of the way. It is a terrible, terrible thing to give a soul a wrong example, and to lead him in a crooked course by the way in which you may walk. We shall soon stand before the judgment seat of Christ, not to have our cases decided, for this has been done before. The judgment sits, the books are opened, and it is revealed that every man receives according to that which he hath done, whether it be good or evil. Crowd all the good works possible into your life. . . .",
