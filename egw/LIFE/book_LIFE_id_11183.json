    "word": "True Principles Circulating Through Entire System.--Conformity to the world can be prevented by the truth, by feeding on the Word of God, by its principles circulating through the entire life current and working out that word in the character. Christ exhorts us by the apostle John to \"love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him\" (1 John 2:15). This is plain language, but it is God's measure of every man's character.--MS 37, 1896.",
