    "word": "I was shown that Bro. Charles Lindsay should seek for more spirituality. You do not possess that calm trust in God which he requires you to have. You do not train your mind to run in the channel of spirituality. You talk too much vain unnecessary talk, which injures your own soul and injures your influence. You must encourage calmness, and fortitude of mind. You are easily excited, and feel strong, and express in strong terms your likes and dislikes. You need more sweet, good religion, to have a soothing influence upon you. You have been invited to learn of Christ, who was meek and lowly of heart. Precious lesson! If well learned, it will transform the whole life. Lightness and cheap talk, is all injurious to your spiritual advancement. Perfection of character you should seek after, and let your influence tell for God in your words and acts. You need to earnestly seek the Lord, and to take a deeper draught at the fountain of truth, that its influence may sanctify your life. Your mind is on the world too much. You should have your interest in the better life than this. You have no time to lose. Make haste and improve the few hours of probation. Your wife has had too much pride and selfishness. God has been bringing her through the furnace of affliction, to remove these spots from her character. She must be very careful that the fire of affliction does not kindle upon her in vain. It should remove the dross, and bring her nearer to God, making her more spiritual. Her love of the world must die. Love of \n                                                                           11\nself must be overcome; and her will swallowed up in the will of God.",
