    "word": "He wants us to do what? \"We are laborers together with God; ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" [1 Corinthians 3:9]. And that is what we are in the world for--not to eat and to drink and to attend horse races, and to use the holidays in idling and in gratifying self; and if we have a shilling, get on the cars and go somewhere to have a good time. There are souls to be saved. There are youth to be educated by our precept and example. The Lord is coming. The end of all things is at hand, and it is time now, as the end of all things is at hand, that we commence the work for youth; that we begin to see what we can do to gather souls to Jesus Christ. \n\n\n                                      -257- \n\nThere is poverty around us; there is distress; there are the naked to clothe, the hungry to feed; and those that are thirsting for the water of life and hungering for the bread of salvation, we want to give it to them.",
