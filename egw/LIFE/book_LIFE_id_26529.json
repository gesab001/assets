    "word": "It is well to gain a knowledge of the sciences. But the acquirement of this knowledge is the ambition of a large class who are unconsecrated, and who have no thought as to the use they will make of their attainments. The world is full of men and women who manifest no sense of obligation to God for their entrusted gifts. They do not realize that God has entrusted them with talents, not for self-glorification, but for His own name's glory. They are eager for distinction. It is the object of their lives to obtain the highest place. They do not use their endowments in bringing their fellow men to Jesus. They are not helping others to study His life and character. They are not bringing them in contact with the divine life, and inspiring them with zeal to impart the light of truth.",
