    "word": "The work of every believer is aggressive. It is a daily warfare. Christ is saying to the managers and workers in the office, \"Ye are my witnesses\" (Isaiah 43:10). Think it; speak it; act it. Heaven is just next door. Open the door heavenward and close the door earthward. God is calling the workers in every department of the office. Will you hear His voice and open the door of the heart to Jesus?  Will you love Him who gave His life for you?--Manuscript Releases, vol. 12, pp. 46, 47.",
