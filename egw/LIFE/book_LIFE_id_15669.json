    "word": "11. God's Guidance Gives Clear Discernment.--Of him who walks in the way of life everlasting, using his blessings to bless others, the prophet Isaiah declares: \"The Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered \n                                                                           1152\ngarden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\"  {4BC 1151.10}  \n     These blessings we need. We need the water of life that flows from Jesus Christ, which will be in us a well of water springing up into everlasting life. \"The Lord shall guide thee continually.\" When we are guided by the Lord, we shall have clear discernment. We shall not call righteousness unrighteousness, nor think that things that the Lord has forbidden are right. We shall understand where the Lord is working.",
