    "word": "Christ pledged Himself to bridge the gulf that sin had made. Thus He became the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He shows us the path that leads to heaven, and promises to impart His efficiency to every one who believes on Him. He came to our world to reveal, not a mixture of truth and error, the pure truth of God. All error is misleading, even though clothed with garments of heavenly beauty.",
