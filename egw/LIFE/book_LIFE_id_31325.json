    "word": "\"I have declared unto them thy name,\" Christ said, \"And will declare it; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them.\" The Lord has made abundant provision that His love may be given us as His free abundant grace, as our inheritance in this life, to enable us to diffuse the same by being yoked up with Christ. Jesus conveys the circulating vitality of a pure and sanctified Christlike love through every part of our nature. When this love is expressed in the character it reveals to all those with whom we associate that it is possible for God to be formed within, the hope of glory. It shows that God loves the obedient one as He loved Jesus Christ; and nothing less than this satisfies His desires in our behalf. As soon as the human agent comes united with Christ in heart, soul, and spirit, the Father loves that soul as a part of Christ, as a member of the body of Christ, He Himself being the glorious head.",
