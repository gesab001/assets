    "word": "Where there is life, there will be growth and fruit-bearing; but unless we grow in grace, our spirituality will be dwarfed, sickly, fruitless. It is only by growing, by bearing fruit, that we can fulfill God\u2019s purpose for us. \u201cHerein is my Father glorified,\u201d Christ said, \u201cthat ye bear much fruit\u201d (John 15:8). In order to bear much fruit, we must make the most of our privileges. We must use every opportunity granted us for obtaining strength.",
