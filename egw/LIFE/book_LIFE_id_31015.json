    "word": "I dare not utter a word to Willie of what I have written to you. Bro. Starr and his wife have gone to Queensland, to open that field. Bro. Starr expects to accompany us to Africa; but I do not propose to leave this field until I see my way more clearly. \n                                                                           1257\nWillie has had little time to help me on my book. For some days he took one hour to hear chapters read on the life of Christ, but as I have not yet been able to write anything new, there is no more to be done in that line. The churches call for help; there is much visiting to be done, and much personal testimony to be written. I feel afraid to neglect this work, and suffer men and women to be under a deception thinking themselves right when I know they are wrong. If accidents should come to them, and they be taken away in their sins, I should feel that the blood of their souls was upon my garments.",
