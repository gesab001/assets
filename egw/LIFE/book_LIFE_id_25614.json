    "word": "Those who write, as well as talk the truth, have double labor. The eight hour system \n\n\n                    -16- \n\nfinds no place in the program of the minister of God. He must watch his chance to minister; he must be ready to entertain visitors. He must keep up life and energy of character; for he cannot exert a pleasing, saving influence if he is languid. If he occupies responsible positions, he must be prepared to attend board and council meetings, spending hours of wearisome brain and nerve taxing labor, while others are asleep, in devising and planning with his co-laborers. Who among God's workers counts his hours of labor as do mechanics? Yet this kind of labor taxes the mind, and draws upon every fiber of the being in such a way as the common laborer cannot appreciate. \"When do you find opportunity to throw off care and responsibility?\" I am asked; and I answer, \"At no period of time can I lay down the burden.\"",
