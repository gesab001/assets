    "word": "I will write no more now, but I hope you will both be situated where for a time you will not have to strain every nerve and muscle to their highest tension. It is not best to be in any way presumptuous. The Lord desires His worn servants to have a chance to be situated where they will have an opportunity to express with pen and voice the advantage of a broad experience, without sacrificing their lives in the effort. By precept and example men should be educated to bear the strain of labor, and those who have hitherto borne the burdens should preserve the life God has given them to voice His Word--\"This is the way; walk ye in it.\"",
