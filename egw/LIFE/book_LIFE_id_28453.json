    "word": "(Diary Entry for Dec. 26, 1904, Mountain View, Calif.) I am strongly impressed that my family shall locate here to be near the printing establishment, but the Lord must direct us, for it means a great deal to us to uproot and resettle and perhaps have to build. St. Helena has been my refuge, but I have much printing to be done. May the Lord spare my life to do this work before I shall rest in the grave, is my prayer.",
