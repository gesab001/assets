    "word": "SATAN CANNOT OVERCOME ONE WHO PRAYS.\u2014The enemy cannot overcome the humble learner of Christ, the one who walks prayerfully before the Lord. Christ interposes Himself as a shelter, a retreat, from the assaults of the wicked one. The promise is given, \u201cWhen the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.\u201d . . . There is no power in the whole satanic force that can disable the soul that trusts, in simple confidence, in the wisdom that comes from God.\u2014(My Life Today, 316.)",
