    "word": "The Lord wants you to understand your individual responsibility for the salvation of your soul. With the word of God as your guide and instructor, you are to personally work out your own salvation. You are to strive to secure eternal life, when you may dwell forever with the Lord. In studying how you may gain this, seek for that wisdom which God alone can impart. Accept the invitation, \"If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given.\" \"My brethren,\" the apostle James writes, \"count it all joy.\" (James 1,2-8)",
