    "word": "Moses had made sacrifices. He had been willing to give his own life for the salvation of others, and had even prayed to the Lord to blot his name out of the book of life rather than destroy the children of Israel, the people whom God had so wonderfully and miraculously delivered. But the Lord would not blot His servant's name out of His book. \"Whosoever hath sinned against Me,\" He said, \"him \n\n\n                                   -154- \n\nwill I blot out of My book\" (Exodus 32:33). Time and again, through the intercession of Moses, the Lord had spared His disobedient people.",
