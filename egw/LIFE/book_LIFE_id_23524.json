    "word": "My sister, we must have heaven. We must not let anything keep us from gaining eternal life. Be humble, meek, and lowly, kind, pitiful, and tenderhearted. Do not look at and talk of the failings of others. Remember that you become like that which you behold. Eternal life is worth everything to us. Let us talk about the goodness and power and glory of Christ.",
