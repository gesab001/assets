    "word": "Once a year, at the Feast of Tabernacles, the children of Israel called to mind the time when their fathers dwelt in tents in the wilderness, as they journeyed from Egypt to the land of Canaan. The services of the last day of this feast were of peculiar solemnity, but the greatest interest centered in the ceremony that commemorated the bringing of water from the rock. When in a golden vessel the waters of Siloam were borne by the priests into the temple, and, after being mingled with wine, were poured over the sacrifice on the altar, there was great rejoicing. . . . On this occasion, above all the confusion of the crowd and the sounds of rejoicing, a voice is heard: \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.\" The attention of the people is arrested. Outwardly all is joy, but the eye of Jesus, beholding the throng with the tenderest compassion, sees the soul parched and thirsting for the waters of life. . . .",
