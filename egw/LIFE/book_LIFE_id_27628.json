    "word": "If human beings for whom Christ has died would take these words to heart and live them out in their lives, we would see a different state of things in our world today. There would be less selfishness, less love of the world, and more love for God. He has entrusted man with talents that he might carry the knowledge of the truth and of Christ to all nations in our land. If Adam and Eve had lived by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God they never would have fallen, never lost the right to the tree of life. All who will live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now will be brought back to the Eden home.--Manuscript 16, 1886, pp. 1-3. (\"The Privilege of Being a Christian,\" September 19, 1886.)",
