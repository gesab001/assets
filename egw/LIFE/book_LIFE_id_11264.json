    "word": "Selfish Happiness Is Ill Balanced.--Happiness that is sought from selfish motives, outside of the path of duty, is ill balanced, fitful, and transitory; it passes away, and the soul is filled with loneliness and sorrow; but there is joy and satisfaction in the service of God. The Christian is not left to walk in uncertain paths; he is not left to vain regrets and disappointments. If we do not have the pleasures of this life, we may still be joyful in looking to the life beyond.--SC 124, 125 (1892).",
