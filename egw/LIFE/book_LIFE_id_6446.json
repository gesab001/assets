    "word": "We are not compelled to choose as familiar associates those who reject the love of God that has been expressed in giving His Son to our world, \"that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Those who love God will not choose the enemies of God to be their friends. The question was asked, \"Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them which hate the Lord?\" Will you prefer the association of the irreligious and disloyal, to that of those who are obeying the commandments of God? Will you choose to separate yourself from those who love God, and place yourself as far as possible from the channel of light? You want to keep in an atmosphere of purity and faith, and bring into your character principles that will be as solid timbers. Christians will not choose and cultivate the society of non-Christians. If the Lord gives you a special position in the world, as He did Joseph and Daniel, then he will sustain and keep you in the midst of temptation. But you will never be where you will find too much light, in our world. Then how perilous it is to choose the association of those who love darkness rather than light, and will not come to the light, lest \n                                                                           296\ntheir deeds should be reproved.--Review and Herald, Jan. 16, 1894.",
