    "word": "Church Trials.\u2014The abuses of the stomach by the gratification of appetite are a fruitful source of most church trials. Those who eat and work intemperately and irrationally, talk and act irrationally. It is not necessary to drink alcoholic liquors in order to be intemperate. The sin of intemperate eating\u2014eating too frequently, too much, and of rich, unwholesome food\u2014 destroys the healthy action of the digestive organs, affects the brain, and perverts the judgment, preventing rational, calm, healthy thinking and acting. In order for the people of God to be in an acceptable state with him, where they can glorify him in their bodies and spirits, which are his, they must with interest and zeal deny the gratification of appetite, and exercise temperance in all things. Then \n156\nthey can comprehend the truth in its beauty and clearness, and carry it out in their lives, and by a judicious, straight-forward course give the enemies of our faith no occasion to reproach the cause of truth. God requires all who believe the truth to make special, persevering efforts to place themselves in the best possible condition of bodily health, for a solemn and important work is before us. Health of mind and body is required in this work; it is as essential to a healthy religious experience, to advancement in the Christian life, to progress in holiness, as is the hand or foot to the human body. God requires his people to cleanse themselves \u201cfrom all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d [2 Corinthians 7:1.] All who are indifferent, and excuse themselves from this work, waiting for the Lord to do for them what he requires them to do for themselves, will be found wanting when the meek of the earth, who have wrought his judgments, are hid in the day of the Lord's anger.",
