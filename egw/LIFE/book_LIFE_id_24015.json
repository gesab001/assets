    "word": "Every blessing the Father has provided for those of more mature experience has been provided for children and youth through Jesus Christ. When the Lord sees the youth studying the life and lessons of Christ, He gives His angels charge over them, to keep them in all their ways, as He gave His angels charge over Jesus, His beloved Son. The angels attended Jesus when He lived upon earth under the guidance of God's Holy Spirit, doing His heavenly Father's will, that He might give a correct sample of character, that might be an example to children and youth. He desired that, in every action of their lives, they should do those things of which God could approve. He knew that every good work, every deed of kindness, every act of obedience to father and mother, would be registered in the books of heaven.",
