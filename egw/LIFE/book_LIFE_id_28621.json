    "word": "I have a deep interest in every soul, high and low, rich and poor. I feel to the very depths of my being the value of the human soul. It seems to me so terrible that one of those for whom Christ has given His life should perish. My heart yearns over sinners. I long to set in operation some means of saving them. All that I have and am I have given to my Saviour, for I am His, bought with a price. I would be His instrument to open ways whereby many shall hear the truth.",
