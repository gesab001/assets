    "word": "The confession of which John here speaks, is not the result of a nominal faith, but is the result of an abiding faith in the living Saviour,--the result of believing that the blessings of salvation are brought within our reach through the sufferings and death of Christ, who was raised from the dead, and ever liveth to make intercession for us. We should feel assured that Jesus is our Saviour, and that life would not be enjoyable, nor afford us peace or hope, if He had not loved us and given Himself for us.",
