    "word": "All the gifts and possessions of this life, all the pleasing pictures of selfish enjoyment, are of no weight when weighed in the balances against eternity. We shall live with honor and satisfaction to ourselves and with wise regard to our own welfare, so far as we make all earthly things help us in our preparation for the great future life. Live for God. Be kind; be courteous. Let not this disappointment ruin you. Cast off your melancholy. God will help you if you will be true to Him. Remember, the eye of God is upon you, searching the depths of your soul. You must preserve the idea that delegations are mutual. If God has done everything for you, then you must willingly do everything for God that is in your power. You must feel your obligation, and this will keep you on the right side, and you will say, These things must be done because they are right, and some other things must not be done because they are wrong.",
