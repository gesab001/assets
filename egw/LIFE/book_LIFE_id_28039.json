    "word": "Let little companies meet together to study the Scriptures. You will lose nothing by this, but will gain much. Angels of God will be in your gathering, and as you feed upon the bread of life, you will receive spiritual sinew and muscle. You will be feeding, as it were, upon the leaves of the tree of life. By this means only can you maintain your integrity. Fidelity to Jesus Christ will ensure a most precious reward. Let each soul strive for eternal life, acknowledging Christ in word and spirit. He has pledged His word that He will acknowledge you and me, gladly, heartily, joyously, before His heavenly Father. Is not this worth striving for? See what you can do personally to be true to principle, to maintain uncorruptness in every phase of your life; and you will behold His glory. I have a great interest in you. I desire that you may be acknowledged in the heavenly courts as true, faithful witnesses for Christ, faithful witnesses of the truth of the third angel's message.--Letter 2, 1900, pp. 1-4. (To W. C. Sisley and wife, Jan. 3, 1900, written from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong.)",
