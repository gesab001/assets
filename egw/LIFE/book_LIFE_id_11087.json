    "word": "Honesty Essential.--In all the details of life the strictest principles of honesty are to be maintained. These are not the principles which govern our world, for Satan-- deceiver, liar, and oppressor--is the master, and his subjects follow him and carry out his purposes. But Christians serve under a different Master, and their actions must be wrought in God, irrespective of all selfish gain.",
