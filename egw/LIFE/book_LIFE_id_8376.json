    "word": "It is our privilege to carry with us the credentials of our faith,\u2014 love, joy, and peace. When we do this, we shall be able to present the mighty arguments of the cross of Christ. When we learn to walk by faith and not by feeling, we shall have help from God just when we need it, and his peace will come into our hearts. It was this simple life of obedience and trust that Enoch lived. If we learn this lesson of simple trust, ours may be the testimony that he received, that he pleased God. Then instead of mourning and bitter repining, we shall make melody in our hearts to the Lord. \u201cIn the world,\u201d says Christ, \u201cye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d \n     Tuesday morning, Sept. 22.",
