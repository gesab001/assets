    "word": "Scattering From Christ.--Many who profess to gather with Christ are scattering from Him. This is why the church is so weak. Many indulge freely in criticism and accusing. By giving expression to suspicion, jealousy, and discontent, they yield themselves as instruments to Satan. . . . Frivolity, selfish indulgence, and careless indifference on the part of professed Christians are turning away many souls from the path of life.--COL 340, 341 (1900).",
