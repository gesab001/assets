    "word": "The teaching given in regard to what is termed \"holy flesh\" is an error. All may now obtain holy hearts, but it is not correct to claim in this life to have holy flesh. The apostle Paul declares, \"I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing\" (Romans 7:18). To those who have tried so hard to obtain by faith so-called holy flesh, I would say, You cannot obtain it. Not a soul of you has holy flesh now. No human being on the earth has holy flesh. It is an impossibility.",
