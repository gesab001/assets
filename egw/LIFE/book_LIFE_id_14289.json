    "word": "Truth is sacred, divine. It is stronger and more powerful than anything else in the formation of a character after the likeness of Christ. In it there is fullness of joy. When it is cherished in the heart, the love of Christ is preferred to the love of any human being. This is Christianity. This is the love of God in the soul. Thus pure, unadulterated truth occupies the citadel of the being. The words are fulfilled, \"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.\" There is a nobleness in the life of the one who lives and works under the vivifying influence of the truth. . . .",
