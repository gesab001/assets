    "word": "Be clothed with humility as with a garment. Bear no thorns to prick and to bruise others, but make manifest the fruits of the Spirit--\"love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law\" (to condemn). \"And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another\" [Galatians 5:24-26]. In all our work for the Master, we must keep studying His Spirit, His life and character.",
