    "word": "Judicial Oath--I saw that the words of our Lord, \"Swear not at all,\" do not touch the judicial oath. \"Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\" This refers to common conversation. Some exaggerate in their language. Some swear by their own \n                                                                           130\nlife; others swear by their head--as sure as they live; as sure as they have a head. Some take heaven and earth to witness that such things are so. Some hope that God will strike them out of existence if what they are saying is not true. It is this kind of common swearing against which Jesus warns His disciples.--1T 201.",
