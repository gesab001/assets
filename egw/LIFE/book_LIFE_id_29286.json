And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind \n\n\n                                    -315- \n\nthat ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God\"? Here we are positively forbidden to conform to the fashions of the world; yet how few, even of professed Christians, regard this sacred injunction. \n\n                                                                --",
