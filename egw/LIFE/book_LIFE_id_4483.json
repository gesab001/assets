    "word": "I have written many pages today. This morning I received a letter from Mabel Workman [her granddaughter]. About two weeks ago she gave birth to a ten-pound boy, but the little one died two days after his birth. Mabel has passed through a severe experience, but we are thankful that her life has been spared. Both father and mother have felt the trial severely, but they have accepted it as Christians should. Mabel's husband has proved himself to be a true Christian in this time of affliction, and the Lord has sustained them both. They feel that had they not had Mrs. Kress with them at the time, Mabel also might have lost her life. I feel thankful that Sister Kress could be with them; for she has great tact and skill. Had the mother's life been taken, all would have felt the affliction keenly.",
