    "word": "Many are unwilling to put forth the needed effort to obtain a knowledge of the laws of life and the simple \n113\nmeans to be employed for the restoration of health. They do not place themselves in right relation to life. When sickness is the result of their transgression of natural law, they do not seek to correct their errors, and then ask the blessing of God, but they resort to the physicians. If they recover health, they give to drugs and doctors all the honor. They are ever ready to idolize human power and wisdom, seeming to know no other god than the creature, \u2014 dust and ashes.",
