    "word": "Again, from manuscript dated March 17, 1902 (MS-43-'02) I read: \"During the past three nights light has been given me that in the medical missionary work we have lost great advantages by failing to realize the need of a change in our plans in regard to the location of sanitariums. It is the Lord's will that our sanitariums shall be established outside the city. . . The surroundings of a sanitarium should be as attractive as possible. Out-of-doors life is a means of gaining health and happiness. . . In flower gardens and orchards, the sick will find health, cheerfulness, and happy thoughts.",
