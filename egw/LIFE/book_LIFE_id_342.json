    "word": "Marriage does not lessen their usefulness, but strengthens it. They may make that married life a ministry to win souls to Christ; and I know whereof I speak, because for thirty-six years my husband and I were united, and we went everywhere that the Lord said Go. In this matter we know that we have the commendation of God in the marriage relation. Therefore it is a solemn ordinance. . . .",
