    "word": "As soon as human beings are converted by receiving Christ as a personal Saviour, they belong to Him, for He has redeemed them by the sacrifice of His life. He does not give them up to any man. God has not given any man the work of ruling over His heritage. He has given His shepherds direction to feed His sheep and His lambs, but not to whip them or drive them.",
