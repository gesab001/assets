    "word": "Life Not a Romance but a Reality. In the power of God's grace you may obtain most precious victories. You are not to treat your life as a romance, but as a reality. You are to be a laborer together with God in forming a character that He can approve. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\" Does the charge end there? No, no, thank God! \"For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" [Philippians 2:12, 13].",
