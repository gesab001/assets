    "word": "I was instructed that the Lord's will is not being done by the men in the office who grasp such large wages. Things are taking a mold decidedly contrary to the principles upon which the publishing work was established. Serious mistakes have been made in exalting business above the service and worship of God. Thus thousands have made shipwreck of the faith. We are exhorted to be \"not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" We are to be active in our work, but another element is to mingle with this energy, a living zeal in the service of God. We are to be \"fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" Into our daily work we are to bring devotion, piety, godliness. This is to be interwoven with every business transaction. Carry on your business without this and you will make the greatest mistake of your life, for you are committing robbery toward God, while professing to serve Him.",
