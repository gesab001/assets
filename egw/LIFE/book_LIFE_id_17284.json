Death by crucifixion was a slow and lingering process; nature became more and more exhausted until it was difficult to determine when life had become extinct. But for a man dying thus to summon such power of voice and clearness of utterance as Jesus had done, immediately before his death, was such an astonishing event that the Roman officers, experienced in \n                                                                           170\nsuch scenes, marveled greatly; and the centurion who commanded the detachment of soldiers on duty there, immediately declared, \"Truly this was the Son of God.\" Thus three men, differing widely from one another, openly declared their belief in Christ upon the very day of his death --he who commanded the Roman guard, he who bore the cross of his Saviour, and he who died upon the cross by his side.",
