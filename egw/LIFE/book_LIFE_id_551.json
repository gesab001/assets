    "word": "Chap. Sixty-Nine - Courtesy and Kindness\n\n     Courtesy Will Banish Half Life's Ills.--The principle inculcated by the injunction, \"Be kindly affectioned one to another,\" lies at the very foundation of domestic happiness. Christian courtesy should reign in every household. It is cheap, but it has power to soften natures which would grow hard and rough without it. The cultivation of a uniform courtesy, a willingness to do by others as we would like them to do by us, would banish half the ills of life.",
