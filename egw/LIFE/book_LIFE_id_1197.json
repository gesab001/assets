    "word": "Thus it will be in the last days of this earth\u2019s history. Those who today hear the message of truth, but do not believe, will fall amid the moral infidelity, even as in Noah\u2019s day those who were not firmly grounded failed to stand till the end of their probation. When the Lord rewards everyone according to his deeds, these people will understand that God is truth, and that His message would have been their life and salvation if they had accepted the evidence given and practiced the conditions laid down. Then they will see that they might have been saved had they not rejected the only means of salvation.",
