    "word": "God forbid that through lack of discernment, errors should be committed through misunderstanding of my words addressed to you. I have had no other feeling than that of pleasure in knowing that students could come forth from the study of the words of life with minds expanded, elevated, ennobled, with their slumbering powers aroused to engage in the study of the sciences with a keener appreciation. They may become learned as did Daniel, with a purpose to develop and employ every power to glorify God. But it becomes every student to learn of God, who giveth wisdom, how to learn to the best advantage, for all are candidates for immortality.--Letter 67, 1894, pp. 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 (Jan. 18, 1894).",
