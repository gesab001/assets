    "word": "God calls for our cooperation. His requirements are just and reasonable. Shall we not strive to be Christians in life as well as in profession? Shall we not ennoble our lives by the dignity of a steadfast purpose? When we take the name of Christ, we pledge ourselves to be true representatives of Him. We are not to bring into the Christian life our natural and cultivated tendencies to wrong. Christ must be formed within, the hope of glory. Our daily life must become more like the Christ-life. We must be Christians in deed and in truth if we ever see the kingdom of heaven.",
