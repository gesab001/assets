    "word": "MR No. 229 - Hold Fast to Jesus\n\n     I received your letter last Thursday morning, and was made glad to see you coming to the position in which for years in the past the Lord has signified that He would have you. If you will walk in humility, I am sure that your mind will be fruitful in the knowledge of the Scriptures, and that in studying the life of Christ you will have special help through the Holy Spirit in expressing the ideas that are now so precious to you, and that the Lord will open the minds of those who hear, so that they will be able to grasp the precious things found in the Holy Scriptures.--Letter 87, 1894, p. 1. (To Edson and Emma White, June 28, 1894.)",
