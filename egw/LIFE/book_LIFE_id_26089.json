    "word": "Bro. Gage would have died had it not been for the earnest, effectual prayer of faith, put up in his behalf, by those who felt that he was not prepared to die, for God to spare him. Had he died at that time, his case would have been far worse than that of the unenlightened sinner. But God mercifully heard the prayers of his people, and spared Bro. Gage and gave him a new lease of his life, that he might have opportunity to repent of his unfaithfulness and redeem the time. His example had influenced many in Battle Creek in the wrong direction.",
