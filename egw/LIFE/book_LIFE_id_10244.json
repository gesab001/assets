    "word": "Count the Cost \n\n     I have had presented before me the fact that in your class of medical missionary students are those whose first work should be to understand themselves, to count the cost and know when they begin to build whether they are able to finish. Let not God be dishonored by breaking down the man in the process of educating him; for a broken-down, discouraged man is a burden to himself. To think that in any work that he may plan to do God will sustain him, while he piles upon himself studies and subjects himself to exposures that imperil health and life and violate the laws of nature, is contrary to the light that God has given. Nature will not be imposed upon. She will not forgive the injuries done to the wonderful, delicate machinery.",
