    "word": "It is the privilege of every one who has a part in any branch of the Lord's work to know that his sins are forgiven, and to rejoice in the assurance of a higher life in the courts above. This hope is more precious than silver or gold or precious stones. Keep this hope ever bright, and seek to impart it to others. In the knowledge that God's smile rests upon you, your heart will be filled with joy and peace.",
