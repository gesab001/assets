    "word": "Written Independent of Books or Opinions of Others \n\n\n     That which I have written in regard to health was not taken from books or papers. As I related to others the things which I had been shown, the question was asked, \"Have you seen the paper, The Laws of Life or the Water Cure Journal?\" I told them No, I had not seen either of the papers. Said they, \"What you have seen agrees very much with much of their teachings.\" I talked freely with Dr. Lay and many others upon the things which had been shown me in reference to health. I had never seen a  paper treating upon health.",
