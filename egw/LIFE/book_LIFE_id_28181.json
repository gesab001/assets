    "word": "The rulers had chosen Barabbas, and Barabbas they would have as long as life should last. They cried out against Christ, \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" \"His blood be on us, and on our children.\" The blood thus invoked upon themselves would indeed be upon them. The characters they had chosen would ever be their characters. By their life and character they contradicted their grand ceremonies. The words, \"His blood be on us, and on our children,\" would never cease to torture the hearts of the speakers. The blight of God's curse was upon them. Jesus never spurned the true penitent, but He hated hypocrisy cloaked by a garment of religion.",
