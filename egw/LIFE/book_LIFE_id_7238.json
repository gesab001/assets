    "word": "The educated man may exalt himself over his unlearned brother, but he is like the man in the parable who hid his talent in the earth. He has shunned the trouble and exertion necessary to trade with his intrusted talent, that he may be able to return it with increase; and he will be condemned as a slothful servant, and dismissed from the presence of his Lord. But the one who is faithful in the improvement of his talents will return both principal and interest, and will hear the \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant.\u201d [Matthew 25:23.] The man who blesses society and makes a success of life, is the one, whether educated or uneducated, who uses all his \n455\npowers in the service of God and his fellow-men.",
