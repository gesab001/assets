    "word": "True Christianity diffuses love through the whole being. It touches every vital part--the brain, the heart, the helping hands, the feet--enabling men to stand firmly where God requires them to stand. . . . We can, we can, reveal the likeness of our divine Lord. We can know the science of spiritual life. We can glorify God in our bodies and in our spirits, which are His.",
