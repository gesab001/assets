    "word": "\u201cWork out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\u201d God desires us to be faithful in using our capabilities, that there may be continual improvement. Eternal principles are involved in the management of the schools that we establish. They are to bear fruit unto eternal life. All who in any way bear responsibilities in the school work are to glorify the Redeemer by striving to prepare souls to labor in various lines of the work of the Lord. The teachers need adaptability in order to know how to deal with the minds under their direction. This is a special gift that the Lord imparts to those only who realize their need of being imbued day by day with the Holy Spirit.",
