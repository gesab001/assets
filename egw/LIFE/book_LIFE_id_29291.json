    "word": "Christ and the church have claims upon each individual member that their thoughts, their energies, their means, their dress, and their deportment shall correspond with the life and character of Christ. No Christian can conform to fashion. If the Master has entrusted means to them, it was not for them to use to adorn the person or to gratify pride in display.",
