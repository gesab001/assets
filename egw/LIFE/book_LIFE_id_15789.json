    "word": "53-57, 63. Eating of the Tree of Life.--\"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood,\" says Christ, \"hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. . . . It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" This is eating the fruit of the tree of life (MS 112, 1898).",
