    "word": "The word of God is to be the man of our counsel. With pen and voice I proclaim to all who bear credentials, to all licentiates, to all colporteurs, and all canvassers, that the Bible, and the Bible only, studied on your knees, laid up in your heart, and practiced in your life, attended by the Holy Spirit's power, can be your safeguard. It alone can make you righteous and holy and keep you thus. Every human influence is weak and varying unless the truth of God's word is brought home to the soul, and placed upon the throne. Not till this is done, will the heart be sanctified, purified and made holy, a fountain out of which are the issues of life.",
