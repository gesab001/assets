    "word": "Brethren, read your Bibles; study your Bibles. We should be ever grateful to God that by His mercy we possess knowledge. We know our duties. We have the eternal life insurance papers plainly written out. We have every facility provided for us, every endowment of capability for discharging the duties devolving upon us. There is only one way of becoming partakers of the divine nature, of escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust. I beseech of you, Put off all self-importance, for it can be no help to you. And yet you may place a high estimate upon your own characters, for you are bought with a price. \n\n\n                                    -156-",
