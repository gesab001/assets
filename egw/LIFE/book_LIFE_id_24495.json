    "word": "The fifty-eight chapter of Isaiah contains instruction for today. \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sin.\" God does not accept Dr. Kellogg as His laborer, unless he will now break with Satan. The work would not have been hindered as it has been for the past several years if Dr. Kellogg were a converted man. \"Come,\" I call, \"come ye out and be separate from him and his associates whom he has leavened.\" I am now giving the message God has given me, to give to all who claim to believe the truth: \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate,\" else their sin in justifying wrongs and framing deceits will continue to be the ruin of souls. We can not afford to be on the wrong side. We can not afford to cover the truth with scientific problems. We urge that decided changes be made, and no more stumbling-blocks be placed before the feet of the people of God. Let every soul put on the gospel shoes. Let every soul pray and work, placing their feet upon the foundation Christ laid in giving His life for the life of the world.",
