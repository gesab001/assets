    "word": "I speak to the church in Fresno: For Christ's sake, move intelligently. Do not blunder here, when the interest of a church is at stake. I pity Elder Daniels, for the church at Fresno have hurt him by placing him where God should be. His ambition has been fed; self-indulgence and a low condition of piety have brought upon him spiritual feebleness and blindness, and he has become unfitted to be a minister of the gospel of Christ. If you place him in that position, you dishonor the cause of God; for he has surely fallen into the snare of the devil. There is only one way of escape,--he must be converted; he must do just as he has told others to do--repent, confess, make restitution--or he will never see the kingdom of heaven. He must return to his first love, and come out from the darkness of unbelief and skepticism. When he shall have clear convictions once more, when the Holy Spirit shall have dominion over his soul, when love, faith, and child-like simplicity shall be the rule of his life, then he may believe that Christ is dwelling in him, and the people everywhere may believe it too; for they see that he has learned the lessons in the school of Christ. Is this more than God requires?--No, no! Christ demands, in return for the blood he has shed, the heaven he has prepared, nothing less than entire consecration. \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" should be the burden of every prayer.",
