    "word": "The work to be done is plainly specified: \"Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\" Many have heard and received the word of life, and have been strongly moved by the truth, but have allowed their souls to become cold, their faith dim, \n                                                                           353\nthrough self-righteousness, self-importance, and pride in the possession of a knowledge of truth which they fail to practice. The truth which is not put in practice, loses its power. The heart is closed to its divine  influence, and those who should be workers for Christ are idle, and souls whom they might help are left in discouragement and darkness and despair.",
