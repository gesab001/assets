    "word": "Neither is it a light thing to be wanting when the Judge shall sit upon his throne, when the book of life is opened and he turns each page to see the names written in the book, when your names are pronounced as wanting, when the accounts of your life are balanced. No respectable sinners will be passed by in that grand and awful reckoning. The Lord calls upon these self-flatterers to see themselves as they are, and to let his Spirit and his grace work effectually on their heart to bring it unto repentance and contrition. If they do not do this, they fail to fall upon the Rock and be broken; and as the only alternative, the Rock must fall upon them and grind them to powder. The proud heart will do almost anything rather than break. A charge of great guilt stands against you in Battle Creek. This charge from the Spirit of God makes repentance and sorrow and humble confession necessary, whatever your profession or position of responsibility. This work God requires of you before your sins and iniquities can be pardoned. Because your brethren and nominal professors may look upon you as correct and faultless, it is no reason that you are so.",
