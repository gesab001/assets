    "word": "In the country, the education of patients and nurses can be carried on with far less labor than in the city. The atmosphere surrounding the soul will be more healthful. Through His workers, the Life-giver will present to the sick the leaves from the tree of life. The Lord has not abandoned the guilty, disobedient race. He is long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth. \n\n\n                                   -357- \n\nHis invitation of mercy is still sounding. The sick and suffering may come to Him and find life.",
