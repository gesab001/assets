    "word": "This is the only election regarding which the Bible speaks. Fallen in sin, we may become partakers of the divine nature and attain to a knowledge far in advance of any scientific learning. By partaking of the flesh and the blood of our crucified Lord, we shall gain life eternal. In the sixth of John we read: \u201cWhoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life\u201d (John 6:54). \u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\u201d (verse 63).",
