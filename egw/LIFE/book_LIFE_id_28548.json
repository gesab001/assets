    "word": "Oh, what experiences we might gain if we were devoting all our God-given ability to seeking knowledge and spiritual strength from God in the place of devoting our powers to hurting one another. How unsearchable are His judgments. Brethren, love one another as Christ has loved you. How little we really know of sweet communion with God; how little we know of the mysteries of the future life. Let us put our mind on these things. We may know far more than we do know if all our powers are sanctified to discern the blessed features of the character of Christ. There are heights for us to reach, depths of experience to sound, if we are to be the light of the world. Then why dishonor God by contention and strife? Why question and find fault with one another? Why misinterpret and misconstrue the words and acts of your brethren? Is there not better work for you to do than to discourage one another and try to put out the light of your brethren? \n\n\n                                -153-",
