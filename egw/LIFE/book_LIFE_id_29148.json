    "word": "The Word of God is to be your lesson book. Study this Word, and it will become your strength, your fortress, your high tower, your consolation, your instruction, your guide, your sanctification. It is given for your constant growth in holiness. Peter calls the practical application of the Word \"growth in grace.\" Through the study of the Word the whole character may be changed. \"If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things (old ambitions) are passed away; behold, all things are become new\" [2 Corinthians 5:17]. The fruits of the Spirit will be revealed in refinement and true godliness. Selfishness will be purged from the life. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, and gentleness will be revealed in the life.",
