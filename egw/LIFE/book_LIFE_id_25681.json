    "word": "I was told by my Guide, \"Look ye, and behold the \n\n                        -9- \n\nidolatry of my people, to whom I have been speaking, rising up early, and presenting to them their dangers. I looked that they should bring forth fruit.\" There were some who were striving for the mastery, each striving to excel others in the swift running of their bicycles. There was a spirit of strife and contention among them as to which should be the greatest. The spirit was similar to that manifested in the base ball games on the College ground. Said my guide, \"These things are an offense to God. Both near and afar off, souls are perishing for the bread of life and the waters of salvation. When Satan is defeated in one line, he will be all ready with other schemes and plans which will appear attractive and needful and which will absorb money and thought and encourage selfishness, so that he can overcome those who are so easily led into a false and selfish indulgence.",
