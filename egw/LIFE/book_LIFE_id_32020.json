    "word": "The only hope for these men of iron will and hearts of stone is to fall on the Rock and be broken. Contact with Christ brings currents of divine power into the soul, so that the old cherished, natural tendencies, habits, and practises, are changed by the Spirit of God. What they need is a genuine conversion . When they have this experience, these weak, tempted souls will look unto Jesus, and say, \"I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me.\" They need to appreciate every ray of light that comes from the throne of God into their pathway. They need to catch the Spirit and principle of the holy law of God, and conform their life to the character of Christ. A new power takes possession of the new heart. Man can never work out this change for himself. It is a supernatural work, bringing supernatural element into weak and wicked human nature. This power will cast out the devils that possessed the mind and will, and whose power has been revealed even in the words and works of those who claim to be the children of God.",
