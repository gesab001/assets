    "word": "\"Gather up the fragments.\" He who had all the resources of infinity at His command would not waste a fragment! There is to be a gathering of all the words of Christ, and these words as the bread of life are to be given to the multitude. All, however weak they may be, are to consider that Jesus would have them feed the souls who are needy of instruction from the apostles. Speak the truth in love. Let all who comprehend the truth retain the impression made upon their heart which they can be able to repeat to others who did not hear the words.",
