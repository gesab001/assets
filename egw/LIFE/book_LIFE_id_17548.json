    "word": "6. THE TWO-HORNED BEAST APPEARS IN TWO PHASES,--WITH THE GENTLENESS OF A LAMB AND THE FIERCENESS OF THE DRAGON. THIS HAS, TO SOME EXTENT, ALREADY BEEN SHOWN, IN THE INCONSISTENCY OF SENDING FORTH TO THE WORLD THE DOCTRINE OF THE EQUALITY OF ALL MEN IN RESPECT TO NATURAL RIGHTS,--THE RIGHT OF LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS,--AND UPHOLDING BY LAW ALL THE EVILS OF AMERICAN SLAVERY. ALSO, BY PROFESSING TO GRANT THE PRIVILEGE TO ALL TO WORSHIP GOD ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES, AND THEM PERSECUTING THE BAPTISTS AND QUAKERS FOR FOLLOWING THEIR CONSCIENTIOUS CONVICTIONS. BUT THIS WILL BE SHOWN MORE FULLY IN THE FUTURE, WHEN CONGRESS SHALL BE CALLED UPON TO MAKE LAWS CONCERNING RELIGION.",
