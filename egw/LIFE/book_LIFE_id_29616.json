    "word": "We are not to linger about the tomb, as though Christ were there. We are to remember that Christ is a risen Saviour. We have a living Christ; He is not lying in Joseph's new tomb. There are those who are always complaining of something in their life or religious service. Full of complaint, their tongues do great mischief. The Lord does not enjoy our sorrow and tears. He would have us walk before Him in obedience, with grateful thanksgiving.",
