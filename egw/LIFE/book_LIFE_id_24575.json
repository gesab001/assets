The heart must be kept pure and holy, for out of it are the issues of life. If the heart is purified through the obedience to the truth, there will be no selfish preferences, no corrupt motives. There will be no partiality, no hypocrisy; love-sick sentimentalism, whose blighting influence has been felt in all our institutions, will not be developed. Strict guard must be kept, that this curse shall not poison or corrupt our health institutions.-- Ellen G. White \n \n                                                                           1",
