    "word": "Recruits for Unentered Areas.--Many of God's people are to go forth with our publications into places where the third angel's message has never been proclaimed. Our books are to be published in many different languages. With these books, humble, faithful men are to go out as colporteur-evangelists, bearing the truth to those who would otherwise never be enlightened. Those who take up this line of work are to go prepared to do medical \n\n274 \n\nmissionary work. The sick and suffering are to be helped. Many for whom this work of mercy is done will hear and accept the words of life.",
