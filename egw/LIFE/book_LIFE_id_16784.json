    "word": "Jesus did not, like many youth, devote his time to amusement. He studied the word till he became familiar with its sayings. Even in his childhood, his life and all his habits were in harmony with the Scriptures, and he was skilful in their use. When his parents lost him in Jerusalem, he was found sitting among the wise men of the nation, both hearing them and asking them questions. He inquired as one who wished to learn; but in his questions there were gems of light that not only pleased his hearers, but flashed into the Scriptures concerning the Messiah a meaning which these teachers of the law had never before seen. \"And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.\"",
