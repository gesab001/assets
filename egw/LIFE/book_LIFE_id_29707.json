    "word": "The truth is to be brought into the heart and to impress the soul and influence the life and transform the character, subduing the carnal nature. There are ways in which this work can be done through an intelligent knowledge of sin and faith in the message that warns and admonishes and rebukes sin. God conveys important truths to the heart and mind through perception and faith. Satan comes in to evade the work, which an intelligent knowledge of sin will set in operation. He presents subterfuges of deceit and falsehood. This he is doing in your case to make of none effect the workings of the Spirit of God.",
