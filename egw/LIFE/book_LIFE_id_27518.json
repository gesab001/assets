    "word": "This subject has long been neglected. The first seven or ten years of a child's life is the time when lasting impressions for good or for evil are made. What is education? The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The child should be educated to receive the truth in the heart. It should be given instruction which will lead it to see what constitutes sin. It should be taught to see that all sin is an offense toward God. The heart should be carefully guarded; for by giving the life of his dear Son, God has purchased the soul of every child. He would have the precious life that has been redeemed by Jesus Christ moulded and fashioned after the similitude of a palace, that Christ may be enshrined as the king of the soul.",
