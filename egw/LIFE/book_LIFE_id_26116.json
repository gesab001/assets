    "word": "You will certainly bring a reproach upon the cause of God unless you attend to your own personal case. God does not lay upon you any burden for others. It is the nicest work ever committed to mortals to deal \n                                                                           96\nwith minds. You are not qualified for this work; you are ardent, impulsive, and unreasonable. In short, you have not a sound mind; and unless there is a great change in you, you will not be able to so perfect Christian character as to obtain eternal life. You would, with your present spirit, make wonderful discord in Heaven. Your spirit could not unite and harmonize with the pure, heavenly angels in glory. You are blind to your own faults, and your self-sufficient spirit is grievous to the people of God, and hateful in the sight of the Lord. You have a greater work to do for yourself than you can possibly have to do for others.",
