    "word": "Under the symbol of the fig-tree, Christ represents, not the Jews only, but all who have neglected to improve the gifts of Heaven. He has bestowed upon us greater blessings than were granted to his ancient people, and he claims of us fruit corresponding to the gifts bestowed. What is this fruit? It is a pure and holy character; godliness, self-denial for others\u2019 good, meekness and lowliness of heart. Jesus claims penitence, faith, and obedience. He came to leave for men a perfect model of character. He was obedient to all the requirements of his Father. If we follow him, we shall in our life carry out the precepts of God's holy law.",
