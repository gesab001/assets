    "word": "Among the Lord's servants there is to be no commanding. No yokes are to be placed on the necks of God's blood-bought heritage. Every yoke is to be broken. Men and women are more precious in the sight of God than the human mind can estimate. Christ understands their value; for he sacrificed Himself for their redemption. We are his property, the purchase of his life-blood. Sign not away your allegiance to any human jurisdiction or power. \"You are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\"",
