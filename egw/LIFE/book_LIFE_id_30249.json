    "word": "The Lord would have His people come very close to Himself. It is important that everyone who professes to be a child of God should carry the spirit and teachings of Christ into his everyday life. Let us look critically to ourselves [and] compare our characters with the only standard of righteousness, lest we shall make any crooked paths for our feet, and many shall, through our want of faith and intelligent knowledge of the Scriptures, be turned out of the way. We want much more of the love of God in our hearts than we have today. Unless we do have the graces of the Spirit of Christ, we shall be channels of darkness.",
