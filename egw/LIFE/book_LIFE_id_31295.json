    "word": "The question, \"If a man die, shall he live again\"? Job 14:14 has been answered. By bearing the penalty of sin, by going down into the grave, Christ has brightened the tomb for all who die in faith. God in human form has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. In dying He condemned the originator of sin and disloyalty to suffer the penalty of sin-- eternal death.",
