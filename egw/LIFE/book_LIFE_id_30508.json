    "word": "Here at Mountain View there are advantages, great advantages, and the believers should make the most of these advantages. Let nothing be allowed in the life-practice that might prove a hindrance. Let none manifest a disposition to make his fellow men come to his personal ideas of doing this and that. Let none say, I cannot do this, when the providence of God indicates that something should be done. Let all seek to come into line.",
