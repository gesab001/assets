    "word": "O, what a physician may be who is a servant of our Lord Jesus Christ! The light of the glory of God may shine upon the man who thus is a laborer together with God. Christianity in the life in business transactions, in professional practices, will be as a power in the earth. \"Ye are the light of the world\" (Matthew 5:14), said Christ. The leaven of sanctification and holiness must be brought into the life and character. In our publishing house, in our Sanitarium and College, we should watch with the utmost care that we do not act from selfish motives. Life at best is short, and this little period of probation should be pure, lived with an eye single to the glory of God. We should not be double minded, now serving the Lord and again serving selfish purposes in all our plans and actions. The selfishness, the carelessness of spirit that is manifested in regard to the words spoken, the habits indulged, the maxims uttered, are all sowing seed that will yield a baneful harvest.",
