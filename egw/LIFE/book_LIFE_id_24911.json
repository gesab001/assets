    "word": "God has work for every true believer in the Sanitarium. Every nurse of the sick should be a channel of light, receiving light from a divine source, and letting it shine forth to others. The workers are not to ape the customs or fashionable display brought into the Sanitarium, but to consecrate themselves to God,--to be humble, meek, and lowly in heart, pure and elevated in character. Let the atmosphere that surrounds the soul be a savor of life unto life. With some there \n\n\n                    -12- \n\nis too great a desire to be exalted. In seeking self-exaltation they abase themselves. Let self be hid in Christ, and they will be exalted in due time. All who are engaged in the work of the Sanitarium can make themselves a blessing to others by revealing in their own character what a knowledge of the truth has done for them. Let every one feel that precious souls for whom Christ has died are perishing in ignorance and transgression of God's holy law. Let every unbeliever see that you are in God's service, that your faith is the truth that does something for you.",
