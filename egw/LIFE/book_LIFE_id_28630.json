    "word": "Then I was pointed to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. They partook of the forbidden tree, and then the flaming swords were placed around the tree of life, and they were driven out of the garden of Eden lest they should partake of the tree of life and be immortal sinners. I saw that the tree of life was to perpetuate immortality. I heard the angel say, \"Who of the family of Adam have passed those flaming swords and partaken of that tree?\" I heard another angel answer, \"Not one of the family of Adam has passed those flaming swords and partaken of the tree of life; therefore there is not an immortal sinner. The soul that sinneth it shall die an everlasting death, a death that lasts forever, where there is no hope of a resurrection, and then the wrath of God will be appeased.\"",
