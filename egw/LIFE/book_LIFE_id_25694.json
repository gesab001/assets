    "word": "The Lord, in his wisdom, designed to bring his people into a position where they would separate from the world in spirit and practice, then their children would not so readily be led away into idolatry, and become tainted with the prevailing corruptions of this age. It is God's purpose that believing parents and their children should stand forth as living representatives of Christ, candidates for everlasting life. All who are partakers of the divine nature will escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. It is impossible for those who indulge the gratification of appetite to attain to Christian perfection. You cannot arouse the moral sensibilities of your children while you are not careful in the selection of their food. The tables that parents usually prepare for their children are a snare to them. The diet is not simple, and it is not prepared in a healthful manner. The food is frequently rich and fever-producing having a tendency to irritate and excite the tender organs of the stomach. The animal passions are strengthened, while the moral and intellectual are weakened. The lower order of passions bears sway, while the moral \n                                                                           16\nand intellectual are servants to the baser passions. You should study to prepare a simple yet nutritious diet. Rich cakes, rich pies, prepared with spices, of any kind, and flesh-meats, are not the most healthful and nourishing diet. Eggs should not be placed upon your table. They are an injury to your children. Fruits and grains, prepared in the most simple form, are the most healthful, and will impart the greatest amount of nourishment, and, at the same time, the intellect will be unimpaired.",
