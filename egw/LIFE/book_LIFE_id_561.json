    "word": "Mrs. White Was Cheerful in Adversity. [NOTE: IN 1867 ELDER JAMES WHITE, WHO WAS IN A CRITICAL CONDITION FOLLOWING A PARALYTIC STROKE, WAS A PATIENT AT \"OUR HOME,\" IN DANSVILLE, NEW YORK. THE DOCTOR IN CHARGE OF THE INSTITUTION REGARDED RELIGION AS A DEPRESSING INFLUENCE AND ENCOURAGED HIS PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS AMUSEMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING THEM CHEERFUL. MRS. WHITE WAS SOLICITED BY ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS TO MAKE A SUBSCRIPTION FOR A DANCE AND INVITED TO BURY HER SORROWS BY ATTENDING. THE WORDS ABOVE INDICATE THE NATURE OF HER REPLY TO THE SUGGESTION.]--Do you ever see me gloomy, desponding, complaining? I have a faith which forbids this. It is a misconception of the true ideal of Christian character and Christian service that leads to these conclusions. It is the want of genuine religion that produces gloom, despondency, and sadness. Earnest Christians seek to imitate Jesus, for to be Christians is to be Christlike. It will be really essential to have correct conceptions of Christ's life, Christ's habits, that His principles may be reproduced in us who would be Christlike.",
