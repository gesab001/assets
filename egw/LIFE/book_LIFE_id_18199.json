    "word": "The human house, God's building, requires close, watchful guardianship. . . . The physical life is to be carefully educated, cultivated, and developed, that through men and women the divine nature may be revealed in its fullness. God expects men to use the intellect He has given them. He expects them to use every reasoning power for Him. They are to give the conscience the place of supremacy that has been assigned to it. The mental and physical powers, with the affections, are to be so cultivated that they can reach the highest efficiency.--Review and Herald, Nov. 6, 1900. \n                                                                           144",
