    "word": "W. C. White has a special work to do. He can not disconnect himself from this work, for it is his life-blood. It is his inheritance from the Lord. For this work he was born. He can not be at rest in spirit when there are so many important matters needing adjustment; for at such times the developments in the Lord's cause lay upon him a proportionately increased responsibility to discharge faithfully his duties--duties as important and sacred as those of any other man who is called upon to deal with the mental and spiritual interests of his fellow-men.",
