    "word": "Lessons from the Life of Nehemiah \n\n     In years past, I have spoken in favor of the plan of presenting our mission work and its progress before our friends and neighbors, and have referred to the example of Nehemiah. And now I desire to urge our brethren and sisters to study anew the experience of this man of prayer and faith and sound judgment, who made bold to ask his friend, King Artaxerxes, for help with which to advance the interests of God's cause.--MS., \"Consecrated Efforts to Reach Unbelievers,\" June 5, 1914.",
