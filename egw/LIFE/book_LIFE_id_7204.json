    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     The exhortation that Paul gave to Timothy, was, \u201cTake heed,\u201d [1 Timothy 4:16.] first to yourself, and then to the doctrine. Do not let your heart become hardened with sin. It is very important that our youth should begin the work right. You need wisdom from heaven to read the Scriptures aright. The youth should decide the aim, the purpose of their life, and set their standard high; if they have a low standard, they will not rise above that at which they aim. Closely examine your manners and habits. Compare them with the word of God, and then separate from you every wrong habit and indulgence; for God will not hear your prayers if you regard iniquity in your heart. \n387\nChrist has said, \u201cWithout me ye can do nothing.\u201d [John 15:5.] Every one of you wants to be sure that Christ is in you and abiding with you. Then you can do all things.",
