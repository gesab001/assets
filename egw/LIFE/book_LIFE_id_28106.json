    "word": "The knowledge of God comes from the doing of the things required in God's law. The experience thus gained will be proportionate to the development of the life, proportionate to the capacity to receive and to the faithfulness with which the capabilities are used to the glory of God. There is no halfway work about this. Profession and assertion are nothing. Our knowledge will surely be proportionate to our Christlikeness of character. The gaining of this knowledge will be to the receiver eternal life. No \n\n\n                                    -216- \n\nother knowledge can take the place of this. We may have all the knowledge on secular subjects that is within mental reach, but this knowledge does not communicate the mysteries of the higher life. The heavenly calling demands larger, broader, higher capacities. Words can never impart this knowledge. It comes from God. Having gained it, we have passed from spiritual death to spiritual life, knowing Him who is our life, our sanctification, our righteousness.",
