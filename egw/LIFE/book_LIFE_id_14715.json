    "word": "\"Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\"  This is the first commandment with promise.  It is binding upon childhood and youth, upon the middle-aged and the aged.  There is no period in life when children are excused from honoring their parents. This solemn obligation is binding upon every son and daughter, and is one of the conditions to their prolonging their lives upon the land which the Lord will give the faithful.  This is not a subject unworthy of notice, but a matter of vital importance.  The promise is upon condition of obedience.  If you obey, you shall live long in the land which the Lord your God gives you.  If you disobey, you shall not prolong your life in that land.  -- 2T 80,81.",
