    "word": "MR No. 418 - Proper Motivation for Christian Service\n\n     While doing aggressive work in America, remember how much more difficult it is to labor in foreign fields, where our brethren are deprived of many of the advantages that are enjoyed by those laboring in America. The carrying forward of the work in Germany or in any other foreign country demands the sharing of our advantages more freely with them because of the disadvantages in those fields. Remember that charity--love--is true blessedness. Whether in the Old Country or in America, how can our brethren give a better illustration of the fruit of the tree of life than by sharing their advantages with others in more difficult places? Our spiritual blessings will be proportionate to our self-denying works. . . .",
