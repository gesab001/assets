    "word": "Those who do not receive Christ as their personal Saviour, who do not feel the need of his grace upon heart and character, cannot influence those around them for good. Whatever their station in life, they will carry with them an influence that Satan will use in his service. Such lose all hope of eternal life themselves, and by their wrong example lead others astray.",
