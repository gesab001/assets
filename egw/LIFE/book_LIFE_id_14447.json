    "word": "When the enemy is seeking in every way to destroy, shall church members unite with him to discourage a man who is repentant, and is asking for forgiveness?

Enter ye in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\"",
