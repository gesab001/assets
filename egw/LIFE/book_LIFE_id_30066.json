    "word": "We want to be very particular to stand on the very ground on which the Lord wants us to stand--that is, to recognize that all the blessings that we receive come through the mercy and compassion and goodness of our God, while we are undeserving. It is not because we regard ourselves good in many particulars, but it is because \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" It is not one now and then in one hundred or one thousand, in five or ten thousand [who] may have life. No. Whosoever believeth on Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.",
