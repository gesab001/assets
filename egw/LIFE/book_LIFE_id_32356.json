    "word": "There are reasons why we should not put our trust in men who are placed in positions of large responsibility. It is often difficult for them to maintain a humble and teachable spirit. They suppose that their position gives them the power to control their fellows, and they flatter themselves, as did Peter, that they will not fall under temptation. When in the hour of his trial Christ declared to his disciples that they would all forsake him, Peter answered, \"Lord, why can not I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down they life for my sake? Verily, verily I say unto thee, the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.\" Throughout his trial Christ preserved his humility. Peter's self-confident assertion was tested, and he failed to endure the test. He denied his Lord in the hour of temptation.",
