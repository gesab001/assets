    "word": "Those who become children of God are under obligation to Him to do all in their power to seek and to save the lost. . . . The gracious invitation first given by Christ is to be taken up by human voices and sounded throughout the world: \"The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely\" (Revelation 22:17). The church is to say, Come. Every power in the church is to be actively engaged on the side of truth. The followers of Christ are to combine in a strong effort to call the attention of the world to the fast-fulfilling prophecies of the Word of God.",
