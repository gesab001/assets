    "word": "MR No. 450 - Christian Leadership\n\n     David writes: \"I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\" Every movement of the vital organs is the handiwork of God our Creator, and if the human agent will not interfere, the Lord will do His work wisely and well. All that He requires is cooperation with Him, that there may be no disorder in the human mechanism. God would be recognized as the Author of our being. That life He has given us is not to be trifled with. Recklessness in the bodily habits reveals a recklessness of moral character.",
