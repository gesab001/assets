    "word": "To those who comply with the conditions, Come out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean, God's promise is, \u201cI will receive you, and will \n476\nbe a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d [2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.] It is the privilege and the duty of every Christian to have a rich and abundant experience in the things of God. \u201cI am the light of the world,\u201d said Jesus. \u201cHe that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d [John 8:12.] \u201cThe path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\u201d [Proverbs 4:18.] Every step of faith and obedience brings the soul into closer connection with the Light of the world, in whom \u201cthere is no darkness at all.\u201d The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine upon the servants of God, and they are to reflect his rays. As the stars tell us that there is a great light in Heaven with whose glory they are made bright, so Christians are to make it manifest that there is a God on the throne of the universe whose character is worthy of praise and imitation. The graces of his Spirit, the purity and holiness of his character, will be manifest in his witnesses.",
