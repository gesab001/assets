    "word": "It has been a continual cross for me to be so far away from you and friends I love, but when I know that I am in the path of obedience I am happy. Privations are nothing, trials are nothing, distress and anguish of soul for others I can bear without a murmur. Only let me know that I am doing the will of my heavenly Father and I am content. I feel that I would not shrink from any hardship or difficulty if it is for Jesus' sake. I want to understand more clearly the ways of God and the glorious plan of redemption, the extent and limitation of our accountability and the weighty truths of the Word of God. I feel my own nothingness and that Jesus is all and in all. Let us come very near to God, advancing in the divine life step by step. The more grace we receive will enlarge our capacities to apprehend and enjoy greater light, breadth and depth of His love; and we shall have intense longing to know the fulness of that infinite love which passeth knowledge. . . .",
