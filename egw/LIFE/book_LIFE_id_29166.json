When the children ask what these stories \n\n\n                                     -74- \n\nmean, which are so contrary to all they have been taught, the parents answer that they are not true, and yet they continue to place the books before their children.

But no one seems to realize that the ideas presented in these books mislead children, and that the imaginary stories, novels, and fables which are dealt out to feed their minds beget a taste and encourage an appetite for the unreal things of life.",
