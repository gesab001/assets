If they are not prepared to withstand temptations by the practice of the principles of truth, they will fall when Satan tempts them. There are ministers of the Gospel who are too weak to resist temptation. They may have long preached the Gospel, and with marked success; they may have won the confidence of the people, but when they think they are strong, they show that they can not stand alone without being overcome. Unless they govern their habits and passions, unless they keep close to the side of Christ, they will lose eternal life. If ministers are in such danger, physicians are even more so.",
