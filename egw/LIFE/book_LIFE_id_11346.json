    "word": "When Counsel Might Have Saved Independent Youth From Ill-advised Marriages.--When it is too late, they find that they have made a mistake and have imperiled their happiness in this life and the salvation of their souls. They would not admit that anyone knew anything about the matter but themselves, when if counsel had been received, they might have saved themselves years of anxiety and sorrow. But advice is only thrown away on those who are determined to have their own way. Passion carries such individuals over every barrier that reason and judgment can interpose.--RH, Sept 25, 1888. (MYP 459.)",
