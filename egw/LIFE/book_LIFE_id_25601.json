    "word": "The Lord Jesus himself has bridged the gulf that sin has made, and the whole scheme of redemption has been put in operation to restore the moral image of God in man. \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.\" Infinite wisdom is revealed in Christ. He suffered in our stead, that men could have another test and trial to prove whether they would be safe subjects for his kingdom. His blood was our ransom, his death brings life and immortality within our reach. He has risen from the dead, and has ascended on high to intercede for the fallen race. He is now at the right hand of the throne of God,--our Representative before the Father. Whatever was given to Christ--the \"all things\" to supply every need of fallen man--was given to him as the head and representative of humanity. In and through him we are complete in every grace. We share his throne. \"To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become \n\n\n                      -29- \n\nthe sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\"",
