    "word": "Then we shall rightly understand the teaching of God's word, and esteem the truth as the most valuable treasure with which to store the mind. We shall have a constant well-spring of the waters of life. We shall pray as did the psalmist, \"Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,\" [Psalm 119:18.] and shall find as he did that \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is they servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.\" [Psalm 119:9-11.]--Review and Herald, Nov. 24, 1891. \n\n                                               -",
