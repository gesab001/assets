    "word": "Christ has given us no promise of help in bearing today the burdens of tomorrow. He has said, \"My grace is sufficient for thee\" (2 Corinthians 12:9); but, like the manna given in the wilderness, His grace is bestowed daily, for the day's need. Like the hosts of Israel in their pilgrim life, we may find morning by morning the bread of heaven for the day's supply.",
