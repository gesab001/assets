    "word": "Drink deep at the fountain of truth, and be a close student of the Word, for the Lord will take the words of truth and through the Holy Spirit imprint them on your heart that you may present the precious Word with simplicity and fervor. \"Rejoice in the Lord alway: . . .\" that Jesus is glad to receive you with all your imperfections, with all your weakness, and acknowledge you as His child. Therefore, trust Him. Adorn the doctrine of Christ our Saviour by a well-ordered life and a godly conversation. \"Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing\"--that is, be not overanxious-- \"but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.\" What a privilege is this given to every one to trust in Jesus and tell Him everything! \"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus\" (Philippians 4:4-7).",
