Gage can present arguments upon \n                                                                           33\ndoctrinal points, but the practical lessons of sanctification, self-denial, and the cross, he has not experienced in himself. He can speak to the ear, but the truth is not urged home upon the consciences with a deep sense of its solemnity and importance in view of the Judgment, when every case must be decided, because he has not felt the sanctifying influence of these truths upon his own heart, and practiced them in his own life. Bro. Gage had not trained his mind, and his deportment out of meeting was not exemplary. He did not seem to have the burden of the work resting upon him, but was trifling and boyish. He lowered the standard of religion by his example. Sacred and common things were placed on a level.",
