    "word": "\"The night cometh, when no man can work.\" You know not how soon the time will come when your hands will be folded on your breast until you come forth in the resurrection. You know not how soon you may be called. Every day you are to go on a progressive work of sanctification. It is a work of a lifetime. Today we are to sow the fruits of the Spirit of Christ in our own character. His goings forth are prepared as the morning. As you follow on to know the Lord you will understand more and more the light that is in reserve for you.",
