    "word": "How many there are whose lifelong ambition it is to be esteemed great among men, that like Jehoiada they may be inscribed in the city among kings, and have their names handed down as great men. God's great ones have their names registered in the Lamb's book of life; and if they remain faithful to the end they will have a pure, nobler immortality than earth can conceive of. They will have a crown of immortal glory that will never fade away. Then why seek for the honors of earth? Rather, live in such a way that it may be written on your gravestone, \"He hath done good in Israel, both toward God and toward His people.\"",
