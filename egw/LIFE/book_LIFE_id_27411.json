    "word": "By the meekness and lowliness of Christ's earthly life, the exhortation is given, \"Love as brethren,\" as members of the same family. Notwithstanding your dissimilarity in habits and character, \"be pitiful, be courteous.\" True love is not a mere sanction. It does not consist in sentiment alone, it is a principle manifest in works, in noble and unselfish deeds. When God's people are actuated by this love, all plans, all activities will be appreciated as coming from one Source.",
