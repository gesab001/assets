    "word": "There will be astonishing revelations when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened. The Revelator says, \"I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.\" O, I wish that men who filled responsible positions in the Review and Herald Office would carefully study the history of their works during their connection with the Office, and let their unfeigned prayers come up before God that his Holy Spirit shall quicken their consciences and memories. O that they might see the evil of practices utterly opposed to God's holy law, and repent, and confess their sins before it shall be forever too late. They are transgressors \n                                                                           1387\nof the law; he who offends in one point is guilty of all.",
