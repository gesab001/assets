Let this agency refine and ennoble the soul. \n     The Lord would have His ministering servants walk humbly before Him. \n     \"Take My yoke upon you,\" He invites, \"and learn of Me; for I am meek \n     and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls, for My \n     yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" (Ibid.)",
