    "word": "The Child of God a Laborer With God \n\n     All spiritual life is derived from Jesus Christ. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God\" (John 1:12). But what is the sure result of becoming a child of God? The result is that we become laborers together with God. There is a great work to be done for your own soul's salvation, and to qualify you to win others from unbelief to a life sustained by faith in Christ Jesus: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me [with a casual faith?--No, with an abiding faith that works by love and purifies the soul] hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. . . . I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. . . . Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. . . . It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they \n                                                                           138\nwere that believed not, and who should betray him. And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father\" (John 6:47, 48, 51, 53, 54, 63-65).",
