    "word": "The life of Christ is to be carefully meditated upon, and to be constantly studied with a desire to understand the reason He had to come at all. We can form our conclusions only by searching the Scriptures as Christ has enjoined upon us to do, for He says, \u201cThey . . . testify of me.\u201d We may find by searching the Word the virtues of obedience in contrast with the sinfulness of disobedience. \u201cAs by one man\u2019s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.\u201d",
