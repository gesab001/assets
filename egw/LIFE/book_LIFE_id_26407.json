    "word": "Because of so many half-hearted professors, very many youth are inclined to think that religion that needs fun and frolic, jesting and joking, would not be any benefit to them, and the subject of religion is presented in an unfavorable light. Religion should not be made to appear gloomy and unattractive, something calculated to detract from their happiness, making life tasteless and unenjoyable. Those who really enjoy the love of God will have joy and peace. Religion was never designed to make one pleasureless. What can be productive of greater happiness than to enjoy the peace of Christ, the bright sunshine of His presence? Can darkness or discontentment surround your soul? Will dark despair brood over you? Never, while your faith is in Jesus Christ.",
