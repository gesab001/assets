How are their garments defiled? By eating of that which brings disease and infirmity. \"And they shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels\" [verses 4, 5].",
