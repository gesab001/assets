    "word": "God Gives to Each an Individual Work.--Things in the natural world are to be considered and their lesson applied to the spiritual life, the spiritual growth. To every man God--not man--has given his work. This is an individual work--the formation of a character after the divine similitude. The lily is not to strive to be like the rose. There are distinctions in the formation of the flowers and in the fruits, but all derive their peculiar variance from God. All are the Lord's. So it is God's design that even the best of men shall not all be of the same character.--MS 116, 1898.",
