    "word": "Advertise and Publish. \n\n     We must take every justifiable means of bringing the light of truth before the people. The press must be utilized, and every advertising medium employed that will call attention to our work. Let not this be regarded as unessential. On every corner you may see placards and notices calling the minds of the people to various things that are going on, some of them of the most objectionable nature; and shall those who have the light of life fail to place it where men can have access to it? Shall we hide the light under a bushel? To as great an extent as possible let the important discourses given at our camp-meetings be published in the papers; for in this way precious light may be shed on the pathway of many who sit in darkness.",
