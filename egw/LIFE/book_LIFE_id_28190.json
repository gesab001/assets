    "word": "In this work, God's Word will be found a profitable guide. Poverty may bind about the work, because we abide by God's simple truth, but there must be a firm adherence to the truth still. You may have to drop men, but not one thread of truth must be conceded. Said the great Teacher, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\" [Matthew 4:4]. Truth, eternal truth, is to be lived in the daily life. The maxims that the Author of our salvation has given must be \n\n                                  -7- \n\nstrictly adhered to. The living principles are as the leaves of the tree of life, for the healing of human woes.",
