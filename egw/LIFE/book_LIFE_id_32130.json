    "word": "When man educates the appetite to desire the flesh of dead animals and to love wine and strong drink he becomes a body of corruption. Oh, how little God is honored by them, how little He is brought into their thoughts. Gluttony and strong drink degrade the beings who are God's property by creation, His property because He has given His only begotten Son for their redemption. Look at that party of judges, lawyers, and \n\n\n                                  -44- \n\nministers, who claim to be the servants of God and co-workers with Jesus Christ, united at the festive board. Through the indulgence of perverted appetites, they have made themselves a set of driveling fools bereft of reason. And these are men for whom Christ died that it might be possible for them to have a life of usefulness, to wear Christ's yoke, and to show their loyalty to God.",
