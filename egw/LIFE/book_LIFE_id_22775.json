    "word": "Those who will take advantage of the necessities of another prove conclusively that they are not governed by the principles of the gospel of Christ.

Such persons are receiving the impress of the great adversary rather than that of the Spirit of God. But those who shall finally inherit the heavenly kingdom must be transformed by divine grace. They must be pure in heart and life and possess symmetrical characters. . . .",
