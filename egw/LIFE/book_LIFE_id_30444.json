    "word": "To every student I would say: Remember that you are under the rule of God. He has given you opportunity to train yourself for usefulness in His cause. He has given you good teachers and a principal in whom you have confidence. Be careful not to load down these faithful workers with unimportant details that you should attend to yourself. Give special attention to the little things of everyday school life. All these have to do with the formation of character. You may form a character that will make you useful in this world, or you may form one that will make you of no benefit to your fellow men.",
