    "word": "M. S.--59--'12\n Dear Brother -----, \n     In the past you have practiced health reform too rigorously for your own good. Once, when you were very sick, the Lord gave me a message to save your life. You have been too strenuous in restricting your diet to certain articles of food. While I was praying for you, words were given me for you to set you in the right path. The message was sent that you were to allow yourself a more generous diet. The use of flesh-meat was not advised. Directions were given as to the food to be taken. You followed the directions given, rallied, and are still with us.",
