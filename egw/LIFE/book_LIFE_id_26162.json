    "word": "The friends of Bro. Andrews had high expectations of seeing a great ingathering in Rochester; but their expectations have not been realized. The view my husband took in regard to Bro. Andrews' locating at Rochester greatly burdened Bro. Andrews. He prayed over the matter, and nearly sacrificed his life in the struggle, with Rochester friends and his own inclination on one side, and the entreaties of my husband on the other side. The exercise of prayer brought him into a state of great feebleness of body. His sad condition was charged to Bro. White's opposing Bro. Andrews in his staying at Rochester. When the circumstances were taken into the account, with all the Lord had shown in reference to Rochester, Bro. Andrews presumed upon the mercy of God when he asked for clearer light than he already had.",
