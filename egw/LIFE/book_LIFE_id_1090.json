    "word": "Fortify Against Corrupting Influences.--Parents, you have taken the responsibility of bringing children into the world without any voice of theirs, and you are responsible for the lives and souls of your children. They have the attractions of the world to fascinate and allure. You can educate them so as to fortify them against its corrupting influence. You can train them to bear life's responsibilities and to realize their obligations to God, truth, and duty, and the bearing that their actions will have upon their future immortal life.",
