    "word": "Even more than God abhors infidelity, He abhors indifference in religious matters, because religious pretention without genuine religion is a continual stumbling block to sinners. The more cold and formal men are in the religious life, the more they are filled with egotism, and egotism always works against Christ. You may have much knowledge, but unless you are the possessor of true, pure religion, your knowledge is worthless to Christ. . . .",
