    "word": "Reach the Standard. \n\n     O that we might all reach the high standard which God has set before us, and no longer remain dwarfs in the religious life! What beams of light would be reflected to the world in good works, if we should become light-bearers such as God would have us! How many would respond to the light, and in their turn become channels of light to others! In place of standing still, go forward. Instead of complaining, rejoice that Christ has made ample provision for your salvation. It is always hard to do the work of God when you leave Christ out of your experience. Jesus says, \"Without me ye can do nothing;\" but through Christ who strengtheneth us, we can do all things.",
