    "word": "Such a testimony will have an influence upon others. As we seek to turn men from their errors, we must show them that we have something better. When Jesus talked with the Samaritan woman, He did not reprove her for coming to draw from Jacob's well, but he presented something of far greater value. In comparison with Jacob's well He presented the fountain of living waters. \"If thou knewest the gift of God,\" He said, \"and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water. . . Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up unto everlasting life.\"",
