    "word": "We are justified to walk by sight as long as we can, but when we can no longer see the way clearly, then we need to put our hand in our heavenly Father's and let Him lead. There are emergencies in the life of all in which we can neither follow sight nor trust to memory or experience. All we can do is simply to trust and wait. We shall honor God to trust Him because He is our heavenly Father. \"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him\" (Job 13:15). There is no difficulty, no sorrow, no dark future, no impending trouble that cannot be met and conquered by the thought, \"I know that my Redeemer liveth. My Father knoweth the way. He will lead me safely. I have put my hand in His; He will not suffer me to stumble or my feet to slide.\" I want this perfect faith and perfect confidence and unwavering trust.",
