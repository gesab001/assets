Oct. 1, 1909. \n\n                       The Medical Student \n\n\n     While seeking a preparation for his life-work, the medical student should be encouraged to attain the highest possible development of all his powers. His studies, taxing though they are, need not necessarily undermine his physical health, or lessen his enjoyment of spiritual things. Throughout his course of study, he may continually grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth, while at the same time he may be constantly adding the store of knowledge that will make him a wise practitioner.",
