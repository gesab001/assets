    "word": "Educate your children from their babyhood to be cheerful and obedient. Teach them to help you. Tell them that they are a part of the firm, and \n\n\n                                    -326- \n\nthat you need their help, so that you will be spared to care for them. \"Oh,\" say some mothers, \"my children bother me when they try to help me.\" So did mine, but do you think I let them know it? Praise your children. Teach them, line upon line, precept upon precept. This is better than reading novels, better than making calls, better than following the fashions of the world. We shall go through this life but once. We cannot afford to fail of reaching the goal for which Christ has told us to strive.",
