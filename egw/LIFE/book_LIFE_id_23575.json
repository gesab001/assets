This branch of education has been woefully neglected. Many receive diplomas from colleges who have not earned them by gaining an all-round education. Teachers and pupils are apt to skip the important matter of the education of speech. For want of training in this line, students lose much. They go from school to be deficient all through their life experience.--Ms 74, 1897.",
