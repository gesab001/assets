    "word": "If your child had disobeyed you, and committed wrong against you, and that child should come with a breaking heart to ask forgiveness, you know what you would do. You know how quickly you would draw your child to your heart, and assure him that your love was unchanged, and his transgressions forgiven. Are you more merciful than your merciful heavenly Father, who so loved the world that He \"gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\"? (John 3:16). You should go to God as children go to their parents.--Bible Echo, Feb. 1, 1892.",
