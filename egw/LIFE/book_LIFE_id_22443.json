    "word": "I saw that God loves you. The Good Shepherd has tenderly cared for you and preserved you amid your afflictions and sufferings of mind, yet you must yield your will and judgment, and be willing to be taught. None, no not one, can go alone to heaven. God has a people whom He is leading, guiding, and instructing. They must be subject one to another. If one undertakes to go alone, independently, to heaven he will find he has chosen the wrong path that will not lead him to life. . . .",
