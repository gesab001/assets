    "word": "He who wears Christ's yoke sees constantly new beauty and loveliness in the Saviour. He counts self as nothing, for he keeps his eyes fixed on Jesus. He thinks of Jesus and speaks of Jesus. His soul is constantly reaching forward and upward for more distinct views of the One in whom all his hopes of eternal life are centered. Nothing is permitted to eclipse this view. Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, he is changed into the same likeness from glory to glory, from character to character, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.",
