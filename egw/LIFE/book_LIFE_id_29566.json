    "word": "I warn my brethren in the educational work not to allow the threads of fanaticism to be interwoven with the church-school work. Preach and teach the words of eternal life. In establishing church schools, do not move uncertainly. Let the foundation of your building be solid rock, not shifting sand. Before you attempt to educate, be sure that you have a message bearing the divine credentials. No one can teach others of God who does not first learn in the school of Christ. Leave out everything which will divert the mind from the truth as it is in Jesus. \"Preach the Word.\"",
