    "word": "I tell you the things which I have seen, and which are true, that by well-directed, persevering effort there might be many, very many, more souls brought to a knowledge of the truth. O, the end is near! Who is ready for Christ to rise from his throne to put on the garments of vengeance? Whose names are registered in the Lamb's book of life? The names of those only will be there who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. Your erroneous ideas, your objectional phases of character, must be given up, and you must be clothed with the garments of Christ's righteousness. Faith and love, -- how \n\n\n                          - 8 - \n\ndestitute are the churches of these! The heavenly Merchantman counsels you, \"Buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, . . . and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.\" God forbid that those who are preaching in our Conferences should be like the foolish virgins, having lamps, but destitute of the oil of grace which makes the lamp burn and give forth light. O! we want more praying ministers,--men who carry a solemn weight of souls,--men who have a faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Without faith it is impossible to please God. How imperfect is faith in our churches! Why do we not believe that the Lord will do just as he says he will?",
