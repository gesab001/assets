    "word": "Those who argue for the policy plan will not enlighten the suffering one as to the nature and cause of the disease which has seized upon his body. They should, with tact and wise discrimination, with tenderness and love for his soul, open to him the reason of his sickness, and then seek to enlighten his mind, that he may bring his appetite and passions under the control of reason, and find a sure remedy for every malady in Jesus Christ. It is a nice work to deal with diseased and unbalanced minds. When the physician comes to the sick-bed in a listless, careless attitude, looks at the afflicted one with little real concern, and by words or actions leaves the impression that there is not much the matter, and then leaves the patient to his or her own reflections, he has done that invalid positive harm, has wounded and bruised the spirit. The physician should never do this, but should show an interest in \n\n\n                         -28- \n\nthe sick, and inquire into the case; and if he knows what is the trouble, he should frankly state it, and with firm and confident words assure them that he will at once do something for their relief, and that they must co-operate with him by doing all in their power to place themselves in right relations to life.",
