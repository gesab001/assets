    "word": "I am not inclined to go to California Conference unless I decide to spend the winter there, and Marian means to be with me wherever I am \n                                                                           692\nthat we can work together. You know that I have not done any of my book writing to speak of since I came from Europe because of this terrible burden upon my soul of seeing men who are connected with our institutions so blinded by the enemy they cannot distinguish the voice of the True Shepherd from that of a stranger. They gather about their souls garments of unbelief and walk in the sparks of their own kindling. This has nearly broken my heart. With this is accompanied a spirit of iron. There is not the sympathy and love and tenderness of Christ, but an unfeeling heartlessness that is surely satanic in its character. All this has been so presented before me that I no longer feel it to be my duty to labor and wear out my life for this satanic spirit to come in and work with might and main to counteract all that I should attempt to do, either by pen or in letter writing or by voice. When my brethren decide to stand by me and second my efforts, and call things by their right name, then I shall feel that God will have me attend the large gatherings.",
