    "word": "I can sympathize with some of my brethren who have strong feelings but  not strong bodies. I do not know what we would do without men who do feel intensely. God would have them regard the laws of life and health; for when they are exhausted by long speaking and praying, or by much writing, the  enemy takes advantage of the tired condition of their nerves, and causes them  to become impatient and to move rashly. It was after Christ was greatly  reduced by long fasting that Satan thought to gain the victory over him; but  Christ drove him from the field of battle, and came off conqueror. Even so  may those who preach the word overcome their wily foe when they are tempted  in a similar way.",
