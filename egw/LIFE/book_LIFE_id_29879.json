    "word": "Such men as have been losing their spiritual discernment are in a very perilous condition. The Lord calls now for men like Cornelius--men who are taught of Him. Men may have been all their lifetime professing Seventh-day Adventists, but this does not make them true men, sanctified and ennobled through the truth. There are some whose ways are right in their own eyes, and who suppose that they are wise, but they are foolish. They are building their house upon the sand, and when the tempest comes, the house will be swept from beneath them. They will perish because they did not build their foundation upon the solid rock.",
