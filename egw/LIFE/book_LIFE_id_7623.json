The meaning of this fearful denunciation is set forth in the closing chapter of the Revelation: \u201cI testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\u201d [Revelation 22:18,19.]",
