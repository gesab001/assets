    "word": "MR No. 877 - Ellen White Letters to Relatives and Family Members\n\n     Speaking at Open-Air Meetings--My health failed me two months since. I have labored earnestly without rest since last December. I attended two grove meetings, speaking to an interested audience of people. In the last of these meetings the wind blew in the pine and oak trees, making it very difficult for the speaker. My turn came upon the afternoon of first day, when the wind was blowing so strong it was almost impossible to make the voice heard by all the people assembled. I spoke one hour and a half, clear and loud; every word was heard distinctly. Outsiders said there could not be found one man in a thousand that could be heard as distinctly as I was heard. I think the effort was too much. That week I began to fail. (It is the turn of life with me.) I was attacked with palpitation and fainting. Could not stand five minutes upon my feet.--Letter 5, 1867, p. 1. (To Stephen and Sarah Belden, September 24, 1867.)",
