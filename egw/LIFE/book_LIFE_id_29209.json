    "word": "The ten commandments are the expression of God's will. With the finger of God they were written upon tables of stone. Not one was ever to be changed or erased. In all ages and in all countries the commandments are binding upon men. Only as we obey God can we be in harmony with Him. In accordance with His promise, the Lord will work for the highest good of those who He sees can be trusted, in filial obedience, to carry out His plans before the world. He builds, as it were, a wall of defense around them. He prohibits those sins which curse the world and encourages that which is for the good of His people. Obedience to God's commandments is to be taught by ministers in the pulpit and by parents in the home. Upon obedience depends the life and happiness, health and joy, of men, women, and children. Obedience is for their well-being in this life and in the life to come.",
