Suppose that we had not another promise in all the lids of the Scripture. Is not this enough to condemn every soul that has not a living faith in a personal Saviour? Whosoever believeth in Him. He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever--and that whosoever means you and me; it means parents and children. For whom did Christ die? Was it for a select few? It was for the whole world, the world that was fallen because of transgression.",
