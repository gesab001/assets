    "word": "\"Go Work Today\" \n\n     Christ is saying to . . . idlers in the market-place, \"Go work today in My vineyard.\" Angels who minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation, are saying to every true saint, There is work for you to do. \"Go, stand and speak . . . to the people all the words of this life.\" If those addressed would obey this injunction, the Lord would prepare the way before them, putting them in possession of means whereby they could go. If they did no more they could diffuse the knowledge which they already have, and present Jesus as the only Mediator. . . .",
