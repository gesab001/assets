    "word": "Bro. Rumery, the Lord is not willing you should perish, but rather that you should take hold of his strength, and make peace with him by a conformity of your will to the will of the Divine. If a faithful picture of your course in money-getting could be presented before you, you would be terrified. You would be disgusted with your closeness, your penuriousness, your love of money. You would make it the effort of your life to obtain the transforming grace of God which would make you a new man. The means which came to you from relatives was a curse to you. It only increased your money-loving propensity, and was an additional weight to sink you to perdition with your god.",
