    "word": "IV. Spotless Christ Was Perfect Offering \n\n     Christ could not have done this work had He not been personally spotless. Only One who was Himself perfection could be at once the sin bearer and the sin pardoner. He stands before the congregation of His redeemed as their sin-burdened, sin-stained surety, but it is their sins He is bearing. All through His life of humiliation and suffering, from the time that He was born an infant in Bethlehem till He hung on the cross of Calvary, and cried in a voice that shook the universe, \"It is finished,\" the Saviour was pure and spotless.--Manuscript 165, 1899.",
