    "word": "The wicked will finally perish. We do not desire to perish with them. We desire to live a life that measures with the life of God. We desire to see the King in His beauty. We desire to behold the Lord Jesus when He comes with power and great glory. To this end we desire to overcome in every trial, for Christ declares, \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\"",
