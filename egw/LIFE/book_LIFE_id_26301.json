    "word": "We now Discern only Shadow of Important Truth \n\n\n     All who have misconceived opinions and principles because they have entertained them, hold them fast as too precious to yield in order to obtain the most precious knowledge of the true bearing of the Word of God upon all the movements of their daily life. These will lose much which they might have obtained, and that loss will prevent them from advancing in the light which God has given them opportunities to obtain. They have not mental or spiritual appetite to eat and digest; therefore the second advance steps could not be made in following the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.",
