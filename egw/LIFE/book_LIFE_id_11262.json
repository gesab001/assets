    "word": "A Never-Failing Friend.--This is Jesus, the life of every grace, the life of every promise, the life of every ordinance, the life of every blessing. Jesus is the substance, the glory and fragrance, the very life itself. \"He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\" (John 8:12). Then the royal path cast up for the ransomed to walk in is not discouraging darkness. Our pilgrimage would indeed be lonely and painful were it not for Jesus. \"I will not,\" He says, \"leave you comfortless\" (John 14:18). Then let us gather every registered promise. Let us repeat them by day and meditate upon them in the night season, and be happy.--Lt 7, 1892. (2SM 244.)",
