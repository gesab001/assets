    "word": "To you, (words missing from page) as President of the General Conference, and to Brother Evans, President of the General Conference Association, and to Brother Durland, as President of the Michigan Conference, I would say, Continue to work with tact and ability. Get some of these young men and young women to work in the churches. Combine medical missionary work with the proclamation of the third angel's message. Make regular, organized efforts to lift the churches out of the dead level in which they have been for years. Send out into the churches workers who will set the principles of health reform before every church in Michigan. See if the breath of life will not then come into these churches.",
