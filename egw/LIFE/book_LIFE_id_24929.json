    "word": "The world looks favorably on some of our methods and ideas; but we must not let the flattery of the world seduce us. We must not depend upon human favor or patronage for success. Like a mighty cleaver, the truth has taken us out of the quarry of the world to be the peculiar people of God, and we can not afford to assimilate with the world. We must not compromise one principle of the truth, or yield one position, to gain the favor of the world. O for a life consistent with our faith! No portion of the Lord's vineyard has greater possibilities for doing good than the Sanitarium. He has promised that if we follow Christ our Saviour, we shall walk in the light as he is in the light. He desires to show to the world \n\n\n                      -47- \n\nthose who will diffuse the light shining from the cross of Calvary. Above everything else in the institution, the spirit of mercy, compassion, human tenderness,--the gentleness of Christ,--is to be manifested. Worldly policy must not prevail, outward appearances must not be permitted to blind the judgment. The poor must receive special attention, because they have not the good things of this life. If the spirit of Christ is cherished and made manifest in the actions, impressions for good will be made upon those who have received a false education concerning life and its great responsibilities.",
