    "word": "The conversion of souls does not depend on the loud tone or the long discourse, but on the conviction which attends the word spoken, on the inculcation of ideas that are of vital importance in obtaining eternal life. How much better truth is appreciated when spoken in a calm, unexcited way. Ministers should feel the importance of the theme of redemption: and realizing that they are speaking to judgment-bound souls, their voices should be filled with pathos and melody, and the words of eternal life should be spoken with distinctness and impressiveness, that the people may realize the value of the truth.",
