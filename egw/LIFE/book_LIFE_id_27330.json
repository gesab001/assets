    "word": "III. Home Life \n\n     The 1876 letters are important not only for what they tell us about Ellen White's writing and speaking, but also for what they reveal about her home life. Her permanent family of nine members was often greatly augmented by a flood of visitors. On a certain Tuesday she commented casually, \"Yesterday . . . we had sixteen to dinner.\" (Letter 3, 1876). Feeding a large family with frequent guests made her constantly alert as to what could be bought in the market. One letter carries this P.S.: \"It is most glorious weather. Strawberries in market, peas, new potatoes, asparagus, etc.\" (Letter 6, 1876).",
