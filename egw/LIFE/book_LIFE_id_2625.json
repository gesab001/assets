    "word": "In order successfully to carry forward the work to which they had been called, these disciples, differing so widely in natural characteristics, in training, and in habits of life, needed to come into unity of feeling, thought, and action. This unity it was Christ's object to secure. . . . The burden of His labor for them is expressed in His prayer to the Father, \"that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us\" (John 17:21).",
