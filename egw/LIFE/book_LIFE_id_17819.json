    "word": "There is a class of young ladies in this age who are merely useless creatures, only good to breathe, eat, wear, chat, and talk nonsense, while in their fingers they hold a bit of embroidery or crotchet. But few of the youth show real sound judgment and good common sense. They lead a butterfly life, without any special object in view. When this class of worldly associates get together, about all you can hear is a few silly remarks to one another about dress, or some frivolous matter, and then they laugh at their own remarks which they consider very bright. This is frequently done before older people, who can but feel saddened at such lack of reverence for their years. Such seem to have lost all sense of modesty and good manners. Yet the way that they have been instructed leads them to think it the height of gentility.",
