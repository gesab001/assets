    "word": "The Lord is coming in power and great glory. It will then be his work to make a complete separation between the righteous and the wicked. But the oil cannot then \n\n\n                          - 6 - \n\nbe transferred to the vessels of those who have it not. Then shall be fulfilled the words of Christ, \"Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.\" The righteous and the wicked are to be associated together in the work of life. But the Lord reads the character, he discerns who are obedient children, who respect and love his commandments.",
