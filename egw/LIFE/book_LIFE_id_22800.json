    "word": "Our compassionate Redeemer, foreseeing the perils that would surround His followers at this time, has given them special warning: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\u201d\u2014Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 99, 100.",
