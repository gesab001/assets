    "word": "We can, we can reveal the likeness of our divine Lord. We know the science of spiritual life. We can glorify God in our body and in our spirit, which are His. Do we do it? Oh, what an illustrious example we have in the life that Christ lived on this earth. He has shown us what we can accomplish through cooperation with Him. We are to seek for the union with Him of which He speaks when He says, \"Abide in Me, and I in you.\" This union is deeper, stronger, truer, than any other union. The heart must be filled with the grace of Christ. His will must control us, moving us by His love to suffer with those who suffer, to rejoice with those who rejoice, to feel a deep tenderness for everyone in weakness, sorrow, or distress. \n\n\n                                    -334-",
