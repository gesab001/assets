    "word": "It is true that the wheels of domestic machinery will not always run smoothly; there is much to try the patience and tax the strength.

But their condemnation is when circumstances are allowed to rule and to subvert their principle, when they grow tired and unfaithful to their high trust, and neglect their known duty.",
