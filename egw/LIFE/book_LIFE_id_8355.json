    "word": "There the redeemed ones greet those who directed them to the uplifted Saviour. They unite in praising Him who died that human beings might have the life that measures with the life of God. The conflict is over. All tribulation and strife are at an end. Songs of victory fill\n54\nall heaven, as the redeemed stand around the throne of God. All take up the joyful strain, \"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain\" and hath redeemed us to God.",
