    "word": "Adam and Eve and their posterity lost their right to the tree of life because of their disobedience. \"And the Lord God said, Behold the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.\" Adam and Eve transgressed the law of God. This made it necessary for them to be driven from Eden and be separated from the tree of life, to eat of which after their transgression would perpetuate sin. \"Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he \n\n\n                       -32- \n\ndrove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\" Man was dependent upon the tree of life for immortality, and the Lord took these precautions lest men should eat of that tree and \"live forever.\"--become immortal sinners.",
