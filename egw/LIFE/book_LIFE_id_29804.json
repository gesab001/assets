    "word": "W.C.W. and I have walked through the cemetery not far distant. It is an extensive ground and is kept up. Women are hired to water and care for the graves for a small sum from different families. The graves are made shapely--oval--and flowers of every description are planted on these graves. It looks like one beautiful flower garden, but the tombstones and the monuments remind you that you are in the city of the dead, and I look forward in imagination to the time when the trump of God shall sound and all that are in their graves shall hear His voice and come forth, those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.",
