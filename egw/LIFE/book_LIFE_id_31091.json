    "word": "Edson, you are at liberty to select from my writings the matter that is needed for the proposed simple tracts and booklets for the southern field. We send you some articles on the child life of Jesus that may be a help to you. As you will see, they are in two styles. My copyist has little time for the preparation of the simple form, and you may be able, yourself, to simplify in a way that will suit you better. You are the one who can best prepare the matter you need; for you are acquainted with the southern field. You will know how simple to make the truth so as to be understood, and what portions to select. From the light God has given me, many of the white people in that field need the very simplest style. All that can be done, should be done for the southern field. As far as you can, obtain the co-operation of those at the head of the work, that they may not be tempted to think you are starting out on independent schemes.",
