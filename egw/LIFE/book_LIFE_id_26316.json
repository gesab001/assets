    "word": "Fixing the Standard for Physician's Pay \n\n\n     The question as to whether the medical profession is to be controlled by Christian principles in regard to compensation, or by the selfish standard of the world, has long been ignored, but can be ignored no longer. Shall the pure elevating principles of Christianity be exemplified in the physician's life? Shall his practice come under the rule and supervision of the church? Shall he practice self-denial for Christ's sake? or is it only for a few men of more common occupation to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, while merchants, lawyers, and professional men, go free to follow the bent of a selfish will? Is the world to see no representatives of Christianity in the medical profession? and in the men who occupy positions of trust in our institutions? . . .",
