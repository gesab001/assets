We had the small Baptist church, which was about full-seventy in all present; six were outsiders, the rest Sabbathkeepers. Quite a number were from Battle Creek. Elder Corliss opened the meeting and I spoke from the first chapter of 1 Peter, 2-9. The Lord gave me strength and freedom and it was easy talking to these souls that are hungering for the bread of life. Elder Corliss occupied a few minutes speaking to the point. Dr. Lay spoke well a few minutes, then thirty-seven excellent testimonies were borne and all expressed their gratitude for the meeting. The next Sabbath there will be more for they now know I will speak every Sabbath. We had a good meeting.",
