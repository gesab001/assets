    "word": "While Satan is doing his utmost to take advantage of men's ignorance, and to lay the foundation of disease by improper treatment of the body, it is best for those who claim to be the sons and daughters of God to avail themselves, while they can, of the opportunities now presented to gain a knowledge of the human system, and how it may be preserved in health. We are to use every faculty of mind which God has given us. The Lord will not work a miracle to preserve any one in health who will not make an effort to obtain knowledge \n\n\n                     -3- \n\nwithin his reach concerning this wonderful habitation that God has given. By study of the human organism, we are to learn to correct what may be wrong in our habits, and which, if left uncorrected, would bring the sure result, disease and suffering, that make life a burden. The sincerity of our prayers can be proved only by the vigor of our endeavor to obey God's commandments.",
