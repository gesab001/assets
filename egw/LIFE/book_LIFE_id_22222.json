    "word": "I feel very sad as I think of how few there are who show that they have tasted the deep blessedness of communion with a risen, ascended Saviour.

A holy desire to live the life of Christ is to fill our hearts. In Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. In Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.",
