    "word": "The angels, as God's intelligent messengers, were under the yoke of obligation; no personal sacrifice of theirs could atone for fallen man. Christ alone was free from the claims of the law to undertake the redemption of the sinful race. He had power to lay down His life and to take it up again. \"Being in the form of God,\" He \"thought it not robbery to be equal with God\" (SW Sept. 4, 1906).",
