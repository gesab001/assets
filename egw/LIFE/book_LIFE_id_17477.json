    "word": "Spurious sanctification carries with it a boastful, self-righteous spirit which is foreign to the religion of the Bible. Meekness and humility are the fruits of the Spirit. The prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His long life was filled up with noble service for his Master. He was a man \"greatly beloved\" [Daniel 10:11.] of Heaven, and was granted such honors as have rarely been vouchsafed to mortals. Yet his purity of character and unwavering fidelity were equaled only by his humility and contrition. Instead of claiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself with the really sinful of Israel, as he pleaded before God in behalf of his people: \"We do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies.\" \"We have sinned, we have done wickedly.\" And \"for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach.\" He \n                                                                           302\ndeclares, \"I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people.\" [Daniel 9:18, 15, 16, 20.] And when at a later time the Son of God appeared in answer to his prayers to give him instruction, he declares, \"My comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.\" [Daniel 10:8.]",
