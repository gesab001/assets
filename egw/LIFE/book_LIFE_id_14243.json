    "word": "The prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His long life was filled with noble service for his Master. He was a man \"greatly beloved\" (Daniel 10:11) of Heaven. Yet instead of claiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself with the really sinful of Israel as he pleaded before God in behalf of his people: \"We do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.\" \"We have sinned, we have done wickedly\" (chap. 9:18, 15). . . .",
