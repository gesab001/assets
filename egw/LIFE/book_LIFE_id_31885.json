    "word": "I have received letters from different points telling the sad, discouraging results of these things. We have opposition enough from our foes, and we shall have conflicts fierce and strong; let us not now cause Satan to glory because of the pitched battles within our own ranks. The unity for which our Saviour prayed should be brought into our practical life. Peace, the peace of Christ, inspired by truth, and sustained by righteousness, we must each cultivate. God so loved the world, that He manifested His love by giving His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Jesus said, A new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one for another, as I have loved you.\" Let your zeal be manifest, not in exposing your variances but in cultivating the precious plant of love, just as Jesus has told us to do.",
