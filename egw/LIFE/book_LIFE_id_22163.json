    "word": "I would write words to console and comfort you. The Lord has not left you, His everlasting arms are beneath you. He has given you an experience in Christian life that is of the highest value. You have let your light shine in your family, and its divine rays are felt. Yet there is a danger that you will allow your affection for your children to lead you to grant requests that your judgment tells you are neither for their best good nor for the glory of God.",
