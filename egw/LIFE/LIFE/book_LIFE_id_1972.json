    "word": "But while you are to love as brethren, and think soul to soul, heart to heart, life to life, you are individually to lean your whole weight on God.  He will be your support.  He is not pleased when you depend on each other for light and wisdom and direction.  The Lord must be our wisdom.  Individually we must know that He is our sanctification and our redemption.  To Him we may look; in Him we may trust.  He will be to us a present help in every time of need.",
