    "word": "There is a heaven before us, a crown of life to win. But to the overcomer only is the reward given. He who gains heaven must be clothed with the robe of righteousness. \u201cEvery man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\u201d In the character of Christ there was no discord of any kind. And this must be our experience. Our lives must be controlled by the principles that controlled His life.",
