    "word": "The end is near. Every soul will have, in the judgment, exactly the tone of character and morals which they cultivated in this life. Every soul will have in the judgment just that spirit and character they cherished and indulged in their home life, in association with their neighbors, in connection with the members of their own family. And according as they have appreciated the words of Christ, and obeyed them, will be the judgment pronounced upon them by that Man Jesus, who came into the world to give His life a sacrifice for them.--Letter 16e, 1892, p. 10.
