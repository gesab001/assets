    "word": "My brother, is it a strange thing that the Word of God should be fulfilled? This Word has declared just what will be, and now, when this comes to pass, should we act as a church surprised? May the Lord help you to be guarded. Watch unto prayer, and guard your spirit; for God cannot be with you, to help you in overcoming, when you do not seek to overcome but act as the evil one desires you to act. We are now preparing for the future, immortal life. Do not, I beg of you, turn aside to strange doctrines.",
