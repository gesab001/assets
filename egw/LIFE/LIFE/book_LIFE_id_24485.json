    "word": "Men may still learn the things that belong to their peace. Mercy's voice may still be heard, calling, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me: for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" It is only when spiritual life is given, that rest is found, and lasting good is secured. We must be able to say, in storm and tempest, \"My anchor holds.\" He who builds upon any other foundation than that which has been laid, builds upon shifting sand. God calls for a reformation. But he who seeks to bring about a reformation without the aid of the Holy Spirit's reviving power, will find himself adrift. Those who turn from human foolishness and frailty, from man's seductive arts, from Satan's planning, to Christ, the shepherd and bishop of our souls, will stand secure upon the platform of eternal truth.",
