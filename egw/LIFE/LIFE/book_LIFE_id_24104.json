    "word": "As the divine endowment--the power of the Holy Spirit--was given to the disciples, so it will today be given to all who seek aright. This power alone is able to make us wise unto salvation, and to fit us for the courts above. Christ wants to give us a blessing that will make us holy. \"These things have I spoken unto you,\" He says, \"that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full\" (John 15:11). Joy in the Holy Spirit is health-giving, life-giving. In giving us His Spirit, God gives us Himself--a fountain of divine influences, to give health and life to the world.--Signs of the Times, March 15, 1910.",
