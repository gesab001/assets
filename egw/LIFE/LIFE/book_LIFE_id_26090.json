    "word": "The influence of the Jones girls was very bad in Battle Creek. They had not been trained. Their mother had neglected her sacred duty, and had not restrained her children. She had not brought them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord. They had been indulged and shielded from bearing responsibilities until they had no relish for the plain, homely duties of life. The mother had educated the daughters to think much of their dress. But the inward adorning was not exalted before them. These young girls were vain and proud. Their minds were impure. Their conversation was corrupting, and yet a class in B. C. would associate with this stamp of minds, and they could not associate with them without coming down to their level. They were not dealt as severely with as their case demanded. They love the society of the young men, and the young men are the theme of their meditation, and of their conversation. These girls have corrupted manners; they were headstrong and self-confident.",
