    "word": "I am thankful that yesterday I have the courage to walk out in faith and speak to our people assembled at the sanitarium on the hillside. This is the first time for a number of weeks that I have felt able to attempt to speak. The sanitarium chapel is being enlarged, and the meeting was held outside under the trees. I spoke from the third chapter of Revelation. Here is a picture of the spiritual life of many, and precious promises held out to the overcomer. I was able to make all hear, and felt a rich blessing myself in putting forth the effort.",
