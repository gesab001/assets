    "word": "But the enemy will try to cast his dark shadow between our souls and God. He presents every possible inducement to lead us to be false to our Maker. He tries to gain control of the appetite, so that men and women shall make a god of the stomach. He knows that if they do this, their senses will become beclouded by overeating. He offers them stimulants and narcotics, hoping to lead them, in the use of these things, to forget God. Let us remember that these are the devices of the enemy to lead us to forget the advantages we may gain by every day eating the Bread of life.",
