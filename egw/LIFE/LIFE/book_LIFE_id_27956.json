    "word": "MR No. 894 - The Sydney Sanitarium\n\n     Wahroonga an Ideal Location for the Sanitarium--Our brethren have selected a site for our new sanitarium. It is about thirteen miles from Sydney, and is in an excellent, healthful location. The altitude is about six hundred feet, and the place receives the cool, life-giving breeze from the sea. Thus, while in the low-lying towns the atmosphere is impure, hot, and oppressive, here it is pure, cool, and refreshing. Excellent roads, and beautiful, picturesque scenery afford opportunity for pleasant drives. Freedom from the dust and the smoke, the din and the confusion, of the city will be most grateful to the brain-weary and the sick.",
