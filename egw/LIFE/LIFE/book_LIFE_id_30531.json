    "word": "Dr. Kellogg is in danger of gathering altogether too many burdens. His influence is to be decidedly felt in the Sanitarium. It is needed there more largely, and with his workers he is to continue to exert the influence on the people that he has exerted in the past. The extra burdens he takes endanger his usefulness. The Lord would have Dr. Kellogg preserve his life, that he may do the work and exert the influence needed in the management of the Sanitarium. His voice can do more at times than the voices of ten of his co-workers. There are wheels within wheels, and it is not a small matter to keep these wheels in such order that they can accomplish the work.",
