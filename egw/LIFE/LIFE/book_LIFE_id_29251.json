    "word": "The people of God are to love as brethren and sisters. They are to be kind and courteous. They are to forgive one another as Christ has forgiven them. They are to follow His example in all things; for their life is hid with Him in God. My brethren and sisters, consider the possibilities of such a life. Christian unity is a grand and wonderful thing. Strive for it. \"As He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. . . . Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever\" [1 Peter 1:15, 22, 23].",
