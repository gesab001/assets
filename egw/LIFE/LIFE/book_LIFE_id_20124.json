    "word": "I entreat you to make earnest work for eternal life. Break the snare of Satan; work against his devices. Let this be the language of your soul. \"There is nothing in the universe that I fear so much as that I shall not know all my duty, or that, knowing, I shall fail to do it.\" \"Stand up for Jesus\" were the words of a dying saint. Yes, Brother I, stand up for Jesus. It will take all to do this. You may have to change your position in the world; but a name, distinction, office, are to you a snare, imperiling your soul. A calculating, worldly wisdom is continually seeking to turn you away from the Saviour. A bold, defiant, blasphemous infidelity will attempt to crush His gospel, not only out of your own soul, but out of the world. But stand up for Jesus. In the presence of your relatives and friends, in all your business relations, in your associations with the world,--anywhere and everywhere, under all circumstances,--stand up for Jesus. \n\n                                               -",
