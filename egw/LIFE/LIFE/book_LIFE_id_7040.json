    "word": "Consecration to the Work\n     God selected Abraham as his messenger, through whom to communicate light to the world. The word of God came to him, not with the presentation of flattering prospects in this life, of large salary, of great appreciation and worldly honor. \u201cGet thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee,\u201d [Genesis 12:1.] was the divine message to Abraham. The patriarch obeyed, and \u201cwent out, not knowing whither he went,\u201d [Hebrews 11:8] as God's light-bearer, to keep his name alive in the earth. He forsook his country, his home, his relatives, and all pleasant associations connected with his early life, to become a pilgrim and a stranger.",
