    "word": "You who have educated yourselves in a love of criticism have lost the love of beauty and holiness out of your lives. Arouse, and rid yourselves of these hindrances to progress in the Christian life. When you feel disposed to criticize the work of some of your brethren, take hold yourselves of the hardest work you can find to be done, and do it in Christ's name. This you will find to be a most valuable education.",
