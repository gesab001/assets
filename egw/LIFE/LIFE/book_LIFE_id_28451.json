    "word": "(Diary entry for Nov. 26, 1904, San Diego, Calif.) I have not been able to sleep after one o'clock a.m. It is Sabbath day. I am this day 77 years old. I have thinking to do and I have reason to thank the Lord that \n\n\n                                 -222- \n\nHe has spared my life. I am pleased that the Lord has favored me with His encouraging grace. I have been sick for more than one week with influenza. Have kept [closely to] my room much of the time. I have been repenting during this more than a week of suffering. My throat and lungs have often been under congestion; my cough is hard and dry; [I] expectorate but little. My labors have been quite taxing, and the Lord has greatly blessed me.",
