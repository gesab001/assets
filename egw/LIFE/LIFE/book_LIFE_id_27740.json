    "word": "When, after the resurrection and ascension of Christ, the words spoken to them from lips human and divine, were fulfilled, the apostles related the scenes of His [Christ's] life experience, and the wonderful truths of His life became their experience, and awoke their slumbering senses. The word, bearing testimony by the disciples, the men of His appointment, awoke them as from a trance, and they proclaimed after the words were spoken, repeating the same words, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. . . . And of His fulness have we all received, and grace for grace\" (John 1:14). --Ms. 63, 1900. (Untitled Manuscript, October 2, 1900.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 17, 1980.",
