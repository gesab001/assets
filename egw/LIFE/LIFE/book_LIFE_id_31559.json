    "word": "We are to take heed to the warning: \"Enter ye in at the straight gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat; because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth into life, and few there be that find it.\" Those who walk in the narrow way are following in the footprints of Jesus. The light from heaven illuminates their path.",
