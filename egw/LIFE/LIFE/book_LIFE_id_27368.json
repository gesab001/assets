    "word": "In this age of the world it is important for every family to understand the science of life. The wonderful machinery of the human body is supplied by the Lord and is kept in motion by Him. It is the human agent's part to keep this machinery in a state of purity and soundness. To do this, an intelligent knowledge of every part is required. It is a great responsibility to care properly for all the God-given faculties, to keep the entire system in as complete order as possible.--Ms 113, 1901, pp. 3, 4.
