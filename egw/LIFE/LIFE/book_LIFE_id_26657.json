    "word": "Heart, Beats Independent of Human Will.--You have been bought with a price, by the death of the only begotten Son of God. Your heart beats on. On that pulsation depends your life. Its beating is independent of your will. You eat and sleep in careless indifference. But God's guardian care over you is unceasing. He controls the ebb and flow of the vital current. Where is your gratitude that should rise from human lips for His preserving care?--Letter 32, 1907.",
