    "word": "Complete subjection through Christ to the will of God is our only safety. The selfish thoughts and impulses that sweep through the soul, producing discordant notes, can be separated from the life only as the whole being is under the control of Christ. The Saviour's words to all unruly elements is, \"Peace, be still.\" Christ welcomes all who accept Him as their Saviour, and rules over them as their king. . . . Our zeal for the advancement of God's kingdom is to mark us as faithful subjects of the cross of Christ. God can trust as His representatives those who implicitly obey Him.",
