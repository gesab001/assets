    "word": "\"Hereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. . . My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him. . . And this is His commandment, That we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another; for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because God sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.",
