    "word": "The Lord has placed you in a position where you can bear responsibilities, if you have that wisdom gained from on high by most earnest prayer and humility of soul. God will hear your supplications if you will seek Him earnestly. You have at times made some excellent movements. But again, you are in danger, by your impressions and prejudices, of creating difficulties hard to remedy. Link up with men older and more experienced than yourself, men who can give you advice and counsel, even if you are a physician. Do not feel that it is your work to manage the sanitariums which may be established in Australia. When you reveal by your life and influence that you consider, that you ask wisdom of God, that you have gained an experience different from the experience which you have had in the past, you will be a man who can be depended on in emergencies.",
