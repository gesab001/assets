    "word": "In all the details of life the strictest principles of honesty are to be maintained. These are not the principles which govern our world, for Satan\u2014deceiver, liar, and oppressor\u2014is the master, and his subjects follow him and carry out his purposes. But Christians serve under a different Master, and their actions must be wrought in God, irrespective of all selfish gain.",
