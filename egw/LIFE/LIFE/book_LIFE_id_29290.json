    "word": "John was listened to with great interest. His doctrine melted their hearts and revived their hopes. It was a strangely sweet message which was borne to them, and the seed was falling into good soil. Never before had such doctrines fallen upon their ears. He drew his followers away from outward forms, away from self-righteousness, toward Jesus. He made them feel that in Christ alone were centered all their hopes of eternal life. Christ and Him crucified was the burden of his message. \n\n                                                                --",
