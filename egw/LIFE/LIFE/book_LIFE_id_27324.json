    "word": "After a time I slept, and in my dreams I seemed to be listening to One who was bearing testimony before our brethren in responsible positions. The words He spoke were so decided and straight, that it seemed to some present as if His representations could not be true of all present. Some were deeply moved, while others were deeply mortified that their course of action should be presented as it was. This latter class had not a right comprehension of true religion. They had not been drinking deep draughts from the fountain of Christ's sympathy and tenderness and love. They had a low estimate of what \n\n\n                                        -273- \n\nthe Christian life should be, and they were hurt and offended at the word spoken.",
