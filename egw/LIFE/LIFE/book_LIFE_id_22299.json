    "word": "Thank the Lord, your heart has been quickened, because you have been privileged to see some rays of light from the heavenly messengers. You can see how much you can do to help your mother and the other members of the family. A Christian is one who is daily learning of Christ, taking up the little duties of life, bearing others' burdens. Thus you will have union with Christ.--Letter 82, May 31, 1900, to Elsie Atkins, a youthful church member in Australia.",
