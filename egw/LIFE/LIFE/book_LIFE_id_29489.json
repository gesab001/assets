    "word": "There are precious experiences for the youth to gain if they will die to self, but if they cherish and exalt self, Christ will not work with or for them. He will permit them to exhibit how little there is of them in their pride and haughtiness and spiritual poverty. Christ says: \"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.\"",
