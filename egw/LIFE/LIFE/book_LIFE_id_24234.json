    "word": "But I thought as I read in your letter that such a building would cost only $-----. O, if we could get such a house in some of our cities that have nothing, how glad we would be! But the patronage of the Sanitarium would, it appears to me, justify the investment of means in a house for God's worship where invalids would be accommodated without having to leave the buildings. They would realize much greater good from the services in such a place. I hope that none will consider these words as contradictory to the former testimonies I have borne, and feel at liberty to disregard the light that God has given. This counsel is in harmony with that light. Those who visit the Sanitarium will see that it is a place where God is honored and worshiped, and many souls may hear the word of life, the precious truth of God, that otherwise might never hear the truth. The sick and suffering ones should have every advantage possible in religious facilities, to win them away from the attractions of Satan, to Jesus Christ. In the chapel let the words of truth be spoken, and the Scriptures be opened to the people in simplicity. Reach the people with the gospel where they are. Jesus will be with you to impress minds and hearts. Nothing should be left undone that can be done to relieve these afflicted souls, and win them to Jesus. \n\n\n                          - 14 -",
