    "word": "Take the Word of God, and kneeling before God, ask, What has God spoken to me from His Word? Wait before the Lord to learn the way in which you are to go.... You may learn of the heavenly Teacher His meekness and lowliness of heart. In His strength be steadfast, and stand in opposition to all that is displeasing to God, and encourage all that is right, and pure, and true. Live a life that Jesus, your heavenly Father, and the angelic host can look upon with favor. . . .",
