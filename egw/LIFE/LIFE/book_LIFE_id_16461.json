    "word": "With this class there is only one remedy,--positive self-control under all circumstances. The effort to get into a favorable place, where self will not be annoyed, may succeed for a time; but Satan knows where to find these poor souls, and will assail them in their weak points again and again. They will be continually troubled so long as they think so much of self. . . . But there is hope for them. Let this life, so stormy with conflicts and worries, be brought into connection with Christ, and then self will no longer clamor for the supremacy. . . . They should humble themselves, saying frankly, \"I have done wrong. Will you forgive me? For God has said we must not let the sun go down upon our wrath.\" This is the only safe path toward overcoming. Many . . . nurse their wrath, and are filled with revengeful, hateful feelings. . . . Resist these wrong feelings, and you will experience a great change in your association with your fellowmen.",
