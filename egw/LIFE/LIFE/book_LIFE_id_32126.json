    "word": "Every minister who preaches the gospel to the people should study the laws of physical health. He should carefully consider what effect eating and drinking have upon the health of the soul. By precept and example, by a life of obedience to nature's laws, he can present the truth in a favorable manner. The teachers and workers in our sanitariums should not only preach, but practice, abstinence from food which stimulates fleshly lusts which war against the soul.",
