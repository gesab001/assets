    "word": "The Lord will be with you. He is your ever-present Helper, and you may know He will never leave nor forsake you. You should have the best of care, and live your time in this world, until the quiet rest, in full hope of the overcomer's reward. Just rest yourself in your belief of the truth. Do not worry about anything. You have kept the faith, and for you is laid up a crown of life, which Christ, the righteous Judge, shall give you at that day, and not to you only, but to all them who love His appearing (see 2 Timothy 4:8).",
