    "word": "From the park we went to our vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco, where we received an invitation to take dinner. Here we found in a narrow building tables set to accommodate as many as possible; but many who desired to come in were obliged to turn away. The plain, simple food placed before the guests was fully in accordance with the sign placed in the only window in the room--Vegetarian Restaurant. There was on the table not a particle of meat, poultry, or anything that has animal life, and yet everything was palatable and acceptable. Our party enjoyed the wholesome, substantial food. The neat appearance of the waitresses, with their dark dresses covered with white aprons, was very pleasant.",
