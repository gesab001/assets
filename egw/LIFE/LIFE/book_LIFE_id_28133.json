    "word": "We must obtain that measure of the grace of Christ that will enable us to dwell together in love and unity in this life, else we can never dwell together in the life to come. I am trying to show our people the need of the unity for which Christ prayed. The soul must fully own the power and authority of the Word of God. Christ, the perfect example, is ever before us. To Him we may look for grace and power to overcome every fault. We are to get ready for the great day of God by carrying out in the daily life the perfect principles presented to us in the life of Christ. We are called by Him to be His representatives. We are God's children. By spiritual adoption we become His sons and daughters. We are to live in conformity to His will, representing Him in life and character.",
