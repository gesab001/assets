    "word": "When ministers are so interested in the work that they love it as a part of their existence, then they can say, \u201cWho shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, \n68\nshall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d [Romans 8:35-39.]",
