    "word": "Oakland, Cal., April 24, 1888 \n\n     Dear Brother and Sister: At times I feel much burdened on your account. I am fearful that you will not keep self under control, that you will not move discreetly in all things, and so lose the confidence of your brethren. I do not wish them to feel at one time that you are a man of great value, because you are led and taught of God, and at another time to be disappointed in you, because of your unconsecrated life, and your great want of spiritual wisdom. I want you to preserve your influence with the people, and I know that you can do it if you put the power of your will on the right side; if you will ever feel your weakness, and the necessity of constant help from God.",
