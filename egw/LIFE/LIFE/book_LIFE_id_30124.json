    "word": "The question is asked by the lawyer that came to Christ, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\"--this very inheritance that He had been presenting to him . Well now, there stood the frowning Pharisees; there stood the rabbis; there stood the priests and the rulers of the synagogue, and they hoped to catch something from the answer that they could use, that they might condemn Christ, the world's Redeemer, the mighty Healer, the greatest Teacher that the world ever knew. Christ read their heart and their purposes, and what did He do? He turned back upon the lawyer himself the labor of answering that question. He said, \"What is written in the law? How readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with\"-nine tenths of your heart? two-thirds? one-half? one quarter?--\"thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind\" [Luke 10:25-27]. This takes intellect; this takes reason; this takes education, ability; and it takes all there is of man. \n\n\n                                      -255-",
