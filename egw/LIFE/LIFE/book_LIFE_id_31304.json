    "word": "When brought in contact with the higher classes of society, let not the physician feel that he must conceal the peculiar characteristics which sanctification through the truth gives him. The physicians who unite with the work of God are to cooperate with God as His appointed instrumentalities: they are to give all their power and efficiency to magnifying the work of God's commandment-keeping people. These who in their human wisdom try to conceal the peculiar characteristics that distinguish God's people from the world will lose their spiritual life, and will no longer be upheld by His power.",
