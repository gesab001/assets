    "word": "I long for it; yes, and I am willing to spend to the last that which I shall accumulate, that I may recover souls that are ready to perish. All the value there is in money to me is to invest it in the treasures of God, that He may have meat in His house, that when missionaries are called to lift the standard in the places that know not God He shall not find an empty treasury because men spend God's money for liquor and tobacco--ten, twenty, a thousand times more in eating and in drinking these things that are taking the underpinning out from their house, which are obliterating the image of God in man, which are creating disease and infirmity and imbecility, and shortening the existence of men years, that they might [not] use their God-given life to the glory of God. Why, it is God's money. He has seen fit in His providence to open the way before me that I could have a little of His money to use for His treasury, and to carry the truth to the people that are ready to perish.",
