ALTHOUGH NOT HERSELF A SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST, SHE SERVED FOR A TIME AS MRS. WHITE'S LITERARY ASSISTANT, AND, DURING HER TRAVELS, AS A PUBLICITY AGENT, WRITING ARTICLES FOR LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ABOUT MRS. WHITE'S SERMONS AND TEMPERANCE LECTURES.] and I will do all we can to forward the work of my writings. I cannot see any light shining to Michigan for me. [ON MARCH 22, JAMES WHITE LEFT OAKLAND FOR A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE AT BATTLE CREEK. HE AND HIS WIFE WERE SEPARATED FOR SIXTY-SIX DAYS, UNTIL THEY MET AGAIN ON MAY 27 AT THE KANSAS CAMP MEETING. DURING THIS 66-DAY PERIOD, MRS. WHITE IN PARTICULAR REALLY KEPT THE POSTMAN BUSY. SHE WROTE HER HUSBAND PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY. ON APRIL 11, SHE PROMISED HIM, \"I WILL WRITE EVERY MORNING,\" AND THEN ASKED, \"WILL YOU DO THE SAME\"? (LETTER 5, 1876).--R. W. OLSON INTRODUCTION TO MS. RELEASE #483, \"THE SPIRIT OF 1876.\"] This year I feel that my work is writing. I must be secluded, stay right here, and I must not let inclination or persuasion of others shake my resolution to keep closely to my work until it is done. God will help me if I trust in Him.--Letter 63, 1876, p. 2. (To James White, March 25, 1876.)",
