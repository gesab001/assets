    "word": "When Sanctification Is Impossible \n\n                                    Health Reformer, March, 1878 \n     52. A large proportion of all the infirmities that afflict the human family, are the results of their own wrong habits, because of their willing ignorance, or of their disregard of the light which God has given in relation to the laws of their being. It is not possible for us to glorify God while living in violation of the laws of life. The heart cannot possibly maintain consecration to God while lustful appetite is indulged. A diseased body and disordered intellect, because of continual indulgence in hurtful lust, make sanctification of the body and spirit impossible. The apostle understood the importance of the healthful conditions of the body for the successful perfection of Christian character. He says, \"I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\" He mentions the fruit of the Spirit, among which is temperance. \"They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.\" \n     [IMPOSSIBILITY OF ATTAINING CHRISTIAN PERFECTION WHILE GIVING REINS TO APPETITE--356]",
