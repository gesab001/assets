    "word": "Some seem to think that all that God has called messengers into the field for, is to go at their bidding and to carry them in their arms; and that the most important part of their work is to settle the petty trials and difficulties which they have brought upon themselves by injudicious moves, and by giving way to the enemy, and indulging an unyielding, faultfinding spirit toward those around them. But where are the hungry sheep at this time? Starving for the bread of life. Those who know the truth and have been established in it, but obey it not--if they did, they would be saved many of these trials--are holding the messengers, and the very object for which God has called them into the field is not accomplished. The servants of God are grieved and their courage taken away by such things in the church, when all should strive not to add a feather's weight to their burden, but by cheering words and the prayer of faith, should help them. How much more free would they be if all who profess the truth would look about them and try to help others, instead of claiming so much help themselves. As it is, when the servants of God enter dark places, where the truth has not yet been proclaimed, they carry a wounded spirit caused by the needless trials of their brethren. \n                                                                           107\nIn addition to all this, they have to meet the unbelief and prejudice of opposers and be trampled upon by some.",
