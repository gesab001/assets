I greatly desire that you shall prosper in all that you undertake. I am interested in everyone that is connected with you. My heart is drawn out in deep interest for every soul for whom Christ has given His precious life. I received a letter from Brother Palmer, and as I read it I was impressed that you would need to move carefully. I thought that you had abundant opportunity to exercise great patience and forbearance, and not cherish any feelings of dislike to those who would hurt your souls.",
