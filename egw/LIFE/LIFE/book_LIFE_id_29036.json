    "word": "MR No. 1340 - Living The Christ-Life Amid Corrupt Surroundings\n\n      (Written February 10, 1887, from Basel, Switzerland, to Henri Frey.) \n\n     I am burdened in regard to your case. I view you as in a perilous condition. You have not as yet seen your true standing before God. You are not closely connected with God. My text this morning was for yourself and a few others who are in the same condition spiritually as you are. You cannot do justice to the work in which you are engaged because you do not bring the wisdom of God into your labor.",
