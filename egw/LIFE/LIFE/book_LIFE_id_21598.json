    "word": "In Luke 4:16-19, Christ announces His mission and work for the world: \"And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up, and as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written: \"The spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor: He hath sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\" Jesus Himself became man's ransom, his liberator from the oppressive power of Satan. \"Ye are not your own,\" He says, \"for ye are bought with a price.\" We are bought from a power whose slaves we were. And the price our ransom cost was the only begotten Son of God. His blood alone could ransom guilty man. \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
