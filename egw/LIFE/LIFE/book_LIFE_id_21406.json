    "word": "Each one must hunger and thirst after righteousness for himself. Leaning upon men, and trusting in their wisdom, is dangerous to the spiritual life of any Christian.

But if, individually, we are endeavoring to walk in the footsteps of Christ, we can follow Him as well as those whom we admire for their consistent, humble lives.",
