    "word": "I wish we could appreciate more fully the value of the lesson taught by the miracle of feeding the five thousand. He who makes it his lifework to labor together with God, not apart from Him, is carrying out the purposes of Christ. It is only such who are fit to be entrusted with the work of dealing with human minds. Those who are not partakers of the divine nature cannot properly estimate the value of the human soul. They do not share in \n\n\n                                -71- \n\nChrist's deep, earnest longing for the souls which cost such an immense price. They have not a personal piety. They cannot be trusted to work in Christ's lines, to lift up, not to tear down; to encourage, not to depress; to restore, not to mar and deface by their own imperfection. They are not safe, accurate judges of the necessities of the soul. They have not the pure, unselfish Spirit of Christ, and therefore they are not qualified to judge of human merit in cases that present peculiar difficulties.",
