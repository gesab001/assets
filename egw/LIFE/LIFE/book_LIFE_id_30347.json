    "word": "Christ says, \"I am the bread of life.... Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day\" [John 6:35, 54]. It is our privilege to eat the bread of life. Christ says, \"The flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" [verse 63]. As we believe and practice the words of Christ, bringing them into the everyday experience, we become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\"",
