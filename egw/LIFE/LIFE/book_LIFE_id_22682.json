    "word": "When the gospel is received in its purity and power, it is a cure for the maladies that originated in sin. The Sun of Righteousness arises, \u201cwith healing in his wings\u201d (Malachi 4:2). Not all that this world bestows can heal a broken heart, or impart peace of mind, or remove care, or banish disease. Fame, genius, talent\u2014all are powerless to gladden the sorrowful heart or to restore the wasted life. The life of God in the soul is humanity\u2019s only hope.",
