    "word": "The grace of Christ received in the soul will work as an educator. The trust received in the heart will purify the soul. The religion of Jesus Christ never makes the receiver coarse and rough and uncourteous. Truth is delicate and elevating. It acts as a refiner. It sanctifies the soul. The constant influence of truth trains the soul after Christ's pattern, and molds and fashions the character for the courts above. It is a grand principle which must be brought into the daily practical life.",
