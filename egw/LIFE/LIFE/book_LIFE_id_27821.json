    "word": "How can we find language to express our deep interest and desire that every soul should awake and go to work in the Master's vineyard! \"Occupy,\" says Christ, \"till I come.\" It may be but a few years until your life history shall close, but you must occupy till then. When the fiat goes forth, \"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still\" (Revelation 22:11), then there will be no more occasion to labor for souls.--Ms. 13, 1895, pp. 1-3. (Untitled Manuscript, June 10, 1895.)",
