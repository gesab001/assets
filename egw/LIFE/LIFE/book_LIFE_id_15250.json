    "word": "Discarding Almost Entirely.--Our institutions are established that the sick may be treated by hygienic methods, discarding almost entirely the use of drugs. . . . There is a terrible account to be rendered to God by men who have so little regard for human life as to treat the body so ruthlessly in dealing out their drugs. . . . We are not excusable if through ignorance we destroy God's building by taking into our stomachs poisonous drugs under a variety of names we do not understand. It is our duty to refuse all such prescriptions.",
