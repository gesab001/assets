    "word": "Chap. 13 - Saved by Loving Care.\n\n     Last night, October 19, 1902, I seemed to be in the operating-room of a large hospital, to which people were being brought. Surgical instruments were being prepared with which to amputate the limbs of these people immediately. One entered who seemed to have authority, and said to the physician, \"Is it necessary to bring these people into this room?\" Looking pityingly at the sufferers, He said, \"Never amputate a limb until everything possible has been done to restore it.\" Examining the limbs which the physicians had been preparing to cut off, He said: \"They may be saved. The first thing to be done is to use every available means to restore these limbs. What a fearful mistake it would be to amputate a limb that could be saved by patient care! Your conclusions have been too hastily drawn. Put these patients in the best rooms in the hospital, and give them the very best of care and treatment. Use every means in your power to save them from going through life in a crippled condition, their usefulness damaged for life.\"",
