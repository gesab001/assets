    "word": "Jesus turns to the suffering one, and says, \u201cThou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him,\n188\nand enter no more into him.\u201d There is a cry, an agonized struggle. The demon, in passing, seems about to rend the life from his victim. Then the boy lies motionless, and apparently lifeless. The multitude whisper, \u201cHe is dead.\u201d But Jesus takes him by the hand, and lifting him up, presents him, in perfect soundness of mind and body, to his father. Father and son praise the name of their Deliverer.\u2014DA 428, 429.",
