    "word": "The heart is the citadel of the spiritual life, and it is necessary daily to expel worldly maxims and the spirit of the world from our hearts. \n\n\n                                    -66- \n\n. . . The pulsing of the heart is felt through the whole body, and the action of the heart must be sound if there is to be a healthful condition throughout the body. Let the heart be diseased, and sickness is communicated to every member of the body.--Letter 16, 1895, pp. 1, 2, 6. (To Elder C. P. Bollman, June 18, 1895.) \n\nReleased June 22, 1971.",
