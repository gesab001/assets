    "word": "The sinner measures himself by himself and by those who like himself are sinners. He does not look at the purity and holiness of Christ. But when the law of God brings conviction to his heart, he says with Paul, \"I was alive \n\n\n                                 -230- \n\nwithout the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.\" \"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\" \"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Romans 7:9, 10, 7, 12).--Manuscript 2, 1900, pp. 1,2.
