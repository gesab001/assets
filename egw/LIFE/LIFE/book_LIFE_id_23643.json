    "word": "Chap. 37 - Proper Use of the Voice\n\n     Health Principles--The proper use of the vocal organs will bring benefit to the physical health and increase the usefulness and influence [of Christ's followers]. It is through falling into bad habits of speech that people become tedious readers and speakers, but those who are looked upon as intelligent enough to become missionary workers or to transact business ought to have intelligence enough to reform in their manner of speaking. By judicious exercise they may expand the chest and strengthen the muscles. By giving heed to proper instruction, by following health principles in regard to the expansion of the lungs and the culture of the voice, our young men and women may become speakers who can be heard; and the exercise necessary for this accomplishment will prolong life.--CT 247.",
