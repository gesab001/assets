    "word": "Those who have gained this knowledge value aright the privilege of communion with Him who is their life, Him in whom they believe, who declares that to all who receive Him, He will give power to become the sons of God. To him they have committed the keeping of the soul. Their knowledge of God and of Christ, their Redeemer, is genuine. They know that were their earthly tabernacle dissolved, they have a home not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.",
