    "word": "We desire to erect a church school building for our children. Because of the many calls made for means, it seems a difficult matter to secure sufficient money or to arouse an interest great enough to build a small, convenient schoolhouse. I have told the school committee that I will lease them some land for as long a time as they care to use if for school purposes. I hope that interest enough will be aroused to enable us to erect a building where our children can be taught the Word of God, which is the life-blood and the flesh of the Son of God. \"Whoso eateth my flesh\" He declares, \"and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life. . . It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" We are to eat and drink the Word of life, carrying out its instruction much more closely than we have ever done before.",
