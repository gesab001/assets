Man has tried to be wiser than God. He has become a law unto himself. God calls upon us to give attention to His requirements, to no longer dishonor Him by dwarfing the physical, mental, and spiritual capabilities. Premature decay and death are the result of walking away from God to follow the ways of the world. He who indulges self must bear the penalty. In the judgment we shall see how seriously God regards the violation of the laws of health. Then, as we take a retrospective view of our course of action, we shall see what knowledge of God we might have gained, what noble characters we might have builded, if we had taken the Bible as our counselor.",
