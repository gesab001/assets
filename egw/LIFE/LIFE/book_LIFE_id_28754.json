    "word": "Elder Andrews is a conscientious servant of Jesus Christ, and your neglect of him was neglect of the Master who sent him. You might have instructed Elder A in some things, might have aided him with your sympathy, your love and cooperation; yet God did not send these men to be taught of you in regard to the best manner of managing His work. You should have been \n\n\n                                   -324- \n\nwilling to be taught by Brother A, as one having a more mature experience in the cause of God. But instead of this, he was allowed, by you, to be placed in the most unpleasant positions, a stranger in a foreign country. You failed greatly in your efforts to make his mission a success. You did not faithfully do all in your power to cause him to feel as little as possible the marked change from the habits and customs of American to European life. God looks upon all these things. He calls upon you in Switzerland to be as self-denying, as teachable and self-sacrificing, to sustain the work among you as the people of America have been to get the truth before you.",
