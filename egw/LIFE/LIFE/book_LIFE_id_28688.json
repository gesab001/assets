    "word": "All are to make it their Christian practice to exhibit to a world dead in trespasses and sins, the great and heavenly principles of the love of Christ for one another, although they are not assigned the same class of labor, but all working intelligently to advance the work in their line. The example of Christ can never be equaled, for the Saviour of the world worked out an example for every living creature in the world in regard to the principles of that heavenly country from which He came. [He] set us all an example in obeying the laws of that better country and the city He has builded for all who will be obedient to the laws of God. Christ gave His life to make it possible in our humanity to meet the conditions that will give all an entrance into that city whose builder and maker is God.",
