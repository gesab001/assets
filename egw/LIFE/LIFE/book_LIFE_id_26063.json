    "word": "I have been shown that the rebellion that started in R. has never been eradicated from all hearts. The root of bitterness, the hatred of reproval of sin, the despising of counsel, the selfishness, has lived in the hearts especially of the family of Bro. L. They have not all reformed. They have not turned unto the Lord with full repentance of soul. When the leaven of disaffection and malice begins to work in some unsanctified hearts, then will the whole lump be leavened. The smouldering fire of prejudice and rebellion will break forth afresh when there is any motion to fan it to life.",
