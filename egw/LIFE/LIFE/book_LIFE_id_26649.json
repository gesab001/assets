    "word": "Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He is the light of the world. He contemplated the situation of the world. He saw that eternal interests were involved in the choice man should make. An immortal crown was presented for the overcomer, and unhappiness and eternal ruin for those who neglected the science of salvation, which is the only term to which higher education can be applied.--Letter 5, 1898.",
