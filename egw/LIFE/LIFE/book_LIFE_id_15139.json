    "word": "If we are constantly looking unto Jesus and receiving His Spirit, we shall have clear eyesight. Then we shall discern the perils on every side, and shall guard every word we utter, lest Satan find opportunity to weave in his deceptions. We do not want to have the minds of the people wrought up into an excitement. We should not encourage an expectation to see strange and wonderful things. But teach them to follow Jesus step by step. Preach Jesus Christ, in whom our hope of eternal life is centered.--Letter 102, 1894. \n                                                                           62",
