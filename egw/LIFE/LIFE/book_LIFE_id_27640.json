    "word": "Whom Shall We Serve.--We want to improve every opportunity given us day by day to overcome the temptations of the enemy. This life is a conflict, and we have a foe who never sleeps, who is watching constantly to destroy our minds and lure us away from our precious Saviour who has given His life for us. Shall we lift the cross given us, or shall we go on in selfish gratification and lose the eternity of bliss? We cannot afford to sin, we cannot afford to disgrace the law of God. Adam and Eve could not afford it. Did they not lose by their transgression? And by obedience we shall regain that which was lost. The question with us should not be, \"How shall I make the most money in this world?\" The question should be, \"Shall I serve God or Baal?\" \"Choose ye this day whom ye will serve,\" but I can say, \"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord\" (Joshua 24:15). . . .",
