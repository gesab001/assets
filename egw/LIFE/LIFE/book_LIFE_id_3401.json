    "word": "It is for the object of soul saving that our sanitariums are established. In our daily ministrations we see many careworn, sorrowful faces. What does the sorrow on these faces show? The need of the soul for the peace of Christ. Poor, sad human beings go to broken cisterns, which can hold no water, thinking to quench their thirst. Let them hear a voice saying, \"Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,\" \"Come to Me, that ye might have life.\" Isaiah 55:1; John 5:40.",
