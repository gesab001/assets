    "word": "God has given us reasoning powers and talents of perception that we may distinguish between good and evil. This we may do if we refuse to yield to the temptations of Satan, who is playing the game of life for every soul. But if we stupefy our faculties by the use of narcotics, we cannot distinguish between right and wrong, between the sacred and the common. The sin of this lies at our own door. We have given our powers into Satan's keeping, and habits that are selfish and impure bind us as with chains of steel.",
