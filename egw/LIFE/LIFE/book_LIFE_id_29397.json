    "word": "We must look on the faults of others, not to condemn, but to restore and heal. Watch unto prayer, go forward and upward, catching more and more of the spirit of Jesus, and sowing the same beside all waters. Give not your heart to the possession of any hatred because you see professed Christians pursuing a course that is not what you might expect from those who have had an experience in the truth. \"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\" See that you are not a commandment breaker in any wise because others disregard the principles of God's holy law. Let all your works, however humble they may be, be of a character to save precious souls for whom Christ has died. Be sure that you have the spirit of Jesus and present to others the truth as it is in Jesus. The Lord loves those who are contrite in heart. Now is the time to form a character unto eternal life, to receive light, and to make the most of your precious opportunities to diffuse light. It is by imparting that which you receive, that you will grow in grace and in Christian experience, becoming a worker together with God.",
