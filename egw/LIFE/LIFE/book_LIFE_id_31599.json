    "word": "W. C. White: They do test our faith, Mother,--especially when a group of workers have labored with a man until they have learned to love him and adore him and they believe that he can do better work than any other man. Then it is natural for them to think that it is wrong for the brethren to withhold from him that which he might use to advantage. They think, \"What is a thousand dollars, or fifteen hundred dollars, extra, when life is involved?\" They say, \"Here is such and such a case that he has just brought through, and there is another whose life he has saved;\" and they feel as if it would be awfully mean of us not to meet his requirements. They say, \"There is no one who has to work and suffer as does a surgeon. Think of the hours of arduous labor, of anxiety, of mental anguish they have to endure, when a precious life is hanging by a slender thread.\"",
