    "word": "We are neglecting our salvation if we give authors, who have but a confused idea of what religion means, the most conspicuous places and devoted respect, and make the Bible secondary. Those who have been enlightened in reference to the truth for these last days will not find instruction in the books generally studied today in regard to the things which are coming upon our world. But the Bible is full of the knowledge of God and is competent to educate the student for usefulness in this life and for the eternal life.--Ms 9, 1896, pp. 10, 11.
