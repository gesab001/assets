    "word": "The book of life contains the good deeds of the saints, and the book of death contains the evil deeds of the wicked. These books were compared with the statute book--the Bible--and according to that they were judged. The saints in unison with Jesus passed their judgment upon the wicked dead. \"Behold ye,\" said the angel, \"the saints sit in unison with Jesus and mete out to each of the wicked according to the deeds done in the body [2 Corinthians \n\n\n                                    -249- \n\n5:10], and it is set off against their names what they must receive at the execution of the judgment.\" This I saw was the work of the saints with Jesus through the 1,000 years.",
