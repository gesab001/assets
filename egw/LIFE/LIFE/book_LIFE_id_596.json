    "word": "God's Invitation to Youth.--God's invitation comes to each youth, \"My son, give Me thine heart; I will keep it pure; I will satisfy its longings with true happiness.\" God loves to make the youth happy, and that is why He would have them give their hearts into His keeping, that all the God-given faculties of the being may be kept in a vigorous, healthful condition. They are holding God's gift of life. He makes the heart beat; He gives strength to every faculty. Pure enjoyment will not debase one of God's gifts.",
