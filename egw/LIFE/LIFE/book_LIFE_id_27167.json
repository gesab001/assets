    "word": "My brethren, discard the streams of the lowlands, and come to the pure waters of Lebanon. Never can you walk in the light of God while you crowd your brains with a mass of matter which they cannot handle. It is time we resolved to have heaven's help, and allow the mind to be impressed with the word of God. Let us close the door to so much reading. Let us pray more, and eat the words of life. Unless there is a deeper work of grace in mind and heart, unless we reveal true Christian charity, we can never see the face of God.--Letter 101, 1899, p. 4. (\"To the Responsible Men in Our Institutions,\" July 3, 1899.)",
