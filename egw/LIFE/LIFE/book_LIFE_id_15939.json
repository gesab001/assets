    "word": "Christ Took Our Place in the Universe.--Under the mighty impulse of His love,  He took our place in the universe, and invited the Ruler of all things to treat Him as a representative of the human family. \n                                                                           925\nHe identified Himself with our interests, bared His breast for the stroke of death, took man's guilt and its penalty, and offered in man's behalf a complete sacrifice to God. By virtue of this atonement, He has power to offer to man perfect righteousness and full salvation. Whosoever shall believe on Him as a personal Saviour shall not perish, but have everlasting life (RH April 18, 1893).",
