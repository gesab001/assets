    "word": "When Christ is abiding in the soul, the fact cannot be hid, for He is like a well of water springing up into everlasting life. We can but represent the likeness of Christ in our character, and our words, our deportment, produces in others a deep, abiding, increasing love for Jesus, and we make manifest in word and deportment that we are conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. \"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.\" The language expressed by John will be the language of every individual soul: \"We have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\"",
