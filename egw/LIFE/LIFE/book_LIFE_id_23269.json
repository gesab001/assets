    "word": "There is no other way to be saved but that devised by our Redeemer, and of which He has given us a practical illustration in His own life of self-denial and self-sacrifice. You know He submitted to insult, to scorn and mockery without retaliation. When He was reviled, He reviled not again. \"I came . . . not,\" says Christ, \"to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me\" (John 6:38). We must have the mind of Christ. We must walk in His footsteps.",
