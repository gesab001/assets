    "word": "Chap. 24 - Onward and Upward\n\n     I wish I could portray the beauty of the Christian life. Beginning in the morning of life, controlled by the laws of nature and of God, the Christian moves steadily onward and upward, daily drawing nearer his heavenly home, where await for him a crown of life, and a new name, \"which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.\" Constantly he grows in happiness, in holiness, in usefulness. The progress of each year exceeds that of the past year.",
