    "word": "In almost every church there are young men and women who might receive education either as nurses or physicians. They will never have a more favorable opportunity than now. . . . It should ever be kept before them that their work is not only to relieve physical suffering, but to minister to souls that are ready to perish. It is important that everyone who is to act as a medical missionary be skilled in ministering to the soul, as well as to the body. He is to be an imitator of Christ, presenting to the sick and suffering the preciousness of pure and undefiled religion. While doing all in his power to relieve physical distress and to preserve this mortal life, he should point to the mercy and the love of Jesus, the Great Physician, who came that \"whosoever believeth in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life.\"--Letter 34, 1892, pp. 1, 2, 4.
