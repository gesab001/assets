    "word": "The Highest Honor, the Greatest Joy \n\n     God is the source of life and light and joy to the universe. Like rays of light from the sun, blessings flow out from Him to all the creatures He has made. In His infinite love He has granted men the privilege of becoming partakers of the divine nature, and, in their turn, of diffusing blessings to their fellow men. This is the highest honor, the greatest joy, that it is possible for God to bestow upon men. Those are brought nearest to their Creator who thus become participants in labors of love. He who refuses to  become a \"laborer together with God,\"--the man who for the sake of selfish indulgence ignores the wants of his fellow men, the miser who heaps up his treasures here,--is withholding from himself the richest blessing that God can give him.--R. & H., Dec. 6, 1887.",
