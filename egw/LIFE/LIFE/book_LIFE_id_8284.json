All that we are required to do is to ask God to raise up the sick if in accordance with his will, believing that he hears the reasons which we present, and the fervent prayers offered. If the Lord sees that it will best honor him, he will answer our prayers. But to urge recovery without submission to his will, \n                                                                           239\nis not right. . . . All that can be done in praying for the sick is earnestly to importune God in their behalf, and in perfect confidence rest the matter in his hands. . . .
