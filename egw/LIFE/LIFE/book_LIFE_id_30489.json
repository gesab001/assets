    "word": "Fathers and mothers, you are responsible for your children. Be careful under what influence you place them. Do not, by scolding and fretting, lose your own influence over them for good. You are to guide them, not to stir up the passions of their mind. Whatever provocation you may have, be sure that the tone of your voice betrays no irritation. Do not let them see in you a manifestation of the Spirit of Satan. This will not help you to fit and train your children for the future, immortal life.",
