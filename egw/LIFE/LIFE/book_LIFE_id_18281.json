    "word": "One youth, about seventeen years of age, wept like a child as I read an article of how a youth of seventeen was enticed into a liquor saloon, and drank his first glass of liquor, and it did what it always will do, maddened the brain. After taking this liquor the youth remembered nothing about what had transpired. A quarrel had taken place in this saloon, and in the youth's hand was found a knife that had taken the life or a human being, and he was charged with the murder, and five years' imprisonment was his sentence. It was a touching article and brought tears to many eyes of both old and young. --Letter 68, 1893.",
