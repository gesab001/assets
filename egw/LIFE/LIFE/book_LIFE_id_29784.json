    "word": "Two are fully with us. Brother Sharp, a very intelligent and capable man, lost his situation where he had been employed for fourteen years. He felt quite bad, and it so deeply affected his wife that she came near losing her life. When a business man in Sydney learned that Brother Sharp had lost his situation because he conscientiously observed the Sabbath, he said, \"That is just the man I want in my work.\" He immediately sent for Brother Sharp, employed him at once, giving him the same wages he had previously received, together with his time on the Sabbath. He paid him $17.50 (seventeen dollars and a half) per week. He also gave him a much pleasanter room, larger \n\n\n                                     -293- \n\nand better lighted, in which to do his work. He lost only one week's time. He was a very happy man.",
