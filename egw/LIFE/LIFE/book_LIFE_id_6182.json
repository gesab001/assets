    "word": "The angelic host were filled with amazement as they beheld the sufferings and death of the King of glory. But. . .it was no marvel to them that the Lord of life and glory. . .should break the bands of death, and walk forth from His prison house, a triumphant conqueror.

But I saw that neither of these events was designed to alter or abrogate God's law; on the contrary, they give the strongest proof of its immutability. . . .",
