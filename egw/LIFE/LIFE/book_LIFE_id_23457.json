    "word": "So it is in spiritual things. The Word of the living God is the seed. Christ is the sower, and unless He constantly works the soil of the heart, there will be no harvest. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). God gave His Son to die, the just for the unjust, that there might be a glorious harvest of souls. The human heart is God's seed plot, and the righteousness of Christ must be cherished there. Then let no man trust in the arm of flesh, but in God. Let each give evidence that he has faith, that he is not a religious dwarf, but that he grows under the dews and showers of the grace of Christ, that his life of righteousness is not of man's creating, but that it is the righteousness of Christ, which the grace of God has nourished in his heart. . . .",
