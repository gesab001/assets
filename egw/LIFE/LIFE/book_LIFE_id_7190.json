    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     O how many are being deluded by their own supposed goodness! When Peter said he would follow Christ to prison and to death, he meant it, every \n366\nword of it; but he was not conscious that slumbering in his soul were elements which circumstances would fan into life, and which would prove his eternal ruin, unless he was made conscious of his danger. His compassionate Saviour saw in him a self-love, self-assurance that would overbear even his love for Christ; and unless he could be brought to see this, he would be lost.",
