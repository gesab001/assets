    "word": "\"God is love\" is written upon every soul who will receive the superscription. Jesus, the Majesty of heaven, will unite all souls to Himself who will permit Him to bind them to His great heart of infinite love. Jesus teaches us that God is an ever-present \"I AM.\" It is by cordially believing that we maintain our allegiance to God. Jesus said, \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in \n\n\n                                    -212- \n\nthe wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Again He said, \"I am the good shepherd. . . . I lay down My life for the sheep.\" \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\"",
