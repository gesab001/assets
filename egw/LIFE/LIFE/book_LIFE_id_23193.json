    "word": "Make no man your king. Who is our King? He who is called, \"Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace\" (Isaiah 9:6). He is our Saviour, our King. To Him you may always go with your burdens. However great your sins, you need have no fear of repulse. If you have injured your brother, go to him, and confess the wrong you have done him. When you have done this, you may come to your King, asking Him for pardon. He will never take advantage of your confessions. He will never disappoint you. He has pledged His word to forgive your transgressions and to cleanse you from all defilement. The names of all His people are written in His book of life.",
