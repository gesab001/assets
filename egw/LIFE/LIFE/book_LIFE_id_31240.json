    "word": "Being partakers of the divine nature will make us willing always to reach forth a helping hand to those in need of relief. Christ's heart was ever touched with pity at the sight of human woe. He died on the cross of Calvary to lift from man the penalty of transgression. He came to our world to make it possible for sinful human beings to obtain salvation. He wept over the sorrow and suffering that He saw on every hand. He groaned in spirit in behalf of the tried and tempted, but He would not fail or become discouraged. He must believe and press forward in order to make it possible for them to gain eternal life.",
