    "word": "I told the people how we were working to establish in various places sanitariums for the sick. I told them that Christ was our physician. We are asked by some, Do you have power to work miracles and to heal the sick? I answer, I have never worked a miracle in my life; but I have presented many suffering ones in faith to Christ, and the mighty Healer has rebuked disease and raised the suffering ones to health. Christ alone can heal the sick and raise the dead.--Letter 278, 1908, p. 2. (To Sister Kerr, February 21, 1908.)",
