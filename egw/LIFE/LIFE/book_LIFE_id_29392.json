    "word": "The character of Christ was one of unexampled excellence, embracing \n\n                                     -73- \n\neverything pure, true, lovely, and of good report. We have no knowledge of His ever visiting a party of pleasure or a dance hall, and yet He was the perfection of grace and courtly bearing. Christ was no novice; He was distinguished for the high intellectual powers He possessed even in the morning of His life.",
