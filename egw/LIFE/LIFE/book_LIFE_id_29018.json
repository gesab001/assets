    "word": "The Lord Jesus is the Maker of the mind which man has debased and enfeebled by sin. The central power of the earth's fallen subjects is a demon. He has set up his throne in the world. Christ proposes the means of recovery through the great work of redemption. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" The Lord Jesus, through sacrificing His life upon the cross, purposed by the agency of the Holy Spirit to bring man to see his position as a sinner and surrender his will to God's will. He will sanctify every soul that will receive the gracious gift, and [will] give him power to become a son of God. He takes away the destructive tendencies of the sinful nature and brings the human agency into His service.",
