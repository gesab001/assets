    "word": "Let the thought encourage us that Christ pities the erring, and desires to comfort the despondent, and encourage the weak. He is fully acquainted with the peculiar trials of every life. He never misjudges our motives, nor places a wrong estimate upon our character. Men may do us injustice, we may suffer by calumny and suspicion, but the Saviour knows our inmost thought, and cannot judge our actions wrongly. We may tell him all our griefs and perplexities, and he will never abuse our confidence, nor turn a deaf ear to our complaints.",
