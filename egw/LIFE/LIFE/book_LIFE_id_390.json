    "word": "The expense, the care, and labor lavished on that which, if not positively injurious, is unnecessary would go far toward advancing the cause of God if applied to a worthier object. People crave what are called the luxuries of life, and sacrifice health, strength, and means to obtain them. A lamentable spirit of rivalry is manifested among persons of the same class as to who shall make the greatest display in matters of dress and of household expenditure. The sweet word \"Home\" is perverted to mean \"something with four walls, filled with elegant furniture and adornments,\" while its inmates are on a continual strain to meet the requirements of custom in the different departments of life.",
