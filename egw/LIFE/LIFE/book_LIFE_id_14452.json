    "word": "God can do much for you, even in your labor, if you ask Him. He can send His angels to preserve you from accidents, from breakage, and losses of life and property. The reason why those who neglect the privileges that God has provided have no more comfort and peace and joy is that they do not pause to have communion with God, who is the source of their strength.

He says, \"Them that honour me I will honour.\"",
