    "word": "We need your prayers daily that the Lord would prepare me to do His work and give me largely of His Spirit, for without this grace and His special assistance I cannot do anything, Oh, I long, I thirst for salvation, for special help from God, to know for myself that my life is hid with Christ in God. I do know that there is nothing on earth I desire beside Him. He is the crown of my rejoicing. Separated from Jesus I should be indeed miserable.",
