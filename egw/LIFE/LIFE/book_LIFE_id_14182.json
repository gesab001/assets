    "word": "There are many hearers, but few doers, of the words of Christ. His words may be theoretically accepted, but if they are not stamped upon the soul, and woven into the life, they will have no sanctifying effect upon the character. It is one thing to accept the truth, and another thing to practice it in the daily life. From those who hear only, God's Word calls for no grateful response. The commandment, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,\" is acknowledged to be just, but its claims are not recognized; its principles are not carried out.",
