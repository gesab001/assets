    "word": "The language of the Christian must be mild and circumspect; for his holy faith requires him to represent Christ to the world. All who are abiding in Christ will manifest the kind, forgiving courtesy that characterized His life. Their works will be works of piety, equity, and purity. They will have the meekness of wisdom, exercising the gift of the grace of Jesus. They will be ready and willing to forgive, earnestly seeking to be at peace with their brethren. They will represent that spirit which they desire to be exercised toward them by their heavenly Father.",
