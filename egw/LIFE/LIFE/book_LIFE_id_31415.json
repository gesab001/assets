    "word": "The law of God is to be obeyed. Obedience is the life of the soul. It brings health and peace and assurance. Seek the Lord in every necessity, and know that you have a friend in Jesus, one who loves you with an everlasting love. He will be as an anchor to the soul, both sure and steadfast. When men and women come just as they are, He cleanses them from their sins, and they become His sons and daughters. \n\n\n                           (Signed) Ellen G.
