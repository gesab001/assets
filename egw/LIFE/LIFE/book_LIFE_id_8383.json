    "word": "Christ says of the overcomer, \u201cI will not blot out his name out of the book of life.\u201d The names of all those who have once given themselves to God are written in the book of life, and their characters are now passing in review before him. Angels of God are weighing moral worth. They are watching the development of character in those now living, to see if their names can be retained in the book of life. A probation is granted us in which to wash our robes of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Who is doing this work? Who is separating from himself sin and selfishness? \u201cYe are dead,\u201d says the apostle Paul of the true followers of Christ, \u201cand your life is hid with Christ in God.\u201d When we are alive to God, we are dead to self. May God help us to die to self. Whose names will not be blotted out of the book of life? Only the names of those who have loved God with all the powers of their being, and their neighbors as themselves.",
