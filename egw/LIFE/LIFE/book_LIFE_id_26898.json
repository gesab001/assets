    "word": "Life is too short, the hours of probation too precious, for us to make a mistake in our religious life. Earnest men, men of strength are needed in the Master's service. The call comes to us, \"Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\" As we obey this command, the power of the Holy Spirit will come upon mind and body, bringing them into conformity to the will of Christ, and renewing us in His likeness. The hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong will die, and Christ will be formed within, the hope of glory. It will be seen that we are indeed followers of Christ.",
