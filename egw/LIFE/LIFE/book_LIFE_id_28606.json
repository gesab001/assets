    "word": "I have had to break off writing to have an interview with Brother Albert Vuilleumier. He is in some perplexity. His brethren urge him to be ordained, but he wishes to wait one year longer. He will work, he says, all the same, but he fears that he has not sufficient experience. I believe him to be an excellent man. He wished to know how he should present the truth in entering new fields, whether the Sabbath should be presented first. I told him that the best and wisest plan would to be to dwell upon subjects that would arouse the conscience. He could talk upon practical godliness, devotion, and piety, and present the self-denying, self-sacrificing life of Jesus as our example until they will see the contrast between that and their self-indulgent life and become dissatisfied with their unchristian lives.",
