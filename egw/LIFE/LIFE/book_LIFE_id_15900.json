    "word": "(Philippians 1:21.) Paul a Living Example for Every Christian.--Paul was a living example of what every true Christian should be. He lived for God's glory. His words come sounding down the line to our time: \"For to me to live is Christ.\" \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.\" He who was once a persecutor of Christ in the person of His saints now holds up before the world the cross of Christ. Paul's heart burned with a love for souls, and he gave all his energies for the conversion of men. There never lived a more self-denying, earnest, persevering worker. His life was Christ; he worked the works of Christ. \n                                                                           1113\nAll the blessings he received were prized as so many advantages to be used in blessing others (RH May 29, 1900).",
