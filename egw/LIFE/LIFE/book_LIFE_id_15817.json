    "word": "Some assert that if a soul stumbles and falls, he can never regain his position; but the case before us contradicts this.

And he was commissioned to feed not only the sheep, but the lambs--a broader and more delicate work than had hitherto been appointed him. Not only was he to hold forth the word of life to others, but he was to be a shepherd of the flock (YI Dec. 22, 1898).",
