    "word": "Only those who practice holiness in this life will see the King in His beauty. Put away all vain, trifling talk, and everything of a frivolous and sensational nature. Do not engross your mind with thoughts of worldly entertainments and pleasures. Engage in the work of saving your soul. If you should lose your soul, it would have been better for you never to have been born. But you need not lose your soul. You may use every moment of this God-given life to His name\u2019s glory. Strengthen yourself to resist the powers of darkness, that they shall not obtain a victory over you.\u2014Manuscript 110, 1901 (Sermons and Talks, vol. 2, pp. 174-176).",
