    "word": "How unlike Christ we are in word and spirit and in our attitude toward one another. His gentleness should make us rejoice in the Lord. It should make us \"kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another.\" As a people who have had great light, we stand before God under condemnation unless we fulfill the Saviour's expectation for us, holding fast to Him, and allowing Him to send through our religious experience a warm current of unselfish love. When we do this, our spiritual strength will show that we are \n\n\n                                  -201- \n\nliving in close connection with the Life-giver. We shall give life for the life that we receive.",
