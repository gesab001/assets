    "word": "I repeat, It should be the fixed principle of every child and every youth to aim high in all the plans for their lifework. Let the standard which God's Word presents be adopted for their government in all things. All this is the Christian's positive duty, and it should be also his positive pleasure. Cultivate respect for yourself because you are Christ's purchased possession. Constantly cherish respect for your own personal influence. Attainments in useful personal experience, success in the formation of right habits, advancement in all that is noble and just and firm and solid, will give you an influence that all will appreciate and value. This is the influence that is a savor of life unto life.",
