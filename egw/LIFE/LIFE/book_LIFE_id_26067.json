    "word": "Physicians at our Health Institute should be constantly advancing in knowledge, refinement, and excellence of character. But they have been moving in a narrow groove, selfishly watching their own interests and and fearfully neglecting the responsibilities which have a direct bearing upon the life and health of those entrusted to their care. This course has not tended to widen and strengthen the influence of the institution. Those in charge have narrowed down their own work \n                                                                           17\nand limited their responsibilities, and have thus injured the enterprise it was their duty to uphold.",
