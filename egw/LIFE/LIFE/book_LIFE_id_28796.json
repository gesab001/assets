    "word": "From time to time God has seen fit to open before me your life, your temperament, your character, and I must say to you that you have a work to do for yourself before you can be admitted to become a member of the Lord's family in the heavenly courts. Sin is sin, whether it is in J. G. Matteson or in the man of lowly position. You are not right with God. A man in God's eye is just what he is in his own family. The converting power of God will be seen in his home. You should have had a testimony to bear to individuals and families in the Spirit of Christ, and [should have had] a love for their souls that would have placed you among the faithful watchmen, but, I feel compelled to say, you are not there now. You must set your own heart in order. You have a work to do for yourself which no other can do for you, to overcome your pettish spirit and to cleanse the soul temple of its defilement.",
