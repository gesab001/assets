    "word": "Aim Stimulates the Mind.--You should also have an aim, a purpose, in life. Where there is no purpose, there is a disposition to indolence; but where there is a sufficiently important object in view, all the powers of the mind will come into spontaneous activity. In order to make life a success the thoughts must be steadily fixed upon the object of life and not left to wander off and be occupied with unimportant things, or to be satisfied with idle musing, which is the fruit of shunning responsibility. Castle-building depraves the mind.--2T 429 (1870). \n\n\n                                                   443",
