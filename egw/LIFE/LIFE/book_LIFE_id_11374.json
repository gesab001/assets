    "word": "The Need for Aims and Goals.--Have an aim in life while you do live. Gather sunshine about you instead of clouds. Seek to be a fresh, beautiful flower in God's garden, imparting fragrance to all around you. Do this, and you will not die a whit sooner; but you will surely shorten your days by unhappy complainings, making \n\n806 \n\nyour pains and ailments the theme of conversation.--HR, June, 1871.",
