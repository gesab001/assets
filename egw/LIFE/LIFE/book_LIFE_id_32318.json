    "word": "My brother, I ask you to remember that Christ is our Leader. The beings that he has purchased with his blood are to study the life that he lived in this world, in order to learn what path they are to follow. His voice is heard, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\" \"So shall he be my disciple.\" He who supposes, like Nebuchadnezzar, that he can lift up or cast down, will find that he is reckoning without God.",
