    "word": "The man works and co-operates with God; the grace of God is constantly at work with the consent of the agent to perfect a Christlike character. In the divine arrangement, God does nothing without the co-operation of man. He compels no man's will. That must be given to the Lord completely, also the Lord is not able to accomplish His divine work that He would do through the human agency. Jesus declared that in a certain place He could not do many mighty works among the people because of their unbelief. He wanted to do for them in that place just what He knew that they needed to have done, but He could not because unbelief barred the way. The potter cannot mold and fashion unto honor that which has never been placed in his hands. The Christian life is one of daily surrender, submission and continual overcoming, gaining fresh victories every day. This is the growing up into Christ, fashioning the life into the divine model.",
