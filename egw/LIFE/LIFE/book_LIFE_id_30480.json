    "word": "In the chapter from which we have read, we find this invitation given: \"The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely\" [verse 17]. There can be no excuse for those who lose eternal life because they have failed to respond to this gracious invitation. \"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus\" [verse 20].",
