    "word": "Here is a warning for those who selfishly neglect, or hold in contempt, their weak brethren; a warning to those who are unforgiving and exacting, judging and condemning others, and thus discouraging them. \"Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe unto that \n\n\n                                  -190- \n\nman by whom the offense cometh! Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast if from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven. For the Son of man is come to save that which is lost.\"",
