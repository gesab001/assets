    "word": "That which others have done, or may do in the future, will not lessen your responsibility or guilt. A pattern has been given you; a faultless life, characterized by self-denial and disinterested benevolence. If you disregard this correct, this perfect, pattern, and take an incorrect one, which has been clearly represented in the word of God, that you should shun, the failure of your life, the imperfection of your course of action, will receive their merited reward.",
