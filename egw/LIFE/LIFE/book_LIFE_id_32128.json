    "word": "The sin of the Noatic world was intemperance, and today this sin, exhibited by intemperance in eating and drinking, is so marked that God will not always tolerate it. By eating and drinking we sustain life, and in themselves, if kept within the bound of temperance, they are of no harm, but a blessing. But when eating and drinking are carried to excess they come under the head of intemperance. Man carries to excess that which is lawful, and his whole being suffers the results of the violation of the laws which the Lord established.",
