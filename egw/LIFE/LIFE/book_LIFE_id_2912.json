    "word": "Influence of Unwholesome Reading\nSatan knows that to a great degree the mind is affected by that upon which it feeds. He is seeking to lead both the youth and those of mature age to read story-books, tales, and other literature. The readers of such literature become unfitted for the duties lying before them. They live an unreal life, and have no desire to search the Scriptures, to feed upon the heavenly manna. The mind that needs strengthening is enfeebled, and loses its power to study the great truths that relate to the mission and work of Christ\u2014truths that would fortify the mind, awaken the imagination, and kindle a strong, earnest desire to overcome as Christ overcame.",
