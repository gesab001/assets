    "word": "By the combined influence of love and authority, Abraham was to rule his home. He was to walk before his household without hypocrisy or deception. He would do nothing to betray the truth. The rule for master and servant, parent and child, is obedience to the great standard of righteousness. But how few bring religion into the home life! Parents, what course are you pursuing? Are you acting on the theory that in things concerning the religious life your children shall be left free from restraint, that all you have to do is to counsel with them, and then leave them to do as they please? If so, you are neglecting your duty, neglecting the souls for whom God holds you responsible.--MS. 7, 1899. \n\n                                               -",
