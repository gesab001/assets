    "word": "\"Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 10:33). What right have we to profess to be Christians, and yet deny our Lord in life and deed? \"He that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it\" (verses 38, 39). Day by day we are to deny self, to lift the cross and follow in the footsteps of the Master.",
