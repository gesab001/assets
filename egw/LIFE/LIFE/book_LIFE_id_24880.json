    "word": "Yes, Christ gave His life for the life of the world. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" He gave His Son to be the propitiation for the sins of men and women. How many appreciate this sacrifice sufficiently to touch not, taste not, handle not, accursed, intoxicating beverages? Who are co-operating with Christ by practicing temperance in their lives, by keeping their tables free from all that will intoxicate?",
