    "word": "Every discourse given should be of that practical character which will show sinners the sinfulness of sin in the light of the law of God. It should lift up before them the sin-pardoning Redeemer, who gave His life that He might draw them unto Himself and ransom them from the power of Satan, by the price of His own sacrifice of ease, of pleasure, of honor, of glory in coming to a world all scarred and marred with the curse. Thus He became man's surety and substitute, and stands in the place of the transgressor of God's law. He suffered--the Guiltless for the guilty--that He might make it possible for all to believe on Him and accept Him as their personal Saviour, and for God to accept them in one Beloved.",
