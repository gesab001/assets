    "word": "Need of Consecration. Dear brethren in the ministry: The old year, 1887, is nearly closed, and 1888 is about to be ushered in. What advancement have we made in the knowledge of Jesus Christ during the past year? Have we, as individual workers together with God, with deep earnestness reviewed the life of the past year? Have we thoughtfully, solemnly, and prayerfully taken in the situation as to our relation to God and to His work? As ambassadors for Christ shall we at this critical period of the history of the church, when the nations of the world are almost universally wavering between infidelity and idolatry, consider the signs of the times? Shall we hear the voice of God through His Word, giving warnings and appeals and commands, calling us to a new contest by a new and more thorough consecration of ourselves, of all our entrusted capabilities and powers? My brethren and sisters who are engaged in the solemn work of being the mouthpiece of God, be sure that the treasure house of the heart is pure and holy. \n\n                                                                --\n \n\n\n                                    -319-",
