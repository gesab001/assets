    "word": "The work of building up the kingdom of Christ will go forward, though to all appearance it moves slowly and impossibilities seem to testify against advance. The work is of God, and He will furnish means and will send helpers, true, earnest disciples, whose hands also will be filled with food for the starving multitude. God is not unmindful of those who labor in love to give the word of life to perishing souls, who \n                                                                           265\nin their turn reach forth their hands for food for other hungry souls.--The Desire of Ages, pp. 369, 370.",
