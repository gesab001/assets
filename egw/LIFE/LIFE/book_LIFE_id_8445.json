    "word": "If parents would prepare their children to be useful in this life, and to enjoy the future life, they must educate them to fear God and keep his commandments. They should feel that it is their first and most important work to bring their sons and daughters under the control of God's holy law. It is not enough that they give instruction and counsel showing the right way. They should feel that it is a solemn duty to restrain their children from entering forbidden paths.",
