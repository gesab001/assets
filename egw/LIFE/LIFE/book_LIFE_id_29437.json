    "word": "Young men, deal faithfully and truly with your own souls. Seek the Lord most earnestly for grace and strength. Study the words of the Saviour: \"I have given them Thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\" Worldly ambition, worldly plans, worldly principles, are not to be brought into the life of the Christian.",
