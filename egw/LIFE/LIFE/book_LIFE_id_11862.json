    "word": "\"Keep thy heart with all diligence,\" is the counsel of the wise man; \"for out of it are the issues of life.\" As a man \"thinketh in his heart, so is he.\" The heart must be renewed by divine grace, or it will be in vain to seek for purity of life. He who attempts to build up a noble, virtuous character independent of the grace of Christ is building his house upon the shifting sand. In the fierce storms of temptation it will surely be overthrown. David's prayer should be the petition of every soul: \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\" And having become partakers of the heavenly gift, we are to go on unto perfection, being \"kept by the power of God, through faith.\"",
