    "word": "Duty of Ministers. \n  32. The ministers in our land need to become acquainted with the science of physiology. Then they will be intelligent in regard to the laws that govern physical life, and their bearings upon the health of mind and soul. Then they will be able to speak correctly upon this subject. In their obedience to physical laws they are to hold forth the word of life to the people, and lead up higher and still higher in the work of reform.--U. T., Jan. 11, 1897.",
