    "word": "Words of Encouragement to the Beldens--I have risen at one o'clock to write to you. I do not forget you. I think of you often, and would be glad to visit \n\n\n                                 -141- \n\nyou on your island home, and talk with you, but this will never be. I see that the cause of God needs me here in America, and I must work here, while He spares my life, till He directs me elsewhere. I am sometimes greatly burdened in the night season. I rise from my bed, and walk the room, praying to the Lord to help me bear the burden, and say nothing to make the people believe that the message He has given me is truth. When I can lay this burden on the Lord, I am free indeed. I enjoy a peace that I cannot express. I feel lifted up, as if borne by the everlasting arms, and peace and joy fill my soul.",
