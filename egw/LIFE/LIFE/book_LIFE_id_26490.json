    "word": "There is a great deficiency in our schools in the line of composition, writing, and bookkeeping. These are as essential for the practical life as the science of grammar. Bookkeeping should stand as one of the most important branches of education. There is not one in twenty who knows how to keep accounts correctly. Attention should also be given to reading, for this is a branch of study greatly neglected. It requires much training to be able to read properly. Through the lack of this training, one-half of the force of the other instruction will be lost. Teachers who are not competent to give  instruction in this line, and to teach correct pronunciation, and where to place the emphasis, should become learners till they can read with proper emphasis, and with a full, clear, distinct tone of voice. . . .",
