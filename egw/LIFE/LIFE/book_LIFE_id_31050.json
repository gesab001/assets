    "word": "Christ has given His own life for you that He might place immortal life within your reach. As the Divine Counsellor looked upon you, I heard Him say, O, \"who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth?\" You had a book which you had been studying. The heavenly messenger took this book from you, and placed the Bible in your hand, saying, \"The word of God, which will judge you in the last day, is alone able to make you wise unto salvation. The Bible alone can be a safe counsellor and guide for you. It will convince you of the ample provision made for all who will come to Jesus.",
