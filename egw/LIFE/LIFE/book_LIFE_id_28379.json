    "word": "Christ said to Peter, \"Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren\" [Luke 22:31, 32]. Very precious to Jesus are the souls for whom He has given His life. Jesus knows the value of the human soul, for if we are obedient to the commandments of God, \n\n\n                                    -73- \n\nwe shall be capable of immortality. When the soul is lost through sin, the most valuable object in the world is lost.",
