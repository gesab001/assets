    "word": "Brother and Sister Hughes, I have more, much more, written which I will try to look up and send you, for you need all you can get along this line if you [are to] keep heaven and Christ, who has purchased them with His own blood. I am sure you will impress upon the students to do their very best, for God\u2019s eye is upon them. Work as the Lord has specified. They are required to glorify their Redeemer. This you may class [as] a branch of higher education as you advance. I think candidly [that] the [black] leaders are truly determined to do the will of God if they see the meaning of this exemplified in the life and in the character of their teachers. We shall see an excellent work done in the future, after [a] Christlike order. All the time keep before them the neatness and order which is specially to be cultivated by all who shall come into the Lord\u2019s heavenly kingdom. Keep [their] minds hopeful that they can be Christians in words, in deportment, and in all service, and you will gain souls. Tell them, oh, tell them, of the love of Jesus, that He taketh away all their sins.",
