    "word": "Those who feel the constraining love of God ask not how little may be given, in order to obtain the heavenly reward; they ask not for the lowest standard, but aim at a perfect conformity to the will of their Redeemer. With ardent desire they will yield all, and  manifest zeal proportionate to the value of the object they are in pursuit of. What is the object? Immortality, eternal life.",
