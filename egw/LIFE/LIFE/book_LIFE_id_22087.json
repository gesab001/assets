    "word": "There is a great work for us to do if we would inherit eternal life. We are to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and live a life of righteousness. . . . There is no salvation for us except in Jesus, for it is through faith in Him that we receive power to become the sons of God. But it is not merely a passing faith, it is faith that works the works of Christ. . . . Living faith makes itself manifest by exhibiting a spirit of sacrifice and devotion toward the cause of God. Those who possess it stand under the banner of Prince Emmanuel and wage a successful warfare against the powers of darkness. They stand ready to do whatsoever their Captain commands. Each one is exhorted to be \"an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity\" (1 Timothy 4:12), for we are to \"live soberly, righteously, and godly\" in this present evil world, representing the character of Christ, and manifesting His spirit. . . .",
