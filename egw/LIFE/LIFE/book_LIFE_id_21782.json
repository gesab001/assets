    "word": "Christ lived the life of a toiler from His earliest years. In His youth He worked with His Father at the carpenter's trade, and thus honored all labor. Though He was the King of glory, yet by His practice of following a humble employment He rebuked idleness in every member of the human family, and dignified all labor as noble and Christlike. . . . From childhood He was a pattern of obedience and industry. He was as a pleasant sunbeam in the home circle. . . .",
