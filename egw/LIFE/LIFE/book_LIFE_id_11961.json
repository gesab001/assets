    "word": "Multitudes . . . crave something which they do not have. They are spending their money for that which is not bread and their labor for that which satisfieth not. The hungering, thirsting soul will continue to hunger and thirst as long as it partakes of these unsatisfying pleasures. O that every such one would listen to the voice of Jesus, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.\" Those who drink of the living water will thirst no more. . . . Christ, the wellspring of life, is the fountain of peace and happiness. . . .",
