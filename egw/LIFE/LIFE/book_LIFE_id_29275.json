    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 26, 1892. I thank the Lord that I am His child, that I can cry, Abba Father. Although I am in pain day and night, yet the grace of Christ sustains me. If I had not hope in Jesus, how lonely I should be! I have a Saviour who is the light of life. How precious to me is the sight that I catch of Jesus during my long, wakeful hours. \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\" (1 Corinthians 2:14).",
