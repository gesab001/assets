    "word": "Those who have had no respect for order or discipline in this life would have no respect for the order which is observed in heaven. They can never be admitted into heaven, for all worthy of an entrance there will love order and respect discipline. The characters formed in this life will determine the future destiny. When Christ shall come, He will not change the character of any individual. . . . Parents should neglect no duty on their part to benefit their children. They should so train them \n                                                                           230\nthat they may be a blessing to society here and may reap the reward of eternal life hereafter.",
