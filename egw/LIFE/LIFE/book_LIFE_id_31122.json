    "word": "I am sorry you have not regarded the warnings and instructions which have been given you as of sufficient value to be heeded, but by disregarding them before men who care naught for them, have made them a common matter, not worthy to have weight in your practice. Your practice has been contrary to these warnings, and this has weakened them in the eyes of men who needed correction, who in their life-practice have separated from God, and who have manifested a selfishness and harshness which should have separated them from the work long ago.",
