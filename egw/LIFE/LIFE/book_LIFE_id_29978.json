    "word": "Those who know not the voice of God, those who have been unwilling to receive the true testimonies from the Lord, may listen to the voice of a stranger, and receive from a human agent what is supposed to be truth. But, \"What is the chaff to the wheat?\" The people of God should know that they are on trial for eternal life, and that they must accept no delusive sentiments. May God save them from Satan's snares.",
