With the angels, they cast their crowns at the feet of the Redeemer, exclaiming, \"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. . . . Honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.\" Revelation 5:12, 13.",
