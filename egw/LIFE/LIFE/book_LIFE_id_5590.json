    "word": "As Christ celebrated this ordinance with His  disciples, conviction came to the hearts of all save Judas. So we shall be convicted as Christ speaks to our hearts. The fountains of the soul will be broken up. The mind will be energized, and, springing into activity and life, will break down every barrier that has caused disunion and alienation. Sins that have been committed will appear with more distinctness than ever before; for the Holy Spirit will bring them to our remembrance. The words of Christ, \"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them,\" will be clothed with new power.--Review and Herald, Nov. 4, 1902.",
