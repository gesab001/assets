    "word": "Both of you need to be converted. Neither of you have a proper idea of the meaning of obedience to God. Study the words, \"He that is not with Me is against Me; and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\" I sincerely hope that you will both become true children of God, servants to whom He can entrust responsibilities. Then peace and confidence and faith will come to you. Yes, you may both be happy, consistent Christians. Cultivate keenness of perception, that you may know how to choose the good and refuse the evil. Make the word of God your study. The Lord Jesus wants you to be saved. He has wonderfully preserved you, my brother, that your life may be one of usefulness. Bring all the good works possible into it.",
