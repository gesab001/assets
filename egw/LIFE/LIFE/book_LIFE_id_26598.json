    "word": "The love that Christ has shown for us is without a parallel. He died that we might have everlasting life. But in order to obtain this life, we must have strength from the Source of all strength. The way of salvation has been opened before us. Shall we not walk in the path of duty? Many think that Christ is a long way off, and can not hear when we cry to Him. But he is close to us, and He is acquainted with our weakness and our needs. He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. He understands our true condition. We should study His life more closely, and gain a deeper knowledge of Him and of what He has done for us. If we are His representatives, we must seek to be like Him. \n\n\n                                     -106-",
