    "word": "See what sinners the colored people were, the downtrodden, the poor. These Christ died to save, and they can, through painstaking and judicious management, become trophies of His grace, heirs to God, and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ. Through faith in Jesus Christ they become purified, sanctified; for the religion of Jesus Christ never degrades the receiver, but works with transforming power, refining the taste, sanctifying the judgment, fitting the soul for the entrance of the word that giveth life, that giveth understanding even to the simple. Those who will be humble enough to learn, the very nobility of the world will consider it an honor to go to heaven in their company, and angels of God will cooperate with such as are workers together with God. We need to hunger and thirst after righteousness, that we may have Christ in us as a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.",
