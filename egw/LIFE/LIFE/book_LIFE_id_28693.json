Hear His words: \"He that will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Having given His life to save the world from ruin, if they would be saved in God's way, [their hope lay] in obeying the laws of His kingdom. The Lifegiver expects all His followers to be faithful stewards of the grace of God, to live for the same object, to do according to His appointed will, and to be His human helping hand to save perishing souls.",
