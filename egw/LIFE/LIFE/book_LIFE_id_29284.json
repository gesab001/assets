    "word": "Health and Fashion. There is scarcely any subject upon which people are more ignorant than that which relates to their own life and health. God has placed us under obligation to take care of the habitation which He has given us. We are, as it were, under bonds to our Maker to preserve our bodies in the very best possible condition of health, that we may in our lives render to God perfect service. Our bodies are not our own to abuse as we please, and lessen our physical and mental strength by wrong habits because it is the fashion.",
