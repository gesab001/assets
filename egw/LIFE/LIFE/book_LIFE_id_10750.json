    "word": "Prepares for Eternity.--In all your work you must do as the husbandman does in laboring for the fruits of the earth. Apparently he throws away the seed; but, buried in the soil, the seed germinates. The power of the living God gives it life and vitality, and there is seen \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear\" (Mark 4:28). Study this wonderful process. Oh, there is so much to learn, so much to understand! If we improve our minds to the utmost of our ability we shall through the eternal ages continue to study the ways and works of God and to know more and more of Him.--CT 252 (1913).",
