    "word": "Let all examine their own practices to see if they are not indulging in that which is a positive injury to them. Let them dispense with every unhealthful gratification in eating and drinking.

Let them bring their daily practice into harmony with nature\u2019s laws; and by doing as well as believing, an atmosphere may be created about both soul and body that will be a savor of life unto life.\u2014Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, pp. 370, 371.",
