    "word": "\u201cFaith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\u201d Few have that genuine faith which works by love and purifies the soul. But all who are accounted worthy of everlasting life must obtain a moral fitness for the same. \u201cBeloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.\u201d This is the work before you, and you have none too much time if you engage in the work with all your soul.\u2014Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 702-705.",
