    "word": "Chapter 7 \n\n     2, 3 (Deuteronomy 20:5-8). Christ Considers Family Ties.--[Judges 7:2, 3; Deuteronomy 20:5-8 quoted.] What a striking illustration is this of the tender, pitying love of Christ! He who instituted the relations of life and the ties of kindred, made special provision that these be not too widely broken. He would have none go forth to battle unwillingly. This proclamation also sets forth in a forcible manner the influence which may be exerted by one man who is deficient in faith and courage, and further shows the effect of our thoughts and feelings upon our own course of action (ST June 30, 1881).",
