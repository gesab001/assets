    "word": "By His life in humanity man may become a partaker of the divine nature. . . . He was born without a taint of sin, but came into the world in like manner as the human family. He did not have a mere semblance of a body, but he took human nature, participating in the life of humanity. . . Christ helps humanity by taking human nature. Thus He lays hold upon man with His long human arm, and upon the throne of God with His divine arm.--Letter 97, 1898, pp. 4, 5, 7. (To brethren in North Fitzroy, typed November 18, 1898.) \n\nReleased December 10, 1971.",
