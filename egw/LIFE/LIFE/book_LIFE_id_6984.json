    "word": "The grace of Christ must be woven into every phase of the character. . . . Daily growth into the life of Christ creates in the soul a heaven of peace; in such a life there is continual fruit bearing. . . . In the lives of those who are ransomed by the blood of Christ, self-sacrifice will constantly appear. Goodness and righteousness will be seen. The quiet, inward experience will make the life full of godliness, faith, meekness, patience. This is to be our daily experience. We are to form characters free from sin--characters made righteous in and by the grace of Christ.",
