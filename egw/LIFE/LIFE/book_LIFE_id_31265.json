    "word": "Every practitioner needs to study carefully the word of God. Read the story of the sons of Aaron in the tenth chapter of Leviticus, verses one to eleven. Here was a case where the use of wine benumbed the senses. The Lord demands that the appetites and all the habits of life of the physician be kept under strict control. While dealing with the bodies of their patients, they are to constantly remember that the eye of God is upon all their work.",
