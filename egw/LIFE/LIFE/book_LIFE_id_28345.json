    "word": "Instruction was given me to speak to the people the words of the prophet Isaiah, found in the fifty-eighth chapter. Here is light and life, goodness and truth, for all who will receive the words of warning and encouragement and will apply the truth to their individual case. We are to let the word come to every appointed agency, for there is a crisis before the people of God. It is not position and rank that the church of God is to rely upon, but the power of God. The favor of God and the power of His Spirit are of more value than gold or silver.",
