    "word": "While we are in this world, we must secure by the sweat of our brow the bread that we eat. Many are inclined to divorce temporal business from spiritual service. Many think that the time devoted to temporal things is lost. They think that if they could devote their time wholly to religious duties, they would be much more fervent and earnest in religious things. But Christ has left us no such example. He was a true worker, in temporal as well as spiritual things; and into all he did, he brought a determination to do his Father's will. It is not God's intention that the business of life shall stand still, that all duties shall be regarded as unimportant but the ministry, and the lines of work embraced by the ministry. To every man God has given his work, according to his several ability. . . .",
