    "word": "To those who are tempted to indulge in trashy reading I would say, Read your Bible. \"Search the Scriptures,\" Christ commanded, \"for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of Me.\" Obedience to the word of God is our only safety. It is through study and belief of the word that we obtain a knowledge of the means by which holiness is attained. And as the principles of truth are believed, they become obligatory upon the conscience. Wonderful victories may be gained by studying the word of God, and obeying from the heart the requirements of that word.",
