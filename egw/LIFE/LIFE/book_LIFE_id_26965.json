    "word": "We want to be loved by Heaven, and we have evidence of that love when we look at Calvary. Now it is our duty to love God in return, and we can manifest that love by keeping His sayings. Jesus says that \"He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him.\"  \"Many therefore of His disciples when they had heard this said, This is a hard saying\" [John 6:56, 60]. \"From that time many of His disciples went back and walked no more with Him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.\" [verses 66-68.] \"And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this Man letters, having never learned? Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me. If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of Myself\" [John 7:15-17].",
