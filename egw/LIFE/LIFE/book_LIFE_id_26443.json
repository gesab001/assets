    "word": "The school and the sanitarium should be closely united in their work. The one aim of the work done in both institutions should be the saving of souls. What is truth, Bible truth? What does it comprehend? In our institutions these questions are to be answered. \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" This is the true higher education. The students are to be taught to carry a burden for the souls for whom Christ has given His life. The teachers in the college should be prepared to give health talks before the students.--Ms 86, 1905, pp. 2, 3. (To the \"Officers of the General Conference and the Managing Boards of the Washington Sanitarium and the Training College,\" July 14, 1905.)",
