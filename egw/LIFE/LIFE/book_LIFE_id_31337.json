    "word": "An atheist or irreligious man should never take up the work of a physician. How inconsistent for a physician to stand by the side of the sick and suffering if he cannot point them to a sin-pardoning Saviour. How terrible not to be able to tell them of the Mighty One who can heal not only every physical disease but every spiritual malady. Would that physicians might realize the greatness of the service they could render to humanity if they were able to speak simply and tenderly of the love of Jesus and of His willingness to save souls, even at the last hour of life. Many physicians fail to see what a noble influence they might exert by accepting Christ and laying hold of eternal interests. They continue to live a hopeless life, a life in which God is not recognized. They refuse to be illuminated by the light of the world, and are in a far worse condition than the one who is suffering from physical disease.",
