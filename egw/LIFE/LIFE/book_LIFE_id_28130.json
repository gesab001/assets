    "word": "We are nearing the close of this earth's history, and we need to place ourselves in right relation to our dear Saviour, who gave His life for us. We have not a moment to lose. We are fitting our characters for eternity, preparing for habitation in that city that Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him. I do not want to miss gaining an entrance into the New Jerusalem, and I want Edson and Emma and Emma's sister to be there. All who will form characters after the divine similitude will receive a welcome to that holy place.",
