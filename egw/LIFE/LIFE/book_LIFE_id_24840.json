    "word": "Like Enoch, the physician should be a man that walks with God. This will be to him a heavenly antidote to all the delusive, pernicious sentiments which make so many infidel physicians, or skeptics. The true antidote is truth, the truth of God revealed in his word, practiced in the life, and constantly guiding in all that concerns the interests of others. Having the soul thus barricaded with heavenly principles you may humbly yet confidently say, I will not fear the face of man. God is not unmindful of your struggles, of your conflicts to maintain the truth and obtain a personal daily experience in walking in the ways of truth. When you appreciate every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God as revealed in his word, higher than worldly policy, higher than the assertions of erring, failing man, you will be guided into every good and holy way.",
