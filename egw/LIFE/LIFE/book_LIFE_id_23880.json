    "word": "Often Repaid in the Coin of the Realm.--The golden rule teaches, by implication, the same truth which is taught elsewhere in the sermon on the mount, that \"with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" That which we do to others, whether it be good or evil, will surely react upon ourselves, in blessing or in cursing. Whatever we give we shall receive again. The earthly blessings which we impart to others may be, and often are, repaid in kind. What we give does, in time of need, often come back to us in fourfold measure in the coin of the realm. But, besides this, all gifts are repaid, even in this life, in the fuller inflowing of His love, which is the sum of all heaven's glory and its treasure.--Ibid., p. 194.",
