    "word": "Every one of us exerts an influence on those with whom we come in contact. This influence we have from God, and we are responsible for the way it is used. God designs that it shall tell on the side of right; but it rests with each one of us to decide whether our influence shall be pure and elevating, or whether it shall act as a poisonous malaria. Those who are partakers of the divine nature exert an influence that is Christlike. Holy angels attend them on their way, and all with whom they come in contact are helped and blessed. But those who do not receive Christ as their personal Savior cannot influence others for good. . . . Such lose all hope of eternal life themselves, and by their example lead others astray. Guard well your influence; it is \u201cyour reasonable service\u201d to place it on the Lord\u2019s side.\u2014Signs of the Times, Jan. 21, 1897.",
