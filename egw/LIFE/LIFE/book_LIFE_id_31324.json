    "word": "\"For their sakes I sanctify myself,\" Christ said, \"That they also might be sanctified through the truth.\" The Lord Jesus is the way, the truth and the life; and those who unite with Him, putting Him on, will work as co-laborers with Him, by conforming to the principles of truth. Thus to those in error and sin to show the force and power of truth. By beholding, they become imbued with truth, and unite with Christ to transform the living temple given to idols, that human beings may become cleansed, refined, sanctified temples for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.",
