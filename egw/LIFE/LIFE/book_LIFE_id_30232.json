    "word": "I think of the children in our families. Are we teaching them to live so that the gates of the city of God will be opened to them? Let fathers and mothers feel the solemn obligation resting upon them to teach their children the way of the Lord in kindness and tenderness and love. The mother should be the first teacher of her child. Parents, be kind and gentle with your children, and they will learn gentleness. Let us demonstrate in our homes that we are Christians. I value as worthless that profession that is not carried out in the home life in kindness and forbearance and love. Let us seek to form characters after the divine similitude. Let us maintain a living connection with heaven. \n\n\n                                     -405-",
