    "word": "Monday, April 24, 1876, Oakland, California, Ellen White to James White \n\n\n     Dear Husband: Mary has just been reading to me two articles--one [was] on the loaves and fishes, Christ walking on the water, and stating to His hearers He was the Bread of life, which caused some of His disciples to turn from Him. This takes fifty pages and comprises many subjects. I do think it the most precious matter I have ever written. Mary is just as enthusiastic over it. She thinks it is of the highest value. I am perfectly satisfied with it.",
