    "word": "Paul's Estimate of the Law \n\n     Paul's testimony of the law is: \"What shall we say then? Is the law sin [the sin is in the man, not in the law]? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained \n                                                                           213\nto life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me\" (Romans 7:7-11).",
