    "word": "All may become intelligent Christians if they will study the Word. In the Word lies life eternal for all who will obey its instruction. Unless we understand the terms of our salvation, and are willing to be wholly obedient to the Word of God, we can never be admitted to the city of God. Could this be possible, and those who refuse to comply with the conditions of salvation be admitted to the home of the redeemed, they would introduce their own unsanctified ideas into the heavenly family, and a second rebellion would be created.",
