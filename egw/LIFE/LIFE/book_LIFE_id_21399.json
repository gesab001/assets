    "word": "The Lord has a controversy with His people over this matter. Why have they left the Lord their God, who so loved them \"that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\"? His love is not uncertain and fluctuating, but is as far above all other love as the heavens are above the earth. Ever He watches over His children with a love that is measureless and everlasting. \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\"",
