    "word": "The essence and flavor of all obedience is the outworking of a principle within\u2014the love of righteousness, the love of the law of God. The essence of all righteousness is loyalty to our Redeemer, doing right because it is \n124\nright. When the Word of God is a burden because it cuts directly across human inclinations, then the religious life is not a Christian life, but a tug and a strain, an enforced obedience. All the purity and godliness of religion are set aside.",
