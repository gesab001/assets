    "word": "The Saviour is bending over the purchase of His blood, saying with inexpressible tenderness and pity, \"Wilt thou be made whole?\" He bids you arise in health and peace. Do not wait to feel that you are made whole. Believe the Saviour's word. Put your will on the side of Christ. Will to serve Him, and in acting upon His word you will receive strength. Whatever may be the evil practice, the master passion which through long indulgence binds both soul and body, Christ is able and longs to deliver. He will impart life to the soul that is \"dead in trespasses.\" He will set free the captive that is held by weakness and misfortune and the chains of sin.--\"Ministry of Healing,\" pp. 84, 85.",
