    "word": "Subordinate Every Earthly Interest \n\n     My dear brethren and sisters, I speak to you in words of love and tenderness. Every earthly interest must be made subordinate to the great work of redemption. \n                                                                           53\nRemember that in the lives of the followers of Christ must be seen the same devotion, the same subjection to God's work of every social claim and every earthly affection, that was seen in His life. God's claims must ever be made paramount. \"He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me.\" Christ's life is our lesson book. His example is to inspire us to put forth untiring, self-sacrificing effort for the good of others. . . .",
