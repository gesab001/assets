    "word": "Every learner needs an increasing capacity as he advances in his study of the Word of God, making the Book of books his textbook. Make your student life as perfect as possible. You will pass over the way but once. Precious are the opportunities granted you. You are not only to learn, but to practice the lessons of Christ. It rests with you yourself whether you make a success or a failure. As you succeed in gaining a knowledge of the Bible, you are storing up treasures to impart.",
