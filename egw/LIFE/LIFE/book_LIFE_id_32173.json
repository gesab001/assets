    "word": "Whatever your duties may be in the various lines of work, always remember that God is the General over us all. You must not withdraw from him to make flesh your arm. We are too much inclined to measure ourselves among ourselves, and compare ourselves one with another, placing our own estimate upon the importance of our work. But these comparisons may fall wide of the mark. The Lord does not estimate by position or rank. He looks to see how much of the Spirit of Christ you possess, and how much of his likeness your life reveals. He who loves the Lord most, listens most earnestly and intently for the Voice of God, and as he loves most, he is most beloved by the Father. \"Learn of me,\" says the greatest Teacher the world ever knew, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\"",
