    "word": "Mercy and truth and love are valuable beyond our power to calculate; we cannot have too great a supply of these treasures, and it is in the Word of God [that] we find out how we may become possessors of these heavenly riches, and yet why is it that the Word of God is uninteresting to many professed Christians? Is it because the Word of God is not spirit and is not life? Has Jesus put upon us an uninteresting task, when He commands us to \u201csearch the scriptures\u201d? Jesus says, \u201cThe words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\u201d But spiritual things are spiritually discerned, and the reason of your lack of interest is that you lack the Spirit of God.",
