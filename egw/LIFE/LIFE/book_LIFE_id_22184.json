    "word": "It is these revealings, these discoveries of God's goodness, that make the soul humble and lead it to cry out in gratitude, \"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me\" (Galatians 2:20). We have reason to be comforted. Severe outward trials may press around the soul where Jesus lives. Let us turn to Him for the consolations He has provided for us in His Word. The nether springs of hope and comfort may appear to fail us, but the upper springs which feed the river of God are full of supply and can never be dried up. God would have you look away from the cause of your afflictions to Him who is the Owner of soul, body, and spirit. He is the lover of the soul. He knows the value of the soul. He is the true Vine and we are the branches. We shall have no spiritual nourishment only as we draw it from Jesus who is the life of the soul.--Letter 10, Feb. 23, 1887, to Dr. J. H. Kellogg.",
