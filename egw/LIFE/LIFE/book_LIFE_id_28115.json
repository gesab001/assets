    "word": "But Christ pledged His own life in order that the transgressor might be spared, that man might have another trial. He would Himself stand in man's place; He would clothe Himself in the garb of humanity, and live the life of man from the very beginning. He would pass through the stages of infancy, childhood, youth, and manhood, that He might show man how he should live, how he should employ his hours of probation.",
