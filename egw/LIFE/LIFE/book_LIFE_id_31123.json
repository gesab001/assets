    "word": "Christ's life of humiliation should be a lesson to all who desire to exalt themselves above their fellow-men. Though he had no taint of sin upon his character, yet he condescended, to connect our fallen human nature with his divinity. By thus taking humanity, he honored humanity. Having taken our fallen nature, he showed what it might become, by accepting the ample provision he has made for it, and by becoming partaker of the divine nature.",
