    "word": "I want to understand more clearly the ways of God and the glorious plan of redemption, the extent and limitation of our accountability, and the weighty truths of the Word of God. I feel my own nothingness and that Jesus is all and in all. Let us come very near to God, advancing in the divine life step by step. The more grace we receive will enlarge our capacities to apprehend and enjoy greater light, breadth and depth of His love; and we shall have intense longing to know the fulness of that infinite love which passeth knowledge.",
