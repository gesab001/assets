    "word": "Many need to learn that it is one thing to assent to truth, and another thing to receive the truth as the bread of God, of which if a man eat, he shall live forever. Day by day we must feed upon the living bread that we may receive spiritual sustenance, as we partake of temporal food to give us physical strength. What is the bread of life? Jesus said, \"Whose eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, \n                                                                           1537\nand drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.\" He does not leave us to misunderstand him. \"He says, \"It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. The words of Christ are to be received with no half-hearted, weak, hesitating faith. The word gives light and assurance to all who educate their souls to believe. The heart needs the presence of the heavenly Guest,--Christ abiding in the soul. We are to dwell in Christ, and Christ is to dwell in us by faith.",
