    "word": "The Word of God is to be our spiritual food. \"I am that bread of life\" (John 6:48), Christ said. . . . The world is perishing for want of pure, unadulterated truth. Christ is the truth. His words are truth, and they have a deeper significance than appears on the surface, and a value beyond their unpretending appearance. Minds that are quickened by the Holy Spirit will discern the value of these words. When our eyes are anointed with the holy eyesalve, we shall be able to detect the precious gems of truth, even though they may be buried beneath the surface.",
