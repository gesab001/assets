    "word": "There is need of the tender sympathy of Christ in human hearts, - love for human beings when Christ has esteemed of such value that he gave his own life to save them from ruin. They are precious, more precious than any gold you can bring into the treasury. To turn every dollar and every penny into \"the cause\", and rob the needy of the means whereby to give bread to their family, is not a kind of faithfulness that will meet the approval of God. Now Has God told you that this brother must keep at work in a certain line, as canvassing, until he is free from debt? Has he not rather enjoined it upon you as a minister of Christ, to see how you could help him out of his distress, and encourage others to relieve him from debt, and then let him receive his convictions from God in regard to the work He has given him ability to do? Has the Lord a work for this brother to do for his colored brethren? If the Lord would have him labor for his brethren, how dare any human agent put up the restrictions or bar his way? Brother R. says that a sister offered to relieve him by paying his debts, but this was not allowed. How did you know but that the Lord was moving upon the mind and heart of that sister to do this very work? Let the oppressed go free. Jesus announced this to be his work; how do you know that it is not this sister's work? It is best for us to cling to Jesus, to cultivate his attributes, and do as he would do, were he in our \n                                                                           1273\nplace. There is a great deal involved in being Christians, living Christ, representing Christ.",
