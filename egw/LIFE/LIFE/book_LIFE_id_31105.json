    "word": "The end of all things is close upon us, but for some of us the end of our probation may be yet nearer. As you look upon your substantial, convenient establishment, as you see the good things of this life with which you are surrounded, I ask you to consider that these must all pass away. You yourself may soon be an inhabitant of the very narrow house to remain till called forth by the trump of God. As you, your wife, and your children, devote your thoughts to earthly things, \n                                                                           1503\nyour characters are receiving a worldly mould. As they are at death, such they will be in the morning of the resurrection. No conversion, no transformation of character, will be made then. How would you and your wife and children appear before the redeemed, holy throng, with your present tastes, habits, dress, thoughts, and words. Let every one of your poor, deceived family remember that the reaping time will be as the sowing time has been. None can sow tares and reap wheat.",
