    "word": "Many souls are hungering for the bread of life. Their cry is, \"Give me bread; do not give me a stone. It is bread that I want.\" Feed these perishing, starving souls. Let our ministers bear in mind that the strongest meat is not to be given to babes who know not the first principles of the truth as we believe it. In every age the Lord has had a special message for the people of that time; so we have a message for the people in this age. But while we have many things to say, we may be compelled to withhold some of them for a time, because the people are not prepared to receive them now.--Review and Herald, Oct. 14, 1902.",
