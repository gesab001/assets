    "word": "One of the greatest sins that is now extinguishing spiritual light is want of love for Jesus and one another. \"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.\" See the longing, yearning love of Jesus who presents to His people the attractions of the eternal life, that they may catch the glory of the future world, and regain their first love. It is not the fashion now to repent. It is regarded by some as altogether too humiliating a work, altogether too old-fashioned.",
