    "word": "Christ has died that we might keep God's commandments. Will you have your names registered in the Lamb's book of life? Then be careful and zealous to repent of every sin. He says, \"I will not blot out your name from the book of life, but I will confess it before My Father and His angels\" (Revelation 3:5). We want you to be happy here in order to be happy in the heaven above, and in order to be happy here you must make an entire surrender to God. And then, ask God to come into your heart and abide there, and by your example seek to glorify God.",
