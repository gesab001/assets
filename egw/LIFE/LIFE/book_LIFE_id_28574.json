    "word": "The great Medical Missionary was a wonderful healer. He worked the most convincing miracles. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He spoke only the truth. Continually there fell from His lips the precious words that bring spiritual strength to those who make them a part of the daily life. Spiritually we are built up from the food that we give the mind.",
