    "word": "In His sacrificial character, Christ reveals Himself as the Bread of Life. \"Whoso eateth My flesh,\" He declared to His disciples, \"and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life\" (John 6:54). Why is not He presented to the people as the Living Bread? Because He is not abiding in the hearts of many of those who think it their duty to preach the law. Christ is left out of their sermonizing, and from east to west, from north to south, the church has been starving for the bread of life.",
