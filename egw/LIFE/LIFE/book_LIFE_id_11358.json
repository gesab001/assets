    "word": "Truth Is a Working Principle.--Truth is an active, working principle, molding heart and life so that there is a constant upward movement. . . . In every step of climbing the will is obtaining a new spring of action. The moral tone is becoming more like the mind and character of Christ. The progressive Christian has grace and love which pass knowledge, for divine insight into the character of Christ takes a deep hold upon his affections. The glory of God revealed above the ladder can be appreciated only by the progressive climber, who is ever attracted higher, to nobler aims which Christ reveals. All the faculties of mind and body must be enlisted.--MS 13, 1884. (HC 68.)",
