    "word": "I am instructed to say to those who minister in word and doctrine, My brethren, you need a practical knowledge of genuine faith in God. There is a fearful lack of this faith among our people. Doubt and unbelief are gaining such power that the Lord can have no influence over our willful, stubborn hearts. The infinite, eternal, omniscient One can not move the hard hearts because men and women refuse to cast self out. Shall this want of faith, this lack of love and unity, continue to strengthen, until those in holy service become unholy and unsanctified, unkindly and miserable? Shall not the breath of life from Christ revive the spark of love for God and man? Unbelief is cruel. Evil thinking and evil speaking are the fruit of an evil tree. Love and faith and trust develop gentleness. Let the heart break before God in longing for true holiness.",
