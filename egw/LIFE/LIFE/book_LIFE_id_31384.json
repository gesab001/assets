    "word": "\"The sick may look to the great Healer as they do all that is possible to be done on their part, cooperating with Him who so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. He who would be healed must cease to transgress the law of God. He must cease to lead a life of sin. God cannot bless the one who continues to bring upon himself disease and suffering by neglecting and violating the laws of heaven. But the Holy Spirit comes with a healing power to those who cease to do evil and learn to do well.",
