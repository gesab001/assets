    "word": "It is a fearful thing to minister in sacred things when the heart and hands are not holy. To be a co-worker with Jesus Christ, involves fearful responsibilities. To stand as a representative of Christ is no small matter. The fearful realities of the Judgment will test every man's work. The apostles said, \"We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord;\" \"for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\" The sufficiency of the apostle was not in himself, but in the gracious influence of the Spirit of Christ which filled his soul, and brought every thought into subjection to the obedience of Christ. The power of truth attending the word preached, will be a savor of life unto life, or of death unto death. Ministers are required to be living examples of the mind and Spirit of Christ, living epistles, known and read of all men. I tremble when I consider that there are some ministers, even among Seventh-day \n                                                                           40\nAdventists, who are not sanctified by the truths which they preach. Nothing less than the quick and powerful Spirit of God working in the hearts of his messengers to give the knowledge of the glory of God, can gain for them the victory.",
