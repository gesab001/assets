    "word": "The subject of Christ's teaching and preaching was the Word of God. He met questioners with a plain, \"It is written.\" \"What saith the Scriptures?\" \"How readest thou?\" At every opportunity, when an interest was awakened by either friend or foe, He sowed the seed of the Word. He who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Himself the living Word, points to the Scriptures, saying, \"They are they which testify of Me.\" . . .",
