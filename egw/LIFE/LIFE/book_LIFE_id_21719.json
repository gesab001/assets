If so much could be endured, so much self-denial practiced, in the hope of gaining so worthless a prize, which only one at best could obtain, how much greater should be the sacrifice, how much more willing the self-denial, for an incorruptible crown, and for everlasting life!  {TSDF 181.10}  \n     There is work for us to do--stern, earnest work. All our habits, tastes, and inclinations must be \n\n182 \n\neducated in harmony with the laws of life and health.
