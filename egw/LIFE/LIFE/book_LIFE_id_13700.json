    "word": "Those who seek God in secret telling the Lord their needs and pleading for help, will not plead in vain. \u201cThy Father which seeth in secret Himself shall reward thee openly.\u201d As we make Christ our daily companion we shall feel that the powers of an unseen world are all around us; and by looking unto Jesus we shall become assimilated to His image. By beholding we become changed. The character is softened, refined, and ennobled for the heavenly kingdom. The sure result of our intercourse and fellowship with our Lord will be to increase piety, purity, and fervor. There will be a growing intelligence in prayer. We are receiving a divine education, and this is illustrated in a life of diligence and zeal.",
