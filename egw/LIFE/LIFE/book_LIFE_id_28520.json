    "word": "Since God has so loved us, we ought also to love one another. How much? Jesus said, \"This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you. Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He may give it you. These things I command you, that ye love one another\" [John 15:12-15]. Here we have a decided, positive command. We would ask, Who are doers of these words? Oh, that God may impart to His poor, needy children His Holy Spirit of love, that the prayer of Christ may be fulfilled in His people, and we all may be one as He is in the Father and the Father in Him. \n\n\n                                   -88-",
