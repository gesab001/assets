    "word": "God Can Mold the Disposition.--Whatever your disposition may be, God is able to so mold that disposition that it will be sweet and Christlike. By living faith you can separate from everything not in accordance with the mind of God, and thus bring a heaven into your life here below. Will you do this? If you do, you will have sunshine at every step.--MS 91, 1901.",
