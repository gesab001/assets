    "word": "Now, my brother and sister, will you not come into a different position in your family, that you may give the right lessons in religious life to your dear children, and become living epistles at home? By your circumspect conduct teach them to have solidity of character; for we are forming characters here for the future immortal life. Teach them to deny appetite, to be grateful for the plain, simple diet God gives them. It is not for you to allow them to dictate to you what they shall eat, but you should dictate to them what is best for them. It is a sin for you to allow your children to murmur and complain about good, wholesome food, just \n\n\n                        [33] \n\nbecause it does not suit their depraved appetites. Practice self-denial yourself. It is sin to use the Lord's money in selfish indulgence. I have been shown that the Lord has had pity upon you, and used you, not because you were defective in character, but in spite of these defects. He has connected you with himself, that through his grace you might perfect a Christian character. How much better service you could have done for the Master, whose servant you are, if you were well balanced and sound where now you are weak! Will you not remember that it is the Lord's money you are handling, and that he requires you to use it wisely? You must render an account to God for your expenses.",
