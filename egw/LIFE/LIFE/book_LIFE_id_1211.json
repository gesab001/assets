    "word": "Is it anything strange that one should do this or that under the conviction of the Spirit of God, under a sense of the fact that a refusal or neglect to do so would endanger the soul\u2019s salvation? Is this a matter hard to comprehend, that obedience on our part to all God\u2019s law is absolutely essential to eternal life? Is this an unfathomable mystery to the Christian\u2014to secure the soul\u2019s salvation at any cost to self or selfish interest? Does the Word of God give us any assurance that we can get to heaven just as well transgressing the law as obeying it? If so, the whole requirement of God as a condition of salvation is an entire mistake.",
