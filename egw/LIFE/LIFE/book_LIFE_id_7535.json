    "word": "Wycliffe was one of the greatest of the reformers. In breadth of intellect, in clearness of thought, in firmness to maintain the truth, and boldness to defend it, he was equaled by few who came after him. Purity of life, unwearying diligence in study and in labor, incorruptible integrity, and Christ-like love and faithfulness in his ministry, characterized the first of the reformers. And this notwithstanding the intellectual darkness and moral corruption of the age from which he emerged.",
