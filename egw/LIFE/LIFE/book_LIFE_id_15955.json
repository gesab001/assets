    "word": "Chapter 12 \n\n     1 (Colossians 3:8). Who Are the Witnesses?--[Hebrews 12:1 quoted.] The weights that are here referred to are the evil habits and practices we have formed by following our own natural dispositions. Who are the witnesses? They are those spoken of in the previous chapter--those who have breasted the evils and difficulties in their way, and who in the name of the Lord have braced themselves successfully against the opposing forces of evil. They were sustained and strengthened and the Lord held them by His hand.  {7BC 934.10}  \n     There are other witnesses. All about us are those who are watching us closely, to see how we who profess a belief in the truth conduct ourselves. At all times and in all places, so far as possible, we must magnify the truth before the world (MS 61, 1907).  {7BC 934.11}  \n     3. See EGW on ch. 2:14.  {7BC 934.12} \n     4. See EGW on ch. 4:15; Matthew 4:1-11.  {7BC 934.13} \n     11 (James 1:2, 3; 1 Peter 1:6, 7). Blossoms Which Mature Amidst Clouds.--Faith, patience, forbearance, heavenly-mindedness, trust in your wise, heavenly Father, are the perfect blossoms which mature amidst clouds and disappointments and bereavements (Letter 1, 1883).  {7BC 934.14}  \n     12, 13. See EGW on Galatians 6:1, 2.  {7BC 934.15}  \n     14. See EGW on Romans 6:19, 22; Ephesians 4:20-24.  {7BC 934.16}  \n     15. See EGW on James 3:15, 16; 1 Peter 2:1, 2.  {7BC 934.17}  \n     16, 17. See EGW on Genesis 25:29-34.  {7BC 934.18}  \n     24. See EGW on ch. 8:5-13.  {7BC 934.19} \n     26, 27. See EGW on 2 Thessalonians 2:7-12.  {7BC 934.20} \n \n                           Chapter 13 \n\n     11-13 (Galatians 3:13). He Suffered Without the Camp.--As Adam and Eve were banished from Eden for transgressing the law of God, so Christ was to suffer without the boundaries of the holy place. He died outside the camp, where felons and murderers were executed. There He trod the winepress alone, bearing the penalty that should have fallen on the sinner. How deep and full of significance are the words, \"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.\" He went forth without the camp, thus showing that He gave His life not only for the Jewish nation, but for the whole world (YI June 28, 1900).  {7BC 934.21}  \n     Christ Died for All Mankind.--Christ suffered without the gates of Jerusalem, for Calvary was outside the city walls. This was to show that He died, not for the Hebrews alone, but for all mankind. He proclaims to a fallen world that He is their Redeemer, and urges them to accept the salvation He offers (SW Sept. 4, 1906).  {7BC 934.22}  \n     12. See EGW on 1 Timothy 2:5.  {7BC 934.23}  \n     15. See EGW on Romans 8:34.  {7BC 934.24}  \n     20 (ch. 8:5-13, 6, 7; see EGW on ch. 9:14). The Everlasting Covenant of Mercy.--Let those who are oppressed under a sense of sin remember that there is hope for them. The salvation of the human race has ever been the object of the councils of heaven. The covenant of mercy was made before the foundation of the world. It has existed from all eternity, and is called the everlasting covenant. So surely as there never was a time when God was not, so surely there never was a moment when it was not the delight of the eternal mind to manifest His grace to humanity (ST June 12, 1901).  {7BC 934.25} \n\nJames\n\n\n\n                               Chapter 1 \n\n     2, 3.
