    "word": "Sister Ross' past life has not been of that character that her experience could be a blessing to others. She has not lived up to her convictions of conscience. Her conscience has been too many times violated. She has been a pleasure seeker, and given her life to vanity, frivolities, and fashion, in face of the light of truth which has shone upon her pathway. She knew the way, but neglected to walk in it. \n                                                                           83\nThe Lord gave sister Ross a testimony of warning and reproof. She believed the testimony, and separated herself from that class who were lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. Then, as she viewed her past life, so full of wrongs and neglect, she gave up to unbelief and stolid gloom. Despair spread its dark wings over her. Her marriage with Bro. Ross changed the order of things somewhat. At times since she has been very gloomy and desponding.",
