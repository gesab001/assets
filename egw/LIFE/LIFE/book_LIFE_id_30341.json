    "word": "We need to ask ourselves the question, What shall I do to inherit eternal life? Christ gave His own life that the transgressor of the law should not suffer the penalty of the law, that as our Redeemer He might stand before the Father with pierced, uplifted hands, and say, \"Lay their sins on Me. I am responsible for them. I will bear their transgressions. I have graven them upon the palms of My hands.\" The sinner may be pardoned if he accepts Christ as a personal Saviour. There is only one condition--the acceptance of the robe of Christ's righteousness.",
