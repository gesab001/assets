    "word": "Here is a promise that is for every one of you. If you live on the plan of addition, adding grace to grace, you are growing up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and you may find in this promise an eternal life insurance policy. This is a promise that will stand the test. It is worth far more than any life insurance policy that can be purchased with money. It is a policy that has been provided by God Himself in giving His only, beloved Son that through belief in Him, through accepting of His great sacrifice, you may obtain everlasting life. Having gained the victory, you may enter in through the gates of the city of God and receive an immortal crown. \n\n\n                                    -290-",
