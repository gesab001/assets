    "word": "The guardians of this institution are so devoid of the Spirit of God as to feel the best harmony with the Lord's worst enemies. Elder E stated of one of this class that he loved him as a brother. Why was this? Because of his smooth words and fair speeches. The man was working to carry out the artifice of his master. He was keeping the favor of a man who had the highest opinion of his own opinions and plans. He did not feel the necessity of counseling at every step. He did not see the need of constant watchfulness and prayer, of walking humbly with God, and learning from the great Teacher the meekness and lowliness He exemplified in His life. No, he did not want discerning eyes in that sanitarium to see and sense the wrong. God was daily dishonored. Warnings and reproofs were unheeded and there was a pretense, a form of religion, but God was displeased; for all the time they were casting His words behind them.",
