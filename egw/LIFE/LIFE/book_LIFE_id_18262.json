    "word": "No Moral Right to Do as You Please.--Have I not a right to do as I please with my own body?--No, you have no moral right, because you are violating the laws of life and health which God has given you. You are the Lord's property, His by creation and His by redemption. \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" The law of self-respect and for the property of the Lord is here brought to view. And this will lead to respect for the obligations which every human being is under to preserve the living machinery that is so fearfully and wonderfully made.--Manuscript 49, 1897.",
