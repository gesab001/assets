    "word": "Truth held in unrighteousness is the greatest curse that can come to our world. But the truth as it is in Jesus is a savor of life unto life. It is worth possessing, worth practicing, worth defending. Christ calls upon us to enter the pathway of self-denial, where every step means a denial of appetite and unholy lust. He calls upon us to stand upon the platform of eternal truth and contend, yes, contend earnestly, for the faith once delivered to the saints.",
