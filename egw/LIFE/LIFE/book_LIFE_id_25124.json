    "word": "Their unbelief and malice increased. Satan controlled their minds, and they cried out against him with wrath and hatred. Their assembly broke up, and they laid hands upon Jesus, and thrust him out of the synagogue, out of their city, and would have rid the world of his presence, had they had power so to do. All seemed eager to act a part in destroying him. They hurried him to the brow of a steep precipice, intending to cast him headlong. Their hands, they thought, were upon him. Some were crying one thing, some another. Some were casting stones and dirt at him; but suddenly he disappeared out of their midst, they knew not how, or when. Angels of God attended Jesus in the midst of that infuriated mob, and preserved his life. The heavenly messengers were by his side in the synagogue, while he was speaking; and they accompanied him when pressed and urged on by the unbelieving, infuriated Jews. These angels blinded the eyes of that maddened throng, and they conducted Jesus to a place of safety.",
