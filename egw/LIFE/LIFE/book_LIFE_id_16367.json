    "word": "The Bible is our guide in the safe paths that lead to eternal life. God has inspired men to write that which will present the truth to us, which will attract, and which, if practised, will enable the receiver to obtain moral power to rank among the most highly educated minds. The minds of all who make the Word of God their study will enlarge. Far more than any other study, this is of a nature to increase the powers of comprehension, and endow every faculty with new vigor. . . . It brings us into close connection with all heaven, imparting wisdom, and knowledge, and understanding. . . . The gospel is adapted for spiritual food, to satisfy man's spiritual appetite. In every case it is just what man needs. \n                                                                           71",
