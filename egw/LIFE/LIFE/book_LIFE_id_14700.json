    "word": "The Dead Still Speak \n\n     At half past two o'clock P.M. I spoke to a full house [at Adams Center, N.Y.].... We were gratified to meet the aged servants of God on this occasion.  We have been acquainted from the rise of the third angel's message with Elder [Frederick] Wheeler, who is now nearing eighty years.  We have been acquainted with Elders [H. H.] Wilcox and [Chas. O.] Taylor for the last forty years.  Age is telling on these old standard-bearers, as well as upon me.  If we are faithful to the end the Lord will give us a crown of life that fadeth not away.",
