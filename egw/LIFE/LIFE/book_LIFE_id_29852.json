    "word": "I am instructed to say that sufficient carefulness has not been shown in regard to the material which has been brought to the foundation-stone. \"If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.\" Who does not desire then to be faithful in cooperating with Christ? \"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire\" [verse 15]. If he sees his wrong and sincerely repents, he will save himself, but his lifework is a failure.",
