    "word": "All who love God and are loyal to His government will be tempted to change leaders. But God has said, \"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.\" \"Thou shalt love the Lord God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and they neighbor as thyself.\" The Lord accepts no half heart. He demands the whole man. Religion is to be brought into every phase of life, carried into labor of every kind. The whole man is to come under God's control. He must not suppose that he can take supervision of his own thoughts. They must be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. Self cannot manage self; it is not sufficient for the work. Whoever tries to do this will be worsted. God alone can make and keep us loyal. \n\n\n                                   -366-",
