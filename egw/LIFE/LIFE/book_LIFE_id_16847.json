    "word": "I was speaking to the teachers in messages of reproof. All the teachers need exercise, a change of employment. God has pointed out what this should be--useful, practical work; but you have turned away from God's plan, to follow human inventions, and that to the detriment of spiritual life. Not a jot or tittle of the after-influence of an education in that line will fit you to meet the severe conflicts in these last days. What kind of education are our teachers and students receiving? Has God devised and planned this kind of exercise for you, or is it brought in by the human inventions and human imaginations? How is the mind prepared for contemplation and meditation, and serious thoughts, and the earnest, contrite prayer, coming from hearts subdued by the Holy Spirit of God? \"As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man.\" \"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\"",
