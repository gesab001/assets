    "word": "My dear brother, I am very thankful that you are in the Review and Herald office. If you walk humbly with God, be assured that the Lord will give you favor with all with whom you associate. Let Frank Belden die. Let the life which you now live in the flesh be wholly consecrated to God. He gave His life for you. Give your life for Him. My soul yearns for you, that you may be perfecting a Christian character. The Lord loves you, and has given you an opportunity of again passing over the ground you passed over before. My brother, you can do a good work if you will be taught by the greatest Teacher the world has ever known.--Letter 81, 1899, pp. 1-3. (To Frank Belden, May 8, 1899.) \n\n\n                                   -138-",
