    "word": "Chap. 5 - The Role of Parents\n\n     Home a School for Speech Culture--It is the work of parents to train their children to proper habits of speech. The very best school for this culture is the home life. From the earliest years the children should be taught to speak respectfully and lovingly to their parents and to one another. They should be taught that only words of gentleness, truth, and purity must pass their lips. Let the parents themselves be daily learners in the school of Christ. Then by precept and example they can teach their children the use of \"sound speech, that cannot be condemned.\" Titus 2:8. This is one of the greatest and most responsible of their duties.--COL 337, 338.",
