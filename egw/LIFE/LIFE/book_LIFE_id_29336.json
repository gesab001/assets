    "word": "It is a very sad thing for you to have departed from God's commandments. The Lord loves your mother, and she needs the help which you could give her; she needs the help which . . . [your brother] can give her. These elder brothers should stand firm as a rock to principle, and be counsellors to the younger members of the family. Both of you are needed, and you should do all in your power to relieve your mother of unnecessary burdens. Her life has been one of storm and wrestling, sorrow and keen anguish. You cannot appreciate this as I can, for I have seen it. Honor your mother and sustain her influence, for God is with her. Refuse not to be illuminated with the light which irradiates all who will walk in the light of the Sun of Righteousness. Grovel not amid material things, neglecting the spiritual and heavenly. Do not lose sight of eternity. The end is near; make no delay. \n\n\n                                    -392-",
