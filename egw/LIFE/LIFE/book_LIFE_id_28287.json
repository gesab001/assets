    "word": "As you openly renounced sin and Satan, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost pledged themselves to be your sufficiency. As you forsook sin and became dead to the world, you were raised to newness of life by the power which raised Christ from the dead. You came forth from the watery grave, pledged by the solemn covenant of baptism to devote your life to the service of God. You are henceforth to live a new life, as if reason, knowledge, affection, speech, property, had been anew entrusted to you, with a distinct declaration from the Word of God that these gifts are to be recognized as coming from Christ, to be used and improved for Him. You are to take up the life of cross-bearing, cheerfully partaking of the sufferings of Christ. Your life is to be bound up with the life of Christ in obedience to the law of God.",
