    "word": "With every truly converted soul the relation to God and to eternal things will be the great topic of life. . . . Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the earth there will be among the people of the Lord such a revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times. The Spirit and power of God will be poured out upon His children. At that time many will separate themselves from those churches in which the love of this world has supplanted love for God and His Word. Many, both of ministers and people, will gladly accept those great truths which God has caused to be proclaimed\n9\nat this time to prepare a people for the Lord's second coming.",
