    "word": "Consecration is a very simple thing when brought daily into our individual life in practice, but it is our spiritual power. We shall know far more by consecration daily than by trusting to our experience. Each day, each hour, let the heart go out after God: \"Here, Lord, am I, Thy property; take me, use me today. I lay all my plans at Thy feet; I will have no way of my own in the matter. My time is Thine; my whole life is Thine. Thou hast bought me with a price.\" Let the heart be constantly going forth to God for strength, for grace every moment.",
