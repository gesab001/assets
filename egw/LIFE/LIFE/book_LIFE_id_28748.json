    "word": "Jesus is our example in all things. His influence was broad and extended. No teacher ever placed such signal honor upon man as did our Lord and Master. He was known as a \"friend of publicans and sinners.\" He mingled with all classes of society that all might partake of the blessings He came to bestow. He was found in the synagogues and in the marketplaces. He shared the social life of His countrymen, gladdening with His presence the households of all who invited Him. But He never urged His way uninvited. He was active to relieve every species of human misery that was brought to Him in faith for relief; but He did not bestow healing power indiscriminately where there was manifested an independence and selfish exclusiveness that would give no expression to their sorrows nor ask for the help so much needed. All who came unto Him in faith He was ready and willing to relieve. Sorrow fled at His presence; injustice and oppression withered beneath His rebukes; and death and hell, the cruel spoilers of our sinful race, humbled themselves before Him and obeyed His commands.",
