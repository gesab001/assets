    "word": "I again entreat of you to remain where you are during the Week of Prayer. The Bible, the Bible alone, laid up in the heart and blessed by the Spirit of God, can make man right and keep him right. All that I may say will have no weight with you or your wife unless a work is wrought upon your heart. You will make objections to the testimonies, and unless the Spirit of God shall have a controlling power, conscience will be warped. The heart, the fountain of the issues of life, is kept only when the word of God is brought into the soul, and rules there. The very position you have occupied will now prove a temptation to you, to keep you from seeking the Lord with all your heart. You are a very firm, determined man, not inclined to make any confession. There is a pride of soul that has not been crucified. I beg of you, if you have difficulties, come with them. I know your danger; you do not know it, but it is great. I want you to attend this Week of Prayer. I want you to free yourself from Satan's grasp. Now I love you both, but I dare not hold my peace, as I see you under temptation, just as weak as any other man. I beg of you to come and let us seek God together. You are not right with God. You are not in harmony with the Spirit of Christ. You have a large amount of self that is holding you away from God.",
