    "word": "This is the time that all we do in the cause and work of God must be \"without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.\" The present state of the church is far behind the correct standard, and the backsliding has been so gradual and so imperceptible that it is a hard matter to represent its true, lamentable condition. The members of the church seem to settle in so low a grade that no power but the Lord God of Heaven can place her where the evil shall be seen and corrected. There are existing evils in the church which no human power can heal. We must hold the standard high, and then in our own words and attitude and actions represent \"the One altogether lovely.\" All misapprehension produces unkindness consciously or unconsciously, and then unkindness provokes retaliations, and strife propagates itself. I am thankful that Christ has given us such a clear, definite expression of His will that if we will to do the will of God, we shall not fail to know of the doctrine whether it be of God. We need the divine virtues brought into our life constantly.",
