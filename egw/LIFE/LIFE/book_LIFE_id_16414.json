    "word": "Constantly we behold Him who lived among men a life of perfect obedience. The more closely we behold Him, the more nearly we shall resemble Him in character, and the greater will be our efficiency in working for others. We shall be lifted far above the trials and perplexities of this life. . . . Self is to be hidden. Christ alone is to appear, full of grace and truth. . . .",
