    "word": "I have had many burdens to bear for the Southern field. I have presented the needs of this field before our men of responsibility, yet the South is neglected. The work that should have been done is not done. More than ten years ago I was shown that the Lord would open the way before them if our men in responsibility would place themselves where the Lord could use them. The workers are not to depend upon the men at the head of the work to set their burdens for them. They are to look to the Lord for an understanding of their responsibilities. He is to be their life and their eternal dependence.",
