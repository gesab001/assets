    "word": "God wants us to go right to the people, realizing that they have souls to save or to lose, and tell them that you desire them to have a life that measures with the life of God--an eternal life in the kingdom of glory. Then you may sit down with them and ask them if they will listen to some precious truths from the Scriptures. But few will refuse you, and then you will have an opportunity to open to them the glorious gospel message.",
