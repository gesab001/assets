    "word": "God declared, \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die\" (Ezekiel 18:4). And apart from the plan of redemption human beings are doomed to death. \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). But Christ gave His life to save the sinner from the death sentence. He died that we might live. To those who receive Him He gives power that enables them to separate from that which, unless they return to their loyalty, will place them where they must be condemned and punished.",
