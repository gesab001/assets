    "word": "Men will never reach the spiritual or intellectual heights that God wishes them to attain, until they become partakers of the divine nature. They may gain a measure of intellectual power; but of what use is intellectual strength without spiritual power? Man, in all his moral degradation may be made pure and unselfish, and he may bear in his life the divine credentials.--Manuscript 18, 1892, pp. 2, 7. (\"Bought With a Price,\" December, 1892.)",
