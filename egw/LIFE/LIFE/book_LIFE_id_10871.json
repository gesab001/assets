    "word": "I cannot see why we should not the more earnestly try to bring the peace of Christ right into our family than to labor for those that have no living connection with us; but if we have religion in the home, it will extend outside of the home. You will have it everywhere. \n\n176 \n\nYou will carry it with you to the church. You can carry it with you when you go out to your work. It will be with you wherever you shall be. What we want is religion in the home. What we need is the peace principle which shall control our spirit and our life and character after the Christlife He has given as His example.--MS 36, 1891.",
