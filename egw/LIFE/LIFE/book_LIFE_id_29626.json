Do all things without murmurings and disputings: that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain\" [Philippians 2:12-16].",
