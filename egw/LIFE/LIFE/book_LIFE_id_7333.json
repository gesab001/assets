    "word": "The Love of God \n\n     Through the love of God the treasures of the grace of Christ have been laid open before the church and the world. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" [John 3:16.] What marvelous, unfathomable love, which led Christ to die for us while we were yet sinners! And what a loss the soul suffers who, understanding the strong claims of the law, fails to acknowledge that where sin abounds, the grace of Christ does much more abound!",
