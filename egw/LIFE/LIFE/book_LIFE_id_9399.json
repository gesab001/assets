    "word": "Have you so deep an appreciation of the sacrifice made on Calvary that you are willing to make every other interest subordinate to the work of saving souls?

He delights to consecrate all that he has and is to the Master's service. He is moved by an inexpressible desire to win souls to Christ. . . .",
