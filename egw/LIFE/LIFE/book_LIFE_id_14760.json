But I am instructed to say to you and to others, that laborers often bring upon themselves greater taxation than is required.  The counsel given is, Cut the discourses short.  Were a long discourse divided, and only one-half given, it would be better retained in the minds of the hearers than the whole of a long discourse.  This counsel belongs to me as well as to you.  Except when I have a special message to bear, I am determined to speak briefly because it is best.",
