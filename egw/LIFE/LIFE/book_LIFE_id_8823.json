    "word": "Hearts that respond to the influence of the Holy Spirit are the channels through which God's blessings flow. Were those who serve God removed from the earth, and His Spirit withdrawn from among men, this earth would be left to desolation and destruction. Though the wicked know it not, they owe even the blessings of this life to the presence in this world of God's people, whom they despise and oppress. . . . Following the instruction of Christ brings the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and this enables men and women to reveal . . . the fragrance and the saving grace of the truth. . . .",
