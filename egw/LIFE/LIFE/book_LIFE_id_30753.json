    "word": "\"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.\" Can we comprehend the meaning of these words? can we taken it in? Can we measure this love? The thought that God loves us as he loves his Son should bring us in gratitude and praise to him. Provision has been made whereby God can love us as he loves his Son, and it is through our oneness with Christ and with each other. We must each come to the fountain and drink for ourselves. A thousand around us may take of the stream of salvation, but we shall not be refreshed unless we drink of the healing stream ourselves. We must see the beauty, the light of God's word for ourselves, and kindle our taper at the divine altar, that we may go to the world, holding forth the word of life as a bright, shining lamp. Those who do not come to God's word for light for themselves, will have no light to diffuse to others.",
