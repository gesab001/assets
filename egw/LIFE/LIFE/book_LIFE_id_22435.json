    "word": "With this lesson before us, let us hide ourselves in Christ. He is the source of all wisdom, all intelligence, all power. Behold in the cross of Christ the only guarantee for our salvation. Behold the Saviour giving His life for us, that we might be Christians. Those who strive to live the life of a Christian are battling against the devil's lie. Can we doubt the result of this conflict? God lives, God reigns, and daily He is working His miracles. \"They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts\" (Galatians 5:24). Before the world and the heavenly universe they give evidence that they are trying to live out the words, \"Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; . . . think on these things\" (Philippians 4:8).",
