    "word": "The word of life is that by which the Christian is to live. From this word we are to receive a continually increasing knowledge of truth. From it we are to gain light, purity, goodness, and a faith which works by love and purifies the soul. It is given us that we may be redeemed and presented faultless before the throne of divine glory. Wondrous victory, gained by Christ in man's behalf!--Letter 60, April 21, 1900, to a young man seeking Ellen White's counsel.",
