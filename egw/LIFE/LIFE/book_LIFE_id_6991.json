    "word": "\"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things\" (Romans 8:32)? Let us appreciate the great sacrifice that God has made in our behalf. There will never be a time when we shall be more welcome to the gifts of His grace than now. Christ gave His life for men, that they might know how He loved them. He does not want any to perish, but longs to see all coming to repentance. All who will surrender the will to Him may have the life that measures with the life of God. . . . The sword of justice fell upon Him that they might go free. He died that they might live. . . .",
