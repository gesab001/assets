    "word": "But not so did prophets and apostles regard the holy law of God. Said David, \u201cI will walk at liberty; for I seek thy precepts.\u201d [Psalm 119:45.] The apostle James, who wrote after the death of Christ, refers to the decalogue as the \u201croyal law,\u201d and the \u201cperfect law of liberty.\u201d [James 2:8; 1:25.] And the Revelator, half a century after the crucifixion, pronounces a blessing upon them \u201cthat do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\u201d [Revelation 22:14.]",
