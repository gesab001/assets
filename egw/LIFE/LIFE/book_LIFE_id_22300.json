    "word": "The Lord judges a man's character by the principles on which he acts in dealing with his fellow men. If in common business transactions his principles are defective, the same will be brought into his spiritual service for God. The threads are woven into his whole religious life. If you have too much dignity to work for yourself for small wages, then work for the Master; give the proceeds into the Lord's treasury. Make an offering of gratitude to God for sparing your life. But do not on any account be idle.--Manuscript 20, June 1, 1896.",
