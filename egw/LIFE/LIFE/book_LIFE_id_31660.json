    "word": "Denying Christ \n\n     We may deny Christ in our life by indulging love of ease or love of self, by jesting and joking, and by seeking the honor of the world. We may deny Him in our outward appearance, by conformity to the world, by a proud look or costly apparel. Only by constant watchfulness and persevering and almost unceasing prayer, shall we be able to exhibit in our life the character of Christ or the sanctifying influence of the truth.-- 1T 304.",
