WHITE AS A THIRTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE LIVELY BOYS, CARRYING THE HOUSEHOLD BURDENS, WRITING, TRAVELING, AND PREACHING, AND AT THE SAME TIME ASSISTING THOSE AROUND HER WHO WERE SUFFERING OR IN NEED. THROUGH THE NINETIES WE OBSERVE HER IN AUSTRALIA DURING A PERIOD OF SEVERE AND PROLONGED DEPRESSION, WITH HEART-BREAKING NEEDS ON EVERY SIDE. WITH THESE THE READER WILL ALSO FIND A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS WHICH HELP TO TRACE THE THREAD OF HER WELFARE ACTIVITIES THROUGH HER ENTIRE LIFE.",
