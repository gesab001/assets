    "word": "We should study how to render to God the most perfect service by constantly seeking to reach perfection. In the day of God it will be seen that while many have carried heavy loads of care and weighty responsibility that have cut short their usefulness and their life, this sacrifice was because there were so many who were not doing the work which God had left for them to do. There are so many slothful servants. If they had educated and trained their powers, they could have proved themselves to be trustworthy servants, true standard bearers, and there would be no question about placing responsibility upon them. Heroic effort and patient endurance is necessary to be cultivated by every son and daughter of God, that when called into active service they will not faint or fail.",
