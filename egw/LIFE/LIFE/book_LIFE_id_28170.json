    "word": "Christ was one with the Father. He loved His church, and gave Himself for it. \"Therefore doth My Father love Me,\" He said to the cavilling scribes and Pharisees, \"because I lay down My life, that I might take it again\" [John 10:17]. \"He saved others; Himself He cannot save\" [Matthew 27:42], was the mocking taunt hurled at Him during the agonies of His death on the cross. At any moment He could have saved Himself, and come down from the cross, but had He done this, the world would have been given over to the control of the great apostate.",
