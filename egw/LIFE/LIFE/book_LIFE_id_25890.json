    "word": "I have felt alarmed for you for some time because of your use of tea and wines. Of all others, you should touch not, taste not, handle not, anything like tea, coffee, wine, beer, brandy, or any stimulus. You are of a nature that you cannot safely use anything of that order. Your preaching to others is not in harmony with your practice. This is against you, and leaves a doubtful impression upon minds in regard to the ministry. Your case is presented before them, and the supposition in their minds is that other ministers indulge in these things, as you do yourself. To cover and excuse yourself, you have misled others by misstating me. I do not preach one thing and practice another. I do not present to my hearers rules of life for them to follow, while I make an exception in my own case. You are a man \n\n\n                        [55] \n\nwho should never use tea, coffee, brandy, or wine. Your nervous temperament will become unduly excited, and be followed by corresponding depression. It is perilous for you to educate your tastes and stimulate your nerves, for you are in serious danger of depending on these stimulants and working upon them. The habit of taking stimulants may become second nature and pave the way for you to become a drunkard. You may start back, and feel bitter towards me because I say these things to you, but let me tell you, you have accustomed yourself to these indulgences because you felt that you must have them for their immediate stimulating properties.",
