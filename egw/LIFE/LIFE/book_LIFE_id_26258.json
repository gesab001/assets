    "word": "Do Not Let Others Discourage You From \n       Taking Part in This Work \n\n\n     Some may say, \"If I were to engage in this sort of work, some connected with the church would discountenance me.\" What if they should? Christ has said, \"Thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward.\" We have no greater encouragement than this; we are to seek to save those who are willing to be saved. We are to bring the truth before those who will hear it. Our own souls must be filled with a love for the truth. And as we do our part faithfully, Christ will acknowledge our efforts, and add his signal blessing. And oh, what a reward awaits the winner of souls! When the gates of that beautiful city on high are swung back on their glittering hinges, and the nations that have kept the truth shall enter in, crowns of glory will be placed on their heads, and they will ascribe honor and glory and majesty to God. And at that time some will come to you, and will say, If it had not been for the words you spoke to me in kindness, \n\n\n                   -14- \n\nif it had not been for your tears and supplications and earnest efforts, I should never have seen the King in his beauty. What a reward is this! How insignificant in comparison with the infinite rewards that await the faithful in the future, immortal life!",
