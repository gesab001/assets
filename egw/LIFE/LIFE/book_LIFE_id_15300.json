    "word": "Oh, how much good might be accomplished if all who have the truth, the Word of life, would labor for the enlightenment of those who have it not. When the Samaritans came to Christ at the call of the Samaritan woman, Christ spoke of them to His disciples as a field of grain ready for harvesting. \"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?\" He said, \"Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest\" (John 4:35). Christ abode with the Samaritans for two days; for they were hungry to hear the truth. And what busy days they were! As a result of those days of labor, \"many more believed because of his own word\" (John 4:41). This was their testimony: \"We have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world\" (John 4:42).",
