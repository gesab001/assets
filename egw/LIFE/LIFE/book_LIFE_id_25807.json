    "word": "Lift Up Christ. \n\n     We must expect to meet opposition and unbelief. The truth has always had to meet these elements. In the days of Christ, the scribes and Pharisees were filled with opposition to his work. When it was declared that \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,\" they were as full of criticism and prejudice at this statement as are the people today when they hear the doctrines held by the Seventh-day Adventists. We shall have to meet people as full of hatred to our work as were the priests and rulers in the days of Christ to his work.",
