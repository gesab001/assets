    "word": "God has been working in your behalf. I know this, for the Lord hath revealed it. But you have need to exercise faith and patience and long-forbearance toward those who are not ready to rejoice over the finding of the lost sheep who is so precious to the true Shepherd. The true Shepherd has given His life for the sheep, and He calls upon all His friends and neighbors to rejoice with Him. He says, \"My sheep that was lost is found, My son that was dead is alive again.\" The kingdom and the work of Christ is not after the similitude of the world's modes and practices. It is [a] dominion of principles originating from the character of God. The prophecies plainly predict that His kingdom is not to be after the order of any earthly government, but is to stand in the world reflecting His sufficiency, completeness, and perfection.",
