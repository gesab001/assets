    "word": "Sufficient light was given to the Jewish people so that they might have known \"the time of their visitation.\" God had sent them \"the way, the truth, and the life,\" in the gift of His Son. Christ came as the messenger of Jehovah, and His path was marked with blessings. He was sent to make known the Father. His whole life to its final sacrifice was a revelation of God to men. Calvary itself announced Him, \"the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.\" From Christ, the Light of the world, shone forth the clear, bright beams of His Father's glory. Yet the Jews comprehended it not.",
