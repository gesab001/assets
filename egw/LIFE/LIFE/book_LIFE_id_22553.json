The heart that is deceived by Satan, looks upon God as a tyrannical, relentless being; the selfish characteristics of humanity, even of Satan himself, are attributed to the loving Creator. \"Thou thoughtest,\" He says, \"that I was altogether such an one as thyself.\" Psalm 50:21. His providences are interpreted as the expression of an arbitrary, vindictive nature. So with the Bible, the treasure house of the riches of His grace. The glory of its truths, that are as high as heaven and compass eternity, is undiscerned. To the great mass of mankind, Christ Himself is \"as a root out of a dry ground,\" and they see in Him \"no beauty that\" they \"should desire Him.\" Isaiah 53:2.
