I have written you a little bit every mail we heard of that went to Australia, and when Brother Linden went, sent you a letter and manuscript for Fanny and Marian--some on life of Christ and some for Fanny. That on life of Christ can be used for articles for the paper.--Letter 133, 1893, p. 3. \n\n\n                                  -28-",
