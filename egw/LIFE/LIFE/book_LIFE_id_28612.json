    "word": "Daniel, we entreat of you to set your heart in order that you will no longer be as a target continually being wounded. You have a determined will that is hard to bend. A few times in your life you have made a surrender to God, and you need to make that surrender again. Whenever your ideas are crossed, however perverted, then you lose that self-control so elevated and noble in the Christian character; you become untamable, unreasonable. Your self-love and independence become so strong [that] there is not one in your house or in connection with you who does not feel your presence and arbitrary power that will permit no liberty of conscience. By this course you alienate your brethren and even your own kindred from you. You force them to take a position at variance with you, and then you feel that they abuse you. Your own course pursued brought around these results. Your brethren saw these defects, that should you carry out your mind the results would be disastrous to the cause of God.",
