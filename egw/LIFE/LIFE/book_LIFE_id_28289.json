    "word": "Let those who have been baptized be true to the vow they have made. \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God\" [Colossians 3:1]. You cannot serve God and mammon. If God be God, follow Him; if Baal, then follow him. No one is compelled to serve God. The full results of a man's choice rest upon himself, for he chooses of his own free will. Let him remember that if he chooses the principles of God, respecting and maintaining them, they become a part of his life, molding him according to the divine similitude. They are in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.",
