    "word": "I left the meeting before it closed, in company with Sister Peck, and rode to Stanmore. I retired to rest \n\n\n                                     -299- \n\nabout eleven p.m., but my mind had brought with me the burden for the souls of the church members in Ashfield. Oh, how my heart ached! I felt at times in an agony of spirit. I could not obtain sleep until two o'clock a.m. The privileges that are now ours seem so large and abundant, but truth must be brought into the practical life, and each be doers of the Word else it will not sanctify and save the soul. We must cooperate with all our faculties with the Lord Jesus Christ. He says, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me\" [Isaiah 27:5]. Man is utterly dependent upon God. Christ says, \"Without Me ye can do nothing\" [John 15:5]. We must cooperate with God if we do His Word.",
