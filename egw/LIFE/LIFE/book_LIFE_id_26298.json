    "word": "Grapple with Great Themes \n\n\n     My brethren, the value of the evidences of truth that we have received during the past half century, is above estimate. These evidences are as treasure hidden in a field. Search for them. Study the Bible truths that for fifty years have been calling us out from the world. Present this evidence in clear, plain lines. Those who have been long in the truth and those who have recently received the truth must now dig for the buried heavenly treasure. Let every man work to the point. Study the word of God. Revive the evidences given in the past. \"Search the Scriptures,\" Christ said; \"for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of Me.\"",
