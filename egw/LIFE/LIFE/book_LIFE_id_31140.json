    "word": "Are acceptable spiritual sacrifices made to God when men who are placed in positions of great responsibility magnify themselves, and dishonor God? This has been done, and God looks upon their course with displeasure. Instead of growing up into Christ, their living head, in all things manifesting his divine attributes to the world, they have grown earthward. Self has been regarded as of great importance, and selfishness has attached itself to their work. Devotion to God has not been seen; spiritual life in Jesus Christ has not been developed.",
