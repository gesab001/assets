    "word": "How particular are you men of business that all your business transactions are made according to law. How careful are you that you shall not invest your money and it prove to be a bad investment. Well; these business matters only relate to temporal matters but here the matter which concerns our eternal interest is such as will last through eternity. And it is not safe to run any risk in regard to our soul's salvation. We want an intelligent knowledge upon that which pertains to our eternal welfare. There is an eternal reward that is presented to those that shall find eternal life.",
