He who was sinless, the perfection of heaven, came to our world in human likeness to reach humanity. When He came, He ranked Himself among the poor and suffering ones that He might become acquainted with fallen humanity and uplift them by restoring the moral image of God in them.

What value this places upon man! In order for us to cooperate with God, we must work in Christ's lines. By assuming human nature the Lord Jesus gave all humanity the lesson that it is a living connection with Him that constitutes us valuable in God's sight. Men and women have been granted another trial as probationers. They have been placed where through a connection with Christ they may learn of Him.",
