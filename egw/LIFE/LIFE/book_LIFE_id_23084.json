    "word": "Here was one lone man who had stirred the rage of priests and people. He was summoned to Augsburg to answer for his faith. He obeyed the summons. Firm and undaunted he stood before those who had caused the world to tremble\u2014a meek lamb surrounded by angry lions\u2014yet for the truth's sake, and for Christ's sake, he stood up undaunted, and with holy eloquence, which the truth can alone inspire, he gave the reasons of his faith. They tried various means to silence the bold advocate for truth. They flattered and held out inducements; he should be exalted and honored; but life and honors were valueless to him, if purchased at the sacrifice of the truth.",
