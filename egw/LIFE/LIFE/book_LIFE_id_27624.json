    "word": "The Works of True Faith.--We cannot possibly have a changing religion. The gospel is to be proclaimed and personally received. A general assent is not enough. There must be an intelligent heart reception of the truth wherein the receiver must stand and perseveringly communicate to others the knowledge received. The truth must be practiced in every respect, holding fast the word of life, \"by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain\" (1 Corinthians 15:2).",
