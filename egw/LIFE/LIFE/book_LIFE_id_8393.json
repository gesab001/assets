    "word": "We want to get in the habit of talking of heaven, beautiful heaven. Talk of that life which will continue as long as God shall live, and then you will forget your little trials and difficulties. Let the mind be attracted to God. \u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\u201d And now may the blessing and peace of God rest upon you all, my brethren and sisters. May your lives from henceforth be lives of watchfulness and prayer; and if we never meet again in this world, may we meet around the great white throne, to sing the song of victory together in the kingdom of God. \n     Tuesday morning, Sept. 29.",
