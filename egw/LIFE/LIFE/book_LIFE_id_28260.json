    "word": "Satan would have your soul; shall he have it? Say, No, never; it is Christ's property. Satan says, \"Curse God and die.\" Will you do it? He curses God for you, that you may repeat his wicked blasphemy. Will you do it? No, for Jesus has died; He has purchased your life. Your soul is His property, and He will take you by the hand; He will draw you away from perdition; He will make you, as John, His beloved disciple, to win the crown of eternal life. He bids you, through me, His humble servant, \"Look and live.\" He opens His loving heart to you that you may hide in the cleft of the Rock. Say not, \"There is no hope for me.\" Satan triumphs every time you say it. \n\n\n                                   -152- \n\nLet these thoughts be in your heart, \"Thou, O Lord, hast created me for Thyself.\" He has permitted you to live that you might become acquainted with Jesus and be willing to follow Him.--Letter 85, 1891. (Written to J. A. Starr, Sept. 22, 1891, from Healdsburg, California.) \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. October 5, 1983 \n\nEntire Manuscript Released",
