    "word": "Nicodemus was converted as the result of this interview. In that night conference with Jesus, the convicted man stood before the Saviour under the softening, subduing influence of the truth which was shining into the chambers of his mind, and impressing his heart. Jesus said to him, \"If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven.\" Jesus not only told Nicodemus that he must have a new heart in order to see the kingdom of heaven, but he told him how to obtain this new heart. He read the inquiring mind of the seeker after truth, and presented before him the representation of himself: \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Good news! good news! let it ring throughout the world!",
