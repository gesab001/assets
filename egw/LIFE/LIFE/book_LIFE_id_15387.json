    "word": "Shown Satan's Hindering Tactics.--At the time of the conference at Battle Creek, June, 1858, . . . I was taken off in vision. In that vision I was shown that in the sudden attack at Jackson, Satan designed to take my life to hinder the work I was about to write; but angels of God were sent to my rescue, to raise me above the effects of Satan's attack. I saw, among other things, that I should be blessed with better health than before the attack at Jackson.--Ibid.",
