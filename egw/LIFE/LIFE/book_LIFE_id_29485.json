    "word": "There is a constant progress in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent, but when men feel that they are wise above a \"Thus saith the Lord,\" they need to become fools in order that they may be wise. The living oracles of God were given to lie at the very foundation of all true education. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" There is a distinction to be made between the sacred and the common, and we are accountable to God if we place human wisdom at the head as essential for education. Language may change, and study books may present the supposed improvements, but, \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not\" [John 1:1-5].",
