    "word": "This living God is worthy of our thought, our praise, our adoration, as the Creator of the world, as the Creator of man. We are to praise God for we are fearfully and wonderfully made. Our substance was not hid from Him when we were made in secret. His eyes saw our substance, yet being imperfect, and in His book all our members were written when as yet there was none of them. He breathed into our nostrils the breath of life. The inspiration of God has given us understanding. (See Psalm 139:14-16; Genesis 2:7; Job 32:8). . . .",
