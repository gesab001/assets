    "word": "We are not to stand still in the Christian life. There is an advancement for us to make. We are to lay hold of him who has all power, remembering that every hour, every moment, we need his help. We are to be always ready to speak to others in regard to the grace and the saving power of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is the privilege of every one to grow in grace, daily reaching higher attainments in the Christian life.",
