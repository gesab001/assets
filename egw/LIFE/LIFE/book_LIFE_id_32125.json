    "word": "The need of healthful habits is a part of the gospel which must be presented to the people by those who hold forth the word of Life. \n\n\n                                   -41- \n\nThe importance of the health of the body is to be taught as a Bible requirement. \"I beseech you, brethren, therefore,\" writes Paul, \"That ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. For I say through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.\"",
