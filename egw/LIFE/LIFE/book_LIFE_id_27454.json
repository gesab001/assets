    "word": "Shall we not humble ourselves before God in behalf of those who apparently have little spiritual life. Shall we not have appointed seasons of prayer for them. Shall we not pray every day for those who seem to be dead in trespasses and sins. As we plead with God to break the hearts of stone, our own hearts will become more sensitive. We shall be quicker to see our own sin.--Ms 117, 1903, pp. 8, 9. (\"A Neglected Work,\" September 24, 1903.)",
