    "word": "Day by day we must talk with God, day by day following on to know the Lord, entering into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, laying hold on the hope set before us. If we reach heaven it must be by binding our souls to the Mediator, becoming partakers of the divine nature. Leaning on Christ, your life being hid with Christ in God, is your trust. And led by His Spirit, you have the genuine faith. Believing fully in the efficacy of His atoning sacrifice, we shall be laborers together with God. Trusting in His merits we are to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.",
