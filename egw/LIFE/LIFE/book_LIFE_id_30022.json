    "word": "I warn you, Do not place your influence against God's commandments. That law is just as Jehovah wrote it in the temple of heaven. Man may trample upon its copy here below; but the original is kept in the ark of God in heaven; and on the cover of this ark, right above that law, is the mercy seat. Jesus stands right there before that ark to mediate for man. We want you to keep God's commandments and live. Seek for immortality, and the crown of life, and then you will have heaven at last.--Ms 6a, 1886. (Sermon by Mrs. E. G. White, June 27, 1886, Orebro, Sweden.) (MR 900.5)",
