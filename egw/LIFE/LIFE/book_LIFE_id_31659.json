    "word": "Satan's Wiles \n\n     There are few among those who claim to be Christians who realize how deceptive are the wiles of Satan, and are prepared to oppose them firmly. Christ has promised His Spirit to go with those who will yield to His workings, and who will be loyal in opposing unrighteousness in every form. He has given to every human agent a work to do, that He may learn how to work in union with His Redeemer and in connection with heaven. It is the duty of every true Christian to unite the utmost powers of his being with the efforts of Him who made His life an example to mankind of what human agencies may accomplish in His name.--Letter 62, 1909. \n\n                                               -",
