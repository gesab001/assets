    "word": "Never forget that thoughts work out actions. Repeated actions form habits, and habits form character. . . . The Bible is to be the rule of life. It is marvelous in the eyes of the universe of heaven that men who teach the Word do not always practice the truth. Few realize what it means to be complete in Christ Jesus, the revealed will of God. His Word is not dishonored by being brought into practical life to form habits which will develop character.--Letter 85, 1896, p. 4. (To O. A. Olsen, March 16, 1896.)",
