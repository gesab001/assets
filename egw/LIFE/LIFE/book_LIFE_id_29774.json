    "word": "The will of God is man's life. The understanding is only the means by which the love of the human agent for God is brought into activity. The willpower is to be under God's control. One human mind is not to be a power to control all other minds. The fact that one man through much study has received advanced ideas to give to others is no evidence that he is to tie other minds to his mind, keeping them under his influence, doing all in his power to prevent others from influencing them.",
