    "word": "If parents, while they live, assist their children to help themselves, it would be better than to leave them a large amount at their death. Children who are left to rely principally upon their own exertions make better men and women, and are better fitted for practical life, than those children who have depended upon their father's estate. \n                                                                           159\nThe children left to depend upon their own resources will generally prize their abilities, and will improve their privileges, and cultivate and direct their faculties to accomplish a purpose in life. They will frequently develop characters of industry, and frugality, and moral worth which lie at the foundation of success in the Christian life. Those children for whom parents do the most, frequently feel under the least obligation toward them. The errors of which we have spoken have existed in Bordoville. Parents have shifted their stewardship upon their children.",
