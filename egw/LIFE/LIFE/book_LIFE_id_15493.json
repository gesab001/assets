    "word": "It Is Christ Who Heals.--Sister White has never claimed to heal the sick. It is Christ who has healed in every instance, as it was Christ who in the days of His ministry raised the dead to life. It is Christ who performs every mighty work through the ministry of His servants. This Christ is to be trusted and believed in. His blessing upon the means used for restoration to health will bring success. The mercy of Christ delights to manifest itself in behalf of suffering humanity. It is He who imparts the ministration of healing to the sick, and physicians are to give to Him the glory for the wonderful works performed.--Letter 158, 1908. \n                                                                           298",
