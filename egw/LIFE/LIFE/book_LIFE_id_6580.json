    "word": "Men and women are the purchase of the blood of God's only-begotten Son. They are Christ's property, and their education and training are to be given, not with reference to this short, uncertain life, but to the immortal life, which measures with the life of God. It is not His design that those whose services He has purchased, shall be trained to serve mammon, trained to receive human praise, human glorification, or to be subservient to the world.",
