    "word": "Before his conversion, Paul was a bitter persecutor of the followers of Christ. But at the gate of Damascus a voice spoke to him, light from heaven shone into his soul, and in the revelation that there came to him, of the Crucified One, he beheld that which changed the whole current of his life. Henceforth love for the Lord of glory, whom he had so relentlessly persecuted in the person of His saints, came before all else. To him had been given the ministry of making known \"the mystery\" which had been \"kept secret since the world began.\" [Romans 16:25.] \"He is a chosen vessel unto Me,\" declared the Angel who appeared to Ananias, \"to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.\" [Acts 9:15.]",
