    "word": "PRAY FOR BLESSINGS IN ORDER TO BLESS OTHERS.\u2014Our prayers are not to be a selfish asking, merely for our own benefit. We are to ask that we may give. The principle of Christ\u2019s life must be the principle of our lives. \u201cFor their sakes,\u201d He said, speaking of His disciples, \u201cI sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified.\u201d John 17:19. The same devotion, the same self-sacrifice, the same subjection to the claims of the word of God, that were manifest in Christ, must be seen in His servants. Our mission to the world is not to serve or please ourselves; we are to glorify God by co-operating with Him to save sinners. We are to ask blessings from God that we may communicate to others. The capacity for receiving is preserved only by imparting. We cannot continue to receive heavenly treasure without communicating to those around us.\u2014(Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 142, 143.)",
