The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not\" (John 1:1-5). The world did not see divinity in the humble Man of Nazareth.
