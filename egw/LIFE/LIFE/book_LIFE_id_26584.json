    "word": "We should give our best affection to our heavenly Father. How my heart has been grieved as I have seen, in galleries of art, pictures representing Christ. The executors have shown their true understanding of the mission of Christ and His character. They have not even approached the reality, and we had better spend our time in contemplating the true Artist of nature. See the flowers, how beautiful nature has painted the various colors! Christ has spoken of the lily of the lake, and He said that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. If we want to instruct our children, let us take them to the lake and show them the handiwork of God, explaining to them the pureness of the lily, that gathers up the properties that are essential to build up itself to its height of purity. From it they may learn the lesson not to be contaminated with impurity. Teach them the lessons that Daniel learned. He refused that which would not assist him in building true character, and although surrounded as he was by evil influences he stood firm upon principle, refusing to partake of those things that would have retarded his progress in divine life, and for his integrity God gave him wisdom and influence. If these lessons are learned by us then we shall have made a good record and shall not be afraid to stand when the Son of man comes. We must not be swayed by every temptation but must constantly grow in grace.",
