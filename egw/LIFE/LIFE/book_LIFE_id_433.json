    "word": "Fretful and Querulous Husbands.--Husbands, give your wives a chance for their spiritual life. . . . By many the disposition to fret is encouraged until they become like grown-up children. They do not leave this portion of their child life behind them. They cherish these feelings until they cramp and dwarf the whole life by their querulous complaints. And not only their own lives but the lives of others also. They carry with them the spirit of Ishmael, whose hand was against everybody, and everybody's hand against him.",
