    "word": "The law of the Lord is to be presented in its true bearing. Paul bears testimony regarding this law. \"What shall we say then?\" he asks. \"Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin but by the law,\" which is the \n                                                                           127\ndetector of sin. \"For I had not known lust except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.\" Because of this does Paul say, Have nothing to do with the law? Oh no, this is not his conclusion. Sin is the transgression of the law, and by the law is the knowledge of sin. Paul saw sin in all its hideous deformity. The law pointed him to Christ, the healer of sin which is repented of and confessed. \"Wherefore,\" Paul declared, \"the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" Why then do men in their transgression curse the law of God? Because it condemns sin.",
