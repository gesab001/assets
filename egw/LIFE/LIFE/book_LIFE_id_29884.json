    "word": "Christ left the abodes of bliss and came to this world as the light of truth, to shine amid the moral darkness, that the bright beams of light might penetrate the darkness of superstition, that divine truth might shine forth in contrast with the maxims and traditions and errors prevailing everywhere. Thus the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness were to dispel the thick clouds of ignorance. Christ opened the fountain of life, not only for the Jews, but for all nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples. He knew the unrest and earnest longing of soul for something which could satisfy the heart. Before leaving His disciples, He made His plans and set in order His work, that the church might be impressed with its missionary character, that it might see that its work is to diffuse the gospel of truth.",
