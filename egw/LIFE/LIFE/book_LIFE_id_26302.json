It is present truth. But how few take up this message in its true bearing, and present it to the people in its power! With many it has but little force. . . . The closing work of the third angel's message will be attended with a power that will send the rays of the Sun of Righteousness into all the highways and byways of life, and decisions will be made for God as supreme Governor; His law will [be] looked upon as the rule of His government.
