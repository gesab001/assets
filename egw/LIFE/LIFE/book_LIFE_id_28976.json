    "word": "Every heart emptied of self will have the quickening energy of the Holy Spirit. It is now that some are being worked by satanic agencies. Mark the fruit.

God puts to them the challenge, \"Choose ye this day whom ye will serve. If it be God, serve Him; if Baal, serve him.\" But some have been fixing themselves for a long time by a species of deception and misrepresentation and prevarication, because they have not turned from their idols to serve the living and true God.",
