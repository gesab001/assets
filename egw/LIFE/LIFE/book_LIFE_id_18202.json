    "word": "To Meet the Demands of Fashion.--In our day, people talk of the dark ages, and boast of progress. But with this progress wickedness and crime do not decrease. We deplore the absence of natural simplicity, and the increase of artificial display. Health, strength, beauty, and long life, which were common in the so-called \"Dark Ages,\" are rare now. Nearly everything desirable is sacrificed to meet the demands of fashionable life.",
