    "word": "Heavenly intelligences are waiting to co-operate with human instrumentalities, that they may reveal to the world what human beings may become, and what, through union with Divine, may be accomplished for the saving of souls that are ready to perish. There is no limit to the usefulness of one who, putting self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart, and lives a life wholly consecrated to God. All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit, to His service, will be constantly receiving a new endowment of physical, mental, and spiritual power. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind. Through the grace given us we may achieve victories that because of our own erroneous and preconceived opinions, our defects of character, our smallness of faith, have seemed impossible. \n\n\n                                    -328-",
