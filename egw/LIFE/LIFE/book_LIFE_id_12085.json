    "word": "The truth of God is to sanctify the soul. \"A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.\" The sanctifying power of truth is to abide in the soul and be carried with us to our business, there to apply its continual tests to every transaction of life, especially to our dealings with our fellow men. It is to abide in our households, having a subduing power upon the life and character of all its inmates.",
