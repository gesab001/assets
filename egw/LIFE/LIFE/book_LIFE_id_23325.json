    "word": "I am instructed to say that we must not look to any human being for power or experience, depending on them for strength and guidance. Christ says, \"Look unto Me. I am the Light of the world. He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of life.\" I speak to those who claim to be children of God. Is it not time that we know the Source of our strength and the Source of our power? Shall we not, from this time forward, make a record more pleasing to the Lord?",
