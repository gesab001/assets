    "word": "Uninspired authors are placed in the hands of children and youth in our schools as lesson books --books from which they are to be educated. They are kept before the youth, taking up their precious time in studying those things which they can never use. Many books have been introduced into the schools which should never have been placed there. These books do not in any sense voice the words of John, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" The whole line of study in our schools should be to prepare a people for the future, immortal life.--Sp. Test., p. 232.",
