    "word": "I leave these lines with you. I had hoped that the great light shining from the Word of God would have been accepted, brought into your religious life, and you become a true, sincere Christian, doing the will of God from the heart. But I have been urged by the Spirit of the Lord to write you. The work must go forward. Everything impure must become pure and holy or be purged from our hands, for all that is earthly, sensual, devilish, is a stumbling block to others and a curse to the cause of God.",
