    "word": "But if men abide not in Christ, \"they are cast forth as a branch,\" and are withered. Man may make great claims to piety, but if in his business transactions he does not reveal that the Holy Spirit of God is governing words and actions, he had far better make no profession. Christ's life and death does not avail for him who chooses to do as he pleases, who follows his own imaginations and carries out on his own way and will.",
