    "word": "\"All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.\" Everything that we of ourselves can do is defiled by sin. But the Son of God was \"manifested to take away our sins; and in Him is no sin.\" Sin is defined to be \"the transgression of the law.\" But Christ was obedient to every requirement of the law. . . . When on earth He said to His disciples, \"I have kept My Father's commandments.\" By His perfect obedience He has made it possible for every human being to obey God's commandments. When we submit ourselves to Christ . . . we live His life. This is what it means to be clothed with the garment of His righteousness. Then, as the Lord looks upon us, He sees, not the fig-leaf garment, not the nakedness and deformity of sin, but His own robe of righteousness, which is perfect obedience to the law of Jehovah.",
