The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with Me in peace and equity, and did turn man away from iniquity. For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts\" [Malachi 2:5-7].--Letter 11, 1897. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G.
