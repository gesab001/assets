But they forgot their Maker, and chose to follow their own way in opposition to his will. They had returned enmity for a love that was as high as Heaven and as broad as the universe. God could not bring down his law to meet the standard of wicked \n                                                                           243\nmen, neither could man, fallen by sin, meet the demands of the law by a blameless character and life.
