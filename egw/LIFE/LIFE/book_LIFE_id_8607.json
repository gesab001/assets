    "word": "What can the most learned in book lore know aright without a knowledge of the Word of God? Without the education found in the Bible, how shall we reach the next world, where we shall enter the presence of God and see His face? Nothing of this world's wisdom, the knowledge gained from books, presents a true and sure foundation upon which we can build for eternity. Nothing but the bread that comes down from heaven satisfies spiritual hunger. \"For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.\" . . . The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:33, 63). . . . As we eat the words of Christ we are eating the bread of life, which gives spiritual vitality.",
