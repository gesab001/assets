    "word": "God gave physicians their wisdom and skill. It is not man who saves life; it is the great Restorer. But poor men are often charged for services they never received. Many physicians merely speak a few words to the suffering fellow-being they are called to visit, doing nothing to relieve his suffering, and then charge a large fee. This is dishonesty before God. They should go vigorously to work, as did the good Samaritan. God is not glorified as a Restorer when physicians demand such large sums for their services.",
