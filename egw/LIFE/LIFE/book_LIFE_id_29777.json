    "word": "Do you love God supremely and your neighbor as yourself? This is the whole duty of man. On these two principles hang all the law and the prophets. If you fulfill them, light and joy and peace and gladness will come into your life. Show by your life your preparedness for the inheritance of the saints in light. In word, in spirit, in action, be a true representative of Christ. Then you will be rich for all eternity.",
