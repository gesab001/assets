    "word": "The Brazen Serpent \n\n     Here is another case Christ presented before Nicodemus--the serpent that was lifted up in the wilderness--and declared, \"Even so must the Son of man be lifted up\" (John 3:14). And if He is lifted up, He will draw all men unto Him, \"that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have eternal life\" (verse 15). Now just look at that brazen serpent. The children of Israel had not realized that God had been keeping them by His angels sent to be their help and their protection. The people had not been destroyed by the serpents in their long travels through the wilderness. They had been an ungrateful people.",
