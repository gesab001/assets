    "word": "[Colossians 3:1-4, quoted.] \n     Jesus, the Son of God, our Sin-bearer, the Giver of eternal life, speaks to His disciples. Hear what He says; \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\" He understands every temptation. He can turn the cross into a means of eternal happiness. We must live His life. We must be co-laborers with Him. He calls upon His followers to tread in His footsteps of self-denial and self-sacrifice. The character of the Christian is to be a reproduction of Christ. The same love, the same grace, the same unselfish benevolence that characterized the life of the Redeemer is to characterize the lives of His followers. \n\n\n                                -219-",
