    "word": "In childhood Jesus did the works of an obedient child. He spoke and acted with the wisdom of a child, and not of a man, honoring His parents and carrying out their wishes in helpful ways, according to the ability of a child. But at each stage of His development He was perfect, \n                                                                           205\nwith the simple, natural grace of a sinless life. The Sacred Record says of His childhood, \"The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.\" And of His youth it is recorded, \"Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.\" Luke 2:40, 52.",
