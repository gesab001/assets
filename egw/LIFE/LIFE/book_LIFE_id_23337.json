    "word": "We are not to stumble along in uncertainty. Christ says, \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Mark 8:34). \"He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\" (John 8:12). As we advance, we become used to following. The path of life shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.",
