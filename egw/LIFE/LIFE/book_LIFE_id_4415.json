THE PRINCIPLES FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING GENERAL COUNSEL CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES, FROM RECOGNIZING OUR LIMITATIONS IN ACCEPTING EXTRA RESPONSIBILITIES, TO LIVING A SIMPLER LIFESTYLE IN ORDER TO EASE THE STRESS AND STRAIN OF MODERN LIVING, AND FINDING TIME FOR THE THINGS THAT MATTER MOST. AGAIN, MOST OF THIS WAS WRITTEN TO MEN, BUT THE PRINCIPLES APPLY EQUALLY.",
