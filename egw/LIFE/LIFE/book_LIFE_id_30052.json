    "word": "I love my Saviour this morning because He first loved me. If there is anything in my life, my words, my teachings, that is good, it is because Christ has put it there. It is not because of any goodness in me, and there is no glory to be directed to myself. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith; against these there is no law. We should experience this, and then we will not be under the bondage of the law of God by any means. You are free in Christ Jesus. We shall walk in liberty because our will is in harmony with the will of God and we love all His commandments.",
