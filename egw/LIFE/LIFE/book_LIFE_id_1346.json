    "word": "Christ\u2019s sermon on the mount was designed to enter into our everyday life. The commandments are so broad that they take hold of even our thoughts. But how few take heed to the words of our Saviour! Consequently we shall have objections to meet. Some will claim that they are wholly led by the Spirit, and consequently they have not much use for the law of God or any portion of God\u2019s Word. Those who claim great light and are not sanctified through the truth are dangerous people, but they can be easily tested. \u201cTo the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\u201d Isaiah 8:20. . . .",
