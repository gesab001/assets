    "word": "\"Our people in Southern California need to awake to the magnitude of the work to be done within their own borders. Let them awake to prayer and labor. Let them manifest more spiritual vitality. They need a new conversion that they may labor untiringly for souls. Wherever there is spiritual life there will be an imparting as well as a receiving of light and blessing. The nourishment from God's Word will be received, and earnest work will be done. The act of imparting keeps open the channel for receiving. This truth our Saviour ever sought to keep before the people.",
