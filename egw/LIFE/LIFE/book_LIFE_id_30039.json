    "word": "It is not enough that we merely give an exposition of the Scriptures, but we must have the Word of God abiding in us; and Christ has said that unless \"ye eat of My flesh and drink of My blood, ye shall have no part with Me. None but those who eat of My flesh and drink of my blood shall have eternal life.\" [See John 6:53-56.] Then He goes on to explain what it means. Why, he says, \"the flesh profiteth nothing; it is the spirit that quickeneth\" [see verse 63], and He says that His flesh is meat indeed and drink indeed. Therefore, we are not to merely open the Bible and read something to the people and then go away out of the desk and carry no burden of souls with us. \n\n\n                                     -63-",
