    "word": "The history of the Sabbath should have been out long ago. You should not wait to have everything so exactly strong as you can possibly make it before you give it to the people. This is a busy world. Men and women, as they engage in the business of life, have not time to meditate, and read even the word of God enough to understand it. And long, labored arguments will interest but a few. For as the people run, they have to read. You can no more remove the objections to the Sabbath commandment from the minds of the First-day Adventists, than the Saviour of the world could, by his great power and miracles, convince the Jews that he was the Messiah after they had once set themselves to reject him. Like the obstinate, unbelieving Jews, they have chosen darkness rather than light, and should an angel direct from the courts of Heaven speak to them, they would say it was Satan.",
