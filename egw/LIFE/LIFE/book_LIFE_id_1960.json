    "word": "Responsibility of Leadership No Child's Play--The position occupied by my husband is not an enviable one.  It requires the closest attention, care, and mental labor.  It requires the exercise of sound judgment and wisdom.  It requires self-denial, a whole heart, and a firm will to push matters through.  In that important position God will have a man to venture, to risk something; to move out firmly for the right, whatever may be the consequences; to battle against obstacles, and waver not, even though life be at stake.--Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 320.",
