    "word": "Chapter 37 \n\n     1-10. What Can Man's Power Do?--At one time the prophet Ezekiel was in vision set down in the midst of a large valley. Before him lay a dismal scene. Throughout its whole extent the valley was covered with the bones of the dead. The question was asked, \"Son of man, can these bones live?\" The prophet replied, \"O Lord God, Thou knowest.\" What could the might and power of man accomplish with these dead bones? The prophet could see no hope of life being imparted to them. But as he looked, the power of God began to work. The scattered bones were shaken, and began to come together, \"bone to his bone,\" and were bound together by sinews. They were covered with flesh, and as the Lord breathed upon the bodies thus formed, \"the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army\" (MS 85, 1903).",
