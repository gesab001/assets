    "word": "Many wonder why their prayers are so lifeless, their faith so feeble and wavering, their Christian experience so dark and uncertain. \"Have we not fasted,\" they say, \"and walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?\" In the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah, Christ has shown how this condition of things may be changed. . . . Verses 6, 7. This is the recipe that Christ has prescribed for the faint-hearted, doubting, trembling soul. Let the sorrowful ones, who walk mournfully before the Lord, arise and help someone who needs help.--Testimonies, vol 6, p. 266.",
