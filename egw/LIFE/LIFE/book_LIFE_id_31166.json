    "word": "The Lord has appointed resources, and we are to accept his provisions. The water of life is open to all. All may come and drink. \n                                                                           1676\nGod is speaking to you, A. R. Henry. Your broken cistern is failing. Amid cares and disappointments, and mental and physical pain, your feverish thirst is not allayed; for you have forsaken the fountain of living water, and like many others, have tried, in weariness of heart and brain, to hew out cisterns in the resisting granite of your own lives, in order to secure your own ends. There is a fountain near you if you have not made the distance long by forsaking the living waters.",
