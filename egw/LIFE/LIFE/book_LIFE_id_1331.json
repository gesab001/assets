    "word": "Jesus carried the burden of the salvation of the human family upon His heart. He knew that unless people would receive Him, and become changed in purpose and life, they would be eternally lost. This was the burden of His soul, and He was alone in carrying this load. . . . From His youth He was filled with a deep longing to be a lamp in the world, and He purposed that His life should be \u201cthe light of the world.\u201d This He was, and that light still shines to all who are in darkness. Let us walk in the light that He has given.\u2014Ibid., Jan. 2, 1896.",
