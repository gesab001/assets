    "word": "Alas, to what a fearful extent is that friendship of the world which is \u201cenmity with God,\u201d now cherished among the professed followers of Christ! How widely have the popular churches throughout Christendom departed from the Bible standard of humility, self-denial, simplicity, and godliness! Said John Wesley, in speaking of the right use of money: \u201cDo not waste any part of so precious a talent, merely in gratifying the desire of the eye, by superfluous and expensive apparel, or by needless ornaments. Waste no part of it in curiously adorning your houses; in superfluous or expensive furniture; in costly pictures, painting, gilding.\u201d \u201cLay out nothing to gratify the pride of life, to gain the admiration or praise of men.\u201d \u201c\u2018So long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.\u2019 So long as thou art \u2018clothed in purple and fine linen, and farest sumptuously every day,\u2019 no doubt many will applaud thine elegance of \n386\ntaste, thy generosity and hospitality. But do not buy their applause so dear. Rather be content with the honor that cometh from God.\u201d But in many churches of our time, such teaching is disregarded.",
