    "word": "Bear Your Own Burdens \n     If you shirk responsibility and crosses and burden-bearing, hard thinking and earnest praying, and look to the president of the General Conference to do your work and help you out of your difficulties, cannot you see that you lay upon him burdens that will imperil his life? Have you not mind and ability, as well as he? You should not neglect any part of the work because it calls for earnest, cross-bearing effort.",
