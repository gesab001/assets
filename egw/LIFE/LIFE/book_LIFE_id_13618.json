    "word": "PRAYER AND FAITH LAY HOLD OF GOD\u2019S POWER.\u2014True faith and true prayer\u2014how strong they are! They are as two arms by which the human suppliant lays hold upon the power of Infinite Love. \n55\nFaith is trusting in God,\u2014believing that He loves us, and knows what is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowledges His ownership, and accepts its blessings. Truth, uprightness, purity, are pointed out as secrets of life\u2019s success. It is faith that puts us in possession of these. Every good impulse or aspiration is the gift of God; faith receives from God the life that alone can produce true growth and efficiency.\u2014(Gospel Workers, 259.)",
