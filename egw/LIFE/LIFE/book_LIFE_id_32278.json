    "word": "In giving us the privilege of studying His Word, the Lord has set before us a rich banquet. Many are the benefits derived from feasting on His Word, which is represented by Him as being His flesh and blood--His spirit and life. By partaking of this Word, our spiritual strength \n\n\n                                      -266- \n\nis increased; we grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth; habits of self-control are formed and strengthened; the infirmities of childhood - fretfulness, wilfulness, selfishness, hasty words, passionate acts - disappear, and in their place are developed the graces of Christian manhood and womanhood.",
