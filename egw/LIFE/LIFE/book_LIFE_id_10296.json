    "word": "Spiritual Loss Through Selfish Aims \n\n     If men become so confused and unprincipled as to engage in sanitarium work for selfish personal profit, they will not be prospered in their spiritual life, and will be unable properly to influence others spiritually. Let those who have a great desire to distinguish themselves in some way, take up a work that does not involve the cause of God so much as does the establishment of a new sanitarium.--MS. 26, 1902. \n                                                                           153",
