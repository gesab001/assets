    "word": "-148- \n\n     Are there any here who, like Thomas, do not know the way? Listen to the Saviour's words. \"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. If ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also; and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him. Philip saith unto Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of Myself: but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works. Believe Me that I am in the father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also.\" Thus we become laborers together with God. \"And greater works than these shall he do, because I go to My Father.\"",
