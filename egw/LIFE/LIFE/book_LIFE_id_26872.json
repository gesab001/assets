    "word": "We are now living in the solemn period of the antitypical day of atonement. In the type, the sins of the people were, on the atonement day, to be called to mind and repented of. It was a time of humiliation and affliction of soul. The greatest care was enjoined that every part of the service be attended to with becoming reverence, lest the anger of the Lord be displayed. The high priest was required to make the most careful and solemn preparation, and he must guard himself with the utmost diligence from all contamination. How much more while the antitypical atonement is going on in heaven, should those who minister in sacred things be holy. \"Be ye clean \n\n\n                                      -6- \n\nthat bear the vessels of the Lord.\" Said Christ, \"I sanctify Myself that they also may be sanctified.\" Those who are sent to the people in Christ's stead should be men of God, pure in life, pure in conversation, ensamples to the flock. They have a solemn work before them, warning every man and teaching every man, in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. \"Whereunto I also labor striving according to His working which worketh in me mightily.\"--Ms 3, 1885, pp. 1, 8, 9, 11-13. (Sermon, \"The Obedience of the Sabbath,\" October 8, 1885.)",
