    "word": "\"According as His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness\" [2 Peter 1:3]. Then if you are lost, you will be left without excuse. The time is coming when your parents, if they have purified their lives by obeying the truth, will come up to the gates of the city of God and the gates will open before them. Are their children preparing to enter with them? If the parents have worked out their own salvation with fear and trembling, if they have in the fear of God tried to help their children, their work will be accepted. But perhaps their children have refused to be helped, and have chosen to follow their own inclinations. Will you not, as young people, act in harmony with the knowledge that you have received, and join the army of believers to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling?",
