    "word": "The life of Christ is a life well worthy of study. And the strong, noble character of many who have followed His example are worthy of imitation. But of many of the race of mankind it may be said that their lives have been almost entirely useless. They have striven to have their own way, and carry out their own purposes. They have lived for self, and died without having laid up for them a jeweled crown.",
