    "word": "Jesus, Heaven's great commander, left the royal courts to come to a world seared and marred with the curse. He took upon himself our nature, that with his human arm he might encircle the race, while with his divine arm he grasps Omnipotence, and thus links finite man to the infinite God. Our Redeemer came to the world to show how man should live in order to secure immortal life. Our Heavenly Father made an infinite sacrifice in giving his Son to die for fallen man. The price paid for our redemption should give us exalted views of what we may become through Jesus Christ.",
