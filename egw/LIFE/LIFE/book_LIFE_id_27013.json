    "word": "In the vision given me at Rochester I was shown that God in His providence has been especially leading Brother Lay to obtain an experience that would be beneficial to himself and to the cause of God. . . . All through your life, Sister Lay, you have had, to a greater or less degree, a diseased imagination. God designed your affliction for your good, that it should remove from you many things detrimental to you and which had proved a leaden weight to your husband. You have not realized your condition or the effect both your physical and mental infirmities have had upon your husband. They have made him a weak man, in every sense of the word, when he might have been strong. He has suffered in mind intensely when it all might have been saved had you viewed calmly, rationally, and as a Christian wife should. . . . The experience you have had at Dansville has greatly helped you to appreciate his worth, and yet, dear sister, you must view things from a higher, more elevated standpoint. . . .",
