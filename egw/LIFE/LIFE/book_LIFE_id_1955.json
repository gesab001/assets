    "word": "\"NOW SHE IS AT REST. HER VOICE IS SILENT; HER PEN IS LAID ASIDE. BUT THE MIGHTY INFLUENCE OF THAT ACTIVE, FORCEFUL, SPIRIT-FILLED LIFE WILL CONTINUE. THAT LIFE WAS LINKED WITH THE ETERNAL; IT WAS WROUGHT IN GOD. THE MESSAGE PROCLAIMED AND THE WORK DONE HAVE LEFT A MONUMENT THAT WILL NEVER CRUMBLE NOR PERISH. THE MANY VOLUMES SHE HAS LEFT, DEALING WITH EVERY PHASE OF HUMAN LIFE, URGING EVERY REFORM NECESSARY TO THE BETTERMENT OF SOCIETY, AS REPRESENTED BY THE FAMILY, CITY, STATE, AND NATION, WILL CONTINUE TO MOLD PUBLIC SENTIMENT AND INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER. THEIR MESSAGES WILL BE CHERISHED MORE THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. THE CAUSE TO WHICH HER LIFE WAS DEVOTED, AND WHICH THAT LIFE MOLDED AND ADVANCED TO SUCH A DEGREE, WILL PRESS FORWARD WITH INCREASING FORCE AND RAPIDITY AS THE YEARS GO BY. WE WHO ARE CONNECTED WITH IT NEED ENTERTAIN NO FEAR EXCEPT THE FEAR OF OUR OWN FAILURE TO DO OUR PART AS FAITHFULLY AS WE SHOULD.\"",
