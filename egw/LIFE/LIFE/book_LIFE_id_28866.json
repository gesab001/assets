    "word": "Said Christ, \"My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His work.\" Shall we take up a work of preparing food for multitudes of unbelievers, and yet leave unspoken the words of life? Shall we so busy ourselves in the preparation of many lines of food that we cannot give an example of what it means to receive and to practice the Word of life?--Ms. 79, 1906, pp. 3, 4. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. August 6, 1987.",
