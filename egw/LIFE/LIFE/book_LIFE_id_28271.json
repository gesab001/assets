    "word": "The richest blessings are for you and all others who preach the Word. But we must ever remember the words, \"Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God\" [Colossians 3:3]. The Saviour promises to satisfy the most urgent needs of the soul. He promises, \"The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" [John 4:14]. You need to be converted every day in order to be a vessel unto honor, one who can teach others. Do not make a mistake. Your soul is precious, and Christ will save you if you will be saved by purifying your soul through obedience to the truth.--Letter 44, 1907. (Written February 4, 1907, from Sanitarium, California, to Elder L. C. Sheafe.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. November 4, 1983 \n\nEntire letter released",
