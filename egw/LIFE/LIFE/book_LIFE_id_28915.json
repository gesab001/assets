    "word": "There is no man who works in obedience to Christ's life in this world, who does all in Christ's name and to His glory, but will be honored. Those who hope to gain worldly recognition, who desire to be the highest in authority, and yet refuse to maintain Bible principles, principles of unselfish character in the service of God, however they may be exalted by those who themselves have not wisdom to obey God in keeping all His commandments, such exaltation and honor is of no value, for it is not recognized or endorsed in the heavenly courts. Seeking to stand as supreme in wisdom by securing the approval of men does not exalt them one tittle with God.",
