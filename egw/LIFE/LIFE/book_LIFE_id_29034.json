    "word": "I saw that many, very many, had been truly converted through the influence of persons who were living in open violation of the commandments of God, their lives vile and corrupt. Others, I saw, were very sick. A case was held up before me of one of my relatives, a Methodist minister. Eighty miles he was sent for to pray for a sick sister in compliance with the teaching of James who sent for him. He went and prayed in earnest, and she prayed. She believed the minister to be a man of God, a man of faith. Physicians had given her up to die of consumption. She was healed immediately. She arose and prepared supper, a thing she had not done for ten years. Now, the minister was vile, his life was corrupt, and yet here was a great work. He took the glory all to himself.",
