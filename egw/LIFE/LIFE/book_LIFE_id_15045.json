    "word": "Christ was invested with the right to give immortality. The life which He had laid down in humanity, He again took up and gave to humanity. \"I am come,\" He says, \"that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly\" (John 10:10). \"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day\" (John 6:54). \"Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (John 4:14).",
