    "word": "We are not to aim for a lower standard than that which Christ has laid out for His people. But there are many things included in what is commonly called a higher education, that we do not need. John the Baptist received a training for his life work, not in the schools of the rabbis, but in the wilderness, alone with God and His Word. As he prayed, the Scriptures were opened before him in a wonderful manner. And today God is just as willing to instruct those who will humbly seek for that wisdom which cometh from above.",
