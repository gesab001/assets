    "word": "The life of Christ was humble, free from affectation or display. He lived mostly in the open air. . . . The birds, the natural flowers that decked the fields with their glowing beauty, the majestic trees and lofty mountains, the ragged rocks and perpetual hills, all had special charms for Him. . . . Secluded from every human eye, He communed with His heavenly Father. His moral powers were strengthened by His meditation and communion with God.",
