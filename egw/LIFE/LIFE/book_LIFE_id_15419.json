    "word": "We May Overcome as Christ Overcame.--The love and justice of God, and also the immutability of His law, are made manifest by the Saviour's life, no less than by His death. He assumed human nature, with its infirmities, its liabilities, its temptations. . . . He was \"in all points tempted like as we are\" (Hebrews 4:15). He exercised in His own behalf no power which man cannot exercise. As man He met temptation, and overcame in the strength given Him of God. He gives us an example of perfect obedience. He has provided that we may become partakers of the divine nature, and assures us that we may overcome as He overcame. His life testified that by the aid of the same divine power which Christ received, it is possible for man to obey God's law.-- Manuscript 141, 1901.",
