You are to receive the precious Saviour as your very best friend, and honour Him by doing His will. \u201cAs many as received Him,\u201d \u2014 choosing Him above all other friends, \u2014 \u201cto them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believed on His name.\u201d Receive Him as your light and life. He so loved you that He died that you might live forever. Believe in Him. Regard Him as your best and truest friend. Come to Him, saying, \u201cLord, I give myself to Thee just as I am. I have wasted many years of the life that Thou didst redeem by the sacrifice of Thine own life. Wilt Thou forgive me?\u201d",
