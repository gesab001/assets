    "word": "As you give heed to the light you have, greater light will come. You are building on God's Word, and your character will be builded after the similitude of the character of Christ. Christ, the true foundation, is a living stone; His life is imparted to all that are built upon Him. \"Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house\" (1 Peter 2:5, ASV). . . . That building no tempest can overthrow (Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 147-150).",
