    "word": "But often we take ourselves in our own hands, thinking that we can arrange matters in a way that will bring us peace and rest. Do we succeed? No. We get into more trouble than before. When things arise to perplex our minds, we fret and worry, and begin to accuse others, and to find fault with them. What ought we to do? Christ tells us. \"Verily, verily, I say unto you,\" He declares, \"except ye eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of man, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me and I in him. As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.\" \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.\" These words are clearly explained in John 5:24; \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and he shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.\"",
