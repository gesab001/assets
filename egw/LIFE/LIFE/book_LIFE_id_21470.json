    "word": "This spirit of Christ will make its way among the gross ignorance that you will meet. But remember the words of Christ, \u201cWithout me ye can do nothing.\u201d It is not enough to speak readily upon controverted subjects; God calls for men whose hearts have been moulded after the divine similitude. Through sanctifying truth we \n31\ncan bear to others the cup of salvation. Through an earnest hold upon God, a prayerful life mingled with persevering faith, the truth will cut its way through seemingly impossibilities.",
