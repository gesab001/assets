    "word": "A Call to Perfection \n\n     Our Saviour understood all about human nature, and He says to every human being, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" As God is perfect in His \n                                                                           113\nsphere, so man is to be perfect in his sphere. Those who receive Christ are among the number to whom the words so full of hope are spoken, \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\" These words declare to us that we should be content with nothing less than the best and highest character, a character formed after the divine similitude. When such a character is possessed, the life, the faith, the purity of the religion, is an instructive example to others. \"Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.\" . . .",
