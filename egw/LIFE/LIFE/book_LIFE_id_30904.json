    "word": "Then said Jesus unto them, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.\" \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.\" \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.\" O, that we may heed the words of Christ.",
