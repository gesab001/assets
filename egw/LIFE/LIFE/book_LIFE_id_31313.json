    "word": "This sixth chapter of John contains the most precious and important lessons for all who are being educated in our schools. If they want that education that will endure through time and through eternity, let them bring the wonderful truths of this chapter into their practical lives. The whole chapter is very instructive, and is only faintly understood. We urge students to take in these words of Christ, that they may understand their privileges. The Lord Jesus teaches us what He is to us, and what advantage it will be to us individually to eat His word, realizing that He Himself is the great center of our life. \"The words that I speak unto you,\" He said, \"They are spirit, and they are life.\"",
