    "word": "\"The views held and widely promulgated by Mrs. White regarding vital fundamental questions -- the sovereignty of God, the divinity of Christ, the efficacy of the gospel, the inspiration of the Scriptures, the majesty of the law, the character of sin and deliverance from its power, the brotherhood of man and the relationships and responsibilities in that brotherhood --her teaching regarding these great questions, and her life of devotion to her Lord and of service to her fellow men, were made impressive through the revelations given her by the divine Spirit.

'By their fruits ye shall know them.' 'To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.'",
