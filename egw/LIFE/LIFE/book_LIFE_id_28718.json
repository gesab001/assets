    "word": "Let no one take for granted that he is saved. Sanctification is the work of a lifetime. Said Christ, \"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
