    "word": "In the lives of all who reject truth there are moments when conscience awakens, when memory presents the torturing recollection of a life of hypocrisy and the soul is harassed with vain regrets.

Those who would have destroyed Christ and His faithful people now witness the glory which rests upon them.",
