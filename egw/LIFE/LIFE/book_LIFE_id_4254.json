    "word": "In the establishment of the Health Institute it was the design of God not only that knowledge might be imparted to the comparatively few who should visit it, but that the many might be instructed as to home treatment. The Health Reformer [OUR PIONEER HEALTH JOURNAL, PUBLISHED UNDER THIS TITLE FROM 1866 TO 1878. SUBSEQUENTLY IT WAS KNOWN AS GOOD HEALTH.] is the medium through which rays of light are to shine upon the people. It should be the very best health journal in our country. It must be adapted to the wants of the common people, ready to answer all proper questions, and fully explain the first principles of the laws of life, and how to obey them and preserve health. The great object to be kept in view by the publication of such a journal should be the good of the suffering people of God. The common people, especially those too poor to attend the Institute, must be reached and instructed by the Health Reformer.-- Testimonies, Vol. 1, pp. 552, 553.",
