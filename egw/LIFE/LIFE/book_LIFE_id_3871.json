    "word": "\"Labor not for the meat which perisheth,\" Christ admonished, \"but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for Him hath God the Father sealed.\" John 6:27. When we obey these words, we shall rightly understand the teachings of the Scriptures, and esteem the truth as the most valuable treasure with which to store the mind. We shall have within us a wellspring of the water of life. We shall pray, as did the psalmist, \"Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law;\" and we shall find, as he did, that \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is Thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.\" Psalm 119:18;  19:9-11. \n\n                                               -",
