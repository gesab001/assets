    "word": "Individually living the life of Christ, His followers become living working agencies. They possess the character of Christ. They have the love of Christ, His faith, His hope, His oneness with the Father. They lean on Christ as their only staff and sufficiency. They are Christ's living witnesses. By their words, their spirit, their true courtesy, their influence, by their every action, they testify of Christ. A power goes out from these human agencies, bearing the testimony that they are laborers together with God, that they have communion with their Saviour.",
