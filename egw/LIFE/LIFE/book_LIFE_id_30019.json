    "word": "We want you to live for the future immortal life, and we want you to decide, \"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\" Now is the time for you to give yourselves without reserve to Jesus. Be determined that you will have Christ at the loss of everything else. The very obstacles and difficulties you meet here are to strengthen your faith by overcoming these obstacles, and every victory gained is registered in the books of heaven. Every good deed you do, leading souls to walk in the way of God's commandments, is also registered in the books of heaven.",
