    "word": "Men and women, young and old, I have a message for you: Seek God for yourselves individually. Look to God alone. Search for the truth as for hidden treasure. Let every mind be enlarged and every soul vitalized by the heavenly current. The Word of God is not a dry theory, but light and life to mind and soul. Eating this Word, and drinking it in, practicing it, is eating and drinking the flesh of the Son of God. \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me\" [John 6:53-57]. Jesus explained these sayings, which seemed so hard for the disciples to understand: \"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" [verse 63].",
