    "word": "MR No. 335 - The Wrath of God\n\n     Having taken a survey of all that would be required of Him, Christ summed up the guilt to be cancelled. God's wrath against sin and the punishment for sin must be exhausted. Christ gathered the entire responsibility to His heart, and bent His whole being to the task. He clothed His divinity with humanity and prepared Himself for the sword that was to smite Him as our substitute and surety. \"Therefore doth My Father love Me,\" He said, \"because I lay down My life that I might take it again.\" He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.--Manuscript 44, 1898, p. 3.
