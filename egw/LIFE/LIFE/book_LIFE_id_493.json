    "word": "Give Mothers Change and Rest.--It is difficult for a loving mother to urge her children to help her when she sees they have no heart in the work and will frame any and every excuse to get rid of doing a disagreeable task Children and youth, Christ is looking upon you, and shall He see you neglecting the trust He has put into your hands? If you want to be useful, the opportunity is yours. Your first duty is to help your mother who has done so much for you. Lift her burdens, give her pleasant days of rest; for she has had few holidays and very little variety in her life. You have claimed all the pleasure and amusement as your right, but the time has come for you to shed sunshine in the home. Take up your duty; go right to work. Through your self-denying devotion give her rest and pleasure.",
