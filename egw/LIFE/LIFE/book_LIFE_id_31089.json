    "word": "September 27. Dear Edson, I see by your letter that you are again in Battle Creek. God grant that every hour of your life may be spent to his own name's glory. May you be God's chosen instrument for the advancement of his work.  May you rise to an appreciation of your high calling. I have written many things, Edson, in regard to the manner in which the work has been prosecuted in Battle Creek; but although the matter is prepared for the mail, I defer sending it. I feel deep sympathy with Bro. Olsen. His associates do little to hold up his hands, but much to make them feeble.",
