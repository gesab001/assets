    "word": "The power of great passion has been your apology for vice. Your life has been a shame--nothing in it of which you might glory. You have had great depression if you were not strained up to some excitement and not had some girl or woman to attract you and to listen to your troubles in regard to your wife. Shame, shame should cover you for your course.--Letter 52, 1876.",
