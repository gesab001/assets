    "word": "Begin Now to Redeem the Past.--The youth are now deciding their own eternal destiny, and I would appeal to you to consider the commandment to which God has annexed such a promise, \"That thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" Children, do you desire eternal life? Then respect and honor your parents. Do not wound and grieve their hearts and cause them to spend sleepless nights in anxiety and distress over your case. If you have sinned in not rendering love and obedience to them, begin now to redeem the past. You cannot afford to take any other course; for it means to you the loss of eternal life. \n                                                                           305",
