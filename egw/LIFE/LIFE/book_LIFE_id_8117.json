    "word": "THE REDEEMED WILL LIVE ACTIVE, PURPOSEFUL LIVES.\u2014In the earth made new the redeemed will engage in the occupations and pleasures that brought happiness to Adam and Eve in the beginning. The Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and field. \u201cThey shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of My people, and Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.\u201d\u2014PK 730, 731 quoted in AH 549.",
