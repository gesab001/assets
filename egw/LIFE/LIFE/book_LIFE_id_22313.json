    "word": "I hope that you will not become impatient by criticism and faultfinding; but if it comes, consider that you are not perfect, that errors are liable to occur, and that many mistakes made in a lifetime occasion suspicion, although the very ones who criticize have similar errors in their experience. Many do not think of this, and as a result they are unmerciful to others, judging others by themselves, to have the same or worse weaknesses than they themselves have. But we must individually preserve a course above retaliation.",
