    "word": "\"The Lord has lifted upon us the light of His countenance. Now we will make known God as never before. Our conversation will be in heaven, and we will draw souls to His attractive loveliness. Our hope of success is in the truth we bring before the people, presenting it in every line in prophetic history, leading step by step to the close of time with the simple exhibitions of the wonders of the cross of Calvary. Truth is a continually increasing power. The love displayed by the Saviour on Calvary's cross vindicates the immutability of the law of God. There is seen the law magnified. And His grace, His peace, His pardon, and eternal life are for all who are obedient. That sacrifice on the cross purchased the crown of immortality for all who will look unto Christ and live.\"",
