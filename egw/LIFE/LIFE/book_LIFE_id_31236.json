    "word": "You need spiritual life. This life would give vigor to your soul and to your body. Spiritual life yields to its possessor that which all the world is seeking, but which can never be obtained without an entire surrender to God. You will have to say more often than you have ever yet said, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" This will give your soul the needed rest. It will give you contentment in doing the very best you can.",
