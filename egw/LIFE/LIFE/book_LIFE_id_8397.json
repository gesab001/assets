    "word": "Success does not depend so much upon age or circumstances in life as upon the real love that one has for others. Look at John Bunyan inclosed by prison walls.

The love for souls continues to burn within him, and from his dark prison-house there springs a light which shines to all parts of the civilized world. His book, \u201cThe Pilgrim's Progress,\u201d written under these trying circumstances, portrays the Christian life so accurately, and presents the love of Christ in such an attractive light, that hundreds and thousands have been converted through its instrumentality.",
