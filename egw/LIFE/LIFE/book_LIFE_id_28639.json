    "word": "All have talents entrusted to them according to their several ability, and the Lord expects these to be used to His name's glory. The warning must go to the world, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear. It may be that by your efforts a score of souls will be brought to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and each become a worker for the salvation of others. No man should reckon his labor a failure if through his efforts one soul has his name registered in the book of life. Eternity will reveal many wonderful histories in connection with the efforts made, which at the time seemed to be fruitless.",
