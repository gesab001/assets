    "word": "The life of Christ was a most perfect and thorough vindication of His Father's law, and His death attested its immutability. Christ did not, by bearing the sinner's guilt, release man from his obligation to obey the law; for if the law could have been changed or abolished, He need not have come to this world to suffer and die. The very fact that Christ died for its transgressions attests the unchanging character of the Father's law.",
