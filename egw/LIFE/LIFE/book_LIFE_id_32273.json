    "word": "Thousands who are afflicted might recover their health if, instead of depending upon the drug-store for their life, they would discard all drugs, and live simply, without using tea, coffee, liquor, or spices, which irritate the stomach and leave it weak, unable to digest even simple food without stimulation. The Lord is willing to let his light shine forth in clear, distinct rays to all who are weak and feeble.",
