    "word": "After his departure, still desirous that his firmness should not be mistaken for rebellion, Luther wrote to the emperor. \u201cGod is my witness, who knoweth the thoughts,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I am ready with all my heart to obey your majesty through good or evil report, in life or death, with no one exception, save the Word of God, by which man liveth. In all the affairs of this life my fidelity shall be unshaken; for, in these, loss or gain has nothing to do with salvation. But it is contrary to the will of God, that man should be subject to man in that which pertains to eternal life. Subjection in spirituals is a real worship, and should be rendered only to the Creator.\u201d",
