    "word": "For years you have been in great need of spirituality, and have not discerned the necessity of weaving Christ into all your labors. You should have less of self and more of Jesus. You are not naturally demonstrative, \n                                                                           331\nand it is essential for you to have a life-giving power that will bring greater earnestness into your labors. When you are placed where you feel authorized to dictate and be a controlling power, you magnify your office; but you are not one yourself to become a learner. You do not want to be counselled. You are inclined to take course according to your own judgment, to dictate, to criticize; and indulging in these habits has strengthened your tendency in this direction. You have been filled to a great degree with Pharisaism. Jesus looks upon you with grief; for you evidence by your actions in this day that if you had lived in the days of Christ you would have done as the Pharisees did in their rejection of Christ.",
