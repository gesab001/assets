    "word": "If Dr. _____ were connected with the Wahroonga Sanitarium, his influence would be exerted to launch out in such a way that you would not know how you stood financially, until embarrassments came upon you from which you could not relieve yourselves.

His tendency is to take matters into his own hands; and I fear you could not prevent him from doing this. There would be many difficulties to surmount as the result of extravagance, which would make of none effect the principles that Christ has given us in His life of self-denial and in his teachings.",
