    "word": "This life is our time of probation. We are placed under the discipline and government of God to form characters and acquire habits for the higher life. . . . We shall be subject to heavy trials, opposition, bereavement, affliction, but we know that Jesus passed through all these. These experiences are valuable to us; the advantages are not by any means confined to this short life; they reach into eternal ages. . . . All the scenes of this life in which we must act a part are to be carefully studied, for they are a part of our education. We should bring solid timbers into our character building, for we are working both for this life and eternal life. And as we near the close of this earth's history we advance more and more rapidly in Christian growth, or we retrograde just as decidedly. . . .",
