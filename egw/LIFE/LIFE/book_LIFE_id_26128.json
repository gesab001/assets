    "word": "Warning to Wealthy Parents. \n\n     At the camp-meeting in Vermont, in 1870, I felt urged by the Spirit of God to \n                                                                           149\nbear a plain testimony relating to the duty of aged and wealthy parents in the disposition of their property. I had been shown that some men, shrewd, prudent, and sharp, in regard to the transaction of business generally; men distinguished for promptness and thoroughness, manifest a want of foresight, and promptness in regard to a proper disposal of their property while they are living. They know not how soon their probation may close, yet they pass on from year to year with their business unsettled, and finally their life frequently closes without their having the use of their reason. Or they may die suddenly, without a moment's warning, and their property is disposed of in a manner that they would not have approved. These are guilty of negligence. They are unfaithful stewards.",
