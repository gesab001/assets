    "word": "When the sick are restored to health, the glory is often given to the physician, when it was the divine touch and healing balm of the Saviour that gave relief and prolonged life. If the one who has been restored gives praise to the physician, it is the physician's duty and privilege to point him to the compassionate Saviour as the One who has spoken to him the word of life and given him a new lease of life to be used for a high and holy purpose. The Lord is the worker: the physician is only the instrument. \"Without me,\" Christ declares, \"ye can do nothing.\" He says to the faithful physician, \"I will stand by your side, and as you tell those for whom you work that Christ is all and in all, that He died for their sins, in order that they should not perish, but have everlasting life, I will impress their heart.\"",
