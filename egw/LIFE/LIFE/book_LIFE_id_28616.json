    "word": "God calls for staunch, faithful workers who understand the truth and are sanctified through the truth. Our ministers, physicians, and teachers need to be converted anew, that they may be vessels unto honor. In every place Satan has his forces leagued together to counterwork the work of God. Those who give place to the subtle theories that the enemy seeks to introduce into minds do not regard sin as sinful. Those who set in motion an influence opposed to Christ are doing that which to undo will require a lifetime of Christian effort on the part of those who are standing on the platform of truth. The evil seed sown will spring up and produce a root of bitterness, whereby many shall be defiled. Wrong impressions will be made that it will seem impossible to efface.",
