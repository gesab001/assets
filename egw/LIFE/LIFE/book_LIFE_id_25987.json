    "word": "All the powers of his being are devoted to the one object, securing money. This has been the burden of his thoughts, the anxiety of his life. He has turned all the powers of his being in this one direction until he is a worshiper of mammon to all intents and purposes. Upon this subject he is insane. His example before his family is leading them to think the possession of property is to be valued before Heaven and immortality. He is sacrificing his eternal interest for treasures upon the earth. He has for years been educating his mind to acquire property. He believes the truth--he loves the principles of truth, and loves to see others prospering in the truth, but he has made himself so thoroughly a slave to mammon, that he feels bound to serve this master as long as he shall live. The longer he lives, the more devoted will he become to his love of getting gain, unless he tears his soul away from this terrible God, money. It will be like tearing out his vitals, but it must be done if he values Heaven. \n                                                                           34",
