    "word": "We Must Become More Like Jesus.--What we want is religion. What we want is that peace that comes from heaven. When Christ entered that upper chamber where His disciples were assembled, He said to them, \"Peace be unto you.\" This is what we want, the peace of Christ. Your friends may bring you happiness, but that is not the peace of Christ, and we want to take that course in this life that may be a light to this crooked and perverse nation.",
