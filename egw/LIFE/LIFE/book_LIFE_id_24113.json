    "word": "The Lord has a work for you to do, and if you listen to His voice, you will not be left in darkness. The Saviour says, \"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me\" (John 10:27). \"And a stranger will they not follow, . . . for they know not the voice of strangers\" (verse 5). I am sure that the Lord is revealing to you the perfection and fullness of the atoning work, that your whole heart may be filled with love and thanksgiving, and that you may reveal to others that which the Lord is revealing to you. The image of Christ engraved upon the heart is reflected in character, in practical life, day by day, because we represent a personal Saviour.",
