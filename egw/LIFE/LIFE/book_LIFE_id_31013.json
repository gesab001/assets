    "word": "God has intrusted to us our capabilities, in order that we may make the most of them for his glory. Christ said, \"A little while is the light with you, walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you.\" The intellect may be cultivated, and through the harmonious use of our faculties, under the control of the Holy Spirit, we may develop a strong, firm character. A righteous character formed after the likeness of Christ's character has a value above that of gold or precious stones. Those who co-operate with the Lord Jesus Christ in the formation of a righteous character will become laborers together with God. They will act their part as the human agent through whom God will reach the hearts and minds of men and women who are separated from him by sin, and will win them to Christ. No one can copy the pattern Christ Jesus without becoming a channel of light to influence others. No man liveth unto himself. God has claims upon us individually and in our short probationary life he requires us to put into exercise the powers he has granted us, to love one another as he has loved us. We are not to labor merely keeping this short life time in view; but to act as if in sight of eternity, we are to act as if the curtain between us and the universe of heaven was withdrawn, and we could with the eye of faith, see Christ looking upon us, and encouraging us in our work. Study diligently the lessons he gave to his disciples; for he declared, \"The words I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they are life.\" There is marrow and fatness in these lessons. Christ has prayed to his Father \n                                                                           1253\nfor his disciples. He said, \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.\"",
