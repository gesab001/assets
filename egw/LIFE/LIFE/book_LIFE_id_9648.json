    "word": "I cannot neglect the great salvation that has been brought to me at such an infinite cost to my heavenly Father, who \"so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" I will not dishonor my Redeemer to lightly esteem His sufferings, His trials, His condescension, His sacrifice, His death, because He so loves us, He would Himself become our sin-bearer. Oh, what love, what inexpressible love! He became a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. He died on the cross [as if He were] a transgressor, that man might be justified through His merits. . . .",
