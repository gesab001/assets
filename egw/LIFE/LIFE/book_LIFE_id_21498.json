    "word": "Letter C\n     \u201cSunnyside,\u201d Cooranbong \n     Sept. 30, 1896 \n\nDear Brother: \n     ...Those who claim to believe the truth in Africa, need to have decided, earnest efforts made in their behalf. The struggling little flock need a firm, decided testimony. Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. It is the power of the Holy Spirit that is needed. There is with you and with the flock of God a self-satisfied feeling that must be broken up. The Spirit of God is a convincing power. When this is breathed upon the church, there will be a decided change in their spiritual efficiency. The Lord God is ready to give, but many do not realize their necessity of receiving. They are weak, when they might be strong; powerless, when they might be powerful through receiving the efficiency of the Holy Spirit. Their light is dim. Arouse them from their self-satisfied, self-righteous condition.",
