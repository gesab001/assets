    "word": "Mattie expects to consummate a marriage with you, and you have given her encouragement to expect this by your attentions. Your happiness in this life and in the future life is in peril. You have followed her deceptive, foolish entreaties and your own judgment which have not made you a more consistent Christian or a more faithful, dutiful son. I speak that I do know, and testify that I have seen. If you will separate yourself from her society you will find a welcome in Battle Creek to engage in labor or attend school and fit yourself as a laborer in the cause of God.",
