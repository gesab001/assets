    "word": "Oh, what a God we have that He should so love \"the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" [John 3:16]. Collecting all the riches of His grace, all the resources of His infinite love, He has placed them at the disposal of the human family, that as many as receive Him might have power to become the sons of God. All who believe in His name may become one with Christ in God.",
