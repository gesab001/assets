In my dream I was preparing to attend an important meeting where we were expecting to meet Dr. Kellogg and W. C. White. Willie came into the room unexpectedly, and I was surprised and glad to greet him. There was altogether a changed look on his countenance. He said, \"Mother, I have it; I have found peace and rest and fullness in Jesus Christ. I know now, as never before, what it means to abide in Christ. My heart, my mind, my flesh, are all the Lord's. My will is to do the will of God. I feel a new and spiritual life, and all who have this spiritual life are 'alive unto God.' Christ is the very substance, the fountain of life, to every believing heart.\"",
