    "word": "What Christ was in His life on this earth, that every Christian should be. He is our example, not only in His spotless purity, but in His patience, gentleness, and winsomeness of disposition. He was as firm as a rock where truth and duty were concerned, but He was invariably kind and courteous. His life was a perfect illustration of true courtesy. He had ever a kind look and a word of comfort for the needy and oppressed.",
