    "word": "Light from the throne of God is waiting for you. Empty your hearts, and let this light shine in. Show to the world an image of heavenly certainty. Lift up your eyes and see the fields that are ripe for the harvest. The light of heaven will shine all around you, repelling presumptuous sophistries. Let the truth shine forth with its own glory and in its own defense. Feed the flock of God with the manna that His own hand supplies. Your capabilities will increase as the indwelling life expands. Trust to God's guardianship. His church is to be taught. Enfeebled and defective though it is, it is the object of His supreme regard.",
