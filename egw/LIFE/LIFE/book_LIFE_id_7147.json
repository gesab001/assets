    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     I have heard some ministers talk of Christ's life and teachings, in a commonplace manner, as though recounting the incidents in the life of some great man of the world. Indeed, it is not unusual for ministers in their discourses to treat of Christ as though he were a man like themselves. When I hear this sacred subject treated in such a manner, I feel a grief that I cannot express; for I know that although these men are teachers of the truth, they have never had exalted views of Christ; they have never become acquainted with him and learned of him. They have not that elevation of thought which would give them a clear conception of the divine character of the world's Redeemer.",
