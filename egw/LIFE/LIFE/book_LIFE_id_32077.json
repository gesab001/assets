    "word": "Be Vigilant\n\n     There is room for all in the work of God, for a world demands our labors. We must not put off the doing of our work until labor comes to be regarded as genteel. The life of Christ is a constant rebuke to the one who is willing to sit by with folded hands. Let us now set to work in earnest to do something for Christ. The Saviour wept over the guilt and obduracy of Jerusalem. Who is ready to weep over his neglect and indolence in the past, and take up the work that has been neglected? We must no longer be self-indulgent.",
