    "word": "The judgments of God are soon to be poured out upon the earth. \"Escape for thy life\" is the warning from the angels of God. Other voices are heard saying: \"Do not become excited; there is no cause for special alarm.\" Those who are at ease in Zion cry \"Peace and safety,\" while heaven declares that swift destruction is about to come upon the transgressor. The young, the frivolous, the pleasure loving, consider these warnings as idle tales and turn from them with a jest. Parents are inclined to think their children about right in the matter, and all sleep on at ease. Thus it was at the destruction of the old world and when Sodom and Gomorrah were consumed by fire. On the night prior to their destruction the cities of the plain rioted in pleasure. Lot was derided for his fears and warnings. But it was these scoffers that perished in the flames. That very night the door of mercy was forever closed to the wicked, careless inhabitants of Sodom.",
