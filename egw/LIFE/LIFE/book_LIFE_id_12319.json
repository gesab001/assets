    "word": "Circumstances may separate friends; the restless waters of the wide sea may roll between us and them. But no circumstances, no distance, can separate us from the Saviour. Wherever we may be, He is at our right hand, to support, maintain, uphold, and cheer. Greater than the love of a mother for her child is Christ\u2019s love for His redeemed. It is our privilege to rest in His love; to say, \u201cI will trust Him; for He gave His life for me.\u201d",
