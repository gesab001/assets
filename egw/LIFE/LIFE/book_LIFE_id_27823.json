    "word": "Restoration of the Whole Man to God's Image--The great object of life should be to restore to God soul, body, and spirit. If the moral image of God is restored in the poor, degraded sot, it will not be by continuing to give him liquor. In every city the Lord would have a place where sin-sick souls may find courage and sustaining help to overcome all unnatural appetites and sinful indulgences--tobacco using, tea and liquor drinking. All flesh meat is to be discarded. Educational meetings should be held where young men may be instructed how to develop a perfect manhood. Then they can become teachers of good things.--Letter 95, 1898, p. 3. (To Bro. Hubbard, Nov. 18, 1898.) \n\n\n                                 -232-",
