    "word": "It is time now that every soul who has a knowledge of present truth come into line and renew his consecration to God. We are to come up to a much higher standard. When there come into our meetings strange spirits, let us not, whatever may be their testimony, repeat their words, but let us repeat the encouraging words that the Lord has given to us. Let us make His word our strong testimony. We are to learn to lean upon His sure promise, and be ready to communicate our encouragement to others. Let us take hold of the mighty assurances that God has given us in Christ and in His Word, and endeavor daily to carry on the work that the Redeemer undertook in behalf of humanity. In the life and death of Christ we can see what sacrifice heaven was willing to make that we might not perish but have everlasting life.",
