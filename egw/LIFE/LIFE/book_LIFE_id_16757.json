    "word": "The true higher education is what makes students acquainted with God and his word, and fits them for eternal life. It was to place this life within their reach that Christ gave himself an offering for sin. His purpose of love and mercy is expressed in his prayer for his disciples. \"These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, \n                                                                           24\nwhom thou hast sent.\" Every instructor of youth is to work in harmony with this prayer, leading the students to Christ.",
