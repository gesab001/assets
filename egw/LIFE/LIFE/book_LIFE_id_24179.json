    "word": "The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" Solomon testifies, \"The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.\" Those who are one with Christ cannot enjoy listening to trifling, cheap conversation; much less will they engage in it themselves. If the heart is spiritual, there will be spiritual conversation, for \"out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\" In our words and actions our thoughts will be revealed just as they are. The life is a true unfurling of the banner, testifying what is in the heart.",
