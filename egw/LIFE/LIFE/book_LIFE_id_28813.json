    "word": "Brother Albert, God has designed you should be a pillar in the church, a strength to the weak. Satan has said from the first he would overthrow you. He has led you in your unconverted life to be exacting and to overreach, and as you have seen the sin of this and have been reforming, you have established a character. All have had unmistakable proofs of the work of reform. The truth \n\n\n                                   -161- \n\nhas wrought for you, and Satan knows that if you follow on and are a thorough overcomer, the sins he led you to commit fall on his own head. He is not willing to lose you. He is constantly at work to devise some means to overthrow you, that your transgressions may finally rest upon your own head.",
