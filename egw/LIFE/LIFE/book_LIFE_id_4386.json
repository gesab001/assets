    "word": "All to Have a Part in the Work of God\n     Our Sisters Can Do Much.--Our sisters are doing comparatively nothing, when they might do very much. Christ is searching the life and character for fruit, and He finds many professed Christians, like the fruitless fig tree, bearing nothing but leaves. The sisters can work efficiently in obtaining subscribers for our periodicals, in this way bringing the light before many minds. The distribution of tracts, and the work of Christian  canvassers and colporteurs,  can be done as well by our sisters as by our brethren.",
