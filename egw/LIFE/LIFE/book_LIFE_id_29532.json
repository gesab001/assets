    "word": "It remains for you, my brother, to step over the line that God has marked out. The path of implicit obedience is the only path of safety, for this is the path cast up for the Christian to travel--the path which leads him close to the side of his Redeemer. He will have a converted body. His soul is in harmony with the laws of God. He is daily receiving renovating grace and is made rich by his title to an immortal inheritance. He is walking in the path of the overcomer. He has a title that will stand the test of law. Through the righteousness of Christ he holds a claim to the priceless gift of eternal life. His heart reposes upon the promise of full and free salvation, imperishable wealth, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.",
