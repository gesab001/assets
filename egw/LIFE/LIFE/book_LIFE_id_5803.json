    "word": "\"Believe, Only Believe\" \n\n     From the pulpits of today the words are uttered: \"Believe, only believe. Have faith in Christ; you have nothing to do with the old law, only trust in Christ.\" How different is this from the words of the apostle who declares that faith without works is dead. He says, \"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves\" (James 1:22). We must have that faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Many seek to substitute a superficial faith for uprightness of life and think through this to obtain salvation.",
