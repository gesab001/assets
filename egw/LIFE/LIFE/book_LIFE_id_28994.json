    "word": "The Lord is doing a great work in the earth. With intense interest He is examining every man's fitness of character to associate with the sinless angels \n\n\n                                -164- \n\nand with the redeemed family in heaven. Not one of the ransomed host will be disposed to begin a rebellion similar to the one that Satan began before the creation of our race. The Lord gives men and women probationary time in which to acquaint themselves with His terms of salvation. They are given opportunity to unite with Him, as \"laborers together with God,\" to mold their characters after the similitude of the Divine. Thus they heed His words of counsel, \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" They profit by the words of warning: \"Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.\"",
