    "word": "Shall we not come into right relation to God? Shall we not put away all strife, which is a manifestation of unconverted self? When you feel sore because you think that somebody else is getting ahead of you, take the matter to the Father in prayer. Ask Him to put the impress of His Spirit upon your mind and character. When you feel like complaining at your lot, look about for some soul who does not have all the blessings that you enjoy. Speak to him words of hope and comfort and encouragement. Such ministry will be a blessing to him, and a greater blessing to yourself. We need to reach the place where as a people we shall reveal in word and work that the Spirit of God is dwelling within; that we are overcomers by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. It is our privilege to make the battle of life easier for those with whom we associate. Shall we not endeavor to do this? If we will partake of Christ's labors for the uplifting and redemption of souls, we shall hear His words of benediction, \"Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"",
