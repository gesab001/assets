They witness the outburst of wonder, rapture, and adoration from the saved; and as the wave of \n128\nmelody sweeps over the multitudes without the city, all with one voice exclaim, \u201cMarvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints\u201d; and, falling prostrate, they worship the Prince of life.\u20144SP 484.",
