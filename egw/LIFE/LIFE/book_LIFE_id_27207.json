    "word": "We greatly desire to see the spiritual atmosphere in Battle Creek changed for the better. Decided changes need to be made in the church; for her lack of moral power and spiritual efficiency is to be lamented. What can heal the church? What can create a pure and holy sentiment in all our institutions in Battle Creek? We need to begin at the very first principles of willing obedience to God's holy law. An outward observance of the Sabbath \n\n\n                                    -397- \n\nwill not save the soul. The principles interwoven with every one of the ten commandments are to be honored and obeyed in the individual, practical life. The law, God requires, shall be written on the tablets of every soul.-- Letter 191, 1899, pp. 3, 4. (To Elders Irwin and Haskell, November, 1899.)",
