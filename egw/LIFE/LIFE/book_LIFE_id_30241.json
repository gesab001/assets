    "word": "With many the precious Word of God is neglected. A novel or a story book engages the attention and fascinates the mind. Anything that will excite the imagination is eagerly devoured, while the Word of God is set aside. Why was it that the Jewish nation rejected and turned from Christ, insisting [that] a robber be granted them and that the Prince of life be crucified? Why did such blindness come upon the people? It was because they overlooked the Word of Life, because they failed to search the Scriptures.",
