    "word": "In His youth Christ was subject unto His parents--an example of obedience to all the youth. In His youth He learned the trade of a carpenter, and earned His bread by the sweat of His brow. Thus He honored physical labor, and gave it as a lesson in His practical life. It should be an encouragement and source of strength to every human being in the performance of the commonplace duties of life to know that Jesus labored and toiled to provide for His own temporal wants.",
