    "word": "What we want today is to be constantly studying the life of Christ and working every day of our life to answer the prayer of Christ that you may be one in His love, and work for unity. The prayer that He offered to His Father is to exercise interest and love for souls. You want in every work, in your spirit, in your thoughts, in your actions, to be cherishing the love of Christ which He has prayed might exist. You want that faith that works out your salvation after the divine similitude. Why, you tell us that by our works we are not saved! Nevertheless, you are not saved by any evil works; but you have that faith that works out a character after the divine similitude. It is a faith that works out a unity of action, brother with brother, and every hour of your life if you are standing in living connection with God. You manifest His love. It works in your home life.",
