    "word": "God's works in nature have lessons of wisdom and gifts of healing for all. The ever-varying scenes of the recurring seasons constantly present fresh tokens of His glory, His power, and His love. Well were it for older students, while they labor to acquire the arts and learning of men, to also seek more of the wisdom of God,-- to learn more of the divine laws, both natural and moral. In obedience to these are life and happiness, in this world and in the world to come.--Review and Herald, Jan. 10, 1882.",
