    "word": "The less conversation you have with your wife about the science of mind-cure, the better it will be for you both. The only hope for your wife's salvation is for you to refuse to let her influence you for the wrong. She has not the mind of Christ, and you should not allow her to lead or rule you. If she does this, both her soul and yours will be lost. Her religion has never been what it should be. Her life has not been what the life of a Christian should be. This has nearly been your ruin. Your only safety is in realizing that your identity cannot be submerged in hers. For years you have walked uncertainly. Will you not now take a correct position and maintain it firmly, in righteousness working out a character that God can approve? Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.",
