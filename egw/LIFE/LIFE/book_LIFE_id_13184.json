    "word": "Jesus' illustrations constantly repeated His lessons.--The educated were charmed with Christ's teaching, and the uneducated were always profited; for He appealed to their understanding. His illustrations were taken from the things of daily life, and although they were simple, they had in them a wonderful depth of meaning. The fowls of the air, the lilies of the field, the seed, the shepherd and the sheep,--with these objects, Christ illustrated immortal truth; and ever afterward, when His hearers chanced to see these things of nature, they recalled His words. Christ's illustrations constantly repeated His lessons.--RH May 18, 1897.",
