    "word": "Our life, if hid with Christ in God, will not be discerned or appreciated by the world. Christian character is sometimes admired by some classes of the world who desire to see consistency, but generally the world is at enmity with God and His people. The world generally will not be pleased with real, vital godliness, with a firm, steadfast character that will not be swayed by any of their sophistries or by science falsely so called.",
