    "word": "It is not because God has given His Son that He loves the world, but because He loved the world He gave His Son, \"that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" As you connect yourself with Jesus Christ you connect yourself with eternal life. His life is in you; you are hid with Christ in God, \"and when Christ who is our life shall \n\n\n                 -111- \n\nappear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory\" [Colossians 3:4].",
