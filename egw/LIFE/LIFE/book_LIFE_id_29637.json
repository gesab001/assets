    "word": "The medical missionary work is not to be divorced from the church. Men of power and strength of mind are to grasp every opportunity of becoming acquainted with the Word of God. This Word each individual who would win eternal life must eat and drink as the flesh and blood of the Son of God. All our new converts need training. Well-directed labor should be put forth that they may receive light. There is constant need of men with well balanced minds, who will not step aside either into the fire or into the water.",
