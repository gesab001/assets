    "word": "Shimei, a kinsman of Saul, who had ever been envious of David because he received the throne and kingly honors which had once been given to Saul, improved this opportunity of venting his rebellious rage upon David in his misfortune. He cursed the king, and cast stones and dirt at him, and his servants, and accused David of being a bloody and mischievous man. The followers of David begged permission to go and take his life, but David rebukes them, and tells them to \"let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?\" If my son \"seeketh my life, how much more now may this Benjamite do it? Let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden him.\"",
