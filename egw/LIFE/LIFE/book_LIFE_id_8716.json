    "word": "How few appreciate these blessings! How few seek to improve their talent and increase their usefulness in the world! The Master has given to every man his work. He has given to every man according to his ability, and his trust is in proportion to his capacity. . . .

Let the mechanic be a diligent and faithful representative of Him who toiled in the lowly walks of life in the cities of Judea. . . .",
