FROM THE PEN OF ELLEN WHITE WE FIND COUNSEL AND INSTRUCTION TOUCHING ALMOST EVERY PHASE OF CHRISTIAN LIFE AND EXPERIENCE. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE LINES OF INSTRUCTION GIVEN ARE REPRESENTED IN THE TESTIMONIES AND OTHER ELLEN G. WHITE BOOKS, THE REINDEXING OF PUBLISHED BUT NOW OUT-OF-PRINT MATERIALS AND OF UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPTS HAS REVEALED ITEMS OF COUNSEL ALONG CERTAIN LINES, WHICH ARE BECOMING OF INCREASING IMPORTANCE TODAY WITH THE APPEARANCE OF NEW AND DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. THESE ITEMS WILL ADD TANGIBLY TO THE WEALTH OF INSTRUCTION NOW IN THE HANDS OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS.",
