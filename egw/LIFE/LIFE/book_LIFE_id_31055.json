    "word": "With the example of Christ before you, can you plead convenience for the erection of more buildings and the centering of more interests in Battle Creek? Our people have deep, earnest lessons to learn in the experience presented in the words of Christ: \"He that will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\" You are not to choose the most convenient path and, because selfish practices have been followed, continue the same course. Look to Christ, and learn how he dealt with humanity. He loved his neighbor better than he loved himself. He denied himself that he might be a perfect example for us. With unfeigned reliance upon the righteousness and efficiency of our Redeemer, we are to consider that as sons and daughters of God we are no longer our own. In receiving Christ we become dead unto the world. Our high vocation--the very highest that any human being can have in this life--is this, that we are called to be children of God. The whole future life is to be consecrated to the service of God. Sacred obligations rest upon every soul. All the faculties of mind and body are God's property; and every hour spent in selfish gratification or self-uplifting will bring its returns in a harvest which none will care to garner. \n                                                                           1365",
