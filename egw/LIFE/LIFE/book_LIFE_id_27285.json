    "word": "Dr. _____ will perhaps be able to flourish in his apostasy for a time; but poor man, he will get to the length of his chain ere long. His happy days are almost over. I pity every apostate. I wish not to increase their miserableness for they have enough to bear. Those who take the side of the great rebel will have the wages of sin which is death. But those who take the side of Christ will have the gift of God which is eternal life. Give me the wages which the Lord gives.--Letter 20, 1892, p. 2. (To J. H. Kellogg, October 17, 1892.)",
