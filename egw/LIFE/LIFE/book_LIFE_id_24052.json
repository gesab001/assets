    "word": "Our sins may be as mountains before us, but if we humble our hearts in confession of them, trusting in the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour, we shall be forgiven, and shall be cleansed from all unrighteousness. The depth of a Saviour's love is revealed in our salvation. If we will accept this salvation, our testimony will be, \"We have redemption through his blood\" (Ephesians 1:7). The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death. We are more than conquerors through Him that loved us, and gave Himself for us.",
