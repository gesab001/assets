    "word": "Ministers and church members should do everything in their power to answer that prayer of Christ. For this, Christ has given His life--to bring all believers into an inward, living union with Himself and with the Father, and thus bind up by golden, spiritual links, brother with brother, in peace and love and unity, and with Christ in God, so that heaven will be represented upon the earth, that the world may believe that God has sent His Son. This unity among believers is the credentials they bear to Christ that God has sent His Son into the world. This great mission can be made successful.",
