Here [A NEW SANITARIUM WAS BEING DEVELOPED AT WAHROONGA, ABOUT 13 MILES FROM SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.] are no liquor-selling hotels or dram-shops on every corner to tempt the unfortunate victim of intemperance. And the pure sights and sounds, the clear, invigorating air, and the sense of God's presence pervading all nature, tend to uplift the mind, to soften the heart, and to strengthen the will to resist temptation.-- Ms. 12, 1900, pp. 1-2.
