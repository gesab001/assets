    "word": "Christ Himself, the Son of the infinite God, clothed His divinity with humanity, and came to this world to show human beings what they may become by obeying the principles of heaven. Through His grace they may become partakers of the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust. Clearly God makes known His will to men and women. Evidence after evidence is given of His unwillingness that any should perish. It is His desire that all through believing and obeying His word shall have eternal life. The Saviour's reference to the flowers and the birds is a rebuke to human beings who depart from the plan of God in their behalf, and lower themselves to do acts that dishonor their maker and Him who came to teach men and women how to practise the virtues that will give them a welcome into the heavenly courts.",
