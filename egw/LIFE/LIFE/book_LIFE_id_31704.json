    "word": "Chap. 27 - Parents and Children\n[REMARKS AT THE\nMINISTERIAL INSTITUTE HELD IN LOS\nANGELES, MONDAY, MARCH 18, 1912.]\n\nBy Ellen G. White\n\n     I felt that if I should come before you again I should say the same things that I was saying last night in my dreams. I seemed to be speaking to a company of people, who listened earnestly to my words. I was pleading with them to devote their energies to training their children for the future life. There were many in the congregation who were condemned by the truths spoken; for they had been giving misguided instruction, with scoldings and denials. They had not brought up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.",
