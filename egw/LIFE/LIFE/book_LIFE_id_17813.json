    "word": "Ministers who are preaching present truth were held up to me in contrast with the leading men of the Reformation, and especially was Luther's devoted, zealous life placed along side of the lives of some of our preachers. His undying love for the truth, his courage, his calm firmness, his self-denial, his trials and sacrifices, his suffering at times the deepest anguish of soul, while standing in defense of the truth. Yet he murmured not. His life was hunted like a wild beast of prey, yet he endured all cheerfully for Christ's sake.",
