    "word": "Many are doing the same thing today . . . because they have not had experience in the testing message comprehended in the first, second, and third angels' messages. There are those who are searching the Scriptures for proof that these messages are still in the future. They gather together the truthfulness of the messages, but they fail to give them their proper place in prophetic history. Therefore such are in danger of misleading the people in regard to locating the messages. They do not see and understand the time of the end, or when to locate the messages. . . .The watchman is to know the time of the night. Everything is now clothed with a solemnity that all who believe the truth should feel and sense. . . . All the little things of life are but a mote now. Those that pertain to eternity are of great consequence.--Manuscript 41a, Dec. 20, 1896, untitled manuscript.",
