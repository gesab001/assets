    "word": "There is a spurious experience that is prevailing now everywhere in regard to the love of Jesus--that we must dwell on the love of Jesus, that faith in Jesus is all we need--but these souls must be instructed that the love of Jesus in the heart will lead to humility of life and obedience to all His commandments. \"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\" (1 John 2:4). The love of Jesus that goes no farther than the lips will not save any soul, but be a great delusion.--Manuscript 26, Oct. 17, 1885, \"First Visit to Sweden, diary.\"",
