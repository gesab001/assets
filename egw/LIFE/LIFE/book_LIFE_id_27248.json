We should have been out of sight of our present spiritual condition, if we had advanced as the light came to us. We should have advanced so far that we would not recognize our present condition. There has been every hindrance to keep us in earthliness and commonness that we should not grasp the eternal. \"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.\" The truth and light given to us of God is as a priceless treasure hid in a field. We are to buy the field and work every foot of it. The more we look at the promises of the word of God, the brighter they grow. The more we practice the principles of God's word, the deeper will be our understanding of them. Our position and \n\n\n                                   -79- \n\nfaith is in the Bible. And never do we want any soul to bring in the testimonies ahead of the Bible.",
