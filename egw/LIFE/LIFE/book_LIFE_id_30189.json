    "word": "You have been bought with a price--and what a price! Who can measure the line let down from heaven for the saving of the subjects of sin. Who \n\n\n                                     -335- \n\ncan compass a love that is as broad as eternity? Think of the sacrifice that Christ made for you. He stepped down from  His high command, and came to this world with the treasures of heaven, that every human being might have power to reach the standard set before him in God's law. Clothing His divinity with humanity, He came to stand at the head of the human race, in our behalf to live a perfect life, that He might know how to help us in our conflict with sin. Through His sacrifice, human beings may reach the high ideal set before them, and hear at last the words, You are complete in Him, not having your own righteousness, but the righteousness that He wrought out for you, Your imperfection is no longer seen; for you are clothed with the robe of Christ's perfection.",
