    "word": "God has given us His holy Word, and His Word is to be presented in the grace of His Holy Spirit. When men permit their peculiar traits of character \n\n\n                                    -102- \n\nand their own unpurified spirit to misrepresent the pure and holy truths which God has committed to them, they cause the loss of many souls who might have been saved if the human agents had been meek, humble, and contrite of heart. It is only as one has learned of Jesus the precious lesson of preserving the fragrance of His character that the Spirit and Word are a savor of life unto life.",
