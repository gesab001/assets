    "word": "In almost every church there are young men and women who might receive education either as nurses or physicians. They will never have a more favorable opportunity than now. I would urge that this subject be considered prayerfully, that special effort be made to select those youth who give promise of usefulness and moral strength. Let these receive an education at our Sanitarium at Battle Creek, to go out as missionaries wherever the Lord may call them to labor. It should ever be kept before \n\n\n                      -6- \n\nthem that their work is not only to relieve physical suffering, but to minister to souls that are ready to perish. It is important that every one who is to act as a medical missionary be skilled in ministering to the soul as well as to the body. He is to be an imitator of Christ, presenting to the sick and suffering the preciousness of pure and undefiled religion. While doing all in his power to relieve physical distress and to preserve this mortal life, he should point to the mercy and love of Jesus, the great Physician, who came that \"whosoever believeth in him might not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
