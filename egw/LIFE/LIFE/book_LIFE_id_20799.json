    "word": "Much is involved in the matter of judging. Remember that soon your life record will pass in review before God. Remember, too, that He has said: \"Thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?\" Romans 2:1-3. \n\n                                               -",
