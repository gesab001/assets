    "word": "In giving His Son to come into the world and die for fallen man, the Lord has done His part; for all heaven was poured out to man in that one rich gift; and now God waits for the cooperation of those who have a knowledge of the love of Christ. Let no one think that because he is poor, and has but a humble position in life, he can not become a missionary for the Lord. The work of Christ, the Majesty of heaven, was begun in poverty and humiliation. The parents of Christ were in very humble circumstances, and the Prince of Life labored with His own hands at the carpenter's bench, that He might help to meet the wants of the family. He took His place in the world as a common day laborer, and He has the tenderest sympathy for those who are struggling to obtain knowledge under difficulties. If those who can not have advantages such as they would desire will but look at the experience of hardship, poverty, and humiliation that Christ endured for their sake, they will see that they have no need to be sad or discouraged. Let those who would work for God trust implicitly in Him; for through the influence of the divine Spirit, through simple, living faith in God, men and women, however humble, may become powerful agents in His hands, to win souls to Christ; for genuine experience in the things of God is not gained through natural means.\u2014S.
