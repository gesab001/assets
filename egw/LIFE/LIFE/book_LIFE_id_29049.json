    "word": "Imagine the temptations found in such a court as Babylon, and at a period of life when temptations have a peculiar power to tarnish and pollute morals. It was just such a situation as we would consider favorable for a man to lose his soul in. Certainly it would not be chosen by a man who wanted to save his soul. Daniel and his associates feared God. They determined not to yield their faith or their principles. They were young, and these four youth in God's own providence were placed in this perilous position that through them God's power might be revealed. These men were not God-fearing and God- loving because circumstances favored it; the godliness was within themselves, and they clung to it and held it fast. Circumstances were continually of that nature to subvert, to attract, to lead to self-indulgence, to crush out godliness. But it was not crushed. Genuine purity and God-fearing principles were interwoven with their life and character.",
