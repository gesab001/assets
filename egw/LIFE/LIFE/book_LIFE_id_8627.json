    "word": "Often the training and education of a lifetime must be discarded, that one may become a learner in the school of Christ. Our hearts must be educated to become steadfast in God. We are to form habits of thought that will enable us to resist temptation. We must learn to look upward. The principles of the Word of God--principles that are as high as heaven and that compass eternity--we are to understand in their bearing on our daily life. Every act, every word, every thought, is to be in accord with these principles.",
