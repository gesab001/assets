    "word": "The True Inspiration to Enthusiasm. \n\n     If there is anything in our world that should inspire enthusiasm, it is the cross of Calvary. \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.\" \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Christ is to be accepted, believed on, and exalted. This is to be the theme of conversation,--the preciousness of Christ.",
