    "word": "I feel it my duty to bear a plain, decided testimony to the believers in Kaeo. They need, oh so much, to be awakened. They do not know what it means to have a burden for the souls in their own borders. They do not know what it means to seek for the perishing ones out of Christ. They do not see why they need to go to campmeeting. The common duties of life are all-absorbing, and it does not meet their inclination to go out from their work and homes, and be put to inconvenience to obtain light and strength through seeking the Lord \n\n\n                                    -85- \n\nwith their brethren. We are working to arouse them. May the Lord help us.--Ms 38, 1893, pp. 1, 4, 5. (\"Labors in Kaeo,\" March 8, 1893.)",
