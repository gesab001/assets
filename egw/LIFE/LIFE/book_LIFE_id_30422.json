    "word": "Every advantage has been given us to make possible our salvation. For us Christ hung on Calvary's cross. For our sake He was laid in the tomb. When He rose from the dead He proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" He is indeed our life, if we are faithful representatives of Him. We cannot afford to be representatives of Satan and do as sinners do, for we should have to endure the suffering that comes to them and share their final reward.",
