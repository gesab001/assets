    "word": "The resurrection of Christ is the life of the church. When we see a man or a woman whose heart the Saviour can not make tender and sympathetic, we all need to cherish the love of Christ in the soul, in order that through our lives He may reveal His unutterable tenderness, gentleness, and sympathy. \n                                                                           1789\nThe Lord Jesus is ever prepared to irradiate with the glory of His presence every heart that will open to let Him in.",
