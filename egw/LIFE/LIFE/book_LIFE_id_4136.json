    "word": "When the Son of God was on trial, the Jews cried out, \"Away with Him, crucify Him!\" because His pure life and holy teaching convicted them of sin and condemned them; and for the same reason many in their hearts cry out against the word of God. Many, even of the children and youth, have learned to love sin. They hate reflection, and the thought of God is a sting to their conscience. It is because the human heart is inclined to evil that it is so dangerous to sow the seeds of skepticism in young minds.",
