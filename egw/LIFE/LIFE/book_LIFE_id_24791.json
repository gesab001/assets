    "word": "From town to town, from city to city, from country to country, the warning message of present truth is to be proclaimed; not with outward display, but in the power of the Spirit, by men of faith. In the golden censer of truth, as presented in the Scriptures, there is that which will convict and convert souls. As the truth that our Saviour came to this world to proclaim, is presented in the simplicity of the gospel, the power of the message will make itself felt. In this age, a new life coming from the Source of all life is to take possession of every faithful laborer. O, how little do we comprehend the breadth of our mission! \n                                                                           15\nWe need to have earnest, determined faith, and unshaken courage in the Lord. Our time to work is short, and we are to labor with unflagging zeal.--Review & Herald, Nov. 29, 1906.",
