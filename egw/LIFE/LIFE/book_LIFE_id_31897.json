    "word": "There is a much higher standard to be reached in every family. All can rise. By drawing nigh to God, they may receive power to resist the devil; for the Spirit of God lifts up a standard for them against the enemy. The father and the mother who know no higher rule of life than selfish indulgence of lustful passions are not Christians. They are lowering the standard of intellectual and moral character, and are descending down toward the brute creation, rather than upward to work in harmony with Jesus Christ to restore the moral image of God in man. Appetites are cherished that are low and debasing, and entirely unnatural.",
