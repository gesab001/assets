    "word": "The letter written by sister Smith to Bro. Andrews in reference to my husband had great influence on his mind. Sister Smith and many others viewed his case in an exaggerated light. But when the letter sister Smith had written to Bro. Andrews was introduced before the public by Bro. Waggoner, it told with great severity against sister Smith.

Here, again, she erred.",
