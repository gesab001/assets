    "word": "The time is coming when the Southern field will be closed, locked up. But this is not yet the case. One place where the work was commenced was closed against the workers; and because of this the word went forth, the Southern field is closed; no more money will be needed for that work. But is this the way in which the Saviour worked? When one city was closed against him, did he say that his work on earth was done? Had he done this, what would have become of us? When he was driven from one place, he went to another, and he has left us the direction, \"When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\" When your life is in danger, go to another city, and when they persecute you there, go to yet another place: \"For verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of Man be come.\" Shall we not take this advice? \n                                Ellen G. White. \n\n\n                                -372-",
