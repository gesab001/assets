    "word": "Here in Malachi we read, \"Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name.\" It is represented as God hearkening to their testimonies. Although you have no minister standing in the desk talking to you, yet you have angels of God that will minister unto you. And as you talk of the blessed hope and of the home in heaven, angels are right by your side. Why, we have enough in this hope to give us life and courage if we will only draw nearer to God.",
