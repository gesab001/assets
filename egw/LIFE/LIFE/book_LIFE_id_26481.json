    "word": "The American mail goes tomorrow, and I have much to write. Have written 17 pages since 3:00 a.m., prepared for the mail which leaves Cooranbong at 9:00 a.m. As soon as I take my pen in my hand I am not in darkness as to what to write. It is as plain and clear as a voice speaking to me, \"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go.\" \"In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct (make plain) thy paths.\" We are to trust the Lord with all our heart. We have proved the Lord. We have the sure word on which we shall rely. Christ assures us, \"I am the light of the world: He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\" [John 8:12]. \"When thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light.\" Praise the Lord, I have verified His promise. Since I was a youth 11 years old, I have believed the promise. I will cast my helpless soul upon the One who has bought me with the price of His own blood.--Ms 89, 1900, pp. 1, 2.
