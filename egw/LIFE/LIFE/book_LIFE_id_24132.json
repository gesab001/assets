    "word": "Christ said of them that they \"loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved\" (John 3:19, 20). He said, \"Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life\" (John 5:40). The way was open; but by their own course of action they closed the door, and severed their connection with Christ. We may do the same by rejecting light and truth.--Review and Herald, March 26, 1889.",
