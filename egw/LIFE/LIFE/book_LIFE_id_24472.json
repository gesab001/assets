    "word": "The Lord calls upon those who once had a knowledge of the truth, but who have backslidden, to return to their first love, and become reformed, regenerated. The eyes of the mind need to be enlightened by the Holy Spirit, that they may discern between good and evil. Some concessions have been made, but no thorough work has been done to uproot the evil plant of malice, cherished so long because this person and that person did not coincide with plans and ideas of human invention. The root of bitterness has sprung up into intense life, and has borne its poisonous fruit. It still flourishes; for only the tip end of it was plucked off. When sin is removed through the blood of sprinkling, the soul will be melted by a sense of the love of Jesus, and by an abhorrence of sin. Repentance for this or that particular act is not sufficient. The heart must be cleansed. Wrong-doing is the overflowing of the fountain of an unclean, unconverted heart.",
