    "word": "The indulgence of spiritual pride, of unholy desires, of evil thoughts, of anything that separates us from an intimate and sacred association with Jesus, imperils our souls. . . . We must \"fight the good fight of faith,\" if we would \"lay hold on eternal life\" (1 Timothy 6:12). We are \"kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation\" (1 Peter 1:5). If the thought of apostasy is grievous to you, . . . then \"abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good\" (Romans 12:9); and believe in Him who is \"able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.\"",
