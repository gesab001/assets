    "word": "We are raised from the water as an emblem of His resurrection. We are to live as newborn souls, that we may be raised at the last great day. . . . You are pledged to live in newness of life; for you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.\" This is where you are to place your treasure. Finite man cannot do your believing. Come to the great source of power for your strength.",
