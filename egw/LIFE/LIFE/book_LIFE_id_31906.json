    "word": "\"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought\" - that is, anxious thought, unbelieving thought - \"for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\" Can you answer that question? We want and God wants us to recognize that every gift that we receive, to be a help and strength to us, it cometh from God. And we should be grateful and we are to carry the gratitude in our individual hearts. And if we carry that gratitude into our individual hearts, let me tell you there will be a different atmosphere surrounding our souls from what we now have. Try to live closely - take the truth of God just as it is given in his word.",
