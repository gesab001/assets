    "word": "\"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.\" All your self-uplifting works out the natural result, and makes you in character such as God will not for a moment approve. \"Without Me,\" says Christ, \"ye can do nothing.\" Work and teach, work in Christ's lines, and then you will never work in your own weak ability, but will have the co-operation of the divine, combined with the God-given human ability. \"Casting all your care upon Him; for He careth for you. Be sober, be vigilant\" [not in kicking football and in educating yourselves in the objectionable games which ought to make every Christian blush with mortification at the afterthoughts] \"be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.\" Yes, he is on your playground watching your amusements, catching every soul that he finds off his guard, sowing his seeds in human minds, and controlling the human intellect. For Christ's sake call a halt at the Battle Creek College, and consider the after-workings upon the heart and the character and principles, of these amusements copied after the fashion of other schools. You have been steadily progressing in the ways of the Gentiles, and not after the example of Jesus Christ. Satan is on the schoolground; he is present in every exercise in the schoolroom. The students that have had their minds deeply excited in their games, are not in the best condition to receive the instruction, the counsel, the reproof, most essential for them in this life and for the future immortal life.",
