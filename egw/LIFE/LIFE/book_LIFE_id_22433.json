    "word": "Our lifetime is precious, and every action should be considered. It has been granted us that we might, if we will, lay hold of it in the right spirit, accomplish a work that will be acknowledged by the Lord as good, enduring as eternity. It is an intensely solemn thing to live in view of the account we must render to God of our time, our talents, and our influence. These are precious things, talents that are not to be buried in the earth, but used. We are not to hide our talents, they are God's entrusted gifts for wise improvement, that they may accumulate in His service, and that at His coming He may receive His own with usury.",
