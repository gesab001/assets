    "word": "Although Christ was rich in the heavenly courts, yet he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich. Jesus honored the poor by sharing their humble condition. From the history of his life we are to learn how to treat the poor. Some carry the duty of beneficence to extremes, and really hurt the needy by doing too much for them. The poor do not always exert themselves as they should. While they are not to be neglected and left to suffer, they must be taught to help themselves.",
