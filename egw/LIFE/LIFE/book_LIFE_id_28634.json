    "word": "When the doctor, whom they had sent for to Newcastle came, he said he was much better. The family asked if they should give him any liquor, and he said, \"A very little.\" They gave him the drink, and it snapped the thread of life. Those drunken men knew not what they were about. The mother said that they poured the liquor down his throat, and he could not help himself; and she could do nothing to prevent them. He was the only member of the family of boys who would not use liquor. When the neighbors came in the morning, the mother said, \"They have killed my son! They have killed my son!\" Oh, how my heart ached as I thought of that murder in that house. The father and brothers had imbibed liquor until they knew not what they were about. This was considered a very affectionate family, but the rum demon took away their senses. They became as all men become when they sell their reason for strong drink.",
