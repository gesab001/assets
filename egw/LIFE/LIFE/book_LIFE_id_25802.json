    "word": "The condition upon which we shall receive an increase of grace is that we improve upon that already bestowed; for faith and works go together. There must be no resisting of the Spirit of God, as there has been in the past, but we must lay hold of eternal realities. The forgiveness of sins is promised to him who repents; but if those who have resisted the Spirit of God, who have given wrong impressions of the character of God, do not repent, their names will be blotted out of the book of life.",
