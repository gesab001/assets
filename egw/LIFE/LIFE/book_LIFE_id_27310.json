    "word": "MR No. 473 - Soul Preparation\n\n     Wherein are we found to be profitable to God? We can so be found only in one sense, in bearing much fruit to His glory; in being active in securing others in the service of the heavenly King; in seeking by holy, irreproachable lives to so exemplify Christ that others shall be constrained to acknowledge that there is a power in the truth in Christian religion which transforms the soul by the renewing of the mind. Our natures are changed by the power of divine grace. Unless this transformation is seen in the life by the fruits of the spirit all the pretensions in that direction are of no weight; therefore although there may be a form of godliness, yet unprofitable, slothful servant is stamped upon the character of their entire religious experience. . . .",
