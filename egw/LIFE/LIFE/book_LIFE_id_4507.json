    "word": "I am writing frequently twenty pages a day. I have dropped Sketches of Life. [We] have got off two more forms [of the testimony]. One more form will complete it. Mary Clough is just the same; she\n272\nworks with interest and cheerfulness. Shew proves to be a precious help; I don't know how we could keep house without him. He makes bread, just excellent pies, buns; and cooks vegetables. All that they have paid him as yet is two dollars each week, till last two weeks, two and [a] half. Shall pay three in two weeks more. Mary [is teaching him] to cook. He is neat; takes care of the whole house.",
