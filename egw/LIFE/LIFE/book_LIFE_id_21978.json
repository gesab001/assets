    "word": "As time has rolled on from Creation and the cross of Calvary, as prophecy has been and is still fulfilling, light and knowledge have greatly increased. . . .

Nothing that God has ordained in the plan of redemption can be dispensed with. It is the working out of the divine will in the salvation of man.",
