    "word": "To the believer, death is but a small matter. Christ speaks of it as if it were of little moment. \"If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death,\" \"he shall never taste of death.\" John 8:51, 52. To the Christian, death is but a sleep, a moment of silence and darkness. The life is hid with Christ in God, and \"when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.\" Colossians 3:4.",
