    "word": "You must never, never seek to lift one pin, remove one landmark, that the Lord has given to His people as truth. You can manipulate matters to suit your own plans and devices. But just as soon as you allow your influence to lead away from the strait and narrow path that the Lord has cast up for His people, in order to accommodate yourself, your prosperity will cease; for God will not be your guide. The record of Nebuchadnezzar's life has been presented to me again and again to present to you, that you may be warned not to trust in yourself and your own wisdom, or to make flesh your arm. Never seek for popularity. Never let the banner be lowered or drop from your hands in order to blend in the wording of the message for these last days anything but that which will keep the features of our faith prominent. \"Here are they which keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus\" [Revelation 14:12].",
