    "word": "In the courts above, Christ is pleading for His church-- pleading for those for whom He has paid the redemption price of His blood. Centuries, ages, can never lessen the efficacy of His atoning sacrifice. Neither life nor death, height nor depth, can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus; not because we hold Him so firmly, but because He holds us so fast.--The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 552, 553.",
