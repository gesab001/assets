    "word": "Christ asks for our love. Does He not deserve it? Has not He given us instruction at every step? He says, \"Whosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" He bore the cross of self-denial and self-sacrifice. He passed over the ground where Adam fell. Our first parents were placed in Eden, and surrounded with everything that would lead them to obey God. Christ assumed our fallen nature, and was subject to every temptation to which man is subject. Even in His childhood He was often tempted. Through life He remained unyielding to every inducement to commit sin. When in His youth His associates would try to lead Him to do wrong, He would begin to sing some sweet melody, and the first thing they knew they were uniting with Him in singing the song. They caught His spirit, and the enemy was defeated. Ah, my friends, Christ is the Chiefest among ten thousand. Praise the name of the Lord!",
