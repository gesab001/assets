    "word": "[Philippians 4:6-9, quoted.] \n     Let no man unsettle your faith. The Lord is greatly dishonored by those in Battle Creek who are turning away from the truth. I am sorry for them, and sorry that you are becoming confused by the doctrines that are being presented to lead souls from the true faith. May the Lord help you not to spoil your record. In the name of the Lord I say to you, Humble your heart before God, and practice the life of Christ, else you will lose your soul.",
