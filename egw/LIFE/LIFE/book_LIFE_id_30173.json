    "word": "Think of the possibilities and probabilities before us. We can have all the strength of heaven; for when God gave Christ to our world, He gave all heaven. The Saviour's long human arm encircles the race, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite. We are sinful, but Christ \n\n\n                                    -322- \n\nis sinless, and through Him we may stand on vantage ground with God. \"God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). There is no excuse for any man or woman to lose eternal life. Everyone can gain heaven, but God will not force anyone to accept the provisions He has made. God forces no one to obey. Neither does He place anyone in a position where he will be tempted above that he is able to bear.",
