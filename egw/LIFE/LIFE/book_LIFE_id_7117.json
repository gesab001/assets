    "word": "Principle is always exacting. Our country claims of fathers and mothers, their sons, the brothers, the husbands, to be given up, to leave their homes for the field of carnage and bloodshed. They must endure privation and hunger, weariness and loneliness; they must make long marches, footsore and weary, through summer's heat and winter's cold; they must face peril, run the risk of life. They are compelled to follow the commander, even to the death. And all this severe experience is in consequence of sin. There is an enemy to meet, an \n199\nenemy to be resisted; enemies of our country will destroy her peace and bring disaster and ruin, unless they are overcome. \u201cConquer or die\u201d is the motto.",
