    "word": "My brethren and sisters, I entreat you to arouse and show a living interest in the unworked portions of the Lord\u2019s vineyard. Catch the spirit of the great Master Worker. His heart was ever touched with human woe. Why are we so cold and indifferent? Why are our hearts so unimpressionable? Christ placed Himself on the altar of service, a living sacrifice. Why are we so unwilling to give ourselves to the work to which He consecrated His life? Something must be done to cure the terrible indifference that has taken hold upon us. Let us bow our heads in humiliation as we see how much less we have done than we might have done to sow the seeds of truth.",
