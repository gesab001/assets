The disciples were noted for the purity \n                                                                           50\nof their words, and Peter, to deceive, and convince them that he was not one of Christ's disciples, denied it the third time with cursing and swearing.

He bitterly wept and repented of his great sin, and was converted, and then was prepared to strengthen his brethren.",
