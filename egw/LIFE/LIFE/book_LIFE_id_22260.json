    "word": "We are living amid the perils of the last days. The Spirit of God is being withdrawn from the earth, but the Lord has not left you, my brother. I am bidden to encourage you to believe that your life has not been wasted. Wake up, my brother, and the Lord will guide you to the work He has for you. But do not longer please the enemy by yielding to the temptation to despair. Let the truth of God be to your soul as the sunshine and the vital air.",
