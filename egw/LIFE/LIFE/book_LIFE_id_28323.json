    "word": "A worker cannot gain success while he hurries through his prayers to God, and rushes away to look after something that he fears may be neglected \n\n\n                                 -306- \n\nor forgotten. He takes time to give only a few hurried thoughts to God, that is all. He does not give himself time to think, to pray, to wait upon the Lord for a renewal of spiritual and physical strength. He soon becomes jaded. He does not feel the uplifting, inspiring influence of God's Spirit. He is not quickened by fresh life. His jaded frame and tired brain are not soothed by personal contact with Christ.--Letter 83, 1902, p. 9. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. April 12, 1984",
