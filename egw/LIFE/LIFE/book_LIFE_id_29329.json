    "word": "Multitudes have heard me speak, and have read my writings, but no one has ever heard me claim to work miracles. I have at times been called upon to pray for the sick, and the word of the Lord has been verified: \"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, \n\n\n                                    -373- \n\nthey shall be forgiven him [James 5:14, 15]. Christ is the great miracle-worker. To Him be all the glory. He it is of whom John writes: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. . . .  He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not\" [John 1:1-5, 10].",
