    "word": "We are to bear Christ's yoke, to work as he worked for the salvation of the lost; and those who are partakers of his sufferings will also be partakers of his glory. The apostle says, \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" Then let us take hold of his strength. Let every one who names the name of Christ among us become a laborer together with God. Let not the burden of the whole work fall on the ministers, but let every member of the church realize that he has a work to do. Let the people of God scatter abroad, moving in all directions, into cities and villages where the light of truth has not shone, that the knowledge of God may be diffused among men. Tell others what they must do to be saved. \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\" If you had a realizing sense of the lost condition of souls who are out of Christ, you would work according to your entrusted talents, not growing weary in well-doing. The Saviour's commission to his people is, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" O, how \n                                                                           22\ngrievously has this work been neglected, and yet the famine-stricken world is perishing for the bread of life. Let every one surrender himself to God, accept the heavenly endowment of the Holy Spirit, and go forth to tell those who sit in darkness of a Saviour's love and sacrifice, that they should not perish, but have everlasting life. In whatever place you take up your abode, be a light to the people, pointing out the path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in, and thus become laborers together with God.",
