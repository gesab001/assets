    "word": "Brethren, as never before we need to press together, unitedly following with calm faith and confidence Him who has prepared His throne in the heavens and whose kingdom ruleth over all. God has not forsaken His people, and our strength lies in not forsaking Him. Christ died to redeem us. By the infinite price with which He ransomed us He has shown His love for us. He is not willing that any should perish, but that all should believe in Him, and have eternal life. \n\n\n                               -330-",
