    "word": "Yesterday I read the following incident: \"A notable painter was adorning the frescoes in the dome of a cathedral. When a certain portion of his work was done, he stepped backward upon the small scaffold of planks on which he stood, to admire the effect of his skillful craft. Suddenly a comrade who was with him rushed forward to the picture, and with the brush in his hand smeared and spoiled the delicate work so painfully accomplished. Rushing forward, the artist cried angrily, \"What is that for?\" \"Look\", said his companion, \"one more step backward, and you would have fallen, bruised and mangled on the pavement below.\" The artist was thankful that his life was saved. Will our brethren in peril consent to be saved from the dangers they are in? \n\n\n                                      -302-",
