    "word": "A Burden for Souls \n\n     God's ministers must come into close companionship with Christ, and follow His example in all things --in purity of life, in self-denial, in benevolence, in diligence, in perseverance. To win souls to the kingdom of God must be their first consideration. With sorrow for sin and with patient love, they must work as Christ worked, putting forth determined, unceasing effort.",
