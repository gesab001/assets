    "word": "\"If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness.\" The conscience is the regulative faculty, and if a man allows his conscience to become perverted, he cannot serve God aright. His object in life shows to the world whether he is a Christian or in rebellion against God. His whole life is a failure. It is distorted and double, and all the faculties are misdirected. The profession may be all right, but the faith is perverted, and this is revealed by the practice, which misleads others. \"No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon\" [verse 24].",
