    "word": "The Three Angels' Messages--It is our privilege to expect large things, even the demonstration of the Spirit of God. This is a power which will convict and convert the soul. Our message is a life-and-death message, and we must let this message appear as it is--the great power of God. Then the Lord will make it effectual. We are to present it in all its telling force. The first and second angels' messages are bound up with the third angel's message. The power of the proclamation of the first and second angels' messages is to be concentrated in the third.--Lt 209, 1899.",
