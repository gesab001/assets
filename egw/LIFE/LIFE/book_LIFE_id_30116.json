    "word": "God has done so much for us in giving His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish but have everlasting life. We are persons of hope. We may every one lay hold on the hope that is set before us. \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also\" (John 14:12), and He says, \"I kept My Father's commandments.\" The Pharisees said when the disciples rubbed the ears of corn as they went through the wheat fields, \"He has broken the Sabbath.\" Could they have fastened that upon Him, then what? They would not have had to get false witnesses to speak against Him. They would have condemned Him as a Sabbath-breaker. But He said, \"Ye do not know what this means, I will have mercy and not sacrifice\" (See Matthew 9:13), or ye would not have condemned the guiltless.",
