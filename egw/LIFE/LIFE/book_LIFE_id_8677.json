    "word": "When men and women are truly converted they will conscientiously regard the laws of life that God has established in their being, thus seeking to avoid physical, mental, and moral feebleness. Obedience to these laws must be made a matter of personal duty. We ourselves must suffer the ills of violated law. We must answer to God for our habits and practices. Therefore the question for us is not, \"What will the world say?\" but, \"How shall I, claiming to be a Christian, treat the habitation God has given me?\"",
