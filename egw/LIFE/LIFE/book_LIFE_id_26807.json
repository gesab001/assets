    "word": "Dear Edson, I see by your letter that you are again at Battle Creek. God grant that every hour of your life may be spent to His own name's glory. . . . Ponder well the paths of your feet. Be swift to hear, slow to speak. . . . You may be looked upon with suspicion and distrust, but I fully believe that in the providence of God your stay in Battle Creek will be a precious school for you. . . . If you can do so in an unobtrusive way, try to help Brother Olsen, and stay up his hands. He needs sympathy, and words of \n\n\n                                    -265- \n\nhopefulness and courage. But please do not cast reflection upon the men who have not a living connection with God.--Letter 86, 1895, pp. 8, 9. (To Edson White, September 25, 1895.)",
