    "word": "In sickness, when he knows not how his case will be decided, is the time for the physician to impress the human mind. He should not do this with the desire to distinguish himself, but that he may point the soul to Christ as a personal Saviour. The physician who loves and fears God will not need to make any outward display in order to distinguish himself; for the Sun of righteousness is shining in his heart and is revealed in his life, and this distinguishes him. If the life is spared, there is a soul for that physician to watch for. The patient feels as though his physician were the very life of his life. And to what purpose should all this weight of confidence be employed? Always to win a soul to Christ and magnify the power of God.",
