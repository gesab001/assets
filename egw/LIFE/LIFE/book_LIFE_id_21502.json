    "word": "In hours when clouds encompass the soul, Christ is not far from every one of us. To whom shall we go if not to the Sinbearer, the great Healer of human woe? \u201cThou hast the words of eternal life.\u201d There is joy for all who put their trust in Him, and exercise the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Jesus says, My joy shall be in you, and your joy shall be full. \u201cWithout faith it is impossible to please him.\u201d A paralysis has stolen upon the spiritual nerve and muscle of the children of God. Arouse now, just now, without delay. \u201cSeek ye the lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.\u201d \u2014 Letter 93, 1896.",
