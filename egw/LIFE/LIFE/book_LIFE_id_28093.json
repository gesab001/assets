My brother, you are not to make a test for the people of God upon the question of diet, for they will lose \n\n\n                                    -176- \n\nconfidence in teachings that are strained to the farthest point of extension. The Lord desires His people to be sound on every point in health reform, but we must not go to extremes. I have matter written on these points, but I shall not be able to get it copied for this mail.
