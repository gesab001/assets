    "word": "This must be urged again and again, that the youth must commence their career braced for duty by the word of God; then no manner of influence, no entreaty, no reward, will be sufficient to cause them to sacrifice one principle of truth. Christian consistency marked the course of Daniel and Joseph in all the actions of their lives. There are men binding in bundles by vows that will end in sacrificing conscience for professional success; but men are needed, who, like Daniel and Joseph, will fear, and obey, and honor God under the most trying circumstances. They look to Jesus the pattern, and then cry out against evil associates, \"Unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united.\" The atoning sacrifice is the anchor of the life, the word of God a light to their feet and a lamp to their path. All who enter the Paradise of God will be  those in whose mouths there is no guile, no impurity, no falsehood. They will be pure, holy, and undefiled. In the medical profession, elevate the standard as high as Heaven. May the Lord anoint the blind eyes that have made the world's criterion the standard. Oh that they may see as God sees, is my prayer.",
