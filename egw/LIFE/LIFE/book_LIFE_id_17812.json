    "word": "The calm bearing of Luther was a striking contrast to the passion and rage exhibited by those so-called great men. They could not frighten him into a recantation of the truth.

They longed to make him feel their power by torturing his life away. But no, a mightier power than potentates of earth had charge of this fearless witness. God had a work for him to do. He must suffer yet for the truth. He must see it wade through bloody persecutions. He must see it clothed in sackcloth, and covered with reproach by fanatics. He must live to justify it, and be its defender, when the mighty powers of earth should seek to tear it down. He must live to see it tear away the errors and superstitions of papacy, and triumph. Luther gained a victory at Worms which weakened the papacy, and the news of which spread to other kingdoms and nations. It was an effectual blow struck in favor of the Reformation.",
