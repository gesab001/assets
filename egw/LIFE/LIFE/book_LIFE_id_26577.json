    "word": "God is in earnest with us and claims all the power of our being. We need the great Physician to heal us. We need more of heaven and less of self. We must be partakers of the divine nature. Oh, what love has been manifested for us! The divine Son of God left the throne of heaven and gave His life for us, and for our sakes became poor. He clothed His divinity with humanity. Now in return are you willing to deny self and follow your Saviour? Oh, do not trifle away the few moments left us by seeking worldly honor and thus lose the precious boon of everlasting life!--Ms 40, 1886, pp. 1-5.
