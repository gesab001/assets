    "word": "Love is the connecting link between your heart and the heart of Christ. We love Him because He first loved us. Repeat often to your children the lessons of the Saviour. Christ holds you as a family in His arms of love. From Him your heart received the life-current. Let it be seen that this is actually a part of your daily experience. Spasmodic impulses are not reliable. Christ's work has in it good reason and wise method. Do not allow your hope in Him to be affected by circumstances. Educate yourself to persevere in receiving grace from Him, and imparting it to others. Thus you can exert a strong influence for good. You can be a great blessing if you will obtain the rich treasures of grace and give them to others, speaking wise, appropriate words, leading, drawing, souls to Christ, teaching them to love and appreciate Him whose they are by creation and by redemption. Lay up treasure beside the throne of God by bringing souls to Christ. This is the work that the Saviour values. Those who faithfully do this work will one day sit with Him on His throne.",
