    "word": "Courting is not to be carried on in the school. That is not what you are here for. We are here to prepare for the future life, where we may see the King in His glory, where we shall have that life which measures with the life of God. If we do not live in harmony with the law of God here, we shall never see His face. The disobedient can never enter the city of God. The Word of Inspiration declares, \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" [Revelation 22:14].",
