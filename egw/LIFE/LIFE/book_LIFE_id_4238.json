    "word": "The ideas expressed in your articles savor so strongly of antagonism that you will do harm, more than you can possibly conceive. Remember that if by the injudicious use of your pen you close the door to even one soul, that soul will confront you in the judgment. O, how much has been said that has turned souls to bitterness and gall against the truth. Words that should have been a savor of life unto life have been made a savor of death unto death by the spirit which accompanied them.--Letter 17, 1900.",
