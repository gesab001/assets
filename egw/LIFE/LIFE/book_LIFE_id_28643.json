    "word": "Great light has been shining upon our pathway, not to be hidden under a bushel or under a bed. Through unjust business transactions and indulgence of passion, the light of the Christian burns dim. But God has given the light to be set high above sensuality in thought or action. Many lights burn low and go out for the want of the oil of grace. But let the Christian's life shine forth in clear, steady rays, illuminating the surrounding darkness. We cannot grow in grace until we purify our souls by obeying the truth. Obedience to the truth includes obedience to physical law.",
