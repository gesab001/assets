    "word": "Selfishness must die. It manifests itself in a variety of ways, according to circumstances, and the peculiar organization of individuals. If you had children, and your mind was compelled to be called away from yourself to care for them, to instruct them, and be an example to them, it would be more to your advantage. You have called forth in your home the attention and forbearance which is required to be exercised toward \n                                                                           23\nchildren. To care for others, to seek to advantage them, you have not thought was any part of your duty. But you require it, and will have it. You are wilful, and very set to carry out your own plans. When everything is smooth in your pathway, you manifest the fruits we expect to see in a Christian; but when your path is crossed, you manifest fruits that are not to be found upon a good tree. You have a regular perverse, wilful time, like a spoiled child which deserved chastisement. When two compose a family, as in your case, and there are no children to call into exercise forbearance and patience, and true love, there is necessity for constant watchfulness lest selfishness obtain the supremacy, lest yourselves become a center, and you require attention, care and interest, which you feel under no obligation to bestow. The care of children in a family makes it necessary for the culture of mind and heart in connection with the ordinary cares of domestic life, that a large portion of the time be spent at home.",
