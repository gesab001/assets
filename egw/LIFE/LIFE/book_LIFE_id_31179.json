    "word": "Every Bible student in our school should study these prophecies with diligence. As we search the Scriptures, the character of Christ will appear in its infinite perfection. He is the one in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered. He is eternal life to all who will eat his flesh and drink his blood. Those who will look to him may be healed of the serpent's sting: for he is sin-bearer, the only remedy for sin. By beholding him, we may become changed into the same image. Nothing must interpose between the soul and God. Faith, love, adoration, are to grow in the soul of the student. We are in possession of the richest treasures of truth, and if we follow on to know the Lord, we shall have a large field in which to work. The word records the deeds of mercy and the wonderful restoring power of Jesus. With aching hearts we read of his sorrow because of the sins we have committed, We may learn too how through his suffering and sacrifice in our behalf, we may be complete in him.
