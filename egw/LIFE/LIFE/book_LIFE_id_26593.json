    "word": "If we have shunned the truth to save our lives, then we shall lose eternal life. We have a soul to save or to lose. We must work out our salvation with fear and trembling. We must press against the darkness and take hold of the mighty arm of God. We have but a little time to prepare for eternity. May the Lord help us to overcome and win the crown and see the King in His beauty. Then we shall not have lived in vain.--Ms 44, 1886, pp. 1-6. (\"The Cross Before the Crown,\" sermon at Nimes, France, Oct. 22, 1886.)",
