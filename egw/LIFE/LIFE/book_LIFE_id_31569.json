    "word": "\"Last night the same scenes passed before me that passed before me thirty-five years ago, when the light was given to establish a sanitarium that would be the means of educating many souls in regard to right principles of living, and of bringing them to a knowledge of the truth. We must establish sanitariums for this purpose, and they must be so conducted that God can cooperate with the efforts made in them to relieve physical and spiritual suffering. God wants the sick and suffering to understand what it means to have the advantage of living in a sanitarium conducted in accordance with the principles of the gospel. Every worker connected with these institutions is to follow on to know the Lord, that He may know that his goings forth is prepared as the morning. If our missionary spirit were stronger, if the love of Jesus filled the hearts of those in service for Him, many of the sick and suffering would be drawn to Jesus, led to the tree of Life, to take of its health-restoring, life-sustaining power.",
