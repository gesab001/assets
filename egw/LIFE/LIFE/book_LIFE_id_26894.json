    "word": "I spoke on Sabbath. These men [non-Adventists holding responsible positions whose wives were church members] were all there, no less than three \n\n\n                                    -122- \n\nof them hanging in the balance. The wind blew so that the pulpit had to be moved near to the people to preserve me from taking cold. I had great freedom in speaking, and told them plainly that the Lord Jesus was in our midst. I asked them to turn to Exodus 31--\"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, [Now, said I, listen attentively to what the Lord is saying unto you this day], speak thou unto the children of Israel saying, Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations that ye may know that I am the Lord that did sanctify you. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you. Every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death. For whosoever doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\" I read to the close of the chapter. Then I asked them if they would turn away from a plain \"Thus saith the Lord,\" for the sayings of men, when they see that their assertions are entirely contrary to the Word of God. The Word has made the statement \"I am the Lord that do sanctify you\" if you observe the Sabbath. This is the only true sanctification in the Scriptures--that which comes from God because of obedience to His commandments. Then we may know that the little companies assembled together to worship the Lord on the day which He has blessed and made holy, have a right to claim the rich blessings of Jehovah. He who has declared that His words are spirit and life, should have their faith in strong exercise, that the Lord Jesus is an honored guest in their assemblies.--Letter 8, 1898, pp. 2, 3. (To Sister Josephine Gotzian, February 11, 1898.) \n\n\n                                    -123-",
