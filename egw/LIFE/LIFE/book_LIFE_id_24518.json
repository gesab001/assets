    "word": "While respecting authority and laboring in accordance with wisely-laid plans, every worker is amenable to the Great Teacher for the proper exercise of his God-given judgment and of his right to look to the God of heaven for wisdom and guidance. God is Commander and Ruler over all. We have a personal Saviour, and we are not to exchange His Word for the word of any man. In the Scriptures the Lord has given instruction for every worker. The words of the Master-Worker should be diligently studied; for they are spirit and life. Laborers who are striving to work in harmony with this instruction, are under the leadership and guidance of the Holy Spirit, and need not always, before they make any advance move, first ask permission of some one else. No precise lines are to be laid down. Let the Holy Spirit direct the workers. As they keep looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of their faith, the gifts of grace will increase by wise use.",
