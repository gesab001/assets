    "word": "The leaven of truth is a living principle, and it is to be exercised in the little things and exert an influence over the daily life. But many act as if the truths of God's Word did not exist. The same love of self, the same selfish indulgence, the same temper and hasty speech is seen in their lives as in the worldling. The same sensitive pride, the same yielding to natural inclination, the same perversities of character are seen as if the truth were totally unknown by them. They have closed the windows and drawn the blinds of the soul, and shut out the sunshine of the righteousness of Christ, and then complain that they have no sweet joy, no assurance and happiness in believing the truth. But the sin lies at their own door. They have not hidden the leaven of truth in the heart.",
