    "word": "Christ once gave his disciples a lesson upon economy which is worthy of careful attention. He wrought a miracle to feed the hungry \n                                                                           59\nthousands who had listened to his teachings; yet after all had eaten and were satisfied, he did not permit the fragments to be wasted. He who could, in their necessity, feed the vast multitude by his divine power, bade his disciples gather up the fragments, that nothing might be lost. This lesson was given as much for our benefit as for those living in Christ's day. The Son of God has a care for the necessities of temporal life. He did not neglect the broken fragments after the feast, although he could make such a feast whenever he chose. The workers at the Sanitarium would do well to heed this lesson: \"Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost.\" This is the duty of all; and those who occupy a leading position should set the example.",
