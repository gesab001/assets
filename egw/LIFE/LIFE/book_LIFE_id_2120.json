    "word": "Those who belong to the higher ranks of society are to be sought out with tender affection and brotherly regard. Men in business life, in high positions of trust, men with large inventive faculties and scientific insight, men of genius, teachers of the gospel whose minds have not been called to the special truths for this time,--these should be the first to hear the call. To them the invitation must be given.--Christ's Object Lessons, p. 230.",
