    "word": "I am instructed that we are to carry the minds of our students higher than it is now thought by many to be possible. Hearts and mind are to be trained to preserve their purity by receiving daily supplies from the fountain of eternal truth. The divine Mind and Hand has preserved through the ages the record of creation in its purity. It is the word of God alone that gives to us an authentic account of the creation of our world. The Word is to be the chief study in our schools. Here we may hold converse (726) with patriarchs and prophets; here we may learn what our redemption has cost. One who was equal with the Father from the beginning, and who sacrificed His life that a people might stand before Him redeemed from every common, earthly thing, and renewed in the image of God.",
