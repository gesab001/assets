    "word": "Every sincere Christian bows to Jesus as the true (122) physician of souls. When He stands by the bedside of the afflicted, there will be many, not only converted, but healed, He who declared, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,\" will be with His faithful physicians and nurses as they strive to cooperate with Him. If through judicious ministration the patient is led to give his soul to Christ, and to bring his thoughts into obedience to the will of God, a great victory is gained. \n\n                                               -",
