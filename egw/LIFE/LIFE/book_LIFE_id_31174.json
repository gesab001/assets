    "word": "A neglect to live by the law of God cuts off a large portion of a man's life from God. He does not keep the way of the Lord, and \n                                                                           1686\ntherefore he robs his Maker of the service due to him. This reacts upon himself; for he fails to gain that grace, that power, that force of character that it is the privilege of each one to receive who surrenders all to God. Living apart from Jesus places him under Satan's temptations. He makes mistakes and errors in his work for the Master. His heart and mind is not conformed to the will of God. He does not obey God in the great matters which he regards as his special work, because right principles do not guide him in the doing of little things. He thinks the minor things of life unworthy of much attention, but the defects which he bears there pass into the larger things; he acts on the principles to which he has accustomed himself. The sure result is that Christian consistency becomes a hard lesson to practice. He has to work constantly against natural inclination and cultivated habits.",
