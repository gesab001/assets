    "word": "\"We have this treasure in earthen vessels,\" but we are hid in Christ, and Christ is in God; so, our lives are hid with Christ in God and we reveal Christ, and in doing so we reveal the Father. Let this be a season when if you have sins to confess, or if you have wronged your brethren and have not right feelings toward them, for Christ's sake get these things out of the way. We want to be getting ready for the future life. Our Lord is coming with power and great glory. We are not to be surfeited and drunken with the cares of this life, but we are to keep our minds uplifted; and if we do this we shall see of the salvation of the Lord, and our hearts will be all light in the Lord, and we shall talk of His love and tell of His power and reveal Him to all around us.",
