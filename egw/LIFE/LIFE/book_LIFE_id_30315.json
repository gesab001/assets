    "word": "We have seen enough of what the world calls perfection to know that all such is valueless, \"for the earth is corrupt under the inhabitants thereof.\" But if we hide our life in Christ, we are the happiest mortals on the face of the earth. We have a faith that works by love and purifies the soul, for Christ is the purifier and the cleanser of everyone. Is Christ to you the first, the last, and the best in everything? If He is, you have a hope that goes beyond the dark shadows which, like a pall of death, cover the world; your hope is cast within the veil. You do not drift hither and thither, but have a firm foundation, even Christ Jesus.",
