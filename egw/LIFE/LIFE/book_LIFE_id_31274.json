    "word": "\"My brother, whom the Lord has honored by giving a message of truth for the world, in God alone can you maintain your integrity. 'But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on the most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. And of some have compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted of the flesh.' While this hatred for the sin that spots and stains the soul is expressed, we are, with one hand, to lay hold of the sinner with the firm grasp of faith, while with the other we grasp the hand of Christ. 'Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God \n\n\n                                   - 36 - \n\nour Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.'\"",
