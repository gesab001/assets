    "word": "I saw that some of God's children have made a mistake in regard to oath-taking, and Satan has taken advantage of this to oppress them, and take from them their Lord's money. I saw that the words of our Lord, \"Swear not at all,\" do not touch the judicial oath. \"Let your communication be yea, yea; and nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of evil.\" This refers to common conversation. Some exaggerate in their language. Some swear by their own life. Others swear by their head. As sure as they live--as sure as they have a head--some take Heaven and earth to witness that such things are so. Some hope that God will strike them out of existence if what they are saying is not true. It is this kind of common swearing that Jesus warns his disciples against.",
