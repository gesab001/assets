    "word": "We do not half understand the Lord's plan in taking the children of Israel from Egyptian bondage, and leading them through the wilderness into Canaan. As we gather up the divine rays shining from the gospel, we shall have a clearer insight into the Jewish economy, and a deeper appreciation of its important truths. Our exploration of truth is yet incomplete. We have gathered up only a few rays of light. Those who are not daily students of the Word will not solve the problems of the Jewish economy. They will not understand the truths taught by the Temple service. The work of God is hindered by a worldly understanding of His great plan. The future life will unfold the meaning of the laws that Christ, enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, gave to His people.--Letter 156, 1903, pp. 2, 3. (To P. T. Magan, July 27, 1903.)",
