    "word": "There is cheap religion in abundance, but there is no such thing as cheap Christianity. Self may figure largely in a false religion, but it cannot appear in Christian experience. \"Ye are workers together with God.\" \"Without me,\" said Christ, \"ye can do \n\n\n                   - 26 - \n\nnothing.\" We cannot be shepherds of the flock unless we are divested of our own peculiar habits, manners, and customs, and come into Christ's likeness. When we eat his flesh and drink his blood, then the element of eternal life will be found in the ministry. There will not be a fund of stale, oft-repeated ideas. There will be a new perception of truth.",
