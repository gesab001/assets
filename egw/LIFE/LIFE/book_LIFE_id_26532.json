    "word": "From . . . hidden pits where human beings have been buried will start into life those who counted not their lives dear unto themselves, who valued integrity of soul to God above ease, above property, above life itself. From beneath the molding, majestic walls is ground cursed by the Roman power, but sanctified by the blood of martyrs, and as the blood of Abel cried to God from the ground so will the blood of these slaughtered ones cry to God from the ground for vengeance.--Ms 62, 1886, pp. 2, 30-32. (Diary, \"Second Visit to Italy,\" April 15-29, 1886.) \n\nReleased August, 1965.",
