    "word": "Again and again the heavenly messenger has been sent to the school. When his presence has been acknowledged, the darkness has fled away, and the light has shone forth, and hearts have been drawn to God. The last words spoken by Christ to John were, \"And the spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\" When we respond to God, and say, \"Lord, we come,\" then with joy will we draw water out of the wells of salvation. Shall we not keep holy festivals unto God? Shall we not show that we have some enthusiasm in his service? With the grand, ennobling theme of salvation before us, shall we be as cold as statues of marble? If men can become so excited over a match game of cricket, or a horse-race, or over \n\n\n                          - 14 - \n\nfoolish things that bring no good to any one, shall we be unmoved when the plan of salvation is unfolded before us? Let the school and the church henceforth have festivals of rejoicing unto the Lord.",
