    "word": "Heresies are now arising among the people of God, and they will continue to arise. As we near the end of time, falsehood will be so mingled with truth, that only those who have the guidance of the Holy Spirit will be able to distinguish truth from error. We need to make every effort to keep the way of the Lord. We must in no case turn from His guidance to put our trust in man. The Lord's angels are appointed to keep strict watch over those who put their faith in the Lord, and these angels are to be our special help in every time of need. Every day we are to come to the Lord with full assurance of faith, and to look to Him for wisdom. The ministers who teach the truth for this time are to strengthen their hearts by studying the word of God. \"It is the spirit that quickeneth,\" Christ said, \"the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life\" (John 6:63). \n\n\n                                    -360- \n\nThose who are guided by the word of the Lord will discern with certainty between falsehood and truth, between sin and righteousness.",
