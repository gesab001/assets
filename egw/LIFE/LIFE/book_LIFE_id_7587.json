    "word": "The reformed princes had determined upon having a statement of their views in systematic form, with the evidence from the Scriptures, to present before the Diet; and the task of its preparation was committed to Luther, Melancthon, and their associates. This Confession was accepted by the Protestants as an exposition of their faith, and they assembled to affix their names to the important document. It was a solemn and trying time. The reformers were solicitous that their cause should not be confounded with political questions; they felt that the Reformation should exercise no other influence than that which proceeds from the Word of God. As the Christian princes advanced to \n207\nsign the Confession, Melancthon interposed, saying, \u201cIt is for the theologians and ministers to propose these things, while the authority of the mighty ones of earth is to be reserved for other matters.\u201d \u201cGod forbid,\u201d replied John of Saxony, \u201cthat you should exclude me. I am resolved to do my duty, without being troubled about my crown. I desire to confess the Lord. My electoral hat and robes are not so precious to me as the cross of Jesus Christ.\u201d Having thus spoken he wrote down his name. Said another of the princes as he took the pen, \u201cIf the honor of my Lord Jesus Christ requires it, I am ready to leave my goods and life behind me.\u201d \u201cRather would I renounce my subjects and my States, rather would I quit the country of my fathers, staff in hand,\u201d he continued, \u201cthan to receive any other doctrine than is contained in this Confession.\u201d Such was the faith and daring of those men of God.",
