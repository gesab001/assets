    "word": "Did not our Exemplar tread a hard, self-denying, self-sacrificing, humble path, on our account, in order to save us? He encountered difficulties. He experienced disappointment and suffered reproach and affliction in his work of saving us. And shall we refuse to follow where the King of glory has led the way? Shall we complain of hardship and trial in the work of overcoming on our account, when we remember the suffering of our Redeemer in the wilderness of temptation, and in the garden of Gethsemane, and on Calvary? All these were endured to show us the way, and bring us the divine help we must have or perish. If the youth would win eternal life, they need not expect that they can follow their own inclinations. The prize will cost them something, yes, everything. They can now have Jesus or the world. How many dear youth will suffer privation, weariness, toil, and anxiety, in order to serve themselves, and gain an object in this life? They do not think of complaining of the hardships and difficulties they encounter in order to serve their own interest. Why then should the youth shrink from conflict, self-denial, or from any sacrifice, for eternal life?",
