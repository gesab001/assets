    "word": "Remember that with God there is no caste or nationality, no divisions or parties. Truth never places her delicate feet in a path of uncleanness or impurity. Truth does not bring people down to a low level, but brings all up to a high, exalted level. Truth never makes men or women coarse, or rough, or uncourteous. It takes men in all their sin and commonness, separates them from the world, and refines their tastes, even if they are poor and uneducated. Under Christ's discipline a constant work of refinement \n89\ngoes on, sanctifying them through the truth. If they are tempted to exert one particle of influence that would lead away from Christ into the way of the world, in pride, or fashion, or display, they speak words of resistance that will turn aside the enemy's power. \u201cI am not my own,\u201d they say, \u201cI am bought with a price. I am a son, a daughter of God. I cannot possibly give God more than He claims. All is His, by creation and by redemption. Christ has purchased the whole being, mind, soul, strength, and body, and I am to express, in my words, my deportment, my actions, a sense of my obligation to God. I am wholly His. My life is hid with Christ in God, and when He who is my life shall appear, then shall I also appear with Him in glory.\u201d",
