    "word": "The world's Redeemer, the only begotten Son of God, by his perfect obedience to the law, by his life and character, redeemed that which was lost in the fall, and made it possible for man to obey that holy law of righteousness which Adam transgressed. Christ did not exchange his divinity for humanity, but combined humanity with divinity; and in humanity he lived the law in behalf of the human family. The sins of every one who will receive Christ were set to his account, and he has fully satisfied the justice of God.",
