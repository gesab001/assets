    "word": "The preciousness of life is to be appreciated because this life belongs to the Master. As long as we live, we are ever to bear in mind that we are bought with a price. Christ made of himself a whole and complete sacrifice for us, to make it possible for us to receive the gift of everlasting life. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.\" We have enlisted under Christ's banner for life service, and great responsibilities and possibilities are within our reach. There are in the providence of God particular periods when we must arise in response to the call of God, and make use of our time, our intellect, our whole being, body, soul, and spirit, fulfilling to the utmost of our ability the requirements of God.

Let every member of the family do something. Educate, educate. This is an opportunity which God's people can not afford to lose. God calls. Do your best at this time to render to him your offering, to carry out his specified will; and thus make this an occasion for witnessing for him and his truth. In a world of darkness let your light shine forth. Let canvassers do their best in canvassing for the book \"Christ's Object Lessons.\" Their work will serve a double purpose. They will place in the homes of the people a book containing most precious light, seed sown to bring truth to souls ready to perish. In receiving this seed into their hearts, they will save their souls through belief of the truth. At the same time means will be gathered for the relief of the schools. Twofold good will thus be accomplished in this work. Let it be done heartily as unto the Lord.",
