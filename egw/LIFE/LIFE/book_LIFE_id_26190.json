    "word": "I was shown that the work was not left in the hands of James or any other one upon earth. Angels of God have charge of the work, and they counsel and direct through chosen agents, the people, and thus the work moves forward. I was shown that God in his own wise providence raised James above dependence and want, that his testimony and influence might not be crippled by the galling sense of dependence. God will use him as his instrument to speak with freedom, independent of man, and in his strength and Spirit raise his voice, and with his example call upon the people to arouse, and with energy to assist with their substance, their influence, ability and judgment in moving forward this great work. And any that wish to be convinced, can be, that it is not selfishness, nor to obtain any advantage himself that he pursues this course. But his object is to advance the work of God which is dearer to him than life.",
