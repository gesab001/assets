    "word": "God has given you moral powers and religious susceptibilities, but you have not sought to co-operate with Him. To make a propitiation for your sins, and to reconcile you to Himself, He has given the life of His only begotten Son. He has manifested the light, the truth, the way to you, but you have resisted the Spirit of God, and have chosen to walk in the light made by the sparks of your own kindling. The words spoken by Christ to Nicodemus apply to you: \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.\" God has given you the privilege of receiving Him, the Light of the world; but for years you have resisted the Holy Spirit of God, and the truth leaked out of your heart as water out of a leaky vessel. You have turned your back upon Jesus, saying, not only in your thoughts, but in your words and works, \"My Lord delayeth His coming.\" Yes; your seeds of unbelief have been dropping here and there, and sad is the thought, you can not gather them up again; you can not counteract your influence.",
