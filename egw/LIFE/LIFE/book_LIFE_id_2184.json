    "word": "Moses, the first historian, gives quite a definite account of social and individual life in the early days of the world's history, but we find no record that an infant was born blind, deaf, crippled, or imbecile. Not an instance is recorded of a natural death in infancy, childhood, or early manhood. Obituary notices in the book of Genesis run thus: \u201cAnd all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.\u201d \u201cAnd all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.\u201d Concerning others the record states, \u201cHe died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years.\u201d It was so rare for a son to die before his father, that such an occurrence was considered worthy of record: \u201cHaran died \n8\nbefore his father Terah.\u201d [Genesis 5:5, 8; 25:8; 11:28.] The patriarchs from Adam to Noah, with few exceptions, lived nearly a thousand years. Since then the average length of life has been decreasing.",
