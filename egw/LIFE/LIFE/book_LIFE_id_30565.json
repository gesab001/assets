Shall we learn the lesson He would teach us? Will we bear His test and proving? God has worked for His people by His Holy Spirit. By the bestowal of wonderful blessings, He has striven to awaken in them a desire to impart the light entrusted to them. \"I have come to you in love,\" He says. \"I have come to you in mercy and judgment; yet you would not learn the lesson I sought to teach. My Spirit has been grieved by your failure to respond to My love.\" To those who claim to be His servants and yet depart from His way, He says, \"If thou art destroyed, Thou thyself art responsible. Ye would not come unto me, that ye might have life.\"",
