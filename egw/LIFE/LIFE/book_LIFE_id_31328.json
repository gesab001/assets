    "word": "God will not endorse one act of selfishness, one unrighteous deed. Men may claim high honor for their labor in God's service, but the way in which they accomplish their work testifies to their value. If they obey the law of Jehovah and cooperate with Him, witness is borne of them before the heavenly universe that they are true workers with God. God's ordinances and works are given to man to promote holiness of heart and purity of life. If this result is not seen, the object sought for by a righteous God is not accomplished. However zealous men may be in certain lines of work, which receive praise from men, God reads beneath the surface, and if the work is not of such a character as He can approve, the workers are not accepted by Him.",
