    "word": "Afflictions are oft mercies in disguise. We know not what we might have been without them. When God in His mysterious providence overthrows all our cherished plans, and we may receive sorrow in the place of joy, we will bow in submission and say, \"Thy will, Oh God, be done.\"  We must and we will ever cherish a calm, religious trust in One who loves us, who gave His life for us. \"The Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my\n224\nlife. I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?  why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? . . . Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.\"",
