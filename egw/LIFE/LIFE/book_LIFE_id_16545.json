    "word": "All created beings live by the will and power of God. They are recipients of the life of the Son of God. However able and talented, however large their capacities, they are replenished with life from the Source of all life. He is the spring, the fountain, of life. . . . The life which He had laid down in humanity, He again took up and gave to humanity. \"I am come,\" He says, \"that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" . . .",
