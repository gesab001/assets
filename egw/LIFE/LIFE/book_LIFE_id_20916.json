    "word": "In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, such a work as that of John is to be done. God calls for men who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord. The message preceding the public ministry of Christ was: \"Repent, publicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees; 'repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' \" As a people who believe in Christ's soon appearing, we have a message to bear-- \"Prepare to meet thy God.\" Amos 4:12. Our message must be as direct as was the message of John. He rebuked kings for their iniquity. \n                                                                           333\nNotwithstanding that his life was imperiled, he did not hesitate to declare God's word. And our work in this age must be done as faithfully.",
