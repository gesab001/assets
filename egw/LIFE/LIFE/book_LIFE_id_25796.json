    "word": "The greatest Teacher the world ever knew, educated those who came to him, in the simplest way. Sometimes he taught them, sitting among them on the mountainside; sometimes walking with them by the sea or way, he revealed to them the mysteries of the kingdom of God. He did not sermonize as men do today. In intensely earnest tones he assured them of the truths of the life to come, of the way of salvation.",
