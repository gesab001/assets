    "word": "\"We are laborers together with God.\" Christ engaged in the great work for which He lived and died. We are to be instant in season and out of season. And why? \"For ye are bought with a price,\" and have enlisted under the banner of Prince Immanuel. We are enlisted for labor, \"not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.\" We are to work out our own salvation with fear and with trembling.",
