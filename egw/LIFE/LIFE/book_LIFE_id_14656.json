    "word": "My soul cries out after the living God. My very being longs after Him. Oh, for to reflect His lovely image perfectly! Oh, for to be wholly consecrated to Him! Oh, how hard it is for dear self to die. We can rejoice in a whole Saviour; one who saves us from all sin. We can be shut in with God where we can daily say, \"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me\" \"to will and to do of his good pleasure.\" Glory be to God. I know that my life is hid with Christ in God.",
