    "word": "I was pointed back, back in the past, and saw a blot upon the life of Horatio which he has never removed. He did not love his neighbor as himself, but disguised facts and acted a deceptive part which was very displeasing to God. He injured another, which injury has led to reckless moves on his part, and may finally result in his eternal ruin. Selfishness did this. It was a course pursued which Heaven frowns upon. Horatio, you have humble acknowledgements to make in this matter, and your soul cannot be free from guilt till you remove this wrong thoroughly. There have not been right feelings with members of the family in regard to this wrong. It has not been viewed in its heinous character as God views it. It is not too late for wrongs to be righted. And there is no time to lose in redeeming the past, as far as it can be redeemed, lest this sin shall stand against you in the Judgment.",
