    "word": "After Christ rose from the dead, He proclaimed over the sepulcher, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" Christ, the risen Saviour, is our life. As Christ becomes the life of the soul, the change is felt, but language cannot describe it. All claims to knowledge, to influence, to power, are worthless without the perfume of Christ's character. Christ must be the very life of the soul, as the blood is the life of the body. . . .",
