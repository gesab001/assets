    "word": "If there is the same old routine with us in our ministry as in the state church and other denominations, we can do no good. If we have advanced light and truth, we are to reveal that the truth is righteousness and power in the human agent. If we are tame and lifeless, we cannot be living epistles, known \n\n\n                                   -132- \n\nand read of all men. We are to awake into life; for Christ is light and life. Missionaries must have the missionary spirit, and watch for souls as they that must give an account.",
