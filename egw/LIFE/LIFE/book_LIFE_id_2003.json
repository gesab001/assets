    "word": "Among those to whom the Saviour had given the commission, \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,\" were many from the humbler walks of life,--men and women who had learned to love their Lord, and who had determined to follow His example of unselfish service. To these lowly ones, as well as to the disciples who had been with the Saviour during His earthly ministry, had been given a precious trust. They were to carry to the world the glad tidings of salvation through Christ.--The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 105, 106. \n                                                                           26",
