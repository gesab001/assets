    "word": "\u201c\u2018I CONSIDER IT A PRIVILEGE BEFORE I SLEEP TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO MY YOUNG FRIENDS. MY AGE IS SIXTEEN YEARS. I WAS BAPTIZED, AND UNITED WITH THE CHURCH LAST WINTER. I MOURN OVER MY UNFAITHFULNESS AND LACK OF DEVOTION IN THE GOOD CAUSE. I BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS LAID THE HAND OF AFFLICTION UPON ME TO SAVE ME, AND IF I GO DOWN TO THE GRAVE NOW, I HAVE A GOOD HOPE OF COMING UP WITH THE SAINTS IN THE FIRST RESURRECTION. I WOULD APPEAL TO ALL MY YOUNG FRIENDS, NOT TO LET THE PLEASURES OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE WORLD ECLIPSE THE LOVELINESS OF THE SAVIOUR. REMEMBER THAT THE DEATH-BED IS A POOR PLACE TO PREPARE FOR AN INHERITANCE IN THE SECOND LIFE. SPEND THE BEST OF YOUR DAYS IN SERVING THE LORD. FAREWELL.\u2019",
