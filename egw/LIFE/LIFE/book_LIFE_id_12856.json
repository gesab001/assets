    "word": "Christ makes His church a beautiful temple for God. \"Where two or three are gathered together in my name,\" He declared, \"there am I in the midst of them,\" Matthew 18:20. His church is the court of holy life, filled with varied gifts, and endowed with the Holy Spirit. Appropriate duties are assigned by Heaven to each member of the church on earth, and all are to find their happiness in the happiness of those whom they help and bless.",
