    "word": "Will you consider that you have known what it means to feel the moving of the Holy Spirit upon your heart, before you had educated yourself to criticize, to find fault, to accuse, to rail against your brethren? When I \n\n\n                                     -420- \n\nconsider what you might have been, had you improved your God-given powers, had you striven to be kind and pure and unselfish, exerting a spiritual influence and increasing in stability and good works, my heart aches! Had you set a Christlike example, many souls would have been helped in following it. Who can estimate what a good work you might have done had you followed without deviation the instruction given in the teachings of Christ? You have left off to be wise and to do good. But I have hope that you will see yourself as you are and make diligent efforts to counterwork your past influence. I have hope that you will enter the narrow way and pass through the gate that leads unto eternal life. . . . If you are saved from sin you must have an experience altogether different from that which you now have. God hath shined in our hearts, to give what? A knowledge higher, greater, and infinitely more ennobling than the knowledge that this world gives. When church members have this knowledge, their practice will be of a character to recommend their faith. By a well ordered life, and godly conversation, they will reveal Christ. There will be no lawsuits between neighbors or brothers.",
