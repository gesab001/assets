    "word": "Man is to hear the Word of God, filled with a hungering desire to hear in faith and profit by the hearing. He is to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" We are to fear and tremble lest we make a wrong use of the words of the gospel, the leaves of the tree of life, which are for the healing of the nations. \"Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away, even that which he seemeth to have.\"",
