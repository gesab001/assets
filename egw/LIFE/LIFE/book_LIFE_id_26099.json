    "word": "Your education has not been of that kind to form solid, substantial characters, therefore you have this education to obtain now, which you should have had years ago. Your mother was too fond of you. A mother cannot love her children too well, but she may love unwisely, and allow her affection to blind her to their best interest. You have had an indulgent, tender mother. She has shielded her children too much. She has taken the burdens of life which have nearly crushed out her life, while her children should have taken them. They could have borne them better than she.",
