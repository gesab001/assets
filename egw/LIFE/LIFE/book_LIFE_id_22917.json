    "word": "Christ had been the guide and teacher of ancient Israel, and He taught them that health is the reward of obedience to the laws of God. The Great Physician who healed the sick in Palestine had spoken to His people from the pillar of cloud, telling them what they must do, and what God would do for them. [Exodus 15:26 quoted.] Christ gave to Israel definite instruction in regard to their habits of life, and He assured them, \u201cThe Lord will take away from thee all sickness\u201d (Deuteronomy 7:15). When they fulfilled the conditions, the promise was verified to them. \u201cThere was not one feeble person among their tribes\u201d (Psalm 105:37).",
