    "word": "Abiding with Christ is choosing only the disposition of Christ, so that He identifies His interests with yours. When you give up your own will, your own wisdom, and learn of Christ as He has invited you, then you shall find entrance to the kingdom of God. Entire, unreserved surrender He requires. Give up your life for Him to order, mold, and fashion; take upon your neck His yoke; submit to be led and taught as well as to lead and teach; learn that unless you become as a little child you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Abide in Him, to be and do only what He wills. \n\n\n                                     -232- \n\nThese are the conditions of discipleship.",
