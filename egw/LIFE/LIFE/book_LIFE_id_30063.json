    "word": "There is a oneness with those that are partakers of the Spirit of Christ. You may bring the horse to the water, but you never can make him drink; he has got to drink for himself. Just so it is with us; we may have a house around us, and the words of life may be presented in all their beauty and in all their clearness, and it is like the bright shining of the candle; but unless they will kindle their tapers from it, unless they are willing to get some light, they won't have any, no, indeed. Now, that is the most precious to me.",
