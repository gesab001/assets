    "word": "Christ has appointed to every man his work. The second death will be the portion of those who labor not, and the dreadful words will be heard, \"Depart from me, ye that work iniquity\" (Matthew 7:23). But the faithful servants will not lose their reward. They will gain eternal life, and the \"Well done, good and faithful servant\" (chap. 25:23), will fall as sweetest music on their ears.--Signs of the Times, July 28, 1887.",
