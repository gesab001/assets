    "word": "The Training Our Schools Should Give. The teaching in our schools is not to be the same as in other colleges and seminaries. It is not to be of an inferior order; but the knowledge essential to prepare a people to stand in the great day of God is to be made the all-important theme. The students are to be fitted for God's service not only in this life but in the future, immortal life. The Lord requires that our schools shall be training schools for the kingdom to which we are bound. Without previous training, none will be prepared to blend in the holy, happy harmony of the redeemed.",
