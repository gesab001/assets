    "word": "Satan has his bribes, his baits in advance, and one attraction after another is presented. All this will I give thee if thou wilt worship me. O, why do they delay? Why not lay hold now, without one moment's delay? Why are they not seized by a terrific fear that it will be too late for them,--too late, no oil in their vessels with their lamps! My soul is in agony at times, and then I look to Jesus and quiet myself in God. If they will not hear his dear voice and drink of the water of life, what will any other voice avail? The end is near. We are on the very borders of the eternal world, and O, how tardy, how dilatory to secure the oil of grace to replenish the lamps that are going out! God help the sinners in Zion. -- Ellen G. White, Hanover Road, Victoria Park, Adelaide, S. A., Nov. 23, 1892.",
