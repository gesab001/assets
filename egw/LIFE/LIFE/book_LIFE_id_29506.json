    "word": "Those who are so curious to find out things that have not been made known in the Scriptures are generally surface students in regard to those things which have a bearing on the daily life and practice. They do not know God as revealed in Jesus Christ. The Son of God came to bless the world with the example of a pure and perfect life, to practice self-denial, to sacrifice Himself that He might have the joy of seeing souls eternally saved in the kingdom of God. Everyone who follows Christ \n\n\n                                     -244- \n\nfully will share with Him in this divine work of saving the lost. All who, in the name of Jesus, teach as He taught [and] work as He worked, have a divine commission.",
