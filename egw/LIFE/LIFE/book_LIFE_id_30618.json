    "word": "Let men and women who are truly converted offer themselves in all humility to the service of the Lord, for verily He hath need of them. First, they must be emptied of all selfishness. They will be cleansed vessels unto honor. They will reflect the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness to all with whom they come in contact. Partakers of the divine nature, they will be savors of life unto life. They will not talk of the faults of others, but will repeat the words of divine wisdom which have penetrated and illuminated their hearts. They will be men who fear to talk and make sport of God's messengers, but men who pray much.",
