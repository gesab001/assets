    "word": "Our life must be hid with Christ in God, we must know Christ personally: for this is eternal life to know God and Jesus Christ: then only can we rightly represent him to the world. Let the prayer constantly ascend, \"Lord, teach me how to do as Jesus would do, were he in my place.\" Wherever we are, we must let our light shine forth to the glory of God in good works. This is the great, important interest of our life.",
