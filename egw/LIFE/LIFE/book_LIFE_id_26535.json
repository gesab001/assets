    "word": "God has done everything for us. What have we done? Shall we become faithful stewards of His grace? Shall we receive from the Lord Jesus His gifts to impart? \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.\" Our life is to be a trial of faith. We are to recognize that a heavenly hand is reached out to us. In laying aside our tenth for God, we shall be able also to present gifts and offerings. This is the Lord's method of saving our souls from worldliness, from greed, and from selfishness. He has made us His stewards. He imparts to all who love Him, that they may impart to others. With the Lord's imparted gifts in our hands, we are to feel that the Lord has made us His stewards, to be employed by Him. He has made my heart one with the heart of Christ, who gave His life and all the honors and riches of heaven that one, through faith, shall have eternal riches.",
