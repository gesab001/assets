    "word": "Many, many need melting over. Be sound in principle, true to God, but do not manifest one stern, ungenial phase of character. God does not want you to incur contempt by manifesting a disposition like a ball of putty, but he does want you to be a principle as sound as a rock, yet with a healthful mellowness. Like the Master, be full of grace and truth. Jesus was incorruptible, undefiled, yet in his life were mingled gentleness, meekness, benignity, sympathy and love. The poorest were not afraid to approach him, they did not fear a rebuff. What Christ was, every Christian should strive to be. In holiness and winsomeness of character he is our model.",
