    "word": "An interpretation has been given to me of the sinking of The Morning Star. This boat was unsafe. There were in it unperceived defects. In His mercy the Lord permitted the boat to sink while no one was on board. If these defects had not been discovered, lives might sometime have been lost. While the Lord could see and understand the unsafe condition of the boat, human agencies knew not the danger. You have great reason for rejoicing that the heavenly Watcher permitted the boat to sink without loss of life.--(Letter 293, 1905, pp. 1-3. (To Elder James Edson White, Sept. 26, 1905.)",
