    "word": "AWAKENED TO DIE NO MORE.\u2014Ministering angels are round about us giving us to drink of the water of life to refresh our souls in the closing scenes of life. There is a pledge from Him who is the resurrection and the life, that those who sleep in Jesus will Christ bring with Him from\n42\nthe grave. The trump will sound, the dead will awaken to life, to die no more. The eternal morning has come to them, for there will be no night in the city of God.\u2014Letter 78, 1890 quoted in 2SM 250.",
