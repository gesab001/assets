Then, directing that the weeping friends be sent from the room, he kneeled down and prayed fervently to God to restore Dorcas to life and health. Turning to the body, he said, \u201cTabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.\u201d Dorcas had been of great service to the church, and God saw fit to bring her back from the land of the enemy, that her skill and energy might still be a blessing to others, and also that by this manifestation of His power the cause of Christ might be strengthened.\u2014(Acts of the Apostles, 132.)",
