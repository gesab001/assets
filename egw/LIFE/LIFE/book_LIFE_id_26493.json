    "word": "All that Jesus did on the earth was done with an eye single to the glory of His Father. He says, \"As the Father gave Me commandment, even so I do\" [John 14:31]. \"This commandment have I received of My Father\" [John 10:18]. In all He did, He was working out the will of His Father, so that His life on earth was a manifestation of the divine perfection. The union of divinity with humanity in Christ, was to reveal to us God's purpose to bring man into the closest connection with Himself. We cannot possibly be happy without Him.",
