    "word": "If in your restaurant work you make no advancement in religious lines, what have you gained? Daily you are brought into association with many who perhaps all their lifetime have continued in sin. Some means of arresting their attention must be devised. They must be warned of their danger. If this work can not be done in our restaurants, let them be discontinued; for what use is it to expend means and talent in a work that consumes without producing? Of what use is it for workers to spend their time preparing temporal food for men and women, while they neglect to offer them the bread of life and the water of salvation? Merely to provide temporal food is not a savor of life unto life.",
