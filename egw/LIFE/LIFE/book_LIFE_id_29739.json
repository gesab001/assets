    "word": "\"So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church.\" Thus it is that the wife is represented in her union with her husband. \"Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.\" How could there be unhappy families if all were doers of the Word and not hearers only? The Lord does not require that which is impossible, but all are to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, and those who do this will honor their Redeemer in their married life.",
