    "word": "The Lord has given men and women capabilities and tact and skill to be used to His name's glory. When sincere, earnest efforts are put forth to win souls to God, we shall see of the salvation of God. Those who claim to be Christians should make an unreserved surrender of all they have to the Lord. Their time, their substance, and their influence as a savor of life unto life are required of them by Him who willingly gave himself to save to the uttermost all who come to him. Those who claim to be children of God should throw the whole weight of their influence on the side of Christ, for his sake practicing his self-denial and self-sacrifice. There is need of close communion with God and entire conformity to his will. This is the secret of gaining the power that will convict and convert sinners. The church has failed because she has not come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty influence of the Satanic force. Church members have not as they should pressed back the powers of darkness. This is the reason for the deficiency in the church today. The quickening power of God is needed. Men and women who love God supremely and their neighbor as themselves are needed, men and women who crave the power of God, that they may bear witness to the love of Jesus.",
