    "word": "Wonderful lesson of mercy, forbearance, patience, and love! Perishing souls, helpless in sin and liable to be destroyed by the arts and snares of Satan, are cared for as a shepherd cares for the sheep of his flock. Jesus represents Himself as being acquainted with His sheep. He gave His life for them. And He goes to seek them even before they seek Him. There is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that repents than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance.",
