    "word": "God is not pleased that any one of His representatives worries, wearies, and wears himself out, so that he does not diffuse the sweet fragrance of heaven in his life. We have but one life to live. Jesus has come to our world to teach us how to live that life, that we may represent the character of heaven. We must never grow fainthearted, for it will be far worse for ourselves and for others within the reach of our influence. God requires us to behave with dignity under trials and temptations. The Man of Sorrows, who was acquainted with grief, is before us as our example. \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne\" (Revelation 3:21).--Letter 7, Feb. 10, 1885, to Daniel T. Bourdeau, early worker in Europe.",
