    "word": "This truth is an eternal truth, because Christ Himself taught it. He has engaged to raise the righteous dead, for He gave His life for the life of the world. \"As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me\" (John 6:57). \"I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger\" (verse 35).--Letter 82, March 5, 1907, to O. A. Olsen, president, Australasian Union Conference.",
