    "word": "While this decree was in full force, a son was born to Amram and Jochebed. . . . The mother succeeded in concealing the child [Moses] for three months. Then, finding that she could no longer keep him safely, she prepared a little ark of rushes, making it watertight by means of slime and pitch; and laying the babe therein, she placed it among the flags at the river's\n89\nbrink. She dared not remain to guard it, lest the child's life and her own should be forfeited; but his sister, Miriam, lingered near, . . . anxiously watching to see what would become of her little brother. And there were other watchers. The mother's earnest prayers had committed her child to the care of God; and angels, unseen, hovered above his lowly resting place. Angels directed Pharaoh's daughter thither. Her curiosity was excited by the little basket, and as she looked upon the beautiful child within, she read the story at a glance. The tears of the babe awakened her compassion, and . . . she determined that he should be saved; she would adopt him as her own.\u2014PP 241-243.",
