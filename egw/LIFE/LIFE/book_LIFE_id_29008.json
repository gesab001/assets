    "word": "A thoroughgoing Christian draws his motives of action from his deep heart-love for his Master. Up through the roots of his affection for Christ come faith and an unselfish interest in his brethren. The selfish desire to be first is quenched. There is no hatred in his thoughts, because there is no hatred in his heart. He has the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. The refining influence of Christ's love refreshes and invigorates his spiritual life. By his loyalty to his brethren he shows that he realizes the value of souls. He can pray with the spirit and with the understanding also. His zeal, his staunch principles, his true devotion to that which is pure, honest, just, and of good report, make him companionable.",
