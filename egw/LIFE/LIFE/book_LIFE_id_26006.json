    "word": "Pride and fashion hold men and women in the veriest slavery to customs which are fatal to health, and even to life itself. The appetites and passions, clamoring for indulgence, trample reason and conscience under foot. This is the cruel work of Satan, and he is constantly putting forth the most determined efforts to strengthen the chains by which he has bound his victims. Those who have been all their lives indulging wrong habits do not always realize the necessity of a change. And many will persist in gratifying their desire for sinful pleasure at any cost. Let the conscience be aroused, and much is gained. Nothing but the grace of God can convict and convert the heart; here alone can the slaves of custom obtain power to break the shackles which bind them. The self-indulgent must be led to see and feel that a great moral renovation is necessary, if they would meet the claims of the divine law; the soul-temple has been defiled, and God calls upon them to arouse, and strive with all their might to win back the God-given \n                                                                           13\nmanhood which has been sacrificed through sinful indulgence.",
