    "word": "If every physician in our ranks would separate from your influence, they would sound the keynote of Christian medical education, for the angels of God would give them life and courage in the Lord, and power to stand against your persuasive, deceiving influence. It is the privilege of every man who is converted to the truth to show moral independence, to stand firm for the truth and for righteousness. When propositions are laid before a believer to engage in business that would lead him to deviate from the principles of the law given for the guidance of every man's life, it is his privilege and duty to make a firm, decided refusal. The strongest representations that may be made should not lead him to engage in any enterprise that would pollute his conscience. He is to hearken to the Holy Spirit, who would lead him to say to the tempter, \"So did not I, because of the fear of God.\" I tell you, a great crisis is upon us, and those men who have united with you and sustained you have not said, \"So did not I, because of the fear of God.\"",
