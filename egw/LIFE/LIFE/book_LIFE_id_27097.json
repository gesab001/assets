    "word": "There is far more Pharisaism among our people than they suppose. This has no Saviour in it. That makes us in danger of being rigorous and gloomy, as though Jesus were still in Joseph's tomb. We want our attitude in the religious life to be one of peace, happiness and joy. Jesus is not dead. We have a living Saviour, One who is making intercession for us, and who bears our cases by name before the Father. We want to cultivate more joy and bring attractiveness into the religious life, everything testifying that we have a risen Saviour, a living Jesus.",
