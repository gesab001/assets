    "word": "In the hour of need we can gain no power by looking to ourselves. Our eyes need to be anointed with the heavenly eye-salve, that we may discern our spiritual poverty and lack of faith. God is declared in all His dealings with His people, and with clear unclouded eye; in adversity and sickness; in disappointment and in trial, as well as in prosperity, we are to behold the light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, and trust to His guiding hand. Remember the power and love God has shown us in the past. He \"so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). Then will He not find a way for us out of our difficulties? . . . \n     [Ephesians 6:10-16 quoted.]",
