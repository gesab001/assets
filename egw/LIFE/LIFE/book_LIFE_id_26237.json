    "word": "17. Commercial Studies.--\"The education given in our schools is one-sided. Students should be given an education that will fit them for successful business life. The common branches of education should be fully and thoroughly taught. Bookkeeping should be looked upon as of equal importance with grammar. This line of study is one of the most important of use in practical life; but few leave our schools with a knowledge of how to keep books correctly.\"--MS., Dec. 20, 1896.",
