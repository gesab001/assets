Lindsay\n\n                                        \"Sunnyside, Cooranbong, N.S.W., \n                                              April 20, 1896. \n\nHarmon Lindsay, \n   Battle Creek, Mich. \n\nDear Brother,-- \n     I am constrained to say to you, The Judgment is to sit the books are to be opened, and every man is to be judged according to the deeds done in the body. You look upon things seen as of value, but he who is a citizen of the heavenly kingdom will be constantly looking at things not seen. The power of earth over the mind and character is broken. He has the abiding presence of the heavenly Guest according to the Saviour's promise, \"I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\" He walks with God, as did Enoch, in continual communion. Only he who walks with the Lord Jesus in this life will be translated or come forth from the grave changed from mortal to immortality, to dwell with Christ in the heavenly courts through eternal ages. There must now be manifest in us the Holy Spirit's working, a power that will enable us to withstand temptation.",
