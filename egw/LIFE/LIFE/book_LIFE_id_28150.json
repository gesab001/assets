    "word": "We are far from being the people God would have us to be, because we do not elevate the soul and refine the character in harmony with the wonderful unfolding of God's truth and His purposes. \"Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people\" [Proverbs 14:34]. Sin is a disorganizer. Wherever it is cherished--in the individual heart, in the household, in the church--there is disorder, strife, variance, enmity, envy, jealousy, because the enemy of man and of God has the controlling power over the mind. But let the truth be loved and brought into the life, as well as advocated, and that man or woman will hate sin and will be a living representative of Jesus Christ to the world.",
