    "word": "Now is the time to use means for God. Now is the time to be rich in good works, laying up in store for ourselves a good foundation against the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life. One soul saved in the kingdom of God is of more value than all earthly riches. We are answerable to God for the souls of those with whom \n                                                                           109\nwe are brought into contact, and the more closely our connections with our fellow-men, the greater is our responsibility. We are one great brotherhood, and the welfare of our fellow-men should be our great interest. We have not one moment to lose. If we have been careless in this matter it is high time we were now in earnest to redeem the time, lest the blood of souls be found in our garments. As children of God, none of us are excused from taking a part in the great work of Christ, in the salvation of our fellow-men.",
