    "word": "I have not slept since 1:00 a.m., and I am writing to you while all the house are locked in slumber. I am pained when I think of your stubbornness on the matter we have all been troubled about, because I fear for your future. But \n\n\n                                   -218- \n\nif you choose your own way, then we cannot change your course. I see no signs of your spirit being in harmony with the Spirit of God, or being controlled by His Spirit. It seems that you have taken the bit in your own mouth and will do just as you choose. I see naught but an unsanctified will. I will not reproach you, but warn you to be careful what steps you take. With the feelings you now have you will make reckless moves which may plunge you into lifelong trouble.",
