    "word": "Why, I ask you, are there so many families destitute of the Spirit of God? Why are there so many families that have so little of the life and love and likeness of Jesus Christ?

If they knew God, and if they would behold Him by faith in Jesus Christ who came to our world to die for man, they would see such matchless charms in the Son that they by beholding would become changed into the same image. Now you see the wrong of conforming to the world.",
