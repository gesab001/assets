    "word": "Thousands are starving for the bread of life while even church members are drunken as it were with the wine of false representation. What burden do these professed believers carry for perishing souls? Strife for supremacy, great ideas for the development of commercial enterprises absorb the mind, and the spiritual needs of humanity are forgotten. The Lord is preparing to show that there is One who takes account of the wickedness of the world and the pleasure-loving spirit that predominates and that is an offense to Him.",
