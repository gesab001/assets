    "word": "Study His life of self-denial, self-sacrifice, His life of privation, and how much abuse He endured for our sakes on the cruel cross, and then let us never exalt ourselves or think we have a trying time, but let us be thankful. God does not want us to be in gloom, but walk in the light as He is in the light. Jesus lives; He is not in Joseph's new tomb, but lives to make intercession for us. He does not forget us for one brief moment. He encouraged His disciples to [obey] that which He commanded them, [then promised], \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" [Matthew 28:20]. Then let peace come into the soul, joyfulness into the heart, and speak forth the words Christ has given us, and show forth by our piety, \"the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light\" [1 Peter 2:9].",
