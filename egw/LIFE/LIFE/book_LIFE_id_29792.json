    "word": "Empty the soul-temple of all selfishness. Cling with living faith to Jesus. Exert all your tact, all your skill, all your capabilities in resisting the enemy and in coming close to the souls who need help. Diligent, persevering efforts should be made in their behalf. They must be urged to have a care for their own souls. There is fulness for you in Christ. Come to the water of life and drink. Do not keep away and complain of thirst. The water of life is free to all. Spend much time on your knees in prayer. Believe that God hears your prayers, and you will see of His salvation.",
