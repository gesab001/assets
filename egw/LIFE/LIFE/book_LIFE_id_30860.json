    "word": "But, thank God, there are many who have been listening to his word and feasting upon it. What does Christ say?--\"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.\" Then let us feast upon Christ. Let us enjoy his love, and praise God for this great salvation. Then we shall come together, heart to heart. When we shall subdue our pride, when we shall pluck from the garden of the soul every fiber of the root of bitterness, our hearts will flow together as the heart of one. And the Saviour's promise is, \"If any two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\" Then, I ask, Where is our power?--It is in the sincere prayers going up to heaven continually that Christ will reveal himself to us. And he will do it. The light and glory of God will rest upon his people. And then the world will see, and will say, \"Behold, how these brethren love one another.\" Then all this heart burning and distrust will cease, and in place of it, there will be love and union, courtesy, kindness, and tenderness. The very countenances will shine with the glory of God. We shall all see eye to eye. We shall speak the same things, and be of the same judgment.",
