    "word": "Discourse by Elder Haskell \n\n     In his discourse following Elder Daniells's address, Elder S. N. Haskell called attention to the words of the psalmist, \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.\" Psalm 116:15. Some may regard this as a strange statement; it is nevertheless true. The servants of God who are now sleeping, are to Him exceeding precious. So long as time shall last, the influence of their godly life will continue to yield rich fruitage. No longer can the enemy of the human race imperil their welfare; they are safe from his power. Jesus claims them as His own, and on the morning of the resurrection He will bestow upon them fullness of joy.",
