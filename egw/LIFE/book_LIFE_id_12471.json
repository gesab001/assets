    "word": "A true, lovable Christian is the most powerful argument that can be advanced in favor of Bible truth. Such a man is Christ\u2019s representative. His life is the most convincing evidence that can be borne to the power of divine grace. When God\u2019s people bring the righteousness of Christ into the daily life, sinners will be converted and victories over the enemy will be gained.",
