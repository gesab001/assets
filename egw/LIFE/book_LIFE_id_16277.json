    "word": "Chap. 3 - Obedience to the Law of God\n\n     Mercy and truth are promised to the humble and penitent, and judgments are prepared for the sinful and rebellious. \u201cJustice and judgment are the habitation of Thy throne.\u201d Psalm 89:14. A wicked and adulterous people will not escape the wrath of God, the punishment they have justly earned. Man has fallen, and his is a work of a lifetime, be it longer or shorter, to recover from his fall, and regain, through Christ, the image of the divine, which he has lost by sin and continued transgression. God requires a thorough transformation of soul, body, and spirit, in order to regain the estate lost through Adam. The Lord mercifully sends rays of light to show man his true condition. If he will not walk in the light, he manifests a pleasure in darkness. He will not come to the light lest his deeds should be reproved.",
