    "word": "Jesus answered the accusation of the Jews thus, \u201cIf ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.\u201d He had already declared to them that He had kept His Father\u2019s commandments. When He was accused of Sabbathbreaking in the matter of healing the withered hand, He turned upon His accusers with the question \u201cIs it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?\u201d In summing up His answer to the questioning of the Pharisees He said, \u201cWherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.\u201d Here Christ justified His work as in perfect harmony with the Sabbath law.\u2014Signs of the Times, Feb. 28, 1878.",
