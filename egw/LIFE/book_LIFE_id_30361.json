    "word": "I want to tell you, dear friends, that we have done great dishonor to our Master in turning away from Christ to seek wisdom from finite human beings. Shall we continue to cherish the sin of unbelief, which \n\n\n           -166- \n\ndoth so easily beset us, or shall we cast away this weight of unbelief and go to the Source of strength, believing that we shall receive pity and compassion from the One who knows our frame, who loves us so well that He gave His own life for us, who bore in His own body the strokes which fell because of our transgression of the law of God? All this He did that we might become prisoners of hope.",
