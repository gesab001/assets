    "word": "Can we read these words and not discern the value which Christ has placed upon the human agent who has entirely surrendered to Him? He has made provision that \"we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might \n\n\n                                    -86- \n\nserve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him, all the days of our life\" [Luke 1:74, 75]. Always \"looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,\" we are delivered from the devices of evil men and evil angels, and we seek to break the bonds of sin and Satan. [1 Peter 1:1-12, quoted.]",
