    "word": "If we desire to be as useful as possible in this life, we must live in accordance with the laws of God, taking proper care of the house we live in. In order that we may be able to help others, we must do all in our power to save ourselves from disease. Denying selfish appetite, we are to regulate all our habits of life in accordance with the light which God has given. Thus we may not only secure physical health, but gain a rich spiritual experience.",
