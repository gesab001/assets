    "word": "A Good Hold on Immortal Life Essential to Happiness in This Life--Consider in humility, in fearfulness and with much trembling your present condition. Let your eye run back upon the past. Have you glorified God in your life? . . . I would rather be written childless than have my children live and not devote their lives to God, but exert an influence in the wrong direction. Oh, my poor boy, you don't try, half try, to glorify God! Yourself occupies your thought and attention. Unless you trust less in yourself, and by your life seek to honor God, you will not be happy, but will be drifting about without an anchor. If you would become converted, if you would now--while probation lasts --dig deep and lay the foundation sure, you would have a good hold on the better, immortal life; and then you will begin to know what happiness there is in this life.--Letter 15, 1868, pp. 2-3. (To Edson White, June 17, 1868.)",
