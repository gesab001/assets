    "word": "And shall the young live vain and thoughtless lives of fashion and frivolity, dwarfing their intellect to the matter of dress, and consume their time in sensual pleasure? When they are all unready, God may say to them, This night thy folly shall end. He may permit mortal sickness to come upon those who have borne no fruit to his glory. While facing the realities of eternity, they may begin to realize the value of time and the life they have lost. They may then have some sense of the worth of the soul. They see that their lives have not glorified God in lighting the path of others to Heaven. They have lived to glorify self. And when racked with pain and with anguish of soul, they cannot have clear conceptions of eternal things. They may review their past lives, and in their remorse cry out, I have done nothing for Jesus who has done everything for me. My life has been a terrible failure.",
