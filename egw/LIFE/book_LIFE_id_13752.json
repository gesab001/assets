    "word": "All who enter the City of God will enter through the strait gate\u2014by agonizing effort; for \u201cthere shall in no wise enter into it anything \n277\nthat defileth.\u201d Revelation 21:27. But none who have fallen need give up to despair. Aged men, once honored of God, may have defiled their souls, sacrificing virtue on the altar of lust; but if they repent, forsake sin, and turn to God, there is still hope for them. He who declares, \u201cBe thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,\u201d also gives the invitation, \u201cLet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\u201d Revelation 2:10; Isaiah 55:7. God hates sin, but He loves the sinner. \u201cI will heal their backsliding,\u201d He declares; \u201cI will love them freely.\u201d Hosea 14:4.\u2014(Prophets and Kings, 83, 84.)",
