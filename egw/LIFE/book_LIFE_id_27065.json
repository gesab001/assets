    "word": "The Minister and His Wife \n     I have been shown some things with reference to _____'s traits of character, and I now feel it to be my duty to write you; for unless changes are made, she will be a draw back to her husband in his work. _____ is naturally selfish. In her home life she has shunned responsibilities, and has been ready to let others perform the duties which devolved upon her. This is a bad experience, and warps the character. She has shunned caretaking, and if this spirit is carried into her married life, it will be a great hindrance to her.",
