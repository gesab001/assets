    "word": "Doctrinal discourses have been preached, and many have listened and have accepted the doctrines who have had little knowledge of the Word of God; for they have not been students of the Bible, and have never felt it their duty to dig deep in the mines of truth; they catch at the surface truths. A much more thorough work should be done. Some system must be adopted so that those who really want to know the truth as it is in Jesus may have an opportunity of becoming students, and that they may seek earnestly for spiritual  knowledge and understanding, and partake of the rich provision of the Master's table. They have labored diligently for the bread that perisheth; let them now put forth an effort for  the heavenly bread, and work with an earnestness befitting the treasure for which they seek. We plead not that the feelings may be stirred, the emotions awakened, but that the \n                                                                           18\nchurch of God may be fed with their portion of meat in due season. The work of our ministers must be of a different order. They must develop in patience, in Christlikeness, that they may teach the people the way of life by precept and  example. The truth is of no value to any one unless it is brought into the inner sanctuary, and sanctifies the soul. Piety will degenerate and religion become a shallow sentimentalism, unless the plowshare of truth is made to go deep into the fallow ground of the heart. When the truth is received, it will work radical changes in life and character; for religion means the abiding of Christ in the heart; and where he is, the soul goes on in spiritual activity, ever growing in grace, ever going on to perfection.",
