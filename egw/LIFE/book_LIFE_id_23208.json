    "word": "Let the Word be your guide, your rule of conduct. It will teach you refined manners, godly conduct, and unerring judgment. Study the Word. When you are in perplexity, search the Word for instruction that is suited to your case. Seek the Lord for guidance. Never entertain that which the Lord forbids in His Word, and that which His Word requires, ever seek to do. \"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\" (John 5:39).",
