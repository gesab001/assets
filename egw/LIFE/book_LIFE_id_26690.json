    "word": "The colored people might have been helped with much better prospects of success years ago than now. The work is now tenfold harder than it would have been then.

Do not, I beseech you, look upon the hard field, groan a little, set two or three at work in one locality, a few in another, and provide them only enough for the bare necessaries of life. Those who labor in the Southern field will have to stand amid the most discouraging, hopeless poverty. . . .",
