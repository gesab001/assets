    "word": "The power of the cross will move in you the mysterious springs of hope and fear, adoration and love. Angels are watching and waiting and will witness to the fact that the world has you not. Jesus has found you sitting at His feet to learn from Him, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Henceforth, surrendering your will to the will of Christ, you are drawn into a region where the cross is the central object. The world fades from your view. The glory shining from the threshold of heaven is the all-attractive influence. The riches of the grace of Christ hold you in willing obedience. You delight in the precious blessings of your allegiance. You are only too glad to impart to others the gift you have received.",
