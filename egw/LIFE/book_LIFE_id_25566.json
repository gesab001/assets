    "word": "There are young men and women and those of middle age who have had experience in the truth, but do not advance in the divine life and increase in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and they do not know the cause. One cause of their lack of spiritual strength, and of their not being full-grown men and women in Christ is, they are not workers with Christ. If they would work for Jesus, their sympathies would be brought in close \n                                                                           14\nunion with Christ, and they would grow in Him their living head, and have a better understanding of the nature of His work and of His sacrifice for man; and would place that estimate upon souls proportionate to the value of the price Christ has paid for man. There are a large number who, if they would come near enough to God by entire consecration, would hear His voice saying, Go labor in My vineyard, and ye shall receive your wages by and by. . . .",
