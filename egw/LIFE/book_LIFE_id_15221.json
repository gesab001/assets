Oh, if Mary were only improving, how glad it would make my heart. The Lord will let His candle shine about you. He will bless and strengthen and support you, in this your time of trial and distress. The Redeemer is pitiful, full of tender sympathy and love. Now is the time to commit the keeping of the soul to God as unto a faithful Creator. What a blessed hope we have--a hope that grows stronger and stronger as trials and afflictions increase. Now show your trust in One who has given His life for you.",
