    "word": "The burden of the dishonor given to God all through our religious experience, presses upon my mind very heavily. His word should be received as the foundation and the finisher of our faith. It is to be received with the understanding and the whole heart; it is life, and is to be incorporated into our very existence. Thus received, the word of God will humble man at the footstool of mercy, and separate him from every corrupting influence.",
