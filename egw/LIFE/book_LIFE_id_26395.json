    "word": "\"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\" (John 5:39). A neglect to feed the hunger of the soul leaves it weak and strengthless, unable to do the will of God. The life of such a one is like the barren fig tree, destitute of fruit. Rely upon no human being for words of comfort. Seek the Lord most earnestly, while you read His rich promises and apply them. Then you will not be consumers but providers.",
