    "word": "Earthly and selfish interests engage the mind, soul, and strength, of God's professed followers. They are, to all intents and purposes, servants of mammon. They have not experienced a crucifixion to the world, with its affections and lusts. I saw that but few among the many who profess to be Christ's followers can say in the language of the apostle, \"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.\" I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.\" If willing obedience and true love characterize the lives of the people of God, their light will shine with a holy brightness to the world.",
