    "word": "Teachers need an intimate acquaintance with the Word of God. The Bible, and the Bible alone, is man's counselor. It is as the leaves of the tree of life. In it every want is met for souls who love its teachings and bring them into their practical lives. Though many students in the school have been baptized, yet many of them are unconverted. As they are not spiritually minded, they know not what it means to be sanctified by a belief of the truth. The Bible is to be searched, and understood. It is our spiritual food which is to be digested and assimilated. It is to be received into the heart, and worked out in the life. If the Word is unconsulted and unappropriated, no man need expect the Spirit of God [to aid him].",
