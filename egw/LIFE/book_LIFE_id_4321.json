    "word": "SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF ELLEN WHITE'S COUNSEL TO WOMEN IN THE WORK OF GOD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THIS VOLUME.  INCLUDED ALSO ARE CHAPTERS ON SELF-RESPECT AND ON BALANCE IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE.  MOST OF THE COUNSEL IN THESE CHAPTERS, THOUGH ORIGINALLY DIRECTED TO MEN, IS EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO WOMEN.  IN TODAY'S HIGH-PRESSURE SOCIETY MANY WOMEN ARE WAGE EARNERS, OFTEN SINGLE MOTHERS TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES.  THE CONTENT OF THESE CHAPTERS WILL GO FAR TOWARD RESTORING AND SUSTAINING A SENSE OF SELF-RESPECT, HELPING WOMEN TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT AND VALUED IN GOD'S SIGHT.",
