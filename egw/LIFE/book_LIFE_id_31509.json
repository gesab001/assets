    "word": "The only way that temptation may be overcome is through watchfulness and prayer. The trial of the faith must come. Satanic agencies are busy, endeavoring to spoil the record of many souls. Those who are neglectful of Bible study, are in danger of disregarding the Testimonies. Those who seem to feel that position and influence places them above temptation, are under a strong delusion of the enemy. In this conference there is a strong temptation to consider that position makes the man. Men placed in positions of responsibility are to honor that position, by a most earnest determination to be like Christ, as He gave us example in His earthly life. His life testified that the strongest of temptations are no excuse for yielding to sin.",
