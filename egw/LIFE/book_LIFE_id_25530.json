    "word": "Love Not the World \n\n     Every worker should diligently search his own heart. The Lord requires that those who \n                                                                           65\nare purchased by the blood of the Son of God should realize that they are God's property, and no longer look upon themselves as their own, and live to serve themselves. Jesus gave His life to save an apostate race, and will those who accept this heavenly gift be selfish, and withhold from the Lord His own? All selfishness, all love of supremacy, originated with Satan. He is the root, and those who partake of his spirit are the branches; but in the day of God both root and branch will be consumed. . . . Can we wonder that the sin of covetousness is so decidedly denounced in the Scripture? \"For this ye know, that no . . . covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom . . . of God.\" Covetousness is idolatry. Shall be as Christians pay no heed to all the warnings of God? Shall we still be in conformity to the world, when it is forbidden in the Word of God? \"Be not conformed to this world.\" \"Let not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\" . . .",
