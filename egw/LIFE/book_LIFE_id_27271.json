    "word": "Under the Lord's guidance, every sphere of action, every position in life, every disappointment, becomes the means of the development of Christian experience. . . . God designs every man to reach the perfection of character revealed in Christ's humanity. . . . The believer becomes imbued with the love, grace, kindness and benevolence that led Jesus to go about doing good. He beholds constantly a loving, tender, compassionate Saviour. The more he beholds Him, the more he longs and prays to be like Him in character.--Letter 173, 1899, pp. 1, 2, 4. (To Peter Wessels, November 4, 1899.)",
