    "word": "\"And the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.\" These words are written of Christ. He is our representative before the Father. Whatsoever was given to Christ--the \"all things\" to supply every need of fallen man-- was given to him as the head and representative of humanity. Who will be the receivers of eternal life? All who before the universe of heaven are adjudged to have in Christ endured the penalty of the law, and in him fulfilled its righteousness. We are to be one in character with Christ. He said, \"The glory (character) which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.\" Mark these words.",
