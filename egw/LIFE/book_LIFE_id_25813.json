    "word": "We may claim the blessed assurance, \"I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions.\" Thy \"sins, which are many, are forgiven.\" O how precious, how refreshing, is the sunlight of God's love! The sinner may look upon his sin-stained life, and say, \"Who is he that condescended? It is Christ that died.\" \"Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.\" Christ, the Restorer, plants a new principle of life in the soul, and that plant grows and produces fruit. The grace of Christ purifies while it pardons, and fits men for a holy heaven. We are to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, until we reach the full stature of men and women in Christ. \n\n\n                     -33-",
