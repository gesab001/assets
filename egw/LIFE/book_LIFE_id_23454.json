Of all the question will be asked, \"Have you diligently studied the Word of God that you might know the will of God, that you might be enabled to understand the difference between sin and righteousness?\" Sad will be the fate of those who would not come to Christ that they might be cleansed from all unrighteousness.

And they see, too, the sinfulness of the sins that have drawn souls away from Christ, and placed them under the banner of rebellion, to war against Him who gave His life for them.",
