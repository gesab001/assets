    "word": "All the light that John received came from that Word which was made flesh and dwelt among men. Christ alone is the true Light, and He is the only source of light and life to sinful men. By creation and by redemption we belong to Him. He came to His own, and they received Him not. The nation that He had chosen to be His peculiar people did not believe in Him. They rejected and crucified Him.",
