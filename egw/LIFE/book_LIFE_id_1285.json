    "word": "Two classes of witnesses are presented in the prophet\u2019s [Malachi\u2019s] words. Of the first class it is written, \u201cYour words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. . . . Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?\u201d These words describe those who ought to have better represented the precious truth, who ought to have been an example to those newly come to the faith. For all who follow Him the Lord has prepared a rich feast of heavenly things. He has ordained that those who follow Him shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. . . . The Lord does not call upon His believing, obedient followers to cover the altar with tears, but to walk cheerfully and happily along. . . .",
