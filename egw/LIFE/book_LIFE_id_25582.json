Where are the men who have means and experience so that they can go forth to these people, and work for them just where they are? There are \n                                                                           55\nmen who can educate them in agricultural lines, who can teach the colored people to sow seed and plant orchards. There are others who can teach them to read, and can give them an object-lesson from their own life and example.
