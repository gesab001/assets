    "word": "The book of Genesis gives quite a definite account of social and individual life, and yet we have no record of an infant's being born blind, deaf, crippled, deformed, or imbecile. There is not an instance upon record of a natural death in infancy, childhood, or early manhood. There is no account of men and women dying of disease. Obituary notices in the book of Genesis run thus: \"And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\" \"And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.\" Concerning others, the record states: He lived to a good old age; and he died. It was so rare for a son to die before the father that such an occurrence was considered worthy of record: \"And Haran died before his father Terah.\" Haran was a father of children before his death.",
