Man's devices and methods are much more in harmony with the natural inclinations; men choose to have some of self and some of Jesus. To accept the entirely new fabric does not give sufficient honor to the natural feelings and sentiments of the human mind. The religion that must reshape the man, transforming the entire character, is very distasteful, and here man's plans and God's plans come into collision.
