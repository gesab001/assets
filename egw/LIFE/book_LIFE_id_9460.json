    "word": "That which will bless humanity is spiritual life. If the man is in harmony with God, he will depend continually upon Him for strength. \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" It is our lifework to be reaching forward to the perfection of Christian character, striving continually for conformity to the will of God. The efforts begun upon earth will continue through eternity. God's standard of man is elevated to the highest meaning of the term, and if he acts up to his God-given manhood he will promote happiness in this life, which will lead to glory and an eternal reward in the life to come.",
