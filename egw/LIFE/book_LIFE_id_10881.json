    "word": "His Heart a Wellspring of Life.--It is often said that Jesus wept, but that He was never known to smile. Our Saviour was indeed a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, for He opened His heart to all the woes of men. But though His life was self-denying and shadowed with pain and care, His spirit was not crushed. His countenance did not wear an expression of grief and repining but ever one of peaceful serenity. His heart was a \n\n184 \n\nwell-spring of life, and wherever He went He carried rest and peace, joy and gladness.--SC 120 (1892).",
