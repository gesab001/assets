    "word": "As soon as Matthew heard the Saviour\u2019s call, immediately he rose up, left all, and followed Him. . . . But those who in the parable are said to receive the word immediately, do not count the cost. They do not consider what the word of God requires of them. They do not bring it face to face with all their habits of life, and yield themselves fully to its control.",
