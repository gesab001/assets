    "word": "You may ask, What is the value of one soul? I will point you to Calvary. The precious Saviour placed an estimate upon man, and He became poor that we may be elevated. With His divine arm He came to lift us up, and this was done by the sacrifice of His own life. He knew that man could not overcome in his own strength, and He left the courts of heaven that we might be reconciled to the Father. Oh, what matchless love! Well may John exclaim, \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" 1 John 3:1. It is sin that caused this great sacrifice to be made, and now God claims from us loyalty, and to walk in the light of His perfect rule and standard in order that we might be brought back to our Eden home. Christ is the true Shepherd and Leader, and if we do not follow Him by doing as He did, then we are none of His.",
