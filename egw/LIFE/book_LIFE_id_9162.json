    "word": "BUT IT IS NOT ALONE IN INCIDENTS OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD HAS BEEN MANIFESTED IN THE LIFE OF MRS. WHITE. TO A DEGREE STILL MORE MARKED IT MAY BE SEEN IN HER EXTENSIVE PUBLIC LABORS. TIMIDLY, AT FIRST, SHE TOOK THE STAND AS A SPEAKER; BUT AS THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD OPENED THE WAY BEFORE HER, SHE HAS HAD CONFIDENCE TO STAND BEFORE THE LARGE AUDIENCES, AND HAS EXCELLED ALL OTHERS OF OUR SPEAKERS IN POWER TO MOVE THE PEOPLE. SHE HAS SPOKEN IN TWENTY-FOUR STATES AND TERRITORIES, BESIDES THE CANADAS. AT OUR CAMP-MEETINGS SHE HAS FREQUENTLY HELD CROWDS OF \n325\nPEOPLE, IN NUMBERS RANGING FROM FIVE TO TWENTY THOUSAND. HER VOICE, WHICH WAS IMPERFECT IN HER EARLIER DAYS OF FEEBLENESS, HAS BECOME CLEAR AND POWERFUL, AND HER ARTICULATION IS SO DISTINCT THAT ACRES OF PEOPLE CAN HEAR HER OUT-DOOR ADDRESSES AS EASILY AS IF SEATED IN A CHURCH.
