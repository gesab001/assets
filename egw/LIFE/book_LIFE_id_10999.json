    "word": "The Foolish Rich Man's Selfish Aimlessness.--This man's aims were no higher than those of the beasts that perish. He lived as if there were no God, no heaven, no future life; as if everything he possessed were his own and he owed nothing to God or man. The psalmist described this rich man when he wrote. \"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.\"--COL 257, 258 (1900).",
