    "word": "Our hard hearts need to be broken. We need to come together in perfect unity, and we need to realize that we are the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Let each one say: \"He gave His life for me, and He wants me, as I go through this world, to reveal the love that He revealed in giving Himself for me.\" Christ bore our sins in His own body on the cross, that God might be just and yet the justifier of those who believe in Him. There is life, eternal life, for all who will surrender to Christ.  9T 191-193536",
