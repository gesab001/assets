    "word": "\"Light is sown for the righteous, and truth for the upright in heart.\" There is altogether too little searching, with painstaking effort, for the truth as for hidden treasure. With hearts softened and subdued by the grace of God, the conscience quickened by habitual prayer and searching of the Scriptures, the whole soul may become familiar with heavenly truth. Such will stand firmly for the right because it is right. Pure and undefiled religion will be interwoven with the life-practice. They will honor God, and God will honor them.",
