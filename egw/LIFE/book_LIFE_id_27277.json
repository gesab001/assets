    "word": "MR No. 453 - Mrs. S. M. I. Henry and the W.T.C.U.\n\n     I would be very much pleased could I be seated by your side and converse with you in regard to the incidents of our experience. I have an earnest desire to meet you. It is not impossible that, even in this life, we shall see each other face to face. When I learn of the gracious dealings of God with you, I feel very grateful to my heavenly Father that the light of the truth for this time is shining into the chambers of your mind and into the soul temple. Across the broad waters of the Pacific, we can clasp hands in faith and sweet fellowship. I rejoice with you in every opportunity you have of reaching the people. I praise the Lord that he has wrought for you, that the Great Physician who has never lost a case, has healed you, and given you access to the people, that you may set before many your experience of the loving kindness of a gracious Redeemer.--Letter 9, 1898, p. 1. (To Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, Jan. 2, 1898.)",
