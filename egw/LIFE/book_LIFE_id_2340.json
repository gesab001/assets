    "word": "Sinners Converted\nWhen a sinner becomes sensible of the fact that only through Christ can he gain eternal life; when he realizes that obedience to God's Word is the\n69\ncondition of entrance into the kingdom of God; when he sees Christ as the propitiation for sin, he comes to the Saviour in humility and contrition, confessing his sins and seeking forgiveness. His soul is impressed with a sense of the majesty and glory of God. The blessedness of an eternal life of peace and joy and purity is felt so deeply that an entire surrender is made.",
