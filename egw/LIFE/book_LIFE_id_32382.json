WHITE. \n\n                   (\"REVIEW AND HERALD\", MARCH 11.) \n\n\n     DURING THE PAST FEW MONTHS MOTHER'S GENERAL CONDITION OF HEALTH HAS BEEN AS FAVORABLE AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF ONE OF HER AGE. SHE HAS STATED THAT AT NO OTHER PERIOD OF HER LIFE HAS SHE BEEN SO FREE FROM PHYSICAL PAIN. AND WHILE SHE HAS GRADUALLY BECOME MORE FEEBLE, YET SHE HAD NOT, PRIOR TO HER RECENT ACCIDENT, BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEND A DAY IN BED. SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GO UP AND DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT ASSISTANCE, AND IN FAVORABLE WEATHER, HAS TAKEN PLEASURE IN RIDING OUT ONCE A DAY, AND SOMETIMES TWICE.",
