    "word": "Skimming the Surface \n\n     Every teacher in the school should feel that he is a missionary for God. He must improve his moments and his ability to obtain a knowledge of the word of God, that he may impart the same to his scholars. Teachers will become disqualified for their position if they are not learners. They need freshness of ideas, fresh, wise plans, life, tact, and spirit in their work. They must be apt to teach.",
