    "word": "The divine antidote for the sin of the whole world is contained in the gospel of St. John. There is found a recipe for all the maladies of the soul. \"Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood,\" Christ declares, \"hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" He may die, as Christ died, but the life of the Saviour is in him; his life is hid with Christ in God. \"I am come that they might have life,\" Jesus said, \"and that they might have it more abundantly.\" Again He said, \"Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life\" [John 4:14]. \"This spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive\" [John 7:39]. Christ carries on the great process by which believers become one with Him in this present life and are one with Him in life eternal.",
