    "word": "I have a deep interest for your soul, but I dare not withhold the truth from you. You might have been much farther advanced than you are now in genuine religious experience. Angels of God are looking upon the most secret actions of your life. I tell you in the fear of God, you are not a Christian. To be a Christian is to be Christlike. You are not practicing truth. You are not open; you are not frank. You are not exerting a correct influence. You are not pure in thought or in actions.",
