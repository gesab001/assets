    "word": "Oh, let us work today, while we still have opportunity! Let us strive to bring souls into the light of truth, by opening to them the Scriptures, and by praying with them, and urging them to accept Jesus as their Saviour. And as you engage in this work, Jesus is your Helper, even the same Jesus that has passed over the road before us, and has given his life in our behalf. If we make sacrifices on the right hand and on the left; if we seek to be laborers together with God,--without whom we can do nothing aright,--we shall at last have the life that measures with the everlasting life of God--no prospect of falling, no Satan to tempt and lead astray, no death. I long to see families engaged in soul-winning--seeking to let their light shine amid the moral darkness of the world. May God help us, is my prayer. \n\n\n                    -18-",
