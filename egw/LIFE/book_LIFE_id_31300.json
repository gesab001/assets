    "word": "When the crisis has passed, and success is apparent, be the patient a believer or an unbeliever, let a few moments be spent with him in prayer.

Words of gratitude may flow from the patient to the physician: for through God he has bound his life up with his own: but let the praise and thankfulness be given to God, as to One who is present, though invisible. \n\n\n                                   - 52 -",
