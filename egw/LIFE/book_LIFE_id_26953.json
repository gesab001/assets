    "word": "It should be our highest aim in life to get ready for heaven. Sanctification is not the work of a moment, but of a lifetime. The sinner must repent of his sin, and come to Jesus for pardon. The promise is, \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" \"We know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him is no sin.\" \"Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not.\" Many are deceived on this point. Their minds are confused, and they do not know what sin is. But they can know, by studying the word of God.",
