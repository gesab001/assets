    "word": "Have you a tradition that has come down through the ages? Have you such a tradition? Will the baptism sanctify it and make it whole, that by observing it you may save your soul from death? Will it do it? No, decidedly not. Christ says, \"I am the true witness. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\" (See Revelation 1:8.) \"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of \n\n\n                                       -232- \n\nlife, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" (Revelation 22:14). I want to be there. I want to see the King in His beauty. The King that died a victim on Calvary's cross for me, that I should not be found, when he comes in power and great glory to be admired of all them that believe, under the bondage of sin.",
