She encourages the work to go on.\nOctober 30, 1906\n     I felt great sadness of heart on hearing that one of the Huntsville School buildings had been consumed by fire. I am so sorry that one life was lost. We must now do our very best to make the needed improvements at the school. I am not favorably impressed by what you say about all the buildings that are to be erected being small. We must not let the work at Huntsville flag, or be brought down to small dimensions. There is need of buildings, and there is need of larger buildings, but these must not be extravagantly large, for the work in other places in the South must be considered.",
