    "word": "Sunnyside, Cooranbong, Monday, Jan. 1, 1900. 1899 has passed into eternity with its burden of record, sealed up, to be opened when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened. \"And I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and \n\n\n                                    -168- \n\nthere was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works\" [Revelation 20:11, 12].",
