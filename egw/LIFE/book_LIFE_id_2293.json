    "word": "145\n     Parents should in a special sense regard themselves as agents of God to instruct their children, as did Abraham, to keep the way of the Lord. They need to search the Scriptures diligently, to know what is the way of the Lord, that they may teach it to their household. Micah says, \u201cWhat doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\u201d [Micah 6:8.] In order to be teachers, parents must be learners, gathering light constantly from the oracles of God, and by precept and example bringing this precious light into the education of their children. Teach them that principle should govern their eating, their drinking, and their dressing. Teach them from their very babyhood that God's law is the rule of the house, and that it must be obeyed in all the relations of life; that a disregard of moral law will exist wherever there is a willful disregard of physical law.",
