THIS SELFISH, GRASPING SPIRIT WAS MANIFEST ALSO IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO BRING THE CONTROL OF THE PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING ASSOCIATION UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION. THIS INJUSTICE AND THIRST FOR POWER WAS SUCH A DENIAL OF THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT IT CALLED FORTH FROM ELLEN WHITE SOME OF HER MOST SCATHING REBUKES.] was entirely contrary to the principles upon which the office of publication was first established; and it has already resulted in keeping from the cause of God in its various branches thousands of dollars. Many who pay tithes and make offerings do so by practicing self-denial, and when they know that the managers of the office receive so large wages for their work, they have little confidence in them as men whom God has chosen, since they are not imbued with the self-sacrificing spirit of Christ. He gave His life that He might save souls, and the people are losing confidence in the managers of the office.--Lt 5, 1892.",
