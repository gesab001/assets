I then \n     saw the word of God pure and unadulterated, and that we must \n     answer for the way we received the truth proclaimed from that \n     word. I saw that it had been a hammer to break the flinty \n     heart in pieces, and a fire to consume the dross and tin, that \n     the heart might be pure and holy. I saw that the Apocrypha was \n     the hidden book, and that the wise of these last days should \n     understand it. I saw that the Bible was the standard book, that \n     will judge us at the last day. I saw that heaven would be cheap \n     enough, and that nothing was too dear to sacrifice for Jesus, \n     and that we must give all to enter the kingdom.\"--Manuscript 4, \n     1850, (A copy of E.
