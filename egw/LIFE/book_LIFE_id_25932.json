    "word": "Said Christ to the angry, accusing Pharisees, \"He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.\" Were those sinless who were so ready to accuse and condemn Bro. Bell? Were their characters and lives to be searched as closely and publicly as they have searched Bro. Bell's, some of them would appear far worse than they have tried to represent him. I hope I may not be compelled to make public the past course of students, teachers, ministers and church members, to publish the mistakes and sins of the past and present life of those who sat in judgment upon his case. I wish you all to understand, I here wash my hands of your cruel work.",
