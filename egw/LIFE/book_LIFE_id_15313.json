    "word": "It is the duty of every married couple to studiously avoid marring the feelings of each other. They should control every look, and expression of fretfulness, and passion. They should study each others' happiness, in small matters, as well as in large, manifesting a tender thoughtfulness, in acknowledging kind acts, and the little courtesies of each other. These small things should not be neglected, for they are just as important to the happiness of man and wife, as food is necessary to sustain physical strength. The father should encourage the wife and mother to lean upon his large affections. Kind, cheerful, encouraging words from him, with whom she has entrusted her life-happiness, will be more beneficial to her than any medicine; and the cheerful rays of light, such sympathising words will bring to the heart of the wife and mother, will reflect back their own cheering beams upon the heart of the father.",
