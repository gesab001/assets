    "word": "The Burning of the Sanitarium. \n\n                  St. Helena, Cal., Feb. 20, 1902. \n\n     Today we received the sad news of the burning of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. For many weeks I have had a heartache that has made my nights very restless. I would at this time speak words of wisdom, but what can I say? We are afflicted with those whose life interests are bound up in this institution. Let us pray that this calamity shall work together for good to these, who must feel it very deeply. We can indeed weep with those that weep.",
