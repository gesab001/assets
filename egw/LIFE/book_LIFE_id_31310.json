    "word": "In obedience to the commandments of God the soul will receive the best of everything. Every blessing may be enjoyed with the favor of God when heart, mind, and life are consecrated to His service. If men would accept Christ, and see the binding claims of the law of God, they would not take a neutral position, but would stand out in full confidence, and say, The Lord is my helper. He is the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent is the supreme and everlasting Good. Thus they would secure for themselves the grand promises of God.",
