    "word": "We are to be consecrated channels, through which the heavenly life is to flow to others. The Holy Spirit is to animate and pervade the whole church, purifying and cementing hearts. Those who have been buried with Christ in baptism are to rise to newness of life, giving a living representation of the life of Christ. . . . You are dedicated to the work of making known the gospel of salvation. Heaven's perfection is to be your power.",
