    "word": "My brethren in the ministry, open your doors to young men who are exposed to temptation. Come near to them by personal effort. Evil invites them on every hand. Seek to interest them in that which will help them to live the higher life. Do not hold yourself aloof from them. Bring them to your fireside; invite them to join you around the family altar. Let us remember the claim of God upon us to make the path to heaven bright and attractive. \n\n                                               -",
