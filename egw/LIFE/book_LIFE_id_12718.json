    "word": "What fullness is expressed in the words, \"I am the light of the world.\" John 8:12. \"I am the bread of life.\" John 6:35. \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\" John 14:6. \"I am the good shepherd.\" John 10:14. \"I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" John 10:10. This life is what we must have, and we must have it more abundantly. God will breathe this life into every soul that dies to self and lives to Christ. But entire self-renunciation is required. Unless this takes place, we carry with us the evil that destroys our happiness. But when self is crucified, Christ lives in us, and the power of the Spirit attends our efforts.",
