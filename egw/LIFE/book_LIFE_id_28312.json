    "word": "Christ declares, \"No man can come to Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto Me\" [John 6:44, 45]. Christ is the Center of all true doctrine. All true religion is found in His Word and in nature. He is the One in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered, and the teacher who learns from Him finds a safe anchorage.",
