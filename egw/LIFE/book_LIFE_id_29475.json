    "word": "Many who have had the truth kept before them continually do not appreciate the Word. They do not regard it as the bread of life, upon which they are to feed day by day. They need the work of grace in their hearts represented in the words, \"Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures\" [Luke 24:45]. The heart must be opened, softened, subdued. Idols that have been cherished must be dethroned. Through their perceptive powers men must take hold of the Word, and appropriate the same to their spiritual necessities, eating of the bread of life, and drinking of the waters of salvation. Then they will grow spiritually. In its development, the truth will give evidence of constant expansion and new developments.",
