    "word": "Provoked by the unbelief of the children of Israel, Moses uttered a hasty, presumptuous speech; and the Lord told him that he had dishonored His name, and that he could not lead the children of Israel into the promised land. Moses repented, and the Lord forgave him; nevertheless, he must bear his punishment. My brother, the Lord would have you learn from Moses' experience how He regards the hard, hasty, condemnatory spirit you have so often manifested. Throughout your entire lifetime, your inclination to condemn hastily and harshly has been your sin. You have felt inclined to break out on our ministers because they did not come up to the mark on health reform. Your spirit has been such as to make the Lord ashamed of you. In your words and actions there has been that which Christ will in no wise endorse. You have assumed an authority, a rulership, that God has not given you. How can you reform others until you yourself are reformed. No man is prepared to correct the faults of others until he has corrected his own faults. You need to be converted, to be born again, before you can co-operate with the Lord Jesus.",
