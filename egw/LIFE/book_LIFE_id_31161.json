    "word": "I entreat of you, A.R. Henry, to break the power of Satan. No longer be fastened a slave to his chariot wheels. God's power alone can break this chain, break the fetters of Satan. Heaven is worth everything to you. Then break with Satan. Flee to Christ before it is everlastingly too late. A few more steps in the path you are pursuing will place you where light and truth will have no power over you. I send you this, for my soul has been wrestling in agony in regard to your case. I want you to be saved. I want you to have life, that life that measures with the life of God. I want to see you a victor. I want to see you an overcomer. Will you be this? Pursue the course you have entered upon, and you will divorce your soul from God; and then what?",
