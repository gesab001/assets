    "word": "Because the world is disloyal, because it refuses to walk in the way of life, shall those who claim to be the chosen of God become careless and regardless of His Word, turning to the right hand or to the left according to their own pleasure? I am charged to say that there is need of a reformation in every church, in every family. We have no time to devote to pleasure-loving, no means to invest in buying the pictures of human faces. Invest your means in the cause of God. Guard carefully your example. It is of the greatest consequence to every soul to love and fear God, to obey His commands. We all need to become better acquainted with the laws of God's Kingdom, lest we lose our eternal life insurance policy [2 Peter 1:10-12] and fail to find entrance into the city of God.",
