    "word": "Brother and Sister Byron Belden called to see me, and we had a season of prayer. In my suffering, the Lord is sacredly near to me. It seems that I can endure the seeing of Him who is invisible. During these long, wakeful nights, I have precious seasons of communion with my Saviour. I seem to look upon His face, full of tenderness and compassion. These words are impressed on my mind: \"Then said Jesus unto His disciples, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it\" (Matthew 16:24, 25).",
