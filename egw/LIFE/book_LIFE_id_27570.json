    "word": "We have decided to have the printers go on my book and not transport these books across the plains again. Part of the book is here already printed. We shall not have them stereotyped, because we shall not wait to have matters of my book so very, very exact, but get out this first edition and get it in market.

But we have all used our best judgment and think we had better remain here till December and complete this edition. . . .",
