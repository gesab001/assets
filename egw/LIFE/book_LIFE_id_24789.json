    "word": "Those with whom the Christian comes in contact have a right to know what has been revealed to the follower of Christ, and he is to make it known both by precept and example. The Christian is to publish the good news of salvation, and he is never to be weary of the recital of God's goodness. \n                                                                           11\nHe is continually to draw with Christ, and continually to draw from Christ, eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of Man, which Jesus declares are His words. They are spirit, and they are life. Thus he will always have a fresh supply of heavenly manna. Every Christian, high or low, rich or poor, learned or ignorant, is to talk of the kingdom of God, to speak of Christ and Him crucified, to those who are in ignorance and sin. You are to speak to sinners; for you know not but God is moving upon their hearts. Never forget that great responsibility attaches to every word you utter in their presence. Ask yourself the question, How many have I spoken to with my heart filled with the love of Christ, concerning the unspeakable gift of God's mercy and Christ's righteousness? To how many of your friends, relatives, and neighbors, have you written, reaching out in unselfish love, that their souls may be saved? Christ said, \"I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it.\"",
