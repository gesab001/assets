    "word": "He who would have spiritual life and vigor must eat the flesh and drink of the blood of the Son of God. Christ declares, \"I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.\" \"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me\" (John 6:35, 54-57).",
