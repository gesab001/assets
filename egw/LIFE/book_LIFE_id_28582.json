    "word": "MR No. 1174 - The Motive Determines the Quality of the Act\n\n     The daily life of the Christian should bring no discredit upon our holy faith. The motive of the heart, as well as the words and actions, is weighed in estimating our moral worth. Those who rejected Christ, the Lord of glory, knew not that He was the Prince of life, else they would not have crucified Him.",
