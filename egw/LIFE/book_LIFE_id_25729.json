    "word": "Daniel's Temperate Course a Lesson. \n\n     The case of Daniel is an instructive one.  Daniel was taught by God, and he co-operated with God. He exercised all his powers to work out his own salvation, and God worked in him to will and to do according to his good pleasure.  Of Daniel and his companions it is written: \"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.\"  These youth were sincere, faithful Christians.  True education must be all-sided, not one-sided.  Such an education Daniel and his fellows were determined to have. They sought to acquire knowledge for a purpose,--to honor and glorify God. They must perfect a Christian character, and have a clear intellect, in order to stand as the representatives of the true religion amid the false religions of heathenism.  To them the will of God was the supreme law of life. They practised temperance in eating and drinking, that they might not enfeeble brain or muscle.  In order to preserve health, they felt that they must avoid the luxuries of the king's table, and they would not partake of wine or any stimulating drink.  Under God they were in perfect training, that all their faculties \n\n\n                     -53- \n\nmight do highest service for him.  God required these youth to keep themselves from idols.",
