    "word": "I ask you to consider these things as you have never yet considered them. I present before you Christ as your only hope. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, \n\n\n              -317- \n\nbut have everlasting life.\" I present Christ's character before you. Study it carefully. There is no higher education to be gained than that which you gather from the Word of God. Those who will may gain from it an intelligence and an understanding that is as enduring and as reliable as that which Daniel had, and which preserved him and carried him safely through test and trial. Christ will give judgment to the student of His Word today, as He gave the Hebrew youth judgment. These young men were found to have more wisdom than all the wise men in all the realm of Babylon.",
