    "word": "Put God's Cause Above All Interests. [A STUDY OF THE LIFE AND WORK OF JAMES AND ELLEN WHITE IN THE PIONEER DAYS OF THE CHURCH PROVIDES A CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF UNRESERVED DEVOTION TO GOD'S SERVICE. THEIR TWO SURVIVING SONS, EDSON AND WILLIAM, WERE ALSO THE OBJECTS OF THEIR ATTENTION AND CARE, THOUGH THE WHITES WERE REQUIRED TO LEAVE THEM AT TIMES IN THE CARE OF OTHERS. BOTH BOYS BECAME MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL. WHEN JAMES AND ELLEN WERE SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDS OF THE CAUSE, THEY COMFORTED THEMSELVES WITH THOUGHTS OF FELLOWSHIP TOGETHER AGAIN AT THE JOURNEY'S END.]--No earthly ties, no earthly considerations, should weigh one moment in the scale against duty to the cause and work of God. Jesus severed His connection from everything to save a lost world, and He requires of us a full and entire consecration. \n\n90 \n\nThere are sacrifices to be made for the interests of God's cause. The sacrifice of feeling is the most keen that is required of us; yet after all it is a small sacrifice. You have plenty of friends, and if the feelings are only sanctified, you need not feel that you are making a very great sacrifice. You do not leave your wife among heathen. You are not called to tread the burning African desert or to face prisons and encounter trial at every step. Be careful how you appeal to your sympathies and let human feelings and personal considerations mingle with your efforts and labors for the cause of God. He demands unselfish and willing service. You can render this and yet do all your duties to your family; but hold this as a secondary matter.--3T 500.",
