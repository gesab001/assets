    "word": "How much more is needed! How much wise, well-planned efforts to send the truth by publications and the living preacher! Many, we are happy to say, are doing much, opening new fields and broadening the work everywhere. But there are many ways in which we can personally do much more than we have done, by practicing self-denial, living not to please ourselves. Every soul who has accepted this truth should make personal efforts for the salvation of friends and relatives and neighbors. Individual cases should be presented as subjects of our prayers, to our heavenly Father. Let us imitate the life of Christ.--Letter 42a, 1893, pp. 1, 2. (To S. N. Haskell, undated.)",
