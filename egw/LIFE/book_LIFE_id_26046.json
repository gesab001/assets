    "word": "The reliance upon worldlings to provide amusements, as they have done, has been productive of greater evils than many suspect. The Sanitarium can afford to dispense with the patronage of those who depend upon this class of amusements for happiness, and who will not be content without them. The managers of the Sanitarium may as well come to the conclusion at once that they will never be able to satisfy that class of minds that can find happiness only in something new and exciting. To many persons this has been the intellectual diet during their life-time; and there are mental as well as physical dyspeptics. Many are suffering from maladies of the soul far more than from diseases of the body, and they will find no relief until they shall come to Christ, the well-spring of life. Complaints of weariness, loneliness, and dissatisfaction will then cease. Satisfying joys will give vigor to the mind, and health and vital energy to the body.",
