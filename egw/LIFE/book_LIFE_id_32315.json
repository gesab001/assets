    "word": "\"Ye are the children of the light and of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.\" Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. The trouble with us is that we do not press on in the way illuminated by the Sun of Righteousness. In order to walk in this way, we must receive strength from the Life-giver. As we move \n\n\n                                    -340- \n\nforward in obedience to Christ's commands, His light shines on our way, and his strength sustains us. Thus we go forward from strength to strength, from grace to grace, by obedience becoming more and more Christlike.",
