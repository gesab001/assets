    "word": "Precious, precious words! Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, which has preserving qualities. Let the believers be sober, and watch unto prayer, and in everything represent Christ, that in the Judgment they may meet the souls with whom they have been associated, and say, I have done for these souls all that I could do. The love of Christ dwelling in the heart will be revealed in the spirit and temper. The heavenly, sanctifying power can be indeed a savor of life unto life, quelling every tumultuous passion, and winning souls to Christ.",
