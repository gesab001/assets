In response, between thirty-five and forty arose to their feet, ten or twelve of whom were women. We then invited those to rise who had been told by physicians that it would be fatal for them to stop the use of tobacco, because they had become so accustomed to its false stimulus that they would not be able to live without it. In reply, eight persons, whose countenances indicated health of mind and body, arose to their feet. How wonderful is the sanctifying influence which this truth has upon the human life, making staunch temperance men of those who have indulged in tobacco, wine, and other fashionable dissipation.",
