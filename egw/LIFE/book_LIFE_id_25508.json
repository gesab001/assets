    "word": "The life of Paul was a success. The influence and work of Paul, the grand reformer, can never perish; they are immortalized. His Christian character shines forth with the brightness of the firmament. The whole Christian life of Paul was a preparation for the future, immortal life. In the dark dungeon, a prisoner for God, he looked over his life with satisfaction, and knowing that he had not been playing a losing game, he exclaims, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.\" Then fixing his eye upon the things that are unseen, the immortal future, which had been the inspiring motive of his Christian life, in confident assurance he exclaims: \"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.\"",
