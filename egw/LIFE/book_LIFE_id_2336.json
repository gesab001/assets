God has promised that His grace shall be sufficient for everyone who will come unto Him. Those who surrender to Jesus, who open the door of the heart and invite Him in, will be in safekeeping. He\n63\nsays, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life.\u201d John 14:6. Possessing Jesus, they will possess truth. They will be complete in Him.",
