    "word": "A hand was laid upon the hand of Dr. Kellogg and upon the hand of W. K. Kellogg, and the Saviour said: \"I have not been unmindful of your struggles; but ye would not come unto Me that ye might have life. Take My yoke upon you, and unite with your brethren, all of whom need to wear My yoke. Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For \n                                                                           33\nMy yoke is easy, and My burden is light. Ye were sometimes in darkness, because you did not wear My yoke. If you will wear My yoke and learn of Me, you will henceforth reveal My meekness and lowliness. Ye were sometimes darkness, but henceforth you are to be children of the light. If you will keep hold of My strength, you will be all light in the Lord. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.\"",
