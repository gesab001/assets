    "word": "To the [Pacific Press] workers in Mountain View I am bidden to say: Let everyone stand clear from the impenitence that brought destruction upon San Francisco. Be faithful in ridding your individual self of all the sins that marked the inhabitants of that doomed city. You need not try to forget that the judgments of God will soon fall upon all that are ungodly. None will then have the opportunity that you now have of gaining a preparation for the future, immortal life.--MS 85, 1906.",
