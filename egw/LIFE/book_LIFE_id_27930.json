    "word": "Monday, March 3, 1873--We have had a beautiful day. We have had no hindrance on account of snow. We passed through many snow sheds. I conversed with a young man who is dying with consumption. He is an infidel I \n\n\n                                  -121- \n\ncannot reach. He says when he dies it is the last of him. He has led a dissolute life and dies as the beast dieth. It made the Christian life look so bright in contrast with the gloomy prospects of this poor sinner who could not comfort himself with any bright picture when he should live again. His brightest hope is in no existence beyond the grave. I gave him lemons and tried to make him as comfortable as possible, but sad, sad is the thought of this man's future. A just God he must meet.",
