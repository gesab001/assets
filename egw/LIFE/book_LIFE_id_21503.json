    "word": "All the rounds of ceremony can never fit the human family for membership in the family of heaven. We must submit to the moulding, fashioning hand of God. The lethargy of Satan is as a funeral pall upon the people. Insensibility has first to be met, and dealt with. The torpor of death must be penetrated. People are dead in trespasses and sins, and they need awakening by the power of God. We must preach Christ and His love to fallen man, in that he took human nature, and suffered the ill-treatment of men professing godliness. His life was a life of constant self-sacrifice. He was hated, despised, and crucified upon the cross. It was the Commander of heaven that thus suffered. But \u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d If God gave His Son to atone for sin, sin must be a tremendous evil, grievous in the sight of God, and ruinous to man.",
