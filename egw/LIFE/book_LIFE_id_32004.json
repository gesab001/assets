    "word": "There is a spirit of worldly policy coming into the council and board meetings; a critical spirit in which personal feelings mold in a greater of less degree, decisions that are being made. A hard, unsympathetic spirit is ruling out the spirit of kindness, compassion, and love. Those who compose our councils need to sit daily at the feet of Christ, learning in his school to be meek and lowly of heart. They are not prepared to deal justly, to love mercy, and to exhibit that true courtesy which characterized the life of Christ, unless they see the necessity of yoking up with Christ and bearing the burdens of his cause. The love of Christ must be incorporated into the work of the several departments in the office, not only to do justice to the work, but to the workers also.",
