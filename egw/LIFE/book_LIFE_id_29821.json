    "word": "The heavenly Father loves His sons and daughters. He wishes all to know Him. It is because men are not more than half converted that the church is so dead and lifeless. There are many who are and have been all their lives half Christians. Their names are in the Book of Life, and if they turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, they then respect the voice that says unto them, \"Seek ye My face,\" and reply, \"Thy face, Lord, will I seek,\" and they shall see God with a clear, elevated, spiritual sense. The religious sentiment awakened in the heart is recognized as God's call, and is obeyed.",
