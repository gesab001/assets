    "word": "We are nothing, but Christ is all and in all. We may unite our ignorance to His wisdom, our weakness to His strength, our imperfections to His merits, our frailty to His enduring might. Oh, yes, He is our all. Upon His merits we may rely and through His merits we may have access to our heavenly Father and thus be closely connected with heaven. Oh, how I long for deeper and higher attainments in the divine life. My soul hungers and thirsts for righteousness. I love Jesus, but our love is too faint and too inconsistent.",
