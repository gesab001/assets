    "word": "In every important work, there are times of crisis, when there is great need that those connected with the work should have clear minds.

All our habits, tastes, and inclinations must be educated in harmony with the laws of life and health. By this means we may secure the very best physical condition, and have mental clearness to discern between the evil and the good.",
