    "word": "W. is a conscientious young man; but he has not taken hold of life aright. He has risen above the simplicity of the work. He has thought that there was some great work for him to do, above the common duties of life, and he is in a fair way of overlooking the duties that lie directly before him. In obtaining an education, many young men are ruined, because they do not take hold of the matter aright. \n                                                                           33\nWork and study, at intervals, would have been better for him. The trials and difficulties of a life of toil are a great advantage to the young in developing physical and mental strength. Physical and mental powers should both be exercised, for both were designed for use.",
