    "word": "Last night I again spoke to the people. This was my text--the words of Christ to the twelve, \"Will ye also go away?\" Peter answered, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life\" (See John 6:67, 68). I had perfect freedom. I never felt more sensibly the especial help from God than while speaking. The people sat as if spellbound, wide awake, although the meeting did not close till after nine o'clock. The Spirit of God was upon me.--Letter 18, 1876, pp. 1,2. (To James White, April, 1876.)",
