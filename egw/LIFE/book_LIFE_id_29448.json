    "word": "My brethren and sisters, study the prayer Christ taught His disciples. If we would but bring His Spirit and life into the church, we should exert an influence that would move the world. Where are the sowers and the reapers, to sow the seed and gather in the harvest? \"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.\" Yes, pray most earnestly that the Lord will send forth more laborers into His harvest. To the indolent and indifferent comes the inquiry, \"Why stand ye here all the day idle? Work while the day lasts; for the night cometh in which no man can work.\" The night is stealing on us. Soon it will be here. Soon the doors now thrown open for the entrance of truth will be closed. Now is the time for the Lord's people to return to Him His own in gifts and offerings and in willing, earnest service.",
