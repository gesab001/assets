    "word": "Pride should not be felt in the forms or mechanical workings of the school, but in the good that is accomplished in bringing souls to Jesus Christ. Machines may be made to respond to the will of man, working with perfect exactitude, but they are destitute of souls. So with schools where formality takes a leading place; it is as marble without life. When all connected with the school have a sense of the responsibility of their work, and feel that they are making efforts, not only for time, but for eternity, order and harmony will be seen in every department.\u2014S.S.W., October, 1895.",
