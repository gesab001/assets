    "word": "One who bears the heavy responsibilities of the physician needs the prayers of the gospel minister, and he should be linked, soul, body and mind, with the truth of God. Then he can speak a word in season to the afflicted. He can watch for souls as one who must give an account. He can present Christ as the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The Scriptures come clearly to his mind, and he speaks as one who knows the value of the souls with whom he is dealing.",
