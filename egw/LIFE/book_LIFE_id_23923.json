    "word": "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\" (Matthew 6:10). The whole life of Christ upon earth was lived for the purpose of manifesting the will of God on earth as it is in heaven. Said Christ, \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. . . . Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit\" (John 3:3-6).",
