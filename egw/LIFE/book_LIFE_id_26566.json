    "word": "Here in this text we have our duty defined. In answer to the young man's question, \"What ... shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\" Christ directed him to the commandments. If they were obeyed strictly to the letter then he would receive the precious boon desired--eternal life. The young man had supposed that he was a commandment keeper, being deceived in himself. Christ knew just where the young man failed, and He touched the plague spot of his life--his great possessions. These stood in the way of his loving God with his whole heart. He was not ready to follow his Master in self-denial, and in this he showed his weakness. He was not a true lover of God. There are many like the young man. When their duty is pointed out to them in keeping the Sabbath, they will be sorrowful because they are not willing to lift the cross.",
