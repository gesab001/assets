    "word": "And now I take up my life-work alone. I thank my Saviour I have two sons he has given me to stand by my side. Henceforth the mother must lean upon the children; for the strong, brave, noble-hearted husband is at rest. The turmoil with him is over. How long I shall fight the battles of life alone I cannot say; but there is one thing that I will say to you, and that is, that when I saw my husband breathe his last, I felt that Jesus was more precious to me then than he ever had been in any previous hour of my life. When I stood by my firstborn, and closed his eyes in death, I could say, \"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\" And I felt then that I had a Comforter in Jesus Christ. And when my little one was torn from my arms, and I could no longer see its little head upon the pillow by my side, then I could say, \"The Lord gave and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\" \n                                                                           42\nAnd now he upon whose large affections I have leaned, with whom I have labored,--and we have been united in labor for thirty-six years,--is taken away; but I can lay my hands upon his eyes and say, I commit my treasure to Thee until the morning of the resurrection.",
