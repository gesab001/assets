    "word": "God is love. Like rays of light from the sun, love and light and joy flow out from Him to all His creatures. It is His nature to give. His very life is the outflow of unselfish love. \n\n\n     \"His glory is His children's good; \n      His joy, His tender Fatherhood.\" \n\nHe tells us to be perfect as He is, in the same manner. We are to be centers of light and blessing to our little circle, even as He is to the universe. We have nothing of ourselves, but the light of His love shines upon us, and we are to reflect its brightness. \"In His borrowed goodness good,\" we may be perfect in our sphere, even as God is perfect in His.",
