    "word": "57\nUNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE OF PRAYER.\u2014Prayer and faith are closely allied, and they need to be studied together. In the prayer of faith there is a divine science; it is a science that everyone who would make his lifework a success must understand. Christ says, \u201cWhat things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\u201d Mark 11:24. He makes it plain that our asking must be according to God\u2019s will; we must ask for the things that He has promised, and whatever we receive must be used in doing His will. The conditions met, the promise is unequivocal.",
