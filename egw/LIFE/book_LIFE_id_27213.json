    "word": "Children Should be Taught to Make Sacrificial Offerings: \n     Children, remember that you are the Lord's property. Jesus gave His life that you might be saved. See how much you can do for Him. First give Him your hearts. Accept Him as your personal Saviour, and consecrate yourselves to Him as His children. The most highly-valued treasure which you can give the Lord is the heart. Present to Him a New Year's Offering by giving Him yourself. \"Ye are not your own: for ye have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.\"",
