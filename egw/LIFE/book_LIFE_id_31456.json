There is a matter that should be clearly understood by all. Every soul who claims to be a Christian is to bear the responsibility of keeping himself in harmony with the guidance of the word of God. God holds each soul accountable for following for himself the pattern given in the life of Christ, and of having a character that is cleansed and sanctified.",
