    "word": "Letter 6, 1898, p. 2. (To Emily Campbell, January 12, 1898.) --The amount of writing that I have been compelled to do has been greater than at any former period of my life. Maggie Hare and Minnie Hawkins are doing good work. I feel so thankful that Fannie is not with me. She does not know what manner of spirit she is of, and I do not think she ever will; for she is deluded by the enemy in regard to her own talents. If she would be converted and remain transformed in character, no one would be more happy than I. But even then I would say to her, Remain in America. Never come across the waters again. \n                                                                           92",
