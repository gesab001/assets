    "word": "To know God in His works is true science, but to know God as He is in Christ is life eternal. Providence is still working amongst us. But many who profess to believe God's Word do not recognize His wonderful working power. Many professing Christians have not an experimental knowledge of God as He is revealed in His Word, therefore they fail to shine as lights in the world. All the disciples of Christ are bound to stand as light-bearers to the world. To them the words are spoken, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\" [Matthew 5:16]",
