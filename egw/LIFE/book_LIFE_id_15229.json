Yet do not feel discouraged if He who can do the work of healing, He who knows the end from the beginning, permits His child to die, to rise in the morning of the resurrection. Say, \"Not my will, but Thine, O God, be done.\". . . If your wife falls under the affliction, remember that there is a future life. The last trump will call forth all who have received Christ, believed in Him, and trusted in Him for salvation.",
