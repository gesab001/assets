    "word": "Many Bible readers and professed Bible believers do the very thing that the Lord has told them not to do, and then they suffer the result of their disobedience. God does not work a miracle to prevent the consequences of their folly. If they introduce into their systems that which cannot make good flesh and blood, they must endure the result of their disregard of God's word. All who claim to love and serve the Lord Jesus should feel it their solemn duty to search the Scriptures, to see how they can be doers of His word. Christ gave His own life for a perishing world. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" (John 3:16.) God is good to His children, and they do not begin to understand His mercy, and His gracious care for them.--Letter 102, 1896. (To A. O. Tait, March, 1896.)",
