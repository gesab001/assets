    "word": "Wednesday, Jan. 19, 1859. In the afternoon we went to Wright. Brother Cramer the elder took a seat in our carriage to pilot us. He is acquainted with the road. It is a good road. Have no milk for Teresa. She cries. Oh, that we may be as earnest for the bread of life as she is for temporal food. She will not be satisfied. May our earnest cries go up to God for His salvation. About dark arrived at Brother Root's. They welcomed us heartily. It is a good home with plenty of house room. . . . There was a meeting in the evening. We were too weary to go.",
