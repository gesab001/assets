    "word": "Read the second chapter of James. Practise the truth in your daily life, and you will know the work that the Lord has given you to do. Read also the fourth chapter, especially verses 5-12; and chapter five, especially verses 13-20. These chapters are a dead letter to the larger number of those who claim to be Seventh-day Adventists. I am directed to point you to these scriptures, and to the seventh chapter of Matthew. You need to study every word as for your life.",
