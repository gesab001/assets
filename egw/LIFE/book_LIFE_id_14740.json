    "word": "If God has blessed us with prosperity, it is not that our time and attention should be diverted from Him and given to that which He has lent us. The giver is greater than the gift.  We have been bought with a price; we are not our own.  Have we forgotten that infinite price paid for our redemption? Is gratitude dead in the heart?  Does not the cross of Christ put to shame a life of selfish ease and indulgence?  -- RH Nov. 15, 1906.",
