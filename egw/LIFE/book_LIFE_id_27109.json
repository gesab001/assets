    "word": "MR No. 363 - Ministers to Exercise\n\n     Your position in connection with the work here has not been a favorable one for you. The close confinement to an indoor, sedentary life is not suited to your constitution. The undue determination of blood to the brain, causes your mind to become confused, you do not think clearly; and more than this, your life is in danger from apoplexy. Instead of being confined indoors, you should be as much as possible in the open air.",
