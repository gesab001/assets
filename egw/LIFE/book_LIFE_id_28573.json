    "word": "\"Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son\" [verses 12, 13]. The great object for which Christ came to our world was to demonstrate the falsity of Satan's claim to the sovereignty of the world and to reassert the original and supreme ownership of God and His supreme authority. As the Restorer and Life-giver, Christ placed Himself in the enemy's pathway. He planted His cross midway between heaven and earth, that He might wrestle with and overcome the powers of darkness. He gave His life for the life of sinners, and Satan, the prince of the world, was cast out. \n\n\n                                   -254-",
