    "word": "During the night I slept but little, but I am not going to look on the dark side. I turn my face to the Sun of Righteousness, and dwell with pleasure upon the Saviour's willingness to pardon my sins and sanctify my soul. It is by beholding that we may reflect Christ's image. . . . My heart longs for more of the presence of Jesus. . . . Last night I spent many wakeful hours in prayer. I am resolved to cast myself, body, soul, and spirit upon the Lord. . . . I am encouraged as I look to Jesus and recount His lovingkindness. . . . Although I am in pain day and night, yet the grace of Christ sustains me. If I had no hope in Jesus, how lonely I should be. I have a Saviour who is the light of life. How precious to me is the sight that I catch of Jesus during my long, wakeful hours. . . .",
