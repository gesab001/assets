    "word": "Give your own selves to the Lord. Let your Christian life affirm in all your work, temporal and religious, that you are working by the will of God, making His word your rule of daily life and practice, putting every fibre of selfishness away. You need not fail nor be discouraged. Sow the seeds of truth wherever you have an opportunity. God will water your own souls just as far and as long as you in Christ shall water others. Do all that you possibly can for the promotion of the truth. Do not get into strife, but with Christ in the heart you may contend for the faith in all meekness, and assurance, and love. Freely you have received, freely give. Let it not be said that the laborers in Norfolk Island have no more religion than those of other denominations. We must, as workers together with God, come out of the frosty atmosphere in which \n\n\n                                   -134- \n\nour spirits will be inclined to live and breathe. No traditionary sentiments must cling to and impede our movements. There are souls to be saved. Ye are \"labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). Our faith must be cultivated daily, and increase and grow, and we must understand what it means to endure, seeing Him who is invisible.",
