    "word": "Now I receive letters constantly, so many that I could do nothing else than answer them, begging me to pray the Lord that He may have mercy upon them. Now I am not their mediator and do not ever expect to be, and I am not one who shall open my heart to those individuals as if I were capable of blessing them. I am riding in the same boat with yourself, trusting for salvation in the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour.
