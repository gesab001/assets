    "word": "Home Hygiene\n     One of the most prolific sources of disease is the transgression of the laws of life in regard to personal habits. Order and cleanliness are laws of heaven. The directions given to Moses when the Lord was about to declare his law upon Mount Sinai, were very strict in this respect. \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes.\u201d [Exodus 19:10.] They were directed to do this lest there should be impurity about them as they should come before him. He is a God of order, and he requires order and cleanliness in his people.",
