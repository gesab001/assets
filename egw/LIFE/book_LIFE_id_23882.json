    "word": "Rewarded for Little Things Generally Overlooked. --At the day of judgment those who have been faithful in their everyday life, who have been quick to see their work and do it, not thinking of praise or profit, will hear the words, \"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Christ does not commend them for the eloquent orations they have made, the intellectual power they have displayed, or the liberal donations they have given. It is for doing little things that are generally overlooked that they are rewarded. --Youth's Instructor, Jan. 17, 1901.",
