    "word": "The character of Christianity is intensely practical. It adapts itself to every circumstance of actual life, and fits in with everyday trials in sympathy, and carries with it the divine credentials. Great truths are brought into immediate contact with that which are regarded by finite man as \"little things.\" On one side is supplied the motive for purity and holiness, while on the other is furnished the grand, noble, principles for the regulation of the conduct and the well balanced character of a Christian.",
