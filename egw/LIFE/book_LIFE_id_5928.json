    "word": "There must be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness. . . . The idea that it is necessary only to develop the good that exists in man by nature, is a fatal deception. \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\" 1 Corinthians 2:14. . . . Of Christ it is written, \"In him was life; and the life was the light of men\"--the only \"name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" John 1:4; Acts 4:12. . . .",
