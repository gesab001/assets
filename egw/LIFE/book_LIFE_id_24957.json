    "word": "\"Does not mother remember that she herself had to learn in jots and tittles before she could be helpful? It is a wrong to children to refuse to teach them little by little. Keep these children with you. Let them ask questions, and in patience answer them. Give your little children something to do; and let them have the happiness of supposing they help you. There must be no repulsing of your children when trying to do proper things. If they make mistakes, if accidents happen, and things break do not blame. Their whole future life depends upon the education you give them in their childhood years.\"--P.C., Dec. 15, 1897. \n                                                                           19",
