    "word": "The doctrines of grace and truth are not really understood by the larger number of our students and church-members. Blindness of mind has happened to Israel. For human agents to misconstrue and put a forced, half truthful, and mystical construction upon the oracles of God, is an act which endangers their own souls, and the souls of others. \"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book. If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\" Revelation 22:18, 19. Those who, by their human construction, shall make the Scripture to utter that which \n                                                                           237\nChrist has never placed upon it, weaken its force, making the voice of God in instruction and warnings to testify falsehood, to avoid the inconvenience incurred by obedience to God's requirements, have become sign-boards, pointing in the wrong direction, into false paths, which lead to transgression and death.",
