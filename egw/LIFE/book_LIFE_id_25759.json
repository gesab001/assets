    "word": "On whose side are we? The world cast Christ out; the heavens received him. Man, finite man, rejected the Prince of life; God, our Sovereign Ruler, received him into the heavens. God has exalted him. Man crowned him with a crown of thorns, God has crowned him with a crown of royal majesty. We must all think candidly. Will you have this man Christ Jesus to rule over you, or will you have Barabbas? The death of Christ brings to the rejecter of his mercy the wrath and judgments of God, unmixed with mercy. This is the wrath of the Lamb. But the death of Christ is hope and eternal life to all who receive him and believe in him.",
