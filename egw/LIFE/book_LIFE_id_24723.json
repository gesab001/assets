    "word": "From what the Lord has shown me, the women of this class have had their imaginations perverted by novel-reading, day-dreaming, and castle-building--living in an imaginary world. They do not bring their ideas down to the common, useful duties of life. They do not take up the life-burdens which lie in their path, and seek to make a happy, cheerful home for their husbands. They lean their whole weight upon them without so much as bearing their own burden. They expect others \n                                                                           36\nto anticipate their wants, and do for them, while they are at liberty to find fault and to question as they please. These women have a love-sick sentimentalism, constantly thinking they are not appreciated; that their husbands do not give them all that attention they deserve. They imagine themselves martyrs.",
