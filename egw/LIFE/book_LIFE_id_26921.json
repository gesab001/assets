    "word": "MR No. 300 - Gaining a Life Which Lasts Through Eternity\n\n     All who are doers of the Word of God will be blessed abundantly. Whatever crosses they must lift, whatever losses they must sustain, whatever persecution they may suffer, even if it be to the loss of their temporal life, they are amply recompensed; for they secure that life which lasts through the eternal ages. They walk under the direction of the Father of lights with whom there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. They shall see His face, and His name shall be in their foreheads.--Letter 48, 1897, p. 14. (To Brethren Daniells and Salisbury, January 21, 1897.) \n\nReleased May 17, 1972.",
