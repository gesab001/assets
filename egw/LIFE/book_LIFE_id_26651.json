    "word": "Emotions, Violent, May Endanger Life.--The giving way to violent emotions endangers life. Many die under a burst of rage and passion. Many educate themselves to have spasms. These they can prevent if they will; but it requires will power to overcome a wrong course of action. All this must be a part of the education received in the school; for we are God's property. The sacred temple of the body must be kept pure and uncontaminated, that God's Holy Spirit may dwell therein.--Letter 103, 1897.",
