    "word": "I tell you frankly that Jesus and the power of his grace are being left out of the question. Result will \n333\nshow that mechanical working has taken the place of piety, humility, and holiness of heart and life. The more spiritual, devoted, and humble workers find no place where they can take hold, and therefore they stand back. The young and inexperienced learn the form, and do their work mechanically; but true love, the burden for souls, is not felt. Less dwelling upon set forms, less of the mechanical and more of the power of godliness, are essential in this solemn, fearful day of responsibilities.",
