    "word": "Sin is death; righteousness is life. Sin cannot be changed into righteousness, but it can be taken away and the righteousness of Christ put in its place. The Saviour was manifested to take away our sin. \"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life\" (Romans 6:23). The Pharisees trusted in their own righteousness, of which Christ said, \"Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 5:20). Of the Jewish leaders, He said, \"Ye will not come to Me, that ye might have \n\n\n                                     -141- \n\nlife\" (John 5:40). The righteousness of Christ brings life and healing. \"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him\" (Colossians 2:6). In Him all fullness dwells.",
