    "word": "The diseased stomach will find relief by exercise. Physicians frequently advise invalids to visit foreign countries, to go to the springs, or to ride upon the ocean, in order to regain health; when, in nine cases out of ten, if they would eat temperately and engage in healthful exercise with a cheerful spirit, they would regain health and save time and money. Exercise, and a free and abundant use of the air and sunlight\u2014blessings which Heaven has freely bestowed upon all\u2014would give life and strength to the emaciated invalid.\u2014Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, pp. 529-531.",
