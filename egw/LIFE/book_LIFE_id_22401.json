    "word": "The Author of this spiritual life is unseen, and the exact method by which that life is imparted and sustained, is beyond the power of human philosophy to explain. Yet the operations of the Spirit are always in harmony with the written Word. As in the natural, so in the spiritual world. The natural life is preserved moment by moment by divine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through the use of blessings placed within our reach. So the spiritual life is sustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied. If the follower of Christ would grow up \"unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ\" (Ephesians 4:13), he must eat of the bread of life, and drink of the water of salvation.--Review and Herald, Aug. 31, 1911.",
