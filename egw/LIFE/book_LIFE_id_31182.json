    "word": "There is need of an advance movement on the part of God's professed people. We need to draw nigh to God, and see if there are not jealousies and evil-surmisings that are keeping the Saviour away. Selfishness and self-sufficiency close the door of the heart against Jesus, saying, \"I want not thy way but my way.\" Humble yourselves under the hand of God, and he will lift you up. Your simple, heartfelt confessions of hard-heartedness, worldliness, and love of display and pleasure will be heard by God, and these sins will be seen as they appear in the sight of a holy God. The simple prayer of faith is music in the ears of the Lord. But you cannot have faith unless you talk faith and live faith. Then you may expect large things. The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and convert you, soul, body, and spirit, and you will show to all around you that your face is turned heavenward. You will be moved to holy endeavor. There is need of heart searching and seeking after God. Then God will take the stony heart out of your flesh, and give you a tender heart, which he can impress. May the Lord help and teach and lead and guide us by his Spirit, that \n                                                                           1697\nin life and character we may be fashioned after the divine pattern.",
