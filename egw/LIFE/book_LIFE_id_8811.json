    "word": "It is God's plan that riches should be used properly, distributed to bless the needy and to advance the work of God. If men love their riches better than they love their fellow men, better than they love God or the truths of His Word, if their hearts are on their riches, they cannot have eternal life. . . . Here souls are proved; and like the rich young man, many go away sorrowful because they cannot have their riches and a treasure in heaven too. . . .",
