    "word": "Not a member of the church is to be an uninterested faction. Life is to be held in their mind as under obligation to do service to Christ in their devising and planning from the first period of their conversion, to consecrate the entire life-influence to unite with Christ in the object for which He gave His life. He would have them patterns of His own love for fallen humanity. They are to love one another, as Christ has loved them. The principles of this kind of labor in love for one another were the badge of their connection with Christ. By this shall all men know ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.",
