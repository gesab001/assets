    "word": "What influence for good can unconsecrated managers have on those over whom they are placed? The heads of departments in our publishing house should be men who love and fear God, men who increase in knowledge as they learn of Christ, the Source of all knowledge. Unless those in responsible positions daily and hourly consecrate themselves to God, they are not safe men; for otherwise they may accept Satan's suggestions as from God, and thus unfit themselves to distinguish with spiritually-anointed eyes the pure from the corrupt, the sacred from the common. Better, far better, to be stripped of all our possessions, and to be poor, than to fall short of attaining eternal life.",
