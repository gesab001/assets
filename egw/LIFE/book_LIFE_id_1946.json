    "word": "BUT THOUGH FALLEN MAN COULD NO LONGER TALK DIRECTLY WITH GOD, YET OUR LOVING HEAVENLY FATHER HAS EVER MAINTAINED COMMUNICATION WITH THE HUMAN FAMILY. THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF HOLY ANGELS, HE HAS PROVIDED FOR MEN AND WOMEN PROTECTION FROM THE INFLUENCES OF EVIL, AND HELP TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WILL. AND THROUGH THE AGENCY OF HIS HOLY SPIRIT, GOD HAS SPOKEN TO THE HEARTS OF MEN, AND HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR EVEN THE MOST SINFUL AND IGNORANT TO FIND THE WAY THAT LEADS TO RIGHT-DOING AND TO ETERNAL LIFE.",
