    "word": "The world must have an antidote for sin. As the medical missionary works intelligently to receive suffering and save life, hearts are softened. Those who are helped are filled with gratitude. As the medical missionary works upon the body, God works upon the heart. The comforting words that are spoken are as a soothing balm, bringing assurance and trust. Often the skillful operator will have opportunity to tell of the work Christ did while He was upon this earth. Tell the suffering one the story of God's love. \"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" This gospel message, connected with practical missionary work, will be a saver of life unto life. The soul will be saved through belief in Christ.",
