    "word": "Christ gave His life to establish forever before the heavenly universe, before the unfallen worlds and before a fallen world, the immutability of the law of God. But the religious world has put the Lord of heaven to open shame. They refuse to receive His law as the rule of this life, and because of this disregard, the world is becoming as it was before the flood. Then, as now, the people were eating and drinking, planting and building, marrying and giving in marriage, in utter forgetfulness of God. The flood came and destroyed them all. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.",
