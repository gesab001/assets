    "word": "Christ came to this earth and lived for us the life that every one must live who is granted an entrance into the city of God. He says, \"Whosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Mark 8:34. The failure of our young physicians to obey this word is the great hindrance to their success in God's work. Among our young physicians there are those who need to be thoroughly converted before they connect with sanitarium work. Unless they are greatly changed, they would exert an influence that is counter to the influence the Lord would have exerted in these institutions. \n                                                                           23",
