How directly to the point, how well adapted to the purpose and circumstances, are Christ's \n                                                                           111 \nwords! How clear and forcible are His illustrations! His style is characterized by simplicity and solemnity. Throughout the teachings of Christ, there is nothing to justify the minister in the relation of humorous anecdotes in the pulpit. The lessons of Christ should be carefully studied, and the subjects, manner, and form of discourses should be modeled after the divine Pattern. Oratorical display, flashy rhetoric, and fine gestures do not constitute a fine discourse. . . . He did not sermonize as men do today. In intensely earnest tones He assured them of the truths of the life to come, of the way of salvation. --RH June 23, 1891.",
