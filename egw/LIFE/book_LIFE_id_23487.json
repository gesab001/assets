    "word": "To the marriage supper of the Lamb will come many who have not on the wedding garment--the robe [Christ] purchased for them with His lifeblood. From lips that never make a mistake come the words, \"Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?\" (Matthew 22:12). Those [thus] addressed are speechless. They know that words would be useless. The truth, with its sanctifying power, has not been brought into the soul, and the tongue that once spoke so readily of the truth is now silent. The words are then spoken, \"Take them out of My presence. They are not worthy to taste of My supper\" (cf. Luke 14:24).",
