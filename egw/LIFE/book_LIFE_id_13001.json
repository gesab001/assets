    "word": "The atmosphere that surrounds the soul is fraught with influence for good or evil. . . . It may be full of poison and malaria, or be fragrant and pure and health giving. This moral influence will be according to our connection with Christ or our separation from Him, who is light and life. Those who are united with Christ will realize that He has given them trusts according to their several ability; and, whatever their surroundings, they will consider them favorable for the development of moral character. We are to make the most of every advantage and opportunity. . . . We must train and improve our ability that we may not disappoint our Master, but reach the highest possible standard, and thus influence others to follow in the footsteps of our Example. We may say, \"Neither society nor intimate companions must have their ideas of Christian character cheapened by my course of action.\" . . .",
