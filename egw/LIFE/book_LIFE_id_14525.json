    "word": "It is the love of self that destroys our peace. While self is all alive, we stand ready continually to guard it from mortification and insult; but when we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall not take neglects or slights to heart. We shall be deaf to reproach and blind to scorn and insult. \"Love suffereth long and is kind\" (1 Corinthians 13:4, R.V.). . . .",
