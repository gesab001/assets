    "word": "Talented Children Require Greater Care.--We should imprint upon our children's minds that they are not their own, to go, and to come, and dress, and act, as they please. . . . If they possess personal attractions and rare natural abilities, greater care should be taken in their education, lest these endowments be turned to a curse, and are so used as to disqualify them for the sober realities of this life, and, through flattery and vanity and love of display, unfit them for the better life.",
