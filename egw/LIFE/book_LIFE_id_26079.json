    "word": "You know but little of real sacrifice and genuine denial of self. You have had but little experience in hardships and taxation of your energies. Your burden has been light, while others have been loaded down with serious responsibilities. The young man who asked Jesus what he should do that he might have eternal life, was answered \"Keep the \n                                                                           31\ncommandments.\" He confidently and proudly replied, \"All these have I kept from my youth up. What lack I yet?\" Jesus looked pityingly upon the young man, he loved him and he knew the words which he spoke would separate him from himself forever. Nevertheless Jesus touches the plague-spot of his soul. He says to the young man, \"Go sell that thou hast and give to the poor, take up thy cross and follow me and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.\" The young man wanted Heaven but not enough to withdraw his affection from his earthly treasure. He refused to yield to the conditions required by God in order to enter into life. He was very sorrowful, for he had great possessions which he thought were too valuable to exchange for eternal rewards. He had asked what he must do to be saved and the answer had been given. But his worldly heart could not make the sacrifice of his wealth to become Christ's disciple. His decision was to give up heaven and to cling to his earthly treasure. How many are now making the very same decision which fixed the destiny of this young man.",
