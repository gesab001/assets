    "word": "The man in whose heart the truth is cherished will bring from his treasure-house things new and old. In his words and deportment he will reveal the likeness of Christ. Lift him up, the Man of Calvary, higher and still higher. Christ is uplifted by the right use of the faculty of speech. Thus the Holy Spirit makes an impression upon minds. The righteousness of Christ is the salvation of all who accept him as their personal Saviour. Why did Christ die?--To bring life and immortality to light. Through the merits of Christ men are invited to repent, believe and obey the commandments of God. Christ died on the cross that he might pardon all transgression and sin, and bring man back to his loyalty to the commandments of God. By his death he showed the immutability of the law of God. He illustrated this truth by laying the foundation in his own death, erecting a cross as its center and glory. In his redemptive plan he embraces man, placing him once more on vantage ground with God, that his moral capacity might be recognized as amenable to God, who is the Supreme Ruler.",
