    "word": "Our belief in Christ is not to be a casual belief, but a belief that enters into every part of the life. Such a belief leads us to ask Him to supply our need because we realize that He is our only dependence. A casual belief admits that He is the Redeemer, but does not honor Him by receiving Him as a friend, a helper. Those who have such a belief do not know the meaning of the words, \"Without Me ye can do nothing\" [John 15:5]. They work without taking Christ into their confidence.",
