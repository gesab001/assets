    "word": "That which will bless humanity is spiritual life. If the man is in harmony with God, he will depend continually upon Him for strength. \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" It should be our lifework to press forward continually toward the perfection of Christian character, ever striving for conformity to the will of God, remembering that the efforts begun upon earth will continue throughout eternity. God has set before the human family an elevated standard, and he who is true to his God-given manhood will not only promote the happiness of his fellow creatures in this life, but will aid them to secure an eternal reward in the life to come.--Signs of the Times, June 17, 1886.",
