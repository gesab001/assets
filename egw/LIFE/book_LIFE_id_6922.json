    "word": "He who gave this parable created the tiny seed, gave it its vital properties, and ordained the laws that govern its growth. And the truths which the parable teaches were made a living reality in His own life. In both His physical and His spiritual nature He followed the divine order of growth illustrated by the plant, as He wishes all youth to do. . . . In childhood He did the works of an obedient child. . . . But at each stage of His development He was perfect, with the simple, natural grace of a sinless life.",
