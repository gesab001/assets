    "word": "\"The interest of every part of the cause is as dear to me as my life. Every branch of the work is important. I was shown that there is great danger not of making the tract and missionary work so absorbing that it will become intricate through a multiplicity of plans: that it will become perplexing and absorb every other interest. It was also brought before me that there was too much machinery in the tract and missionary, and in the Sabbath school work. There was a form and arrangement, but little of Christ-like simplicity felt or practised by the workers. We want less machinery and mechanical arrangement, and more heart work, more real piety and true holiness; especially in the missionary work everywhere. There needs to be piety, purity, and wise generalship, and then far greater and much better work would be done with less expenditure of means.",
