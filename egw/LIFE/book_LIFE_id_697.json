    "word": "The word of God is the seed. Every seed has in itself a germinating principle. In it the life of\n20\nthe plant is enfolded. So there is life in God\u2019s word. Christ says, \u201cThe words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life.\u201d John 6:63. \u201cHe that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life.\u201d John 5:24. In every command and in every promise of the word of God is the power, the very life of God, by which the command may be fulfilled and the promise realized. He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character of God.",
