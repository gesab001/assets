    "word": "Let us in our lifework strive constantly to answer the prayer of Christ, that we may be united with one another and with Him. Let us always before undertaking anything, ask ourselves the question, \"Will this please my Saviour? Is it in harmony with the will of God?\" The consciousness that we are bringing the Christ-life into the daily experience will give a sacred dignity to the everyday duties. All that we do will be done with faithfulness, that the Master may be honored. Thus shall we show to the world what Christianity can accomplish for sinful human beings, giving them constantly increasing efficiency for service in this life, preparing them for the higher life in the world to come.--Manuscript 1, Jan. 7, 1903, \"An Appeal.\"",
