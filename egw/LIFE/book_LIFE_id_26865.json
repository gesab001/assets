    "word": "The active agencies in connection with the work at Battle Creek have placed a wrong mold upon the work. Men have devised and planned in a manner that is not after the order of God, and the publishing house in California has altogether too largely followed and adopted the methods and inventions proceeding from Battle Creek. Strength and power will be in our institutions if they keep close to the word of God in all their connection and dealing with their fellow-men. Character is determined by what we love best and labor for most zealously. We judge of the internal, the unseen, by the manifest developments. A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things. God does not deal with actions so much as with the heart that prompts them. How vitally important it is that all who claim to believe the truth, make the truth fragrant by a life like that of Him who is truth. Oh, many make so little of the truth, and think so little of Jesus.--Letter 80a, 1896, pp. 1, 2. (To Elder O. A. Olsen, April 1, 1896.)",
