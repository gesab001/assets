    "word": "We are not to drift into worldly channels. Consider the cleansing of the temple at the beginning of Christ's ministry. He found the Jews intent on gain. They had made the court of the temple a scene of sacrilegious traffic, and had turned the ancient and sacred institution of the passover into a means of vile profit. They bartered deeply, turning the service instituted by Christ himself into the worship of mammon. But Christ came suddenly into the temple courts, divinity flashed through humanity, and raising a whip of small cords in his hand, with a voice that they will hear again in the execution of the judgment, he said, \"Take these things hence. It is written, My Father's house shall be called a house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.\" The priests and rulers saw as it were an avenging Angel, such as guarded the way to the tree of life.",
