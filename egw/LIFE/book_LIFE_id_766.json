    "word": "All may find something to do. \u201cThe poor always ye have with you,\u201d (John 12:8), Jesus said, and none need feel that there is no place where they can labor for Him. Millions upon millions of human souls ready to perish, bound in chains of ignorance and sin, have never so much as heard of Christ\u2019s love for them. Were our condition and theirs to be reversed, what would we desire them to do for us? All this, so far as lies in our power, we are under the most solemn obligation to do for them. Christ\u2019s rule of life, by which every one of us must stand or fall in the judgment, is, \u201cWhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\u201d Matthew 7:12.
