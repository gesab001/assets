    "word": "I wish you could read the daily papers of this country, and notice the accounts of how men in responsible positions have dropped dead while traveling or while at some entertainment. Never have the deaths of wealthy men in high life been so frequent as of late. This is the result of a violation of nature's laws. Cause is being followed by effect. The life-forces are extinguished by indulgence. \"Heart failure,\" say the physicians who attended these men at their death. Poor souls! They abused the Lord's wonderful machinery until it could endure no longer, and gave up the conflict. God does not work a miracle to keep in motion the machinery that is worn out by the abuse put upon it.",
