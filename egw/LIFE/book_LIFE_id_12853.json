    "word": "We want to cling to the Way, the Truth, and the Life. . . . We have a living Saviour, a living Intercessor, one who will help us in every time of need. When tempted to go into the dark cave of doubt and despair, sing, \n     \"Arise, my soul, arise! Shake off thy guilty fears; \n      The bleeding Sacrifice in thy behalf appears; \n      Before the throne my Surety stands; \n      My name is written in His hands.\"",
