    "word": "The question put to Christ by a lawyer was, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" There stood the wily priests and rulers expecting to hear from the lips of Christ an answer that would give them opportunity to condemn him. He who reads every heart as an open book understood their purpose. Turning to the lawyer, Christ said unto him, \"What is written in the Law? how readest thou?\" He gives him an opportunity to answer his own question. And the lawyer answering said, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: This do, and thou shalt live.\" Christ will not accept a divided heart. The life of the receiver of truth should witness to the change wrought by the transformation of character. \"Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord.\" Why? Because they have an indwelling Saviour, who works the mind and heart to reveal that love for Christ which leads them to do his will, not their own. They have that faith which works by love and purifies the soul.",
