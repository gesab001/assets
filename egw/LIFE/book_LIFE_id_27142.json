    "word": "There are sluggards all through our churches, who frame excuses for their idleness. God calls not only on the minister, but on every soul connected with him, to be a worker in his vineyard. \"Herein is my Father glorified,\" Christ says, \"that ye bear much fruit.\" By his own life Jesus has paid for your earnest, hearty cooperation. He expects you to work, every one who has passed from death unto life. If you do not work as faithful missionaries, you are untrue to your trust, and you disappoint your Saviour.--Ms 48, 1899, pp. 4, 5. (\"Work in Christ's Lines,\" March 29, 1899.)",
