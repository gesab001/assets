    "word": "Intelligent, God-fearing workers can do a vast amount of good in the way of reforming those who come as invalids to be treated at the Sanitarium. Not only are these persons diseased physically, but mentally and morally. The education, the habits, and the entire life of many have been erroneous. They cannot make the great changes necessary for the adoption of correct habits, in a few days. They must have time to consider the matter, and to learn the right way. If all connected with the Sanitarium are correct representatives of the truths of health reform and of our holy faith, they are exerting an influence to mold the minds of their patients. \n                                                                           5\nThe contrast of erroneous habits with those which are in harmony with the truth of God, has a convicting power.",
