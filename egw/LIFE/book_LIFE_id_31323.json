    "word": "If you will watch and pray, and make earnest efforts in the right direction, you will be thoroughly imbued with the spirit of Jesus Christ. \"But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.\" Be determined that you will make this school a success; \n\n\n                                   - 68 - \n\nand if you will heed the instruction given in the word of God, you may go forth with a development of intellectual and moral power that will cause even the angels to rejoice, and God will rejoice over you with singing. If you are under God's discipline, you will secure the harmony and the co-operation of the physical, mental and moral powers, and the fullest development of your God-given faculties. Let not the buoyancy and the lust of youth through manifold temptations make your opportunities and privileges a failure. Day by day put on Christ, and in the brief season of your test and your trial here below, maintain your dignity in the strength of God, as co-workers with the highest agencies during your scholastic life.",
