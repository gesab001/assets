White, at the Pavilion, Napier, New Zealand, Tuesday, March 28, 1893, 6:00 a.m.] \n\n\n     Our blessed Saviour said \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me\" (John 5:39). Our Saviour knew just what the disciples would pass through. They witnessed the body of the Lord hanging between the heavens and the earth, treated as a sinner, though undeserving. They had taken His body down and laid it in Joseph's new tomb. Never had they realized so much the worth of a living Saviour as in their great trial. They had not appreciated the value of the Saviour. In this, their great sorrow, was just when they needed Him.",
