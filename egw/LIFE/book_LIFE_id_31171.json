    "word": "The Lord would have Bro. _____ connected with the cause, if he will work patiently on these lines. My Bro., you do not know yourself. You need to learn self-control from the great Teacher. You need to learn to take care of the little things, to heed the words \"Gather up the fragments.\" You cannot estimate the cost incurred by not bringing the principles of the word of God into the every day practice. Thus the religious life is marred. Religion can only bless where it influences. It needs to be brought into every line of work.",
