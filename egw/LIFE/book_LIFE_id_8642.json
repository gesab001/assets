    "word": "\"Be ye therefore perfect\" (Matthew 5:48) is God's word to us. And in order that we might obey this word, He sent His only-begotten Son to this earth to live in our behalf a perfect life. We have before us His example, and the strength by which He lived this life is at our disposal. In thought, word, and act Jesus was sinless. Perfection marked all that He did. He points us to the path that He trod, saying, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:24).",
