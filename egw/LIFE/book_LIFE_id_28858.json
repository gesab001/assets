    "word": "MR No. 1281 - Concern for the Wahroonga Sanitarium; The Purpose of Our Institutions; Leaders Should Be Chosen for Their Spirituality\n\n     (Written January 5, 1903, from \"Elmshaven,\" Sanitarium, California, to Elder and Mrs. J. A. Burden.) \n\n\n     I wish to send you a few lines in this mail. I have written to Dr. Caro and his wife, and I will send you copies of these letters, that you may see just how I regard the question of their connection with the Wahroonga Sanitarium. Have you evidence that a radical change has taken place in Dr. Caro's life? If so, this is enough. Has he been converted? If he has not, he would not, if connected with the sanitarium, rightly represent the truth for this time. His influence would stand in the way of bringing the institution to that place where it will meet the mind of God.",
