    "word": "12-15 (chs. 3:5; 13:8; 21:27; 22:19). The Book of Life.--When we become children of God, our names are written in the Lamb's book of life, and they remain there until the time of the investigative judgment. Then the name of every individual will be called, and his record examined, by Him who declares, \"I know thy works.\" If in that day it shall appear that all our wicked deeds have not been fully repented of, our names will be blotted from the book of life, and our sins will stand against us (ST Aug. 6, 1885).",
