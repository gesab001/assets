    "word": "The Life of Faith\n     True piety begins when all compromise with sin is at an end. When the soul has surrendered itself to do the will of God, there is no feeling of self-security. And if we live under the guidance of the Spirit of God, day by day, and hour by hour, we shall not fail nor be discouraged.",
