    "word": "THE IMMORTALITY QUESTION\n \n     One day I listened to a conversation between my mother and a sister, in reference to a discourse which they had recently heard, to the effect that the soul had not natural immortality. Some of the minister's proof texts were repeated. Among them I remember these impressed me very forcibly: \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die.\" Ezekiel 18:4. \"The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything.\"\n40\nEcclesiastes 9:5. \"Which in His times He shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality.\" 1 Timothy 6:15, 16. \"To them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life.\" Romans 2:7.",
