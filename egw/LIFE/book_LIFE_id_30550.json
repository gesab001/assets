    "word": "You have had many, many opportunities to become acquainted with the truth as it is in Jesus. Will you not hold the beginning of your confidence firm unto the end? Will you not look to Jesus as your pattern in character-building? Then the structure that you rear will not be weak and imperfect, but solid and symmetrical. Study carefully the life of Christ. Constantly compare you way of viewing things with the way in which they are viewed in the Word of God. Do not in character misrepresent Christ. Never, never depart from the way of the Lord; for \"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\"",
