    "word": "At the conference in Battle Creek I had a testimony to bear to all in the conference. In every line of the work, in every institution there should be men who realize that the souls in their charge, if faithful to their trust, will be immortalized in the kingdom of God. Christ died to give them eternal life. By lives of rectitude they may receive a reward greater than their teachers. But if the men in any line of work shall forget the instruction of Him who honored humanity by taking human nature, and shall use roughly one of God's little ones, it were better for him that a mill stone were hanged about his neck, and that he were cast into the depths of the sea.",
