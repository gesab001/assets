    "word": "Lest any should forget these important directions, Christ has repeated them with His own voice. He calls His followers to a life of consecration and self-denial. He says: \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Matthew 16:24). This means what it says. Only by self-denial and self-sacrifice can we show that we are true disciples of Christ.",
