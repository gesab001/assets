We are not, because we are in the attitude of waiting and watching, to be indolent, doing nothing. But as we view the great event of Christ's coming, and as we see the necessity of watching and waiting for it, we must unite zeal and diligent industry to our waiting and watching. A life of idleness or mere meditation and abstraction, will not answer for the waiting, watching ones. Neither will it be safe or justifiable for the waiting, watching ones to become so busy in worldly matters that they cease to watch and forget their peculiar position as waiting ones. They should not be in a busy excitement like worldlings, and become surfeited and drunken with the cares of this life. A drunken man is bewildered. The fine organs of the brain are beclouded. This is exactly the position of professed Christians who allow the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches to have such a powerful influence upon them as to eclipse the attractions of heaven. They become insane in their worldly pursuit.--Letter 21a, 1871. (Fragment of a letter; addressee unknown, undated.)",
