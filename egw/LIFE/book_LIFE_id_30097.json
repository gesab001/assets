    "word": "Christ loves every soul. He gave His life to save man. \"If ye keep My commandments,\" He says, \"ye shall abide in My love, even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love. These things have I spoken unto you that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.\" \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\" Christ died on the cross to draw all to Him, and He would have us joyful in that joy which He alone can give, the joy of obedience.",
