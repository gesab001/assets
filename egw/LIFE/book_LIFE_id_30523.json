    "word": "There are some who, though they have received great light, do not feel the need of following Jesus in humility and contrition. God has honored them, but they have not reflected his glory. Jesus says to them, \"Ye will not come unto Me that ye might have life.\" \"I received not honor from men. But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. I am come in My Father's name, and ye receive Me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.\" \"How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?\" \n\n\n                                 -8-",
