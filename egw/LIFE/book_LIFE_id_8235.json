    "word": "510. A tendency to disease of various kinds, as dropsy, liver complaint, trembling nerves, and the determination of the blood to the head, results from the habitual use of sour cider. By its use many bring upon themselves permanent disease. Some die of consumption or fall under the power of apoplexy from this cause alone. Some suffer from dyspepsia. Every vital function refuses to act, and the physician tells them they have liver complaint, when if they would break in the head of the cider barrel, and never give way to the temptation to replace it, their abused life forces would recover their vigor.--R. and H., 1884, No. 13.",
