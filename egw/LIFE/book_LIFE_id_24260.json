    "word": "The heavenly messenger who was with us, said; \"Never lose sight of the fact that the message you are bearing is a world-wide message. It is to be given to all cities, to all villages; it is to be proclaimed in the highways and the byways. You are not to localize your message.\" In the parable of the sower, Christ presented an illustration of his own work and that of his servants. The seed fell upon all kinds of soil. That which was sown upon good ground brought forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty, and some even a hundredfold. But some seed fell upon poor soil, and yielded no fruit unto eternal life. Yet the sower did not therefore cease his work. You are to sow the seeds of truth in every place. Whenever you can gain access, hold forth the word of God. Sow beside all waters. You may not at once see the result of your labors, but be not discouraged because of this. Speak the words that Christ gives you, work in Christ's lines, go forth everywhere as he has given you an example. \n\n\n                     - 5 -",
