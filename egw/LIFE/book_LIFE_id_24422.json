    "word": "And Christ has been made our Judge. The Father is not the Judge. The angels are not. He who took humanity upon Himself, and in this world lived a perfect life, is to judge us. He only can be our Judge. Will you remember this, brethren? Will you remember it, ministers? Will you remember it, fathers and mothers? Christ took humanity that He might be our Judge. No one of you has been appointed to be a judge of others. It is all that you can do to discipline \n                                                                           21\nyourselves. In the name of Christ I entreat you to heed the injunction that He gives you, never to place yourself on the judgment-seat. From day to day since I have been at this meeting, this message has been sounded in my ears, Come down from the judgment-seat. Come down in humility.",
