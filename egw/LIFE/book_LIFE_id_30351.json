    "word": "Why do we not remember that Christ is our light, our salvation. He gave His own precious life that we might be guided, strengthened, and sustained. Why do we not go to Him as a child goes to its Father. He is our helper, our sufficiency, our all and in all. If we go to Him in faith, we shall never fail to receive comfort. He will deal gently with us in our infirmities, for He has been tempted in all points like as we are.",
