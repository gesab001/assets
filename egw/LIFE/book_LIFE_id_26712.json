    "word": "Jesus was a teacher when He was but twelve years old. He went in before the rabbis and doctors of the law as a learner, asking questions that surprised the learned doctors, and showing eagerness to obtain information.

His lot was no more pleasant than that of the young people who today are trying to walk in His footsteps.",
