    "word": "What we want is the Bible. We want to know the truth on every point. There are many who think they know it, who do not know anything about it, because they do not practice it. A man may stand upon the shore and see another swim, and he may think he knows exactly how to make the motions, but let him try it and he finds that he does not know. Just so it is in the spiritual life. You may think you know all about it, but you don't know anything, unless you have a living experience in the things of God, because God has not spoken to your soul. You are not furnished unto all good works.",
