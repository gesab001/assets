    "word": "Christ says to His disciples, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Let that soul leave its impression upon the professed followers of Christ. Oh, for less and less of self, and more and still more of Jesus! \"That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain\" [Philippians 2:15, 16].",
