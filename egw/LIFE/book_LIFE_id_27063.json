    "word": "God's Attitude Toward Sin \n     Never before had there been a being upon the earth who hated sin with so perfect a hatred as did Christ. He had seen its deceiving, infatuating power upon the holy angels, causing them to revolt, and all his powers were enlisted against Satan. In the purity and holiness of his life, Christ flashed the light of truth amid the moral darkness with which Satan had enshrouded the world. Christ exposed his falsehoods, and deceiving character, and spoiled corrupting influence.--Ms 143, 1897, p. 4. (\"Christ's Commission to Earth,\" undated.)",
