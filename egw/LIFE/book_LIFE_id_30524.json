It comes to me with force at times the great violence you are doing to yourself when you have knowledge of just the result that you must shorten your life and I feel intensely over this matter. For it will not make the matter one whit better. I have learned, if you go calmly along trusting in God, committing the keeping of your soul to Him as unto a faithful Creator you will be able to preserve the calmness and ease, a peace that cannot be marred, that will astonish you.",
