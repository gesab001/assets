    "word": "Another day was spent on the water, through the courtesy of one of the members of the church in San Francisco, Brother Chittendon, who owned a large sailboat. Ellen White enjoyed the occasion to the full. \"Yesterday,\" she wrote. \n\n\n     \"Brother Chittendon took out a number of us on the water in his \n     boat,--Sister Chittendon, Waggoner, Loughborough, and wife, Mary \n     Clough, Edson, Emma, Frank, Willie Jones, Bro. O. B. Jones, Charles \n     Jones, myself and the little girls. We remained on the water and \n\n\n                                    -281- \n\n\n     beach all day. Sailed out of the Golden Gate upon the ocean. There \n     was no wind to take us out of the harbor. Charlie employed a steam \n     tug to take us out. One of his friends managed the steam boat. Mary \n     and Emma were seasick. I was not sick at all. The waves ran high \n     and we were tossed up and down so very grandly. I was highly \n     elevated in my feelings, but had no words to say to any one. It was \n     grand. The spray dashing over us. The watchful captain giving his \n     orders, the ready hands to obey. The wind was blowing strong and I \n     never enjoyed anything so much in my life.",
