    "word": "Other persons have written to me of most flattering views which had been presented to them, and some have had them put in print. A new life has seemed to stir them; they are full of zeal. But the word comes to me as it has come to me in regard to the theories you hold: \"Believe them not.\" You have a mixture of truth and error, so combined that you think it all genuine. Here is where the Jews stumbled. They wove a fabric that appeared to them a beautiful thing, but it led them to refuse the light Christ brought to them. They thought they had great light, and in that light they walked, and rejected the pure, true light which Christ had come to give. Intensity is taking possession of minds, urging them into different ventures, which lead them they know not where.",
