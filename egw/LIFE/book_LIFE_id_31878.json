    "word": "Who can be made to understand that the inner life must be hid with Christ in God? Such are in the habit of praying, for Christ prayed. Such are in the habit of searching the Scriptures for themselves, and more earnestly as they see the day approaching. Such ones, who love God supremely and their neighbors as themselves, will give themselves to God as a free will offering, and that gift will include all they have. None can give themselves without reserve unless their possessions also are included, and they are dispensing their God-given trust of means as the Lord's goods. They produce fruit in good works. \"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\" \n\n\n                                     (Signed) \n\n\n                                               Ellen G.
