I am so anxious for you to take hold of the work in Australia in the right way. I am very desirous that you shall avoid the mistakes some have made. At the beginning, your work may not be pleasant. But if you will take hold unitedly \n\n\n                                   - 22 - \n\nto do your best, to improve your capabilities and talents, you will come very close to the Saviour. You are in a new country, on missionary ground, and you need to be very careful to do all the Saviour requires. You need to be ever under the supervision of Him who has purchased you with His own life.",
