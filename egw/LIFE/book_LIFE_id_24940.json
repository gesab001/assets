    "word": "Dr. Ginley is not the best adapted for a position as physician at the Institute. He sees men and women ruined in constitution, who are feeble in mental, and weak in moral, power, and he thinks it time lost to treat such cases. This may be in many cases. But he should not become discouraged and disgusted with sick and suffering patients. He should not lose his pity, his sympathy, and patience, and feel that his life is poorly employed in being interested in those cases who can never appreciate the labor they receive, and who will not use their strength, if they regain it, to bless society, but will \n                                                                           38\npursue the same course of self-gratification, if they regain health, that they did in losing health. Dr. Ginley should not become weary, or discouraged. He should remember Christ, who came in direct contact with suffering humanity. Although, in many cases, the afflicted brought disease upon themselves by their sinful course in violating natural law, Jesus pitied their weakness, and when they came to him with disease the most loathsome he did not stand aloof for fear of contamination; he touched them, and bade disease give back.",
