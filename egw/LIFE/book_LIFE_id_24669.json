    "word": "The light of the Sun of Righteousness is to shine upon regions that are in darkness. The waste places of the earth are to be cultivated, that they may bud and blossom as the rose. The word of the Lord, which is eternal life to all who receive it, must be given to those who have it not. This word is to be as the tree of life for the salvation of men, women, youth, and children. Those who through belief and practice have experienced its life-giving power, we ask, Will you not arouse to more resolute, determined effort to hold forth the word of life to your fellow-men?",
