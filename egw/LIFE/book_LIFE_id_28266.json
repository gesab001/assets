    "word": "The message of mercy from the Father was given to the world through Christ. An atmosphere of grace and peace always surrounded His life. In His life He gave evidence of what everyone who believes in His name may give evidence, that He possessed the gift of thoughtful kindness. Christ's followers may reveal the same characteristics in their associations with one another. All who profess the name of Christ must represent His kindness in their lives. Never in speech or action should they manifest an opposite spirit. Whosoever will may surround his soul with an atmosphere of kindness and patience and love; and these graces represent eternal life to the receiver. Will you now be reconverted? Your present good and your eternal welfare demand that you repent and be converted. Humble your heart before God and become one of His little children.",
