    "word": "There has been a wonderful unfolding of lines of truth more precious than the golden wedge of Ophir but you have not heard much of the truth and have not had the opportunity many have had of experiencing for yourself its power. And there will be circumstances that appear very inconsistent to your judgment and reason, and you criticize these things, and do not lay hold of the grand and precious things which, if they were brought into your life, would increase your usefulness, because you would have altogether a different kind of faith. I am surprised and grieved to the heart to see how little genuine faith there is in our world. \n                                                                           980",
