    "word": "\"He which converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.\" The people need to be enlightened at every point how to take care of themselves. This work you both could do for the Master if you were willing and obedient. [Then] you will not walk in the sparks of your own kindling, but in obedience to God's holy law. You will walk in humility and will seek to uplift those who are weak and trembling. You will not aim to see how much means you can acquire, but will manifest the same spirit of which Christ has given us an example in His life.",
