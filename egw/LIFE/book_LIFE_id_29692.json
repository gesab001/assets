    "word": "Who are keeping the commandments of God? There are those who know the truth, but who walk not in its light. A lawyer came to Christ with the question, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" Christ left him to answer his own question. \"What is written in the law? how readest thou?\" He asked. The lawyer answered, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself.\" \"Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.\" Willing to justify himself, the lawyer asked, \"Who then is my neighbor?\" And by the parable of the good Samaritan Christ showed whom he was to regard as his neighbor.",
