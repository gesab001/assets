    "word": "We are in this world to lift the cross of Calvary. As we lift this cross, we shall find that it lifts us. Let every Christian stand in his lot and place, catching the inspiration of the work that Christ did for souls while in this world. We need the ardor of the Christian hero, who can endure the seeing of Him that is invisible. Our faith is to have a resurrection. The soldiers of the cross are to exert a positive influence for good. Christ says, \"He that is not for Me is against Me, and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\" Indifference in the Christian life is a manifest denial of Christ.",
