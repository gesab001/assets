    "word": "I urge our people to make it their lifework to seek for spirituality. Christ is at the door. This is why I say to our people, \"Do not consider it a privation when you are called to leave the cities and move out into the country places. Here there await rich blessings for those who will grasp them. By beholding the scenes of nature, the works of the Creator, by studying God's handiwork, imperceptibly you will be changed into the same image.\"--Manuscript 85, 1908.",
