    "word": "The young man spoken of in our text represents a large class. When duty is brought to bear upon them they see a cross to be lifted. It is earthly treasures that hold the people and that is the reason that so few obey God. Those who are the true followers of Christ are entrusted with sacred truths to present to the world. We have been entrusted with talents, and when the Master comes to reckon with His servants, it will be seen if we have been faithful. We must not put our light under a bushel, but on a candlestick that all may see that we have been with Christ and learned of Him. In this way eternal life can be secured.",
