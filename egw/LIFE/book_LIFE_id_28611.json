    "word": "Some who had been teaching the truth to others, themselves needed to learn its first principles--mercy and the love of Jesus. Some who ought to be strong men in Christ as far as experience is concerned, are weak as babies. Their age and experience, opportunities and privileges, should make them strong men under temptation, but their life and character reveals they are only children. Some come to this meeting with great self-confidence --firm to carry out their own ideas. Decided testimonies have been given to me to meet these cases. The arrows from the Lord's quiver wounded you. Why do you place yourself as a target, then flutter as though wounded? Why not get out of my way, and let the testimony from God be set home by His Holy Spirit to hearts that need this? You get up and begin to excuse yourself, and justify yourself, thus exposing yourself to the congregation, saying to all, \"Sister White means me, but all do not understand my case.\" You are, by this course, hedging up my way and hurting yourself.",
