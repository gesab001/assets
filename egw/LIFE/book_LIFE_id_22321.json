    "word": "When so many of Christ's followers left Him, and the Saviour asked the twelve, \"Will ye also go away?\" Simon Peter answered, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life\" (John 6:68). It filled Christ's heart with sorrow to see anyone leaving Him, because He knew that faith in His name and in His mission is man's only hope. This desertion of His followers was a humiliation to Him. Oh, how little human beings know of the sorrow that filled the heart of infinite love when such things took place.",
