    "word": "The relationships between Ellen and James White were always tender and close. But at times the demands of the work in which they were engaged separated them for weeks and at times months. When a special session of the General Conference was called to convene on March 31, James White journeyed east to be present. He was filled with plans for a great expansion of the work in all its facets. Ellen remained in Oakland to continue her writing on the life of Christ. As president of the General Conference, president of the Review and Herald Publishing Association, head of the editorial staff of the Review and Herald, and closely linked with the newly established Battle Creek College, James was soon caught up in the interests in Battle Creek and questioned the wisdom of returning to the west even though they were now building a house there. When he expressed his feeling on the subject, she answered, \"While you are so happy [in the] east, I shall never ask you to \n\n\n                                   -284- \n\ncross the plains again. If you say, Stay east, thus it shall be.\" (Letter 14, 1876). She suggested that they rent the new house for a brief period, and then added, \"We will do exactly as you say. So advise or direct us and we will do as you say.\" (Letter 8, 1876).",
