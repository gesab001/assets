    "word": "When the teachings of Christ are but dimly comprehended, the whole life and character will testify to the fact. The teachings of Christ will be seen in a far different aspect when the soul falls upon the Rock and is broken. When the soul is filled with self-esteem and self-importance there is no place for the Word to find entrance. The teachings of Christ are very nice, he thinks, but not necessary to practice. Christ's lessons will bear close study. One truth comprehended in its simplicity will prove a key to a whole treasure house of truth. Christ is the great mystery of godliness. He is as the Master scattering the golden grains of truth, which require tact, skill, and deep laborious search to pick up and link together in the chain of truth. The Word is the treasure house of truth. It puts in our possession all things essential for our preparation for entrance into the city of God.",
