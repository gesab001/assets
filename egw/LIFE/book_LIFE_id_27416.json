    "word": "I feel so thankful that I have assurance that the Lord is to me a present help in every time of need. I arose early this morning to prepare and complete articles to send to Fanny [Bolton] for the papers, articles on the life of Christ for Marian [Davis], letters for Willie [White]. Some of these I had to finish after the teeth drawing, for Brother London takes the boat at about two o'clock for Melbourne school. Sister Caro did not leave today as expected on the afternoon train. I kept to my chamber and did not care to sit at the table with them. I suffered considerable pain.--Ms 81, 1893, pp. 11, 12. (Diary, July 5, 1893.)",
