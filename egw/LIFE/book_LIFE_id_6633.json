    "word": "The leaven hidden in the flour works invisibly to bring the whole mass under its leavening process; so the leaven of truth works secretly, silently, steadily, to transform the soul.

The mind is changed; the faculties are roused to action in new lines. . . . The conscience is awakened. . . .",
