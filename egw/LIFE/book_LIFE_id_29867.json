    "word": "\"This do, and thou shalt live,\" Christ said to the lawyer who had answered His question in the words, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\" Eternal life is the reward that will be given to all who obey the two great principles of God's law--love to God and love to man. The first four commandments define and enjoin love to God; the last six, love to our fellow men. Obedience to God's commands is the only evidence man can give that he possesses a genuine, saving knowledge of God. And supreme love for God is demonstrated by love for those for whom Christ has died.",
