    "word": "\"Blessed are they that mourn: for they \n shall be comforted.\" Matthew 5:4. \n\n\n     The mourning here brought to view is true heart sorrow for sin. Jesus says, \"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me.\" John 12:32. And as one is drawn to behold Jesus uplifted on the cross, he discerns the sinfulness of humanity. He sees that it is sin which scourged and crucified the Lord of glory. He sees that, while he has been loved with unspeakable tenderness, his life has been a continual scene of ingratitude and rebellion. He has forsaken his best Friend and abused heaven's most precious \n                                                                           10\ngift. He has crucified to himself the Son of God afresh and pierced anew that bleeding and stricken heart. He is separated from God by a gulf of sin that is broad and black and deep, and he mourns in brokenness of heart.",
