    "word": "Touched With the Feelings of Our Infirmities.-- Christ, our substitute and surety, was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. His human life was one long travail in behalf of the inheritance He was to purchase at such an infinite cost. He was touched with the feelings of our infirmities. In consideration of the value He places upon the purchase of His blood, He adopts them as His children, makes them the objects of His tender care, and in order that they may have their temporal and spiritual necessities supplied, He commits them to His church, saying, \"Inasmuch as ye do it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye do it unto Me.\"--Manuscript 40, 1899.",
