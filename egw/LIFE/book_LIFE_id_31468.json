    "word": "Not all are called to engage in the same line of labor, but to every man and woman who enters the service of Christ, are \n\n\n                             -242- \n\ngiven responsibilities to bear, and a special work to do. My brethren and sisters, Christ sends you this message, \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of Me.\" Humble your hearts before God, and seek counsel of Him who never makes a mistake. Under His guidance you will never go astray. You need to seek as you have never sought before for an understanding of the word of God. Pray that the Lord will open your understanding, and turn (425) your whole heart to the One who has bought you with an infinite price. You are Christ's purchased possession. Ask Him to tell you what He would have you do.",
