    "word": "A haughty spirit should not be countenanced, but all should be willing to learn, and the doctor [should be] willing to teach and educate, so that, should he be called away to recruit his health, or should disease lay him low, there would be those who could work intelligently, and the sanitarium not become demoralized.

He should now save himself before he is a complete wreck.",
