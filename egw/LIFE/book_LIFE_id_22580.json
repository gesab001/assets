    "word": "God is the fountain of life, and we can have life only as we are in communion with Him. Separated from God, existence may be ours for a little time, but we do not possess life. \"She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.\" 1 Timothy 5:6. Only through the surrender of our will to God is it possible for Him to impart life to us. Only by receiving His life through self-surrender is it possible, said Jesus, for these hidden sins, which I have pointed out, to be overcome. \n                                                                           62\nIt is possible that you may bury them in your hearts and conceal them from human eyes, but how will you stand in God's presence?",
