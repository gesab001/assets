    "word": "Our precious Jesus gave up all heaven to come to this world that He might sanctify us through the truth. Will we be sanctified? In His life and example, His lessons and His words, there was the sanctification of the Spirit of God. Sanctification was upon Him for us. God Himself worked \n\n\n                                    -308- \n\nthrough humanity, just as humanity must work through humanity. That is why He took humanity upon Himself that He might teach humanity how to work for itself. He took humanity that He might experience death in our behalf, that we might have life and immortality through His life and death.",
