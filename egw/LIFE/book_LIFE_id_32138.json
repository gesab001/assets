    "word": "The aim of life should be to obey the call of Christ, \"Follow me.\" Those whose minds are kept pure and uncrowded with too many small items, who will let their mind give its strength to those things that will be received not from their standpoint, but from the light that God has given, will be continually gaining in knowledge. And this knowledge will direct them in straightforward channels. By their aftersight they will be able to give thanks to God that they had studiously chosen to know and understand what saith the Lord to His servant.",
