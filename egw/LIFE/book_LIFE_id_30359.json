    "word": "We are to find rest by wearing His yoke and bearing His burdens. In being co-workers with Christ in the great, grand, work for which He gave His life, we shall find true rest. When we were sinners He gave His life for us. He wants us to come to Him and learn of Him. Thus we are to find rest. He says He will give us rest. Then do not lay your burdens upon any human being. \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" In doing this you will find in your own experience the rest that Christ gives, the rest that comes from wearing His yoke and lifting His burdens.",
