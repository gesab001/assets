    "word": "The Pharisee, scribes, and elders, in Christ's days manifested an avaricious spirit which brought them under the control of Satan, and was the main cause of their hatred toward Christ; for his teaching and example rebuked everything of this character. If such a spirit should be cherished in our institutions under any pretense, God cannot abide there. There should not be a grasping spirit manifested toward brethren, for it is not born of heaven, but from beneath. Any injustice done to God's children is registered in the books of heaven as done unto Christ. That success which is attained through taking advantage of another by sharp dealing, will prove to be a loss in the end; but that which appears to be loss through the practise of principles that represent the life of Christ, is divine success.",
