    "word": "Success Comes When the Will Is Yielded to God.-- Every human being possessed of reason has power to choose the right. In every experience of life God's word to us is, \"Choose you this day whom ye will serve.\" Joshua 24:15. Everyone may place his will on the side of the will of God, may choose to obey Him, and by thus linking himself with divine agencies, he may stand where nothing can force him to do evil. In every youth, every child, lies the power, by the help of God, to form a character of integrity and to live a life of usefulness.",
