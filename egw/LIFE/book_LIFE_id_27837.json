    "word": "In the movement of 1844, when we believed the coming of Christ was at hand, night after night, when bidding goodnight to those of like faith, we would grasp their hands, feeling that we might not clasp them again until we should meet in the kingdom of glory. Thus it will be again as we draw near to the close of time. I urge our people to make it their lifework to seek for spirituality. Christ is at the door. This is why I say to our people, Do not consider it a privation when you are called to leave the cities and move out into country places. Here there await rich blessings for those who will grasp them. By beholding the scenes of nature, the works of the Creator, by studying God's handiwork, imperceptibly you will be changed into the same image.",
