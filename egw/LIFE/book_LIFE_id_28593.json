    "word": "God so loved the world that He manifested His love by giving His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. Jesus said: \"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another\" [John 13:34, 35]. \"This is My commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you\" [John 15:12]. Let your zeal be manifest, not in exposing your variances but in cultivating the precious plant of love, just as Jesus has told us to do.",
