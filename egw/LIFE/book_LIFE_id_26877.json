    "word": "There is one thing we should not forget, and that is that \"every plant that My heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.\" Jesus says, \"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them and they follow Me; and I give unto \n\n\n                                    -13- \n\nthem eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand. My Father which gave them Me is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand.\" \"All that My Father giveth Me shall come to Me; and him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out.\"",
