    "word": "Those who deal with human minds must cultivate self-control, patience, kindness, forbearance, and Christlike love. These souls connected with them may be their companions through the ceaseless ages of eternity. There is no respect of persons with God. All with whom we stand related in any capacity should see in us Christlike attributes, not satanic. Everything should be set in order, and everything guarded against that would cast a shadow over the religious life of the workers, so that they labor in discouragement. The same principles should govern your course toward the youth who have not accepted the truth. Any wrong treatment from you, by word or action, is making their salvation more difficult.",
