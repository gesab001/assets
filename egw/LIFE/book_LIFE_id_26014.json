    "word": "Eld. McCoy, you are not what the Lord would have you to be. You are abrupt and harsh, and need the softening, subduing influence of the Spirit of God. It is never convenient to take up the cross, and follow in the path of self-denial; and yet this must be done. God wants you to have his grace and his Spirit to make fragrant your life. You are too independent, too self-sufficient; you do not counsel with others as you should. You cannot read character, you lack discernment; therefore your only safety is in counseling with those of good judgment. You may be constantly associated \n                                                                           33\nwith unprincipled persons connected with the Sanitarium, and yet you do not discern their defects; individuals will practice dishonesty, and you do not see it; they may do any amount of injury by their influence upon others, and you are blind to it all.",
