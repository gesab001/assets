    "word": "I must speak most earnestly to our brethren and sisters in Colorado. The Lord would have you first carry out the plans that are sanctified by the approval of heaven. You are to stand continually on guard. Time is precious. Unify, unify. Christ is calling for oneness in labor, in and through His grace and strength. He calls for the whole being to be sanctified to one purpose --the doing of the commandments of God. Those who know the truth are to strive most earnestly to teach perishing souls how to win the race for eternal life, ever looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. Paul tells us that there is a race to run. Every step to advance brings us nearer the winning of the race. Every one is to put forth an earnest effort, moving firmly and steadily forward with an unwavering purpose to run the race and win the prize. Let no one place himself where he will hinder any soul from running this race.",
