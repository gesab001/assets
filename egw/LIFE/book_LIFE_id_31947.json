    "word": "Many who should have stood with us in solid rank and file have given themselves up to ambitions which have led to objectionable practises, opposed to honest and righteous dealing. The service of such ones God does not accept. They are drawing into the pattern strange threads, which will spoil the figure, and the Lord cannot endorse their work. Those who become adept in unfair dealing gain their success at altogether too high a price. Their mental powers are used to overreach and defraud, and opposite their names in the books of heaven God writes the words, Unfaithful stewards. God and eternal life become of little account to them when the greed for gain and for the mastery are in the scale. An eternity of blissful experience is exchanged for the flattery of supposed success. Transaction after transaction forbidden by God is entered into. The Voice said, Better, far better the loss of all earthly possessions that the loss of the favor of God and the eternal interests that are at stake.",
