    "word": "\"Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice\" (Philippians 4:4). Those who do this have a joyous life. No unpleasantness comes from their lips or from the atmosphere surrounding the soul, for they do not feel that they are better than others. Hide in Jesus Christ; then all the time the truth of God will be fitting you up for the future, immortal life. When you have confidence in the Mighty One, your experience is not borrowed; it is your own.--MS 91, 1901.",
