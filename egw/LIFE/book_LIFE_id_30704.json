    "word": "The Jews expected the Messiah to come with pomp and ceremony as a great king. They looked for Him to appear as a conqueror, to deliver Israel from the Roman yoke. They thought they would be able to cry, \"This is the king that will reign on David's throne.\" But this man who made the claim that He was the Anointed One of God, was from the humble walks of life, the son of Joseph and Mary. They had seen Him going up and down the hills, they had seen Him toiling daily at the carpenter's bench, and could He be the Messiah? The very humiliation which Christ bore was foretold in the Scriptures as a specification of His divine character and mission, and should have commended Him to every home and heart in the land. \n                                                                           397\nBut to the proud and unbelieving Jews His humility was an offense.",
