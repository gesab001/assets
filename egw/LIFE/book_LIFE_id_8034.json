    "word": "THE SURETY OF OUR DELIVERANCE.\u2014By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave us an example of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey. It was Christ who from the bush on Mount Horeb spoke to Moses saying, \u201cI AM THAT I AM. . . . Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.\u201d Exodus 3:14. This was the pledge of Israel\u2019s deliverance. So when He came \u201cin the likeness of men,\u201d He declared \n11\nHimself the I AM. The Child of Bethlehem, the meek and lowly Saviour, is God \u201cmanifest in the flesh.\u201d 1 Timothy 3:16. And to us He says: \u201cI AM the Good Shepherd.\u201d \u201cI AM the living Bread.\u201d \u201cI AM the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\u201d \u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\u201d John 10:11; 6:51; 14:6; Matthew 28:18. I AM the assurance of every promise. I AM; be not afraid. \u201cGod with us\u201d is the surety of our deliverance from sin, the assurance of our power to obey the law of heaven.\u2014DA 24, 25.",
