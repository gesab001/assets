    "word": "\"Therefore, I say unto you, Take no (anxious) thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\" While you do your best, weary not your body and mind with the cares of this life; do not spoil your religious experience by worry; but trust the Lord to work for you, and to do for you what you cannot do for yourself. The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.",
