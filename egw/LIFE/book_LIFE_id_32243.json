    "word": "Take God with you in every place. The door is open for every son and daughter of God. The Lord is not far from the soul who seeks him. The reason why so many are left to themselves in places of temptation is because they do not set the Lord before them. It is in the places where God is least thought of that you need to carry the lamp of life. If God be left out of sight, if our faith and communion with Him is broken, the soul is in positive danger. Integrity will not be maintained.",
