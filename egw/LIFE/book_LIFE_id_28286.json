    "word": "Time is short, and there is a world to be warned. Souls are to be hunted for, fished for. The Lord has given to every man his work. Everyone is under obligation to obey the law of God. He who is a doer of the will of God, who conscientiously holds his talents in trust as a precious gift to be used in the Master's service, will be accounted a wise steward. Each worker is to say from the heart, \" I have come into close relationship with Christ. I have taken upon myself sacred vows. When I was baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, I was buried with Christ in the likeness of His death, and raised in the likeness of His resurrection. I am pledged to consecrate my life to His service.\"",
