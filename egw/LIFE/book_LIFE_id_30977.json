    "word": "My much-respected brother, I dare not but speak to you plainly. Do not, for your soul's sake, allow others to place before your mind the supposed deficiencies of those who love God and His chosen workers. The real efficiency of the church rests upon a few whose moral powers may be taxed unnecessarily by bearing the burdens and counteracting influences of created suspicion and doubt. It is your duty to surround your soul with an atmosphere that will invigorate the spiritual life of all who inhale it. We need to cultivate faith, hope, courage, and large love. The peace of God is for your soul. Let it in to rule in your heart. Then you will have moral efficiency to discharge your responsibilities. This you can do only through the daily endowment of the Holy Spirit, which will impart a divine efficiency, a calm, subdued dignity to all your ministry to relieve suffering. You will testify that you have learned of Jesus.",
