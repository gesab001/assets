    "word": "-231- \n\n     There is a heaven for us to win. For our sake Christ left His riches and glory, and became poor, that we through His poverty might become rich. Shall we not avail ourselves of this opportunity of becoming rich, instead of taking the position that we will have our own way? We shall be under the control of either Christ or Satan, whichever master we voluntarily choose to serve. It seems as if those who, unwilling to give their hearts and minds to Jesus, [and thus] choose to place themselves under the control of the prince of darkness, do not exercise their reason in regard to the future. If they continue in their wrong course, the eternity upon which they are entering will not be an eternity of life, but of death.",
