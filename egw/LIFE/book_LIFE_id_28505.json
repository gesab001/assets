    "word": "No one needs to spend sleepless moments in regard to his life insurance papers. His title deed as heir of God and joint-heir with Jesus Christ [is] to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not away. God is responsible for every soul who wears the sign of His government, who is loyal and true to the Sabbath, and through obedience to the Sabbath, true to every principle in the Decalogue. \"He that keepeth My words, loveth Me,\" Christ said. Thus faith and works are combined, the inward working of the Holy Spirit and outward demonstration of practical godliness. The proof of heart-love is obedience to God's commandments. All who love God will study His words. They will eat His flesh and drink His blood, living and acting in constant submission to His will.",
