    "word": "22 (see EGW on 2 Corinthians 5:10). Christ Appointed as Judge.--To His Son the Father has committed all judgment. Christ will declare the reward of loyalty. \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son. . . . And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.\" Christ accepted humanity and lived on this earth a pure, sanctified life. For this reason He has received the appointment of judge. He who occupies the position of judge is God manifest in the flesh (RH June 18, 1901).",
