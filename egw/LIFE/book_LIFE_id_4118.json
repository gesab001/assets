    "word": "In our towns and cities are souls living in ignorance of the truths of God's word; many are perishing in sin. Some out of curiosity come to our houses of worship. Let every discourse preached be a revelation of the great truths applicable to this time. Unveil the mysteries of redemption before the students in the school and before the congregations who assemble to hear the word. This is knowledge needed by the educated and the unlearned. The highest education will be found in studying the mystery of godliness. The great truths of God's word, if believed and received and carried into the life practice, will result in education of the highest order.",
