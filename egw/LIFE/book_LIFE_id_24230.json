    "word": "Upon those who keep the commandments of God the benediction is pronounced: \"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\" They are \"a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people;\" that they should show forth the praises of him who hath called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. The obedient are called the just; they are drawn to the holy magnet, Jesus Christ; the holy attracts the holy. He that is unjust will be unjust still. Character cannot then be made or transformed. The oil of grace cannot be lent by one to another, neither have the foolish virgins time to buy oil for themselves. The righteous are those who keep the commandments of God, and they will be forever separated from the disobedient and unrighteous, who trampled under foot the law of God. The pure ore and the dross will no longer commingle.",
