    "word": "The people of God have received many admonitions and encouragements to advance, and it is time that the purposes of God regarding His work shall be understood by them and carried out. By cherishing unbelief in the plans and directions that have been laid out for them to follow, and by exalting human judgment, much time and valuable experience have been lost. The Lord, He is God, and beside Him there is none else. Let all now search the word of the Lord, and walk in His ways. Let the prophecies of Isaiah be studied and heeded, and the Lord will perform His part. \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life.\"",
