    "word": "In the last year of His ministry Christ witnessed this ceremony commemorating the smiting of the rock in the wilderness. That rock was a symbol of Him who by His death would cause living streams to flow to all who are athirst. There in the presence of the assembled multitude He set Himself apart to be smitten, that the water of life might flow to the world. He declared that He was the living Rock, of whom the rock in the wilderness was a symbol.",
