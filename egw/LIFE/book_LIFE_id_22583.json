    "word": "The whole earthly life of Jesus was a manifestation of this principle. It was to bring the bread of life to His enemies that our Saviour left His home in heaven. Though calumny and persecution were heaped upon Him from the cradle to the grave, they called forth from Him only the expression of forgiving love. Through the prophet Isaiah He says, \"I gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting.\" \"He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.\" Isaiah 50:6;  53:7. And from the cross of Calvary there come down through the ages His prayer for His murderers and the message of hope to the dying thief.",
