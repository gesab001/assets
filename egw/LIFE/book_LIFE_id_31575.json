    "word": "\"It is Satan's plan to talk about that which concerns himself. He is delighted to have human beings talk of his power, of his working thru the children of men, but by indulgence in such conversation the mind becomes gloomy and sour and disagreeable. We may become channels of communication for Satan thru which words bring no sunshine to the heart. But let us decide that this shall not be. Let us decide not to be channels thru which Satan shall send gloomy disagreeable thoughts. Let our words be not a savor of death unto death, but of life unto life, in the words we speak to the people and in the prayers we offer. God desires us to give unmistakable evidences that we have a spiritual life. We do not enjoy the fulness of the blessing which the Lord has prepared for us because we do not ask in faith. If we would exercise faith in the word of the living God, we should have the richest blessings. We dishonor God by our lack of faith; therefore we can not impart life to others unless we ourselves bear a living, uplifting testimony. We cannot give that which we do not possess. If we will walk humbly with God, if we will walk in the spirit of Christ, none of us will carry heavy burdens. We shall lay them on the great burden-bearer. Then we may expect triumphs in the presence of God, in the communion of His love. Every campmeeting may be a love feast from the beginning to the end because God's presence is with His people. All heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of God, thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand are commissioned ministers to those who shall be heirs of salvation. They guard us against evil and press back the powers of darkness that are seeking our destruction. Have we not reason to be thankful every moment; thankful even when there are apparent (892) difficulties in our pathway. The Lord Himself is our Helper.\"",
