    "word": "The Lord God of Israel has made Himself a refuge for His people. All who will make Christ their dependence, will know what it means in these last days to agonize to enter in at the straight gate. The foolish self-esteem and self-confidence which many possess will prove their eternal ruin. To them the narrow path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in seems altogether too restricted. But he who abides in Christ will understand what it means to be crucified to the world. The Lord has provided only one refuge for His people. The great apostle says, \"Your life is hid with Christ in God.\" \"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.\" All who are overcomers will be highly exalted. \n\n\n                                    -153-",
