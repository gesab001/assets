    "word": "55\n \n\nTraining Leaders\n\n     Divide Responsibility--I feel somewhat anxious about you.  I dreamed that you were telling me some of your trials and I said, My brother, if you had possessed the same spirit that Moses had, you would have thorough workers with you.  When Moses was much burdened the Lord raised him up in Jethro an advisor and helper.  The advice was taken and the burdens that had come upon him were divided with others and a two-fold object was gained; Moses was relieved and he had a better chance for his life, and men were learning to bear responsibilities to qualify them to do work in positions of trust so that Israel should not learn to look to one man and trust in one man and think that no one could do any thing for them unless it came before that one man.  Now it is hard I know to let go some responsibilities and give others an opportunity to get hold with all the advantages and counsel of your knowledge to help them.  Unless this is done they will ere long have to carry an unwieldy lead without the instruction and counsel which now it is their privilege to have.--Letter 64, 1886.",
