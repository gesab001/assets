    "word": "The  Samaritan Woman\nJohn 4:5-42\n     THE JEWS AND THE SAMARITANS DESPISED EACH OTHER. ONE WOULD NEVER ASK A FAVOR OF THE OTHER EVEN IF THE NEED WERE GREAT. AND THEY WOULD NEVER ADDRESS A WOMAN UNLESS SHE SPOKE FIRST. WHEN JESUS, A JEW, ASKED A SAMARITAN WOMAN FOR A DRINK OF WATER, IT WAS AN ACTION UNHEARD OF.  THE ENSUING DIALOG CHANGED HER LIFE.",
