    "word": "When Christ ascended to heaven at the close of His earthly ministry, the gates of the city of God were thrown back upon their glittering hinges, and He entered as a conqueror, there to take up in the heavenly sanctuary His ministry in behalf of those for whom He had given His life. The divine-human Son of God is now standing before the Father, pleading our cases and \n\n\n             -223- \n\nmaking atonement for our transgressions. Thus He confesses our names before His Father and before the angels. His hands still bear the marks of the crucifixion. He exclaims, \"Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands!\" He desires that we shall finally enter the heavenly city as conquerors.",
