    "word": "When the meeting is carried on in the absence of the minister, let one take the lead, but not devote long time to sermonizing. Just speak the words in the spirit and in the love of Jesus, and thus set an example for others, that no one shall talk words for the sake of talking and killing the time. Let each work a part in diligently presenting the experience of the soul. Let them state their own individual experience, their soul struggles, the victories obtained. Above everything, let them offer to God a tribute of praise from a thankful heart that Jesus has died for them. Here is subject matter that each may dwell upon with profit. It is the duty of all to feel that they must contribute a part to the life and soul of the meeting. Do this and the blessing of God will come into your midst in large measure.-- Manuscript 39, 1887, pp. 1-4. (Special testimony to a church in North England Conference. July 23, 1887.) \n\n\n                                      -5-",
