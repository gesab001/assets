    "word": "To our sanitariums all classes of the sick will come, and by our physicians and nurses they are to be led to realize that they need spiritual help as well as physical restoration. They are to be given every advantage for the restoration of physical health, and they should be shown also what it means to be blessed with the light and life of Christ, what it means to be bound up with Him. They are to be led to see that the grace of Christ in the soul uplifts the whole being. And in no better way can they learn of Christ's life than by seeing it revealed in the lives of His followers.--Letter 287, 1905, pp. 6, 7. (To \"Promoters of the Canon City Sanitarium,\" October 2, 1905.)",
