    "word": "God intends that, even in this life, truth shall be ever unfolding to His people. There is only one way in which this knowledge can be obtained. We can attain to an understanding of God\u2019s Word only through the illumination of that Spirit by which the Word was given. \u201cThe things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God\u201d; \u201cfor the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\u201d And the Savior\u2019s promise to His followers was: \u201cWhen he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth. . . . For he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.\u201d",
