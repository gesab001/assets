    "word": "Christ gave His life for sinful men and women. He desired to rescue the race from a life of transgression to a life of obedience and righteousness; and to those who accept Him as their Redeemer He offers the richest reward that Heaven can bestow--even the inheritance of life eternal. . . .  {1NL 69.10} \n \n                                What Are We Worth? \n\n     O that we might comprehend more fully the infinite price that has been paid for our redemption! Paul declares, \"Ye are bought with a price;\" and it is true; for the price paid is nothing less than the life of the only-begotten Son of God. Let us all consider this. We may refuse the invitations that Christ sends \n                                                                           70\nto us; we may neglect His offer of pardon and peace; but still it remains a fact that every one of us has been bought with a price, even with the precious blood of the Son of God. Therefore, \"Consider Him.\"  {1NL 69.11}  \n     You have cost much. \"Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" That which you may regard as your own, is God's. Take care of His property. He has bought you with an infinite price. Your mind is His. What right has any person to abuse a body that belongs not to himself, but to the Lord Jesus Christ? What satisfaction can anyone take in gradually lessening the powers of body and mind by selfish indulgence of any form?",
