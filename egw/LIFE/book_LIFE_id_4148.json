    "word": "When God's word is made the man of our counsel, when we search the Scriptures for light, heavenly angels come near to impress the mind and to enlighten the understanding so that it can be truly said, \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" Psalm 119:130. It is no marvel that there is not more heavenly-mindedness seen among the youth who profess Christianity, when so little attention is given to the word of God. The divine counsels are not heeded; \n                                                                           443\nthe divine admonitions are not obeyed. Grace and heavenly wisdom are not sought, that every taint of corruption may be cleansed from the life.",
