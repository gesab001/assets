    "word": "Parents are to give their children such a training that, as they grow older, they will take part in the work of the Lord. From their earliest years children are to be trained to habits of order and helpfulness. They are to be taught to be burden-bearers according to their several ability. As they grow older, they will become more and more useful, more fitted to bear their share of the burdens of life.",
