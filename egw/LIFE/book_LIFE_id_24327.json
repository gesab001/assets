    "word": "Truths, precious, vital truths, are bound up with man's eternal well-being both in this life and in the eternity which is opening before us. \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\" The word of God is to be practised. The word of God liveth and endureth forever. While worldly ambition and worldly projects and the greatest plans and purposes of men shall fade like the grass, \"they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.\"",
