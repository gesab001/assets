    "word": "Meeting Temptations. Our work is a solemn, serious work. It is not the order and will of God to shield His people from temptation. His people will be exposed to trial, and the very object of Christ's choosing a people from the world was to prepare them to meet and resist temptations, that when they should come in contact with the world in public life, they would be so imbued with the Spirit of God that they would not yield to corrupting influences. When truth takes possession of the heart, the Christian will be brought into conflict, and in this conflict he will need the whole armor of God, for he has to fight the good fight of faith. There are opposing elements in his own household, even in his own heart, and nothing but the free Spirit of God can ensure for him the victory. \n\n                                                                --",
