    "word": "Then come to Jesus although you feel your unworthiness. The life of simple dependence upon God is a daily lesson in knowing God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent. \"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\" The voice of invitation is, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" To God, only to God, pour out the sorrows, the great needs and troubles of your soul. He will help you. \"My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be moved.\" (Psalms 62:5, 6)",
