    "word": "To you and to Edson I desire to say, Please do not use my name as sustaining you in taking an independent course. I advise you both to unite with those who are bearing responsibilities in the Southern Union Conference. Assist them all you possibly can. You can best advance the work in the Southern field by uniting with your brethren in the conference, by showing them that you do not regard your capabilities as all that is necessary to make the work a success. Let all see that you are gaining spiritual life as you advance step by step.",
