    "word": "While laboring in this world as the great medical missionary, Christ denied Himself every luxury. He suffered that you might secure salvation. For you He endured death on the cross, despising the shame. He descended to the lowest depths of humiliation that you might sit in heavenly places. Behold His love. Does it not put to shame your extravagant outlay of means, that you may make a show in the world? How much owest thou unto thy Lord? Can you compute the sum? \n                                                                           19\nAll that He possessed, He gave for your salvation, and He calls upon you to consecrate yourself to His service. Review from the first your service to God, and henceforth follow the example of the Saviour, not the example of worldlings. Unless you study the Saviour's life, and practise His lessons; you will never enter the courts of the blessed.",
