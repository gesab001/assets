    "word": "I feel the deepest interest for you. I love you. I know that your happiness depends upon the course of your action. And unless it is entirely different in many respects than it has been, you cannot have life, have salvation. I have written this letter sadly, discouragingly. My heart aches while I write. Gladly would I write encouragingly if I had it to write. I was in hopes that God would never give me another message for you. . . . I have felt agony of soul. I have cried in agony for above an hour.--Letter 1, 1858, pp. 3, 5. (To Mary Loughborough, March 3, 1858.)",
