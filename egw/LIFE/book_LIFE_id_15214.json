    "word": "O precious Saviour, I long for Thy salvation. \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee\" (Psalm 42:1). I long for a clearer view of Jesus. I love to think of His spotless life, to meditate upon His lessons. How many times I repeat the words, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28).",
