    "word": "MR No. 1086 - Christ Will Shape the Life and Work of Surrendered Christians as a Potter Molds the Clay: Harmonious Action Necessary\n\n        (Written to Dr. J. H. Kellogg, about December 14, 1899.) \n\n     The Lord is not partial. But He has been misrepresented. The work that should have been done in the different parts of His vineyard has been hindered because men have failed to see how the work could be advanced in these parts of the vineyard. In some parts the work has been overdone. In this way money has been absorbed that should have been used to enable workers in other parts of the vineyard to move forward without hindrance in the work of elevating the standard of truth. Some portions of the vineyard are not to be robbed in order that means may be absorbed in one location.",
