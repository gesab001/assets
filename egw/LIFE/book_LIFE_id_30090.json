    "word": "The truth of a heavenly origin converts the soul. The truth from heaven has an influence upon the human life and upon the human character that is elevating, ennobling, sanctifying, refining--making us more and more like Jesus; and thus we are changed through the sanctification of the truth from glory to glory. What is the glory? It is the character--\"From character to character.\" And we are fitting for heaven in this life, that we may see Jesus and that we may be like Him; that we may reflect His image, and from character to character marching, marching right straight along; step by step you keep with the Leader, and He is leading you. Who is it? The Light of the world, the Truth, the Life.--all these combined, and He is leading in straight paths. You are never left without angels' care. Do you respond and seek to perfect a true righteous character?  Will you be led? That is the question, the whole question of your salvation today. Will you be led?",
