    "word": "You are a crew on the missionary ship. Very many men, women, and children have invested their mites, and offered their prayers for the safety of this ship as she rides upon the treacherous ocean. You need Jesus with you every moment. The vessel that rides upon the waters on this missionary enterprise may be a floating Bethel. The captain, Brother S, has a large responsibility upon him. Let every one on board pray for him in faith that he \n\n\n                                    -205- \n\nmay have the special guardianship of heavenly angels, and an abiding Christ in the soul. Cherish the love of Jesus in the heart, respect each other; for Christ has given His life for you. Every soul is precious in the sight of God. It is a wonderful thing to be remembered and cared for every hour by God. If we should be left alone to ourselves, what a terrible alone it would be.",
