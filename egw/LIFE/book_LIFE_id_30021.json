    "word": "And now I present before you the cross of Calvary. If you will come to that cross in penitence, in faith, in obedience to God's commandments, you will come in the only appointed way. If you lose heaven, you lose everything. If I can only see the King in His beauty, it is all I desire. Let me listen to the sweet music of His voice, saying \"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world\" [Matthew 25:34]. Who of you in this congregation shall we meet there? We want to see you crowned in the city of God. We want to see when the judgment shall sit and the books be opened, that you can stand with the glory of God shining in your countenance. If we can only have that life in the city of God we shall be eternally blessed.",
