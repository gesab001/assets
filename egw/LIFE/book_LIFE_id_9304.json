    "word": "Many were the visitors -- old acquaintances and others -- who came to greet Mrs. White during the last few months of her life. Sometimes she was unable to recognize old associates in labor; at other times she knew those who came. Whenever possible, she would converse with them. She never ceased to take delight in testifying of God's goodness and tender mercy. For months prior to her illness, she frequently quoted the scripture, They overcame \"by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony\"; and she felt strengthened every time she bore witness to the love of God and to His watchful care.",
