    "word": "The School of the Home \n\n     Talk, by Mrs. E. G. White, in the St. Helena (Cal.) \n     Sanitarium Chapel, 6 a.m., July 14, 1902. \n\n\n     I promised that I would speak this morning in regard to the necessity of withdrawing our children from the public schools and of providing suitable places where they can be educated right. I have felt surprised at the apparently indifferent attitude of some, notwithstanding the oft-repeated warnings given the parents must provide for their families not merely with reference to their present interests, but especially with reference to their future, eternal interests. The characters that we form in this life are to decide our destiny. If we choose, we may live a life that measures with the life of God.",
