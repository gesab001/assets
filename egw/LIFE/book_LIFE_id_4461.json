    "word": "Sister Daniels, you have not met your solemn responsibilities as a mother . . . [when you have] aided your daughter to deceive her father in regard to her dress and expenditures. Both of you have been\n205\ndeceived and carried away with false ideas in regard to the training of your children. You must be thoroughly transformed by the grace of Christ, so that you can teach your children, by precept and example, the good and right way. Zua is full of affectation and deception. She is superficial in nearly all her attainments. Her school life has given her an outside polish, but her heart is unrenewed, for she has no love for God, no love for the society of Christians. She is in the ranks of the enemy, and should she die today she would not enter the kingdom of heaven.",
