He raised his voice zealously, and in the power of the Holy Spirit cried out against, and rebuked the existing sins of the leaders of the people. He counted not his life dear unto him. Proclamations went forth to kill Luther anywhere he might be found. He seemed left to the mercies of a superstitious people who were obedient to the head of the Romish church.",
