    "word": "Many professed Christians are laying upon the foundation-stone wood, hay, and stubble, which the fires of the last day will consume. They engage in work that wearies, work that occupies golden hours; but it is not work that need be done. Their time is occupied, their energies exhausted, in that which will bring no precious returns either in this life or in the future immortal life. What a difference will be seen when spiritual work engages the mind, when the talents are employed in the service of Jesus! The light that He has given us will then shine forth in direct, concentrated rays to others. All that we do for Jesus will enable us to enjoy this life better.",
