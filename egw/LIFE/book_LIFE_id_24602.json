    "word": "There is a work to be done for all classes of society. We are to come close to the poor and the depraved, those who have fallen through intemperance. And at the same time, we are not to forget the ministers, lawyers, senators, and judges, many of whom use strong drink and tobacco. Leave no effort untried to show them that their souls are worth saving, that eternal life is worth striving for. Present the total abstinence pledge to those in high positions. Ask them to give the money they would otherwise spend for the harmful indulgences of liquor and tobacco, to the establishment of institutions where children and youth can be prepared to fill positions of usefulness in the world.
