    "word": "But in spite of his precautions, the very thing he dreaded afterward came upon him. His honors were stripped from him, he was cast down from his high office, and, stung by remorse and wounded pride, not long after the crucifixion he ended his own life. \n                                                                           138\n {SJ 137.10}  \n     So all who compromise with sin will gain only sorrow and ruin. \"There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.\" Proverbs 14:12.",
