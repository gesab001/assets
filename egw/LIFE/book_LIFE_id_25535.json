    "word": "\"The deportment, words, and acts of all in that office should be reserved, modest, humble, and disinterested, as was their Pattern, Jesus, the dear Saviour. They should seek God and obtain righteousness. The office is not the place for sport, for visiting, for idlers, for laughing, or useless words. All should feel that they are doing a work for their Master. These truths which they read, that they act their part to arrange to get before the people, are invitations of mercy, are reproofs, are threatenings, warnings, or encouragements. They are doing their work. They are savors of life unto life, or of death unto death. If rejected, the judgment must decide the matter. The prayer of all in the office should be, 'O God, make these truths which are of such vital importance, clear to the comprehension of the humblest minds! May angels accompany these silent preachers, and bless their influence, that souls may be saved by these humble means.'",
