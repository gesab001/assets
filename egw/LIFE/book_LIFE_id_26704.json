    "word": "My birthday is past without commemoration. Father and I went to Green Valley from Healdsburg California, fourteen miles and back. The road part of the way was bad. We wandered out of the way some. We arrived at Brother Ross's. They had nothing in the home to eat. I tended a babe, held it in one arm and prepared my dinner myself. Made a little mush, cooked some eggs and put on a few cold gems. This composed my dinner, birthday dinner, half a century old! Not much display in this. Then our birth does not amount to much. It is not of much consequence in regard to our birth--not half as much as in regard to our lives. How do we live? Our daily life will either honor or dishonor the day of our birth.--Letter 39, 1877, p. 1. (To \"Dear Children, Willie and Mary,\" November 27, 1877.)",
