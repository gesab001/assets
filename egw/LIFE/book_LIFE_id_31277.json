    "word": "An atheist or an irreligious man should never take up the work of a physician. The godless physician watches with human sympathy the sufferings of the afflicted: but he cannot do that which he might do did he realize that the One who gave his own life for the sufferer, even the Son of God, is watching the case with intense interest. How inconsistent for a physician to stand by the side of the suffering if he cannot point them to a sin-pardoning Saviour. How terrible not to be able to tell them of the Mighty One who can heal not only every physical disease but every spiritual malady.",
