    "word": "How, then, can the gospel be called a message of peace? When Isaiah foretold the birth of the Messiah, he ascribed to him the title, \u201cPrince of peace.\u201d When angels announced to the shepherds that Christ was born, they sung above the plains of Bethlehem, \u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\u201d [Luke 2:14.] There is a seeming contradiction between these prophetic declarations and the words of Christ, \u201cI came not to send peace, but a sword.\u201d [Matthew 10:34.] But rightly understood, the two are in perfect harmony. The gospel is a message of peace. Christianity is a system, which, received and obeyed, would spread peace, harmony, and happiness throughout the earth. The religion of Christ will unite in close brotherhood all who accept its teachings. It was the mission of Jesus to reconcile men to God, and \n47\nthus to one another. But the world at large are under the control of Satan, Christ's bitterest foe. The gospel presents to them principles of life which are wholly at variance with their habits and desires, and they rise in rebellion against it. They hate the purity which reveals and condemns their sins, and they persecute and destroy those who would urge upon them its just and holy claims. It is in this sense\u2014 because the exalted truths it brings, occasion hatred and strife\u2014that the gospel is called a sword.",
