G. White. \n                                                                -\n \n                             (Concluded.) \n\n\n     Christ says, \"I am the way, the truth , and the life;\" and it is the privilege of every soul to make Christ his personal Saviour. You need not wait to grow good; you need not think that any effort of yours will make your prayers acceptable, and bring you salvation. Let each man and woman pray to God, not to man. Let each one come to Christ in humility, speak to him with your own lips. The request, \"Will you pray for me?\" has become simply a form of speech; you should pray to God for yourself, believing that he listens to every word you utter. Lay bare your heart for his inspection, confess your sins, asking him to forgive you, pleading the merits of the atonement, and then by faith contemplate the great scheme of redemption, and the Comforter will bring all things to your remembrance.",
