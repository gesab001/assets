    "word": "O precious Saviour, I long for Thy salvation.  \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee\" (Psalm 42:1).  I long for a clearer view of Jesus.  I love to think of His spotless life, to meditate upon His lessons.  How many times I repeat the words, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28).",
