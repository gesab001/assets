The brethren there were all poor, and we suffered many privations. We boarded in Bro. A.'s family. We were willing to live cheap that the paper might be sustained. My husband was a dyspeptic. We could not eat meat \n                                                                           144\nor butter, and were obliged to abstain from all greasy food. Take these from a poor man's table, and it leaves a very spare diet. Our labors were so great that we needed nourishing food. We had much care, and often sat up as late as midnight, and sometimes until two or three in the morning to read proof-sheets. We could have better borne these extra exertions could we have had the sympathy of our brethren in Paris, and had they appreciated our labors and the efforts we were making to advance the cause of truth. Mental labor and privation reduced the strength of my husband very fast.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 143}
