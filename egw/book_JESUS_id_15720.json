{"word": "When Philip came to Jesus with the request, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us,\" the Saviour answered him: \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?\" Christ declares Himself to be sent into the world as a representative of the Father. In His nobility of character, in His mercy and tender pity, in His love and goodness, He stands before us as the embodiment of divine perfection, the image of the invisible God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 739}
