    "word": "The Work of the Evangelist \n\n     Teaching the Scriptures, praying in families--this is the work of the evangelist, and this work is to be mingled with preaching. If it is omitted, preaching will, to a great extent, be a failure. Come close to the people by personal efforts. Teach them that the love of God must come into the sanctuary of the home life.",
