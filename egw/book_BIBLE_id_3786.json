{"word": "Effective Use of Scripture and Song.--I spoke in the afternoon on the subject of temperance, taking the first chapter of Daniel as my text. All listened attentively, seeming surprised to hear temperance presented from the Bible. After dwelling on the integrity and firmness of the Hebrew captives, I asked the choir to sing, \"Dare to be a Daniel, dare to stand alone! Dare to have a purpose firm! Dare to make it known!\" The inspiring notes of this song rang out from the singers on the stand, who were joined by the congregation. I then resumed my talk, and I know that before I had finished, many present had a better understanding of the meaning of Christian temperance. The Lord gave me freedom and His blessing, and a most solemn impression was left upon many minds.--Letter 42, 1900.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 265}
