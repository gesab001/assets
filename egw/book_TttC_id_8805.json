    "word": "Now, with John the Baptist, we are to point men to Jesus, saying: \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29. Now as never before is to be sounded the invitation: \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.\" \"The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\" John 7:37; Revelation 22:17.",
