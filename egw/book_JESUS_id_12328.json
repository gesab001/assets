Debasing practices have been forced upon them, and they have received low conceptions of life, and even their conceptions of the Christian life are of a depraved order. But the people who have been more favorably situated, who have had light and liberty, who have had an opportunity to know God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, are responsible \n                                                                           32\nfor the moral darkness that enshrouds their colored brethren. Can they who have been so highly privileged afford to stand in their pride and importance and feel that they are altogether too good to associate with this depraved race? Let those who profess to be Christians look to the example of Christ. He stooped to take human nature, in order that He might be able to reach man where he was. The Majesty of heaven came to seek and to save that which was lost; and shall those for whom Christ has done so much, stand aloof from their fellow men who are now perishing in their sins?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SW", "page": 31}
