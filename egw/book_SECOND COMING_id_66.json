{"word": "PROPHESYINGS WHICH CONTRADICT THE PLAIN AND POSITIVE DECLARATIONS OF THE WORD, ARE TO BE REJECTED. THUS OUR SAVIOUR TAUGHT HIS DISCIPLES WHEN HE WARNED THEM CONCERNING THE MANNER OF HIS SECOND COMING. WHEN JESUS ASCENDED TO HEAVEN IN THE SIGHT OF HIS DISCIPLES, IT WAS DECLARED MOST EXPLICITLY BY THE ANGELS THAT THIS SAME JESUS SHOULD SO COME IN LIKE MANNER AS THEY HAD SEEN HIM GO INTO HEAVEN. HENCE JESUS, IN PREDICTING THE WORK OF THE FALSE PROPHETS OF THE LAST DAYS, SAYS, \"IF THEY SHALL SAY UNTO YOU, BEHOLD, HE IS IN THE DESERT; GO NOT FORTH: BEHOLD, HE IS IN THE SECRET CHAMBERS, BELIEVE IT NOT.\" ALL TRUE PROPHESYING ON THAT POINT MUST RECOGNIZE HIS VISIBLE COMING FROM HEAVEN. WHY DID NOT JESUS SAY, REJECT ALL PROPHESYING AT THAT TIME; FOR THERE WILL BE NO TRUE PROPHETS THEN?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 139}
