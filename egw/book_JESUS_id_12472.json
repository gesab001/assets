{"word": "The teacher may understand many things in regard to the physical universe; he may know all about the structure of living things, the inventions of mechanical art, the discoveries of natural science; but he cannot be called educated unless he has a knowledge of the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he has sent. A principle of divine origin must pervade our conduct and bind us to God. This will not be in any way a hindrance to the study of true science. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the man who consents to be molded and fashioned after the divine similitude, is the noblest specimen of the work of God. All who live in communion with our Creator will have an understanding of his designs in their creation, and they \n                                                                           205\nwill have a sense of their own accountability to God to employ their faculties to the very best purpose. They will seek neither to glorify nor to depreciate themselves.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 204}
