{"word": "Chap. 48 - The Great Lesson Book\n\n     The Sanitarium is a broad missionary field. Your medical students, in studying the word of God diligently, are far better prepared for all other studies; for enlightenment comes always with an earnest study of the word. Let it be understood by medical missionaries that the better acquainted they become with God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent, the better acquainted they become with Bible history, the better qualified they will be to do their work. The students in the College at Battle Creek need to aspire to higher knowledge, and nothing can give them a knowledge of all lessons, and a retentive memory, like the searching of the Scriptures. Let there be genuine discipline in study. There should be a most humble, prayerful longing of soul to know the truth.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 390}
