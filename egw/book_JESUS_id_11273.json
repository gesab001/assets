{"word": "Look Beyond the Shadows \n\n     Jesus lives; He has risen, He has risen, He is alive forevermore. Do not feel that you carry the load. It is true you wear the yoke, but whom are you yoked up with?--No less a personage than your Redeemer. Satan will cast his hellish shadow athwart your pathway; you cannot expect anything else; but he cast the same dark shadow athwart the pathway of Christ. Now all you have to do is to look beyond the shadow to the brightness of Christ. . . . Do not look at the discouragements; think of how precious is Jesus. \n                                                                           327", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 326}
