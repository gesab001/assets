{"word": "Strict Economy.--Let all who take up the work in our large cities be careful in this respect--in no place should there be any needless expenditure of money. It is not by outward display that men and women are to learn what is comprehended by present truth. Our workers are to practice strict economy. God forbids all extravagance. Every dollar at our command is to be expended with economy. No great display is to be made. God's money is to be used to carry forward in His own way the work that He has declared must be done in our world.--Letter 107, 1905. \n                                                                           86", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 85}
