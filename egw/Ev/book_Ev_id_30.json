{"word": "Ambassadors for Christ.--Ministers of God, with hearts aglow with love for Christ and your fellow men, seek to arouse those who are dead in trespasses and sins. Let your earnest entreaties and warnings pierce their consciences. Let your fervent prayers melt their hearts, and lead them in penitence to the Saviour. You are ambassadors for Christ, to proclaim His message of salvation.--Gospel Workers, p. 35 (1915)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 22}
