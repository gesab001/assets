{"word": "Do Not Miss the Mark.--Do not encourage the presentation of Scripture in any way to encourage vainglory in the one who shall open the Word to others. The work for this time is to bring students and workers to the place where they will deal with subjects in a serious, solemn, plain manner, that there may be no time uselessly employed in this great work. Do not miss the mark. Time is too short to reveal all that might be opened up to view; eternity will be required to know the length and breadth, the depth and height of the Scriptures. There are truths of more importance to some souls than others. Skill is needed in educating in Scriptural lines.-- Manuscript 153, 1898.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 296}
