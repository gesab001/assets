The theaters and halls present so many objectionable phases that we think we shall use the skating rink, which has lately been used for religious and temperance meetings. . . .

God will make a place for His own truth to come to the people, for this is the way He has wrought.--Letter 79, 1893.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 39}
