{"word": "Reward of Soul Winning.--A rich reward will be given to the true workers, who put all there is of them into the work. There is no greater bliss on this side of heaven than in winning souls to Christ. Joy fills the heart as the workers realize that this great miracle could never have been wrought by human agencies, but only through the One who loves souls ready to perish. The divine presence is close beside every true worker, making souls penitent. Thus the Christian brotherhood is formed. The worker and those worked for are touched with the love of Christ. Heart touches heart, and the blending of soul with soul is like the heavenly intercourse between ministering angels.--Manuscript 36, 1901.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 333}
