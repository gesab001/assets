{"word": "Mrs. D, a lady occupying a position in the institution, was visiting at Sr. _____'s room one day, when the latter took out of her trunk a gold necklace and chain, and said she wished to dispose of this jewelry and put the proceeds into the Lord's treasury. Said the other, \"Why do you sell it? I would wear it if it was mine.\" \"Why,\" replied Sr. _____, \"when I received the truth, I was taught that all these things must be laid aside. Surely they are contrary to the teachings of God's Word.\" And she cited her hearer to the words of the apostles, Paul and Peter, upon this point, \"In like manner, also, that women adorn \n                                                                           271\nthemselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but, as becometh women professing godliness, with good works.\" \"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel. But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 270}
