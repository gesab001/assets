{"word": "True Medical Missionary Work.--The lesson that we need to learn is, What is true medical missionary work in practical gospel lines? Let us keep before the people everywhere the terms of eternal life, as given in the Word of God. Those who obey this Word, reverently giving God the honor that is due Him, will show in their practice that they have a knowledge of what constitutes true medical missionary work. Self is to be humbled, not exalted. . . . It is of great consequence that all who claim to understand gospel medical missionary work, teach the principles of truth.--Manuscript 126, 1905.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 519}
