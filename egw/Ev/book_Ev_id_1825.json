{"word": "In this miracle Christ has shown how medical missionary work is to be bound up with the ministry of the Word. His disciples are to take the bread of life and the water of salvation, and give it to those who are longing for spiritual help. And as there is need, they are to feed the hungry and clothe the naked. Thus they do double service for the Master. The beauty and utility of the work we do for God consists in its symmetry and harmony and in its all-round adaptability and efficiency.--Manuscript 5, 1901.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 524}
