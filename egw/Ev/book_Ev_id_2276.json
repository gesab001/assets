{"word": "Be Not Slothful.--Labor for those who are loitering away their lives, accomplishing only half of what they might for the Master. Strive to arouse them to a sense of their responsibility. Pray for and exhort one another, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching. Let brother say to brother and sister to sister, \"Come, my fellow laborer, let us put all earnestness into our work; for the night is at hand, wherein no man can work.\" Let no one lose minutes by talking when he should be working.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 653}
