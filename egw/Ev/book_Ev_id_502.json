{"word": "Great Themes--Up-to-Date Message.--Those who stand before the people as teachers of truth are to grapple with great themes. They are not to occupy precious time in talking of trivial subjects. Let them study the Word, and preach the Word. Let the Word be in their hands as a sharp, two-edged sword. Let it testify to past truths and show what is to be in the future.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 151}
