{"word": "It is the divine plan that we shall work as the disciples worked. Connected with the divine Healer, we may do great good in the world. The gospel is the only antidote for sin. As Christ's witnesses we are to bear testimony to its power. We are to bring the afflicted ones to the Saviour. His transforming grace and miracle-working power will win many souls to the truth. His healing power, united with the gospel message, will bring success in emergencies. The Holy Spirit will work upon hearts, and we shall see the salvation of God. In a special sense the healing of the sick is our work. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 544}
