{"word": "Workers Who Can Give Spiritual Help.--In our sanitariums, of all places in the world, we need soundly converted physicians and wise workers--men and women who will not urge their peculiar ideas upon the sick, but who will present the truths of the Word of God in a way that will bring comfort and encouragement and blessing to the patients. This is the work for which our sanitariums are established--to correctly represent the truths of the Word of God and to lead the minds of men and women to Christ.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 538}
