{"word": "Judge by the Fruit of the Life.--There is one thing that we have no right to do, and that is to judge another man's heart or impugn his motives. But when a person presents himself as a candidate for church membership, we are to examine the fruit of his life, and leave the responsibility of his motive with himself. But great care should be exercised in accepting members into the church; for Satan has his specious devices through which he purposes to crowd false brethren into the church, through whom he can work more successfully to weaken the cause of God.--Review and Herald, Jan. 10, 1893.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 313}
