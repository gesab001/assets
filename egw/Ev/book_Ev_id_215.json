{"word": "God never designed that, as a rule, His servants should go out singly to labor. To illustrate: Here are two brothers. They are not of the same temperament; their minds do not run in the same channel. One is in danger of doing too much; the other fails to carry the burdens that he should. If associated together, these might have a molding influence upon each other, so that the extremes in their characters would not stand out so prominently in their labors. It might not be necessary for them to be together in every meeting; but they could labor in places ten, fifteen or even thirty miles apart,--near enough together, however, so that if one came to a crisis in his labors, he could call on the other for assistance. They should also come together as often as possible for prayer and consultation. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 73}
