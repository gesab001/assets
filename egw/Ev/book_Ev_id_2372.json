They should stand right by the side of older and experienced ministers, where they could educate them. But they should say to them, \"You must not copy my gestures, nor the tone of my voice, so that nobody will know whether you are speaking or whether I am speaking.

You are not to take my phase of character, nor my gestures, nor my tone of voice, nor my expressions, nor my words.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 684}
