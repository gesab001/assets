{"word": "A Challenge to the Leaders.--I ask those who have charge of our work: Why are so many places passed by? Look upon the towns and cities yet unworked. There are many large cities in America, not only in the South, but in the North, yet to be worked. In every city in America there should be some memorial for God. But I could mention many places where the light of truth has not yet shone. The angels of heaven are waiting for human instrumentalities to enter the places where witness has not yet been borne to present truth.-- Review and Herald, Dec. 30, 1902.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 60}
