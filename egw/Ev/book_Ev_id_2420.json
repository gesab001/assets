{"word": "Power for Finishing the Work \n\n     Why Many Have Failed in Soul Winning.--Many present the doctrines and theories of our faith; but their presentation is as salt without savor; for the Holy Spirit is not working through their faithless ministry. They have not opened the heart to receive the grace of Christ; they know not the operation of the Spirit; they are as meal without leaven; for there is no working principle in all their labor, and they fail to win souls to Christ. They do not appropriate the righteousness of Christ; it is a robe unworn by them, a fullness unknown, a fountain untouched.--Review and Herald, Nov. 29, 1892.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 697}
