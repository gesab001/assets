{"word": "Elder _____'s Church.--In working for those who are converted under your labors, you would be highly pleased if they were called Elder_____'s church. You would like to manipulate their minds in such a way that they would be guided by sentiments of your choosing. But God forbid! In fastening minds to yourself, you lead them to disconnect from the Source of their wisdom and efficiency. Their dependence must not be in you but be wholly in God. Only thus can they grow in grace. They are dependent on Him for success, for usefulness, for power to be laborers together with God.--Letter 39, 1902.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 331}
