{"word": "Find Your Way to Their Hearts.-- Wherever you can gain access to the people by the fireside, improve your opportunity. Take your Bible, and open before them its great truths. Your success will not depend so much upon your knowledge and accomplishments, as upon your ability to find your way to the heart. By being social and coming close to the people, you may turn the current of their thoughts more readily than by the most able discourse.--Gospel Workers, p. 193. (1915)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 483}
