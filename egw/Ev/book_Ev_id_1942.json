Their own train of thoughts and associations lose eternity out of their reckoning. They grow more proud and selfish, hardhearted and unimpressible, suspicious that every one wants to get money, while the poor are envious of the rich, who need pity rather than to be envied. Bring these all under the power of saving truth, and the work of the upbuilding of the kingdom of God will go forward with much greater success.-- Manuscript 66, 1894.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 556}
