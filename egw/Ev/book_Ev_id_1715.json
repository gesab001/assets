{"word": "A Continual Sermon.--These words [song of Moses] were repeated unto all Israel, and formed a song which was often sung, poured forth in exalted strains of melody. \n                                                                           497\nThis was the wisdom of Moses to present the truth to them in song, that in strains of melody they should become familiar with them, and be impressed upon the minds of the whole nation, young and old. It was important for the children to learn the song; for this would speak to them, to warn, to restrain, to reprove, and encourage. It was a continual sermon. --Manuscript 71, 1897.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 496}
