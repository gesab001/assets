{"word": "Go Work for Souls.--Instead of keeping the ministers at work for the churches that already know the truth, let the members of the churches say to these laborers: \"Go work for souls that are perishing in darkness. We ourselves will carry forward the services of the church. We will keep up the meetings, and, by abiding in Christ, will maintain spiritual life. We will work for souls that are about us, and we will send our prayers and our gifts to sustain the laborers in more needy and destitute fields.\"--Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 30.
