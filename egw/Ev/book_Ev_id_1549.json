{"word": "An Effective Use of Literature.--There was one man whom, with his whole family, we highly prized. He is a reading man, and has a large farm, on which grow the choicest of oranges and lemons, with other fruit. But he did not in the beginning fully take his position for the truth, and went back. They told me about this. In the night season the angel of the Lord seemed to stand by me, saying, \"Go to Brother _____, place your books before him, and this will save his soul.\" I visited with him, taking with me a few of my large books. I talked with him just as though he were with us. I talked of his responsibilities. I said, \"You have great responsibilities, my brother. Here are your neighbors all around you. You are accountable for every one of them. You have a knowledge of the truth, and if you love the truth, and stand in your integrity, you will win souls for Christ.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 451}
