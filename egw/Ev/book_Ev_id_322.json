{"word": "Different in Temperament, but United in Spirit.-- In our home we have no dissension, no words of impatience. \n                                                                           103\nMy workers are different in temperament, and their ways and manners are different, but we blend in action and stand united in spirit, seeking to help and strengthen one another. We know that we cannot afford to be a variance because we differ in temperament. We are God's little children, and we ask Him to help us to live, not to please ourselves and to have our own way, but to please and glorify Him.--Letter 252, 1903.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 102}
