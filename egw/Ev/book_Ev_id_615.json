{"word": "If from any cause you are tired and exhausted, for Christ's sake do not attempt to give a discourse. Let another who is not thus exhausted speak, short, to the point, or else have a Bible reading; anything but sickly discourses. These will do less harm where all are believers, but when the truth is to be proclaimed before a people who are not in the faith, the speaker must prepare himself for the task. He must not ramble all through the Bible but give a clear, connected discourse, showing that he understands the points he would make.--Letter 48, 1886.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 181}
