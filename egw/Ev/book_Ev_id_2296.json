{"word": "Avoid Strain of Overwork.--I hear of workers whose health is breaking down under the strain of the burdens they are bearing. This ought not to be. God desires us to remember that we are mortal. We are not to embrace too much in our work. We are not to keep ourselves under such a strain that our physical and mental powers shall be exhausted. More workers are needed, that some of the burdens may be removed from those now so heavily loaded down.--Review and Herald, April 28, 1904.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 660}
