{"word": "At the Feasts.--When invited to a feast, Christ  accepted the invitation, that He might, while sitting at the table, sow the seeds of truth in the hearts of those present. He knew that the seed thus sown would spring up and bring forth fruit. He knew that some of those sitting at meat with Him would afterward respond to His call, \"Follow Me.\" Ours is the privilege of studying Christ's manner of teaching as He went from place to place, everywhere sowing the seeds of truth.--Manuscript 113, 1902.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 58}
