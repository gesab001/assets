{"word": "Christ's Method of Training.--In their association with the Master the disciples obtained a practical training for missionary work. They saw how He presented truth, and how He dealt with the perplexing questions that arose in His ministry. They saw His ministry in healing the sick wherever He went; they heard Him preach the gospel to the poor. In our day, from the record of His life, all must learn His methods of working.--Letter 208a, 1902.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 109}
