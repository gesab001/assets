{"word": "The simple Word of God has great power to convince of the truth. Let the Word speak and do its work. Let there be wise restraint in evangelistic effort.

Let the words and works show that you believe the words of the living Teacher.--Letter 308, 1906.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 540}
