{"word": "Medical Evangelism in the Cities \n\n     From City to City and Town to Town.--To all people, rich and poor, free and bond, Christ, the Messenger of the covenant, brought the tidings of salvation. How the people flocked to Him! From far and near they came for healing, and He healed them all. His fame as the Great Healer spread throughout Palestine, from Jerusalem to Syria. The sick came to the places through which they thought He would pass, \n                                                                           533\nthat they might call on Him for help, and He healed them of their diseases. Hither, too, came the rich, anxious to hear His words and to receive a touch of His hand. Thus He went from city to city, from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing the sick--the King of glory in the lowly garb of humanity. --Review and Herald, July 23, 1914.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 532}
