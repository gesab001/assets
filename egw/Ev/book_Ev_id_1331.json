Besides New York City, where you labored last summer, there is the important city of Boston, near which is situated the Melrose Sanitarium. And I know of no place where there is a greater need for a rebuilding of the first works than in Boston and in Portland, Maine, where the first messages were given in power, but where now there is but a little handful of our people.--Letter 4, 1910.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 389}
