{"word": "The Cities of Northern Europe \n\n     Come Up to the Help of the Lord.--In my last vision I was shown the importance of the work in Northern Europe. The people are awakening to the truth. The Lord has given Elder Matteson a testimony to reach hearts. But the work is just entered upon. With judicious, self-sacrificing labor, many souls will be brought to the knowledge of the truth. There should be several unselfish, God-fearing workers in this missionary field, who will labor for souls as they that must give account in the day of judgment.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 419}
