{"word": "Converted Jews in the Closing Work.--There will be many converted from among the Jews, and these converts will aid in preparing the way of the Lord, and making straight in the desert a highway for our God. Converted Jews are to have an important part to act in the great preparations to be made in the future to receive Christ, our Prince. A nation shall be born in a day. How? By men whom God has appointed being converted to the truth. There will be seen \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" The predictions of prophecy will be fulfilled.--Manuscript 75, 1905.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 579}
