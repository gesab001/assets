{"word": "Tactful Methods, Not Deception.--You need not feel that all the truth is to be spoken to unbelievers on any and every occasion. You should plan carefully what to say and what to leave unsaid. This is not practicing deception; it is to work as Paul worked. He says, \"Being crafty, I caught you with guile.\" \n                                                                           126\nYou must vary your labor, and not have one way which you think must be followed at all times and in all places. Your ways may seem to you a success, but if you used more tact, more of the wisdom of the serpent, you would have seen much more real results of your work.--Letter 12, 1887.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 125}
