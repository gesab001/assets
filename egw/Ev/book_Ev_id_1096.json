{"word": "Conversion, Not Just Baptism.--Salvation is not to be baptized, not to have our names upon the church books, not to preach the truth. But it is a living union with Jesus Christ to be renewed in heart, doing the works of Christ in faith and labor of love, in patience, meekness, and hope. Every soul united to Christ will be a living missionary to all around him. --Letter 55, 1886.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 319}
