{"word": "False Sanctification and Holiness \n\n     Beware of Doctrine \"Just Believe.\"--We shall meet with false doctrines of every kind, and unless we are acquainted with what Christ has said, and are following His instruction, we shall be led astray. One of the most dangerous of these doctrines is that of false sanctification. There are those who claim to be holy, and yet are breaking God's commandments. Their assertion that they are sinless is false and should not be received. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 595}
