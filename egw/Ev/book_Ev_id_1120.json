{"word": "Length of Effort and Closing \n                  The Campaign \n\n\n     Length of Effort Not to be Prescribed.--Bear in mind that no living man can tell the precise work, or bound the work of a man who is in God's service. No one can prescribe the days, the weeks, that one should remain in a certain locality before pushing on to another place. Circumstances must shape the labors of the minister of God, and if he seeks God he will understand that his work embraces every part of the Lord's vineyard, both that which is nigh and that which is afar off. The laborer is not to confine his work to a specified measurement. He must have no circumscribed limits, but extend his labors wherever necessity demands. God is his co-laborer; he should seek wisdom and counsel of Him at every step and not depend upon human counsel. \n                                                                           327", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 326}
