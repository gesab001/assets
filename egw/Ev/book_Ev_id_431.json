{"word": "Christ Not Called Professor.--It is not the seeking to climb to eminence that will make you great in God's sight, but it is the humble life of goodness, meekness, fidelity, and purity that will make you the object of the heavenly angels' special guardianship. The pattern Man, who thought it not robbery to be equal with God, took upon Himself our nature and lived nearly thirty years in an obscure Galilean town, hidden among the hills. All the angel host was at His command; yet He did not claim to be anything great or exalted. He did not attach \"Professor\" to His name to please Himself. He was a carpenter, working for wages, a servant to those for whom He labored.--Letter 1, 1880.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 132}
