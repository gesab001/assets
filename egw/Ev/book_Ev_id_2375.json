{"word": "Young Men Called to Front-Line Service.--Men of gray hairs should walk circumspectly and should give the young men who are seeking to grow, every opportunity to come to the front. The older men should not feel it any dishonor to them for younger men, who must use their capabilities and who must fill their individual places and become men to be relied on, to come to the front. Those who are older should encourage the young to develop their talents.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 685}
