{"word": "According to the teaching of the Scriptures, it dishonors God to address ministers as \"Reverend.\" No mortal has any right to attach this to his own name or to the name of any other human being. It belongs only to God, to distinguish Him from every other being. Those who lay claim to this title take to themselves God's holy honor. They have no right to the stolen word, whatever their position may be. \"Holy and reverend is His name.\" We dishonor God when we use this word where it does not belong.--Youth's Instructor, July 7, 1898.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 133}
