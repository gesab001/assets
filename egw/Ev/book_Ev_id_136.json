{"word": "Missionary Families for Towns and Villages.-- Brethren who wish to change their location, who have the glory of God in view, and feel that individual responsibility rests upon them to do others good, to benefit and save souls for whom Christ withheld not His precious life, should move into towns and villages where there is little or no light and where they can be of real service and bless others with their labor and experience. Missionaries are wanted to go into towns and villages, and raise the standard of truth, that God may have His witnesses scattered all over the land, that the light of truth may penetrate where is has not yet reached, and the standard of truth be raised where it is not yet known. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 52}
