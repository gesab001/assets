{"word": "Poor Hall Advertises Defeat.--I am convinced that we might have had a good hearing if our brethren had secured a suitable hall to accommodate the people. But they did not expect much, and therefore did not receive much. We cannot expect people to come out to hear unpopular truth when the meetings are advertised to be held in a basement, or in a small hall that will seat only a hundred persons. . . . By their lack of faith our laborers sometimes make the work very hard for themselves.--Historical Sketches, p. 200. (1886)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 126}
