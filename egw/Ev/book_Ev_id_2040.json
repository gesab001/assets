{"word": "Open-Air Temperance Meetings.--We ought to be at work in the dark corners of the earth. . . . I have frequently stood in the open air to speak to companies gathered to hear me. I have seen women with children in their arms standing for an hour to listen to me. There were men and women all around me. I have asked them, \"How many of you have an intelligent faith in Jesus Christ? How many are Christians? Those who are, hold up your hands.\" Not a hand would be raised. Did they not need Christ? Did they not need a knowledge of the truth? Did they not need to learn lessons of temperance? Indeed they did.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 587}
