{"word": "Avoid Sickly Discourses.--Short, plainly made points, avoiding all rambling, will be of the greatest advantage. God would not have you exhaust your energies before you come into the meeting, either in writing or in any other employment, for when you come with a tired mind you give a very imperfect discourse to the people. Put your freshest energies into the work and let not the slightest dullness of imperfectness be seen in any of your efforts.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 181}
