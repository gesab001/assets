{"word": "Sounding the Call in New Places.--Our Saviour's work was to warn the cities and to ordain workers to go out of the cities to places where the light had never yet been given, and to lift up the standard of truth in new localities. . . .The light is given me that we must not have special anxiety to crowd too many interests into one locality, but should look for places in out-of-the-way districts and work in new places. Thus people may be reached and converted who know nothing of the precious, testing truths for this time. The last call should be made just as important in new places in this country as in distant lands. This word  was spoken concerning some localities that have not had the message brought to them. The seeds of truth are to be sown in uncultivated centers. . . .It will cultivate a missionary spirit to work in new localities. Selfishness in respect to keeping large companies together is not the Lord's plan. Enter every new place possible and begin the work of educating in vicinities that have not heard the truth.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 47}
