{"word": "This was the method of Christ's teaching. As he spoke to the people, they would question as to His meaning. To those who were humbly seeking for light, He was always ready to explain His words. But Christ did not encourage criticism or caviling, nor should we. When men try to provoke a discussion of controverted points of doctrine, tell them that the meeting was not appointed for that purpose.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 153}
