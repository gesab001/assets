{"word": "Explaining the Word.--Right where you are, right where the people are, let earnest effort be put forth. The Word of God has been, as it were, hid under a bushel. That Word must be explained to those who are now in ignorance of its requirements. Search the Scriptures with those who are willing to be taught. The work may be small in its beginning, but others will unite to carry it forward; and as in faith and dependence on God earnest labor is put forth to enlighten and instruct the people in the simple truths of the Word, those who listen will catch the meaning of true discipleship.--Letter 30, 1911.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 458}
