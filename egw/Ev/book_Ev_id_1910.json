{"word": "Balancing Cautions \n\n     Our Threefold Ministry.--God works by means of instruments, or second causes. He uses the gospel ministry, medical missionary work, and the publications containing present truth to impress hearts. All are made effectual by means of faith. As the truth is heard or read, the Holy Spirit sends it home to those who hear and read with an earnest desire to know what is right. The gospel ministry, medical missionary work, and our publications are God's agencies. One is not to supersede the other.--Letter 54, 1903.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 547}
