{"word": "Responsibility of Spiritual Laymen \n                   to New Converts \n\n\n     Church Patiently to Help New Converts.--Those who have newly come to the faith should be patiently and tenderly dealt with, and it is the duty of the older members of the church to devise ways and means to provide help and sympathy and instruction for those who have conscientiously withdrawn from other churches for the truth's sake, and thus cut themselves off from the pastoral labor to which they have been accustomed. The church has a special responsibility laid upon her to attend to these souls who have followed the first rays of light they have received; and if the members of the church neglect this duty, they will be unfaithful to the trust that God has given them.--Review and Herald, April 28, 1896.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 351}
