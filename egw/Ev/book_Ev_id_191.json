{"word": "The cities are to be worked. A season of great trial is before us. Then let none lift up the soul unto vanity. It becomes those who are striving for the crown of life to strive lawfully. All our capabilities and gifts are to be used in the work of saving perishing souls, thus winning others to become co-laborers with Christ. The knowledge and powers that the Lord has given men and women will be largely increased as they work to build up His kingdom.--Manuscript 19, 1910.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 67}
