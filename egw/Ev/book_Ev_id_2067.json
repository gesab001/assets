{"word": "Another Error--Commandments Done Away.-- Christ warns His followers, \"Beware of false prophets, \n                                                                           598\nwhich come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\" He exhorts us not to be deceived when false shepherds present their doctrines. These men tell us that the commandments of God were done away at the death of Christ. Shall we believe them, these men who claim to be sanctified, while they refuse to obey God? They say the Lord has told them that they need not keep the Ten Commandments; but has the Lord told them this? No, God does not lie.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 597}
