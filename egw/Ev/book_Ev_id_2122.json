{"word": "We Shall Have to Meet Erroneous Teaching.-- Again and again we shall be called to meet the influence of men who are studying sciences of satanic origin, through which Satan is working to make a nonentity of God and of Christ.

Christ declared, \"I and My \n                                                                           614\nFather are one.\" Yet it was the Son of God who came to the world in human form. Laying aside His royal robe and kingly crown, He clothed His divinity with humanity, that humanity through His infinite sacrifice might become partakers of the divine nature, and escape the corruption that is in the world through lust.--Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 68.
