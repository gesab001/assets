{"word": "No Pulling to Pieces Another's Work.--Remember that we are laborers together with God. God is the all-powerful, effectual mover. His servants are His instruments. They are not to pull apart, everyone laboring in accordance with his own ideas. They are to labor in harmony, fitting together in kindly, courteous, brotherly order, in love for one another. There is to be no unkind criticism, no pulling to pieces of another's work. Together they are to carry the work forward.--Review and Herald, Dec. 11, 1900.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 106}
