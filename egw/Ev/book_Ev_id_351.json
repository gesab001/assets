{"word": "Twenty Souls Instead of One.--There is a vast amount of rubbish brought forward by professed believers in Christ, which blocks up the way to the cross. Notwithstanding all this, there are some who are so deeply convicted that they will come through every discouragement, and will surmount every obstacle in order to gain the truth. But had the believers in the truth purified their minds by obeying it, had they felt the importance of knowledge and refinement of manners in Christ's work, where one soul has been saved there might have been twenty.--Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 68.
