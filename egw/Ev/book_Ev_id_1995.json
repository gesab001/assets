{"word": "City Bases for Foreign Work.--We drove out to see the newly established Swedish Mission on Oak Street [in Chicago]. There we were shown a building which our Swedish brethren, under the leadership of Elder -----, have recently purchased for the headquarters of their work in Chicago. The building presents a good appearance. In the basement they have a  well-equipped vegetarian restaurant. On the first floor there is a pleasant, commodious hall for meetings, comfortably seated for a congregation of about one hundred and fifty, and the two upper stories are rented to lodgers. I was indeed glad to see this evidence of progress in the Swedish work in Chicago.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 572}
