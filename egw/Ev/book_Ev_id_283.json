{"word": "Chap. 5 - Organizing for Evangelistic Meetings\n\n           Methods and Organization \n\n     A Great Work by Simple Means.--The striking feature of divine operations is the accomplishment of the greatest work that can be done in our world by very simple means. It is God's plan that every part of His government shall depend on every other part, the whole as a wheel within a wheel, working with entire harmony. He moves upon human forces, causing His Spirit to touch invisible chords, and the vibration rings to the extremity of the universe.--Manuscript 22, 1897.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 93}
