{"word": "Rising at Regular Time.--Some youth are much opposed to order and discipline. They do not respect the rules of the home by rising at a regular hour. They lie in bed some hours after daylight, when everyone should be astir. They burn the midnight oil, depending upon artificial light to supply the place of the light that nature has provided at seasonable hours. In so doing they not only waste precious opportunities but cause additional expense. But in almost every case the plea is made, \"I cannot get through my work; I have something to do; I cannot retire early.\" Thus they are sleeping soundly when they should be awake with nature and the early-rising birds. The precious habits of order are broken; and the moments thus idled away in the early morning set things out of course for the whole day.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 651}
