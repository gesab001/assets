{"word": "Cheap, Common, Earthly Matters \n\n     Such experiences as these came to be very common. Several in one family were under this species of deception. . . . Messages would be given for different members of the church, telling some poor trembling soul, \"You are proud\"; another, \"You are unbelieving; you will be lost.\" The Lord gave me light in this instance to speak words of comfort and encouragement. I bore my testimony to those deceived ones, whether they would hear, or reject it. Their visions were Satan's work. The things revealed were often common, earthly matters, such as, who should get breakfast the next morning, who should prepare the dinner, who should wash the dishes. Mingled with these frivolous things were sacred truths, which they had found in the Bible and testimonies. Satan's hand was in all this, to disgust people, and cause them to spurn everything in the nature of visions. Thus the false and the true would be rejected together. And even those who were engaged in the deception, when they should become weary of it, would be inclined to doubt all visions.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 77}
