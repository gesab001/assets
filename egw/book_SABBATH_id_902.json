{"word": "The Lord commands by the same prophet, \\93Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.\\94 [Isaiah 8:16.] The seal of God's law is found in the fourth commandment. This only, of all ten, brings to view both the name and the title of \n452\nthe Lawgiver. It declares him to be the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and thus shows his claim to reverence and worship above all others. Aside from this precept, there is nothing in the decalogue to show by whose authority the law is given. When the Sabbath was changed by the papal power, the seal was taken from the law. The disciples of Jesus are called upon to restore it, by exalting the Sabbath of the fourth commandment to its rightful position as the Creator's memorial and the sign of his authority.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 451}
