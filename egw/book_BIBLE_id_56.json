{"word": "The City Mission and Training School \n\n     A well-balanced work can be carried on best when a training school for Bible workers is in progress. While the public meetings are being held, connected with this training school or city mission should be experienced laborers of deep spiritual understanding, \n                                                                           20\nwho can give the Bible workers daily instruction, and who can also unite wholeheartedly in the general public effort being put forth. And as men and women are converted to the truth, those standing at the head of the city mission should, with much prayer, show these new converts how to experience the power of the truth in their lives. This united effort on the part of all the workers would be as a nail driven in a sure place.--Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 111, 112.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "CME", "page": 19}
