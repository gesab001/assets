{"word": "(Ezekiel 18:20-24;  33:12-16; Romans 11:4-6;  1:2; 2 Peter 1:10;  2:15-21.) No Unconditional Election.--[2 Peter 1:2-10 quoted.] Here is the condition of the only saving election in the Word of God. We are to become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. We are to add grace to grace, and the promise is, \"If ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\"", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1114}
