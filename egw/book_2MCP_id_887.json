{"word": "No Reason for Despair.--None need abandon themselves to discouragement and despair. Satan may come to you with the cruel suggestion: \"Yours is a hopeless case. You are irredeemable.\" But there is hope for you in Christ. God does not bid us overcome in our own strength. He asks us to come close to His side. Whatever difficulties we labor under, which weigh down soul and body, He waits to make us free.--MH 249 (1905). \n\n\n                                                       631", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 630}
