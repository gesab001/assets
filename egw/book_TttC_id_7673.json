    "word": "Here are positive directions that reach down to our time. God is speaking to us in these last days, and He will be understood and obeyed. God spoke to Israel through His servants: \"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then \n                                                                           329\nthou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.\" \"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.\" \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\"",
