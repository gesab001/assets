{"word": "Willing Ignorance a Sin \n\n     Guilt rests upon us as a people who have had much light, because we have not appreciated or improved the light given upon health reform. Through misunderstanding and perverted ideas many souls are deceived. Those \n                                                                           506\nwho teach the truth to others and who should be shepherds of the flock will be held accountable for their willing ignorance and disregard of nature's laws. This is not a matter to be trifled with, to be passed off with a jest. As we approach the close of this earth's history, selfishness and violence and crime prevail as in the days of Noah, when the old world perished in the waters of the Flood. As Bible believers, we need to take our position for righteousness and truth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 505}
