    "word": "Dr. B needs to cultivate courtesy and kindness lest he shall unnecessarily injure the feelings of the patients. He is frank and openhearted, conscientious, sincere, and ardent.

With this knowledge he needs self-culture, refinement of manners, and to be more select in his words and illustrations in his parlor talks.",
