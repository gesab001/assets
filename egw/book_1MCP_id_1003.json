{"word": "When Human Loves Come First.--With many, the love for the human eclipses the love for the divine. They take the first step in backsliding by venturing to disregard \n\n304 \n\nthe Lord's express command; and complete apostasy is too often the result. It has ever proved a dangerous thing for men to carry out their own will in opposition to the requirements of God. Yet it is a hard lesson for men to learn that God means what He says. As a rule, those who choose for their friends and companions, persons who reject Christ and trample upon God's law eventually become of the same mind and spirit.--ST, May 19, 1881.
