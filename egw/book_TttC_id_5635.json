    "word": "Effects of Overwork \n\n     My husband labored incessantly to advance the interests of the cause of God in the various departments of the work centering in Battle Creek. His friends were astonished at the amount of labor he accomplished. Sabbath morning, August 18, he spoke in our house of worship. In the afternoon his mind was closely and critically exercised for four consecutive hours, while he listened to the reading of manuscript for Spirit of Prophecy, volume 3. The matter was intensely interesting and calculated to stir the soul to its very depths, \n                                                                           277\nbeing a relation of the trial, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. Before we were aware of it, he was very weary. He commenced labor on Sunday at five o'clock in the morning and continued working until twelve at night.",
