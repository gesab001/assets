    "word": "I tell you plainly, God is displeased with your course. There are troubles before you that you do not discern and which may be avoided if you choose to follow wise counsel. Our Saviour has made you the object of His unwearied labors and tender solicitude, that you may be wise and not ruin your self. He yearns over you in boundless compassion and love, exclaiming: \"How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!\" Your foolish heart has turned from the counsel of your best friends.",
