    "word": "Before your fanatical course you were jealous of those at Battle Creek, and have thrown out hints which would excite suspicion. You have been jealous of my husband and myself, and have surmised evil. Envy and suspicion have been united. Under an appearance of conscientiousness you have suggested doubts in regard to the movements of those who are bearing the burden of the work at Battle Creek, and have thrown out hints in regard to matters of which you were wholly ignorant, and utterly incapable of judging rightly. The burden of matters there was not laid upon you. \n                                                                           312\nI was shown that God would not select a person with a mind constituted like yours, and lay heavy burdens upon him, and call him to fill the most responsible positions; for self-esteem would be so prominent that it would be ruinous to himself and to God's people. Had you esteemed yourself less, you would have had less jealousy and suspicion.",
