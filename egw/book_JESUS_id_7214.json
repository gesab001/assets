{"word": "At first the angels could not rejoice, for their Commander concealed nothing from them, but opened to them the plan of salvation. Jesus told them that He would stand between the wrath of His Father and guilty man, that He would bear iniquity and scorn, and but few would receive Him as the Son of God. Nearly all would hate and reject Him. He would leave all His glory in heaven, appear upon earth as a man, humble Himself as a man, become acquainted by His own experience with the various temptations with which man would be beset, that He might know how to succor [help] those who should be tempted. . . . The weight of the sins of the whole world would be upon Him. He told them He would die and rise again the third day, and would ascend to His Father to intercede for wayward, guilty man (The Story of Redemption, pp. 42, 43).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 22}
