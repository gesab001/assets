{"word": "Not to Shape Other Minds.--God has given to every man an individual responsibility. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\" Man is not to work out any other man's salvation. He is not to become the transcript of any man's mind. He is required to act in his capacity according to the ability God has given him. No man, whatever his experience, whatever his position, is to feel that he accomplishes a wonderful work when he \n\n428 \n\nfashions and shapes the mind of any human being after his own mind and teaches him to voice the sentiments he may express. This has been done again and again to the detriment of human beings.--MS 116, 1898.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 427}
