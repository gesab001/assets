{"word": "I Shall Go Forward With My Work \n\n     We may be called \"weak and foolish,\" enthusiastic, even insane. It may be said of us as it was of Christ, \"He hath a devil\" (John 10:20). But the work which the Master has given us to do is our work still. We must direct minds to Jesus, not seeking praise or honor of men, but committing ourselves to Him who judgeth righteously. He knows how to help those who while following in His steps suffer in a limited degree the reproach He bore. He was tempted in all points like as we are, that He might know how to succor those who should be tempted.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 73}
