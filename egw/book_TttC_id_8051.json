    "word": "Now is reached the complete fulfillment of those words of the Angel: \"Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth My servant the Branch.\" Christ is revealed as the Redeemer and Deliverer of His people. Now indeed are the remnant \"men wondered at,\" as the tears and humiliation of their pilgrimage give place to joy and honor in the presence of God and the Lamb. \"In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem.\"",
