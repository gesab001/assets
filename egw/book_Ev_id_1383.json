{"word": "A Warning to San Francisco Workers.--The work going forward in San Francisco is a good work. But at every step there must be watchfulness and prayer; for many things will come in to confuse and entangle the workers. My brethren, the word has been given me for you, \"Watch and pray,\" Watch lest you stand in the way of the work of God, making an impression that hurts the truth. Adorn your profession by an honest conversation. Cherish the grace of the Holy Spirit, else you will stand as hindrances in the way of the work of God. Make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way.--Manuscript 105, 1902.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 404}
