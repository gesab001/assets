{"word": "Let no man present the idea that man has little or nothing to do in the great work of overcoming; for God does nothing for man without his cooperation. Neither say that after you have done all you can on your part, Jesus will help you. Christ has said, \"Without Me ye can do nothing\" (John 15:5). From first to last man is to be a laborer\n38\ntogether with God. Unless the Holy Spirit works upon the human heart, at every step we shall stumble and fall. Man's efforts alone are nothing but worthlessness; but cooperation with Christ means a victory. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "NL", "page": 38}
