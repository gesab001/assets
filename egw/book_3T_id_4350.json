    "word": "In the teachings of Christ He said: \"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?\" The spiritual health and prosperity of the church is dependent in a great degree upon her systematic benevolence. It is like the lifeblood which must flow through the whole being, vitalizing every member of the body. It increases love for the souls of our fellow men; for by self-denial and self-sacrifice we are brought into a closer relation to Christ, who for our sakes became poor. The more we invest in the cause of God to aid in the salvation of souls, the closer to our hearts will they be brought. Were our numbers half as large, and all of these devoted workers, we should have a power that would make the world tremble. To the active workers Christ has addressed these words: \n                                                                           406\n\"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\"",
