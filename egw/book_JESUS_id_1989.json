{"word": "Said the apostle Paul to his Philippian brethren, \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\" Adopt this as the rule of life. \"Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.\" Philippians 4:8, 6, 7.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 630}
