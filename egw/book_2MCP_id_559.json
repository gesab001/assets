{"word": "Presumption Is Satan's Counterfeit.--Faith is in no sense allied to presumption. Only he who has true faith is secure against presumption, for presumption is Satan's counterfeit of faith. Faith claims God's promises and brings forth fruit in obedience. Presumption also claims the promises but uses them as Satan did, to excuse transgression.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 534}
