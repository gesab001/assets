{"word": "We read in the Bible about the resurrection of Christ from the dead, but do we act as though we believed it? Do we believe that Jesus is a living Saviour, that He is not in Joseph's new tomb, with the great stone rolled before it, but that He has risen from the dead and ascended on high . . .? He is there to plead our cases in the courts of heaven. He is there because we need a friend in the heavenly court, One who is to be our advocate and intercessor. Then let us rejoice in this. We have everything for which to praise God.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 45}
