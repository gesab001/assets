    "word": "What has not God done for Brother D in giving His Son to die for him? and will He not with Him freely give him all things? Why should he be unfaithful to God because man has proved unfaithful to him? How much stronger than death is the love that binds the mother's heart to her afflicted child; \"yet God declares that even a mother may forget her child, yet will I not forget thee.\" No; not a single soul who puts his trust in Him will be forgotten. God thinks of His \n                                                                           330\nchildren with the tenderest solicitude and keeps a book of remembrance before Him, that He may never forget the children of His care. \n\n\n          Every human tie may perish, \n            Friend to friend unfaithful prove, \n          Mothers cease their own to cherish, \n            Heaven and earth at last remove; \n              But no changes \n            Can attend Jehovah's love.",
