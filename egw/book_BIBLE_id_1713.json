{"word": "Now, as in former ages, the presentation of a truth that reproves the sins and errors of the times, will excite opposition. \\93Every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\\94 [John 3:20.] As men see that they cannot maintain their position by the Scriptures, many determine to maintain it at all hazards, and with a malicious spirit they assail the character and motives of those who stand in defense of unpopular truth. It is the same policy which has been pursued in all ages. Elijah was declared to be a troubler of Israel, Jeremiah a traitor, Paul a polluter of the temple. From that day to this, those who would be loyal to truth have been denounced as seditious, heretical, or schismatic. Multitudes who are \n459\ntoo unbelieving to accept the sure word of prophecy, will receive with unquestioning credulity an accusation against those who dare to reprove fashionable sins. This spirit will increase more and more. And the Bible plainly teaches that a time is approaching when the laws of the State shall so conflict with the law of God that whoever would obey all the divine precepts must brave reproach and punishment as an evil-doer.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 458}
