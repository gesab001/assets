    "word": "If we are making the life and teachings of Christ our study, every passing event will furnish a text for an impressive discourse. It was thus the Saviour preached the gospel in the highways and byways; and as He spoke, the little group that listened to Him swelled to a great company. Present-day evangelists are to be workers together with Christ. These, just as verily as the first disciples, have the assurance: \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: \n                                                                           64\nand, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Matthew 28:18-20.",
