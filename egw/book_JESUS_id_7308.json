{"word": "It is our duty to love Jesus as our Redeemer. He has a right to command our love, but He invites us to give Him our heart. He calls us to walk with Him in the path of humble, truthful obedience. His invitation to us is a call to a pure, holy, and happy life--a life of peace and rest, of liberty and love--and to a rich inheritance in the future, immortal life. Which will we choose--liberty in Christ, or bondage and tyranny in the service of Satan? . . . If we choose to live with Christ through the ceaseless ages of eternity, why not choose Him now as our most loved and trusted friend, our best and wisest counselor.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 98}
