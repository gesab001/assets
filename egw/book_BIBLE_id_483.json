{"word": "Love for Bible Study Is Not Natural\nBoth old and young neglect the Bible. They do not make it their study, the rule of their life. Especially are the young guilty of this \n89\nneglect. Most of them find time to read other books, but the Book that points out the way to eternal life is not daily studied. Idle stories are attentively read, while the Bible is neglected. This Book is our guide to a higher, holier life. The youth would pronounce it the most interesting book they ever read had not their imagination been perverted by the reading of fictitious stories.
