{"word": "Jesus commissioned other angels to fly quickly to revive and strengthen the drooping faith of His people and prepare them to understand the message of the second angel and the important move which was soon to be made in heaven. I saw these angels receive great power and light from Jesus and fly quickly to earth to fulfill their commission to aid the second angel in his work. A great light shone upon the people of God as the angels cried, \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.\" Then I saw these disappointed ones rise and in harmony with the second angel proclaim, \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.\" The light from the angels penetrated the darkness everywhere. Satan and his angels sought to hinder this light from spreading and having its designed effect. They contended with the angels from heaven, telling them that God had deceived the people, and that with all their light and power they could not make the world believe that Christ was coming. But notwithstanding Satan strove to hedge up the way and draw the minds of the people from the light, the angels of God continued their work.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 248}
