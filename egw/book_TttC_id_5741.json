    "word": "Christ has said: \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\" \"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\" The deeds of a man's life are the fruit he bears. If he is unfaithful and dishonest in temporal matters he is bringing forth briers and thorns; he will be unfaithful in the religious life and will rob God in tithes and offerings.",
