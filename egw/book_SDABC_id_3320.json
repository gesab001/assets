    "word": "\"Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.\" This is our work. There are many ready to die spiritually, and the Lord calls upon us to strengthen them. God's people are to be firmly united in the bonds of Christian fellowship, and are to be strengthened in the faith by speaking often to one another about the precious truths entrusted to them. Never are they to spend their time in accusing and condemning one another (RH Aug. 10, 1905).",
