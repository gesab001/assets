{"word": "[NOTE.--FROM THE TIME OF HER GIRLHOOD, MRS. WHITE WAS BURDENED WITH WRITING AND PUBLIC MINISTRY, AND WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DOMESTIC WORK IN HER HOME LARGELY UPON HOUSEKEEPERS AND COOKS. SHE WAS NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO SECURE THE SERVICES OF THOSE TRAINED IN HYGIENIC COOKERY. SO THERE WERE TIMES IN HER OWN HOME WHEN VARIOUS COMPROMISES HAD TO BE MADE BETWEEN THE IDEAL STANDARDS, AND THE KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, AND STANDARDS OF A NEW COOK. THEN, TOO, MUCH OF THE TIME WHILE TRAVELING, SHE WAS DEPENDENT FOR HER FOOD UPON THOSE WHOM SHE WAS VISITING. ALTHOUGH ABLE TO SUBSIST UPON A SPARE DIET, IT SOMETIMES SEEMED NECESSARY TO EAT SOME MEAT, WHICH SHE KNEW WAS NOT THE BEST FOOD AND WHICH WAS NOT OF HER OWN CHOOSING.--COMPILERS.]", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 487}
