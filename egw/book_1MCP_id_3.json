{"word": "Train and Discipline the Mind.--No matter who you are . . . the Lord has blessed you with intellectual faculties capable of vast improvement. Cultivate your talents with persevering earnestness. Train and discipline the mind by study, by observation, by reflection. You cannot meet the mind of God unless you put to use every power. The mental faculties will strengthen and develop if you will go to work in the fear of God, in humility, and with \n\n4 \n\nearnest prayer. A resolute purpose will accomplish wonders. --LS 275 (1915).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 3}
