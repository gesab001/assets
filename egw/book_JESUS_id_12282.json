{"word": "As one becomes acquainted with the history of the Redeemer he discovers in himself serious defects. . . . He catches the looks, the spirit, of his beloved Master. . . . It is not by looking away from Him that we imitate the life of Jesus, but by talking of Him, by dwelling upon His perfections, by seeking to refine the taste and elevate the character, by trying, through faith and love, and by earnest, persevering effort, to approach the perfect Pattern. By having a knowledge of Christ,--His words, His habits, and His lessons of instructions,-- we borrow the virtues of the character we have so closely studied, and become imbued with the spirit we have so much admired. Jesus becomes to us \"the chiefest among ten thousand,\" the One \"altogether lovely.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 341}
