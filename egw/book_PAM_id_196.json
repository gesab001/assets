{"word": "Satan controls ministers through selfish, ease-loving companions.--Satan is ever at work to dishearten and lead astray ministers whom God has chosen to preach the truth. The most effectual way in which he can work is through home influences, through unconsecrated companions. If he can control their minds, he can through them the more readily gain access to the husband, who is laboring in word and doctrine to save souls. . . . Satan has had much to do with controlling the labors of the ministers through the influence of selfish, ease-loving companions.--AH 355.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 86}
