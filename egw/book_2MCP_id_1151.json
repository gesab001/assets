{"word": "Satan Cannot Touch the Mind Not Surrendered to Him.--The interests most vital to you individually are in your own keeping. No one can damage them without your consent. All the satanic legions cannot injure you unless you open your soul to the arts and arrows of Satan. Your ruin can never take place until your will consents. If there is not pollution of mind in yourself, all the surrounding pollution cannot taint or defile you.--Lt 14, 1885. (HC 94.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 710}
