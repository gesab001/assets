    "word": "You are selfish, exacting, and overbearing. This ought not to be. Your salvation depends on your acting from principle--serving God from principle, not from feeling, not from impulse. God will help you when you feel your need of help and set about the work with resolution, trusting in Him with all your heart. You are often discouraged without sufficient reason. You indulge feelings akin to hatred. Your likes and dislikes are strong. These you must restrain. Control the tongue. \"If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.\" Help has been laid upon One that is mighty. He will be your strength and support, your front guard and rearward.",
