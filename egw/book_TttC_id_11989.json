    "word": "A False and a True Knowledge of God \n\n                 Speculative Theories \n\n\n     \"Those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever;\" but \"the secret things belong unto the Lord our God.\" Deuteronomy 29:29. The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate. The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out in conjectures regarding the nature of God; but the effort will be fruitless. This problem has not been given us to solve. No human mind can comprehend God. Let not finite man attempt to interpret Him. Let none indulge in speculation regarding His nature. Here silence is eloquence. The Omniscient One is above discussion.",
