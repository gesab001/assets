{"word": "Jesus brought into his teaching none of the science of men. His teaching is full of grand, ennobling, saving truth, to which man's highest ambitions and proudest inventions can bear no comparison; and yet things of minor consequence engross the minds of men. The great plan of the redemption of a fallen race was wrought out in the life of Christ in human flesh. This scheme of restoring the moral image of God in debased humanity entered into every purpose of the life and character of Christ.

The way in which God uses men is not always discerned, but he does use them. God entrusts men with talents and inventive genius, in order that his great work in our world may be accomplished. The inventions of human minds are supposed to spring from humanity, but God is behind all. He has caused that the means of rapid traveling shall have been invented, for the great day of his preparation.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 7}
