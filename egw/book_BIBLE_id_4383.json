{"word": "When reading the Bible with humble, teachable heart, we are holding intercourse with God Himself. The thoughts expressed, the precepts specified, the doctrines revealed, are a voice from the God of heaven. The Bible will bear to be studied, and the mind, if not bewitched by Satan, will be attracted and charmed. . . . The light which beams through the Scriptures is light from the eternal throne flashed down to this earth. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 196}
