    "word": "Why, I inquire, are some of our ministerial brethren so far behind in proclaiming the exalted theme of temperance? \n                                                                           300\nMy brethren, the word given to you is: \"Take hold of the work of health reform; go forward.\" If you think that the medical missionary work is assuming undue proportions, take the men who have been working in these lines with you into your fields of labor, two here and two there. Receive these medical missionaries as you would receive Christ, and see what work they can do. You will not find them dwarfs in religious experience. See if in this way you cannot bring much of heaven's vital current into the churches. See if there are not some who will grasp the education they so much need, and bear the testimony: \"God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\" Ephesians 2:4-6. Our great need is unity, perfect oneness in God's work.",
