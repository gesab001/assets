{"word": "Of Jesus it is written: \"And the child grew, and waxed strong is spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him . . . . And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\" A knowledge of God \n                                                                           17\nwill constitute a kind of knowledge that will be as enduring as eternity. To learn and do the works of Christ, is to obtain a true education. Although the Holy Spirit worked the mind of Christ, so that he could say to his parents, \"How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?\" Yet he worked at the carpenter's trade as an obedient son. He revealed that he had a knowledge of his work as the Son of God, and yet he did not exalt his divine character. He did not offer as a reason why he should not bear the burden of temporal care, that he was of divine origin; but he was subject to his parents. He was the Lord of the commandments, yet he was obedient to all their requirements, thus leaving an example to obedience to childhood, youth, and manhood.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 16}
