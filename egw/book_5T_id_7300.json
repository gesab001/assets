    "word": "Chap. 22 - Looking Unto Jesus\n\n     Many make a serious mistake in their religious life by keeping the attention fixed upon their feelings and thus judging of their advancement or decline. Feelings are not a safe criterion. We are not to look within for evidence of our acceptance with God. We shall find there nothing but that which will discourage us. Our only hope is in \"looking unto Jesus \n                                                                           200\nthe Author and Finisher of our faith.\" There is everything in Him to inspire with hope, with faith, and with courage. He is our righteousness, our consolation and rejoicing.",
