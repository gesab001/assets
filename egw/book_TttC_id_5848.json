    "word": "While engaged in the missionary work, you have at the same time manifested your scheming propensities in buying and selling. This makes a poor combination. You should be one thing or the other. \"If the Lord be God, follow Him: \n                                                                           351\nbut if Baal, then follow him.\" \"Choose you this day whom ye will serve.\" God will not accept your labors in the tract and missionary work while you are scheming to advantage yourself. You are in danger of counting gain as godliness. The tempter will present flattering inducements before you to fascinate you and allure you on to indulge a spirit of scheming which will kill your spirituality.",
