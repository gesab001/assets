{"word": "Ministers who hover over their churches do them harm.--The churches that have not life in themselves, that have lost their spiritual discernment, call for ministers to come to their help, to bring them the breath of life. But the ministers have other work to do. They must carry the message of truth to those who know it not. Those ministers who hover about the churches, who have not a clear cut message, which, like a sharp, two-edged sword, cuts both ways, will do the churches harm. They will not work for the salvation of souls that are in great peril because they know not the truth, and they will\n122\ndie spiritually themselves, and trouble and discourage those who try to help them. 6MR 65.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 121}
