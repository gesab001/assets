{"word": "In our business meetings, it is important that precious time should not be consumed in debating points that are of small consequence. The habit of petty criticism should not be indulged; for it perplexes and confuses minds, and shrouds in mystery the things that are most plain and simple. How does Jesus, our Counselor, whom we have invited to be present at these meetings, look upon these things? \n231\nIf there is that love among brethren which will lead them to esteem others better than themselves, there will be a giving up of their own ways and wishes to others. It is our duty to study, daily and hourly, how we may answer the prayer of Christ, that his disciples may be one, as he and the Father are one. Precious lessons may be learned by keeping our Saviour's prayer before the mind, and by acting our part to fulfill his desire.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 230}
