    "word": "About this time a celebrated physician who gave counsel free visited Rochester, and I decided to have him examine my eye. He thought the swelling would prove to be a cancer. But upon feeling my pulse, he said: \"You are much diseased, and will die of apoplexy before that swelling shall break out. You are in a dangerous condition with disease of the heart.\" This did not startle me, for I had been aware that without speedy relief I must go down to the grave. Two other women \n                                                                           93\nwho had come for counsel were suffering with the same disease. The physician said that I was in a more dangerous condition than either of them, and it could not be more than three weeks before I would be afflicted with paralysis. I asked if he thought his medicine would cure me. He did not give me much encouragement. I tried the remedies which he prescribed, but received no benefit.",
