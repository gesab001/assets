{"word": "Chap. 47 - Mental Hygiene\n[SEE CHAPTER 42, \"MIND AND HEALTH.\"]\n\n\n     Mental Powers Depend on Health.--Health is a blessing of which few appreciate the value; yet upon it the efficiency of our mental and physical powers largely depends. Our impulses and passions have their seat in the body, and it must be kept in the best condition physically and under the most spiritual influences in order that our talents may be put to the highest use. Anything that lessens physical strength enfeebles the mind and makes it less capable of discriminating between right and wrong.-- RH, June 20, 1912.
