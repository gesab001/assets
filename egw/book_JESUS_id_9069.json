{"word": "Paul did many things. He was a wise teacher. His many letters are full of instructive lessons setting forth correct principles. He worked with his hands, for he was a tent-maker, and in this way earned his daily bread. . . . He carried a heavy burden for the churches. He strove most earnestly to present their errors before them, that they might correct them, and not be deceived and led away from God. He was always seeking to help them in their difficulties; and yet he declares, \\93One thing I do.\\94 . . . The responsibilities of his life were many, yet he kept always before him this \\93one thing.\\94 The constant sense of the presence of God constrained him to keep his eye ever looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of his faith.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 195}
