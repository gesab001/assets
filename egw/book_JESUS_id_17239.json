{"word": "The world's Redeemer is speaking to us; let us hear what He says: \"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" (Revelation 22:14). Then those who see the claims of God in His Word and do not obey, but excuse their negligence or willful disregard of God's requirements, testify by their course of action that they are not embraced in the blessed promise on condition of obedience. They are not the ones who will have a right to the tree of life, but are with the willful transgressors of the law of God to whom Jesus says, \"Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity\" (Luke 13:27).--Manuscript 15, July 17, 1885, \"Influence of Unconsecrated Workers.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 207}
