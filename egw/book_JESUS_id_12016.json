{"word": "The more one sees of the character of God, the more humble he becomes, and the lower his estimation is of himself. This indeed is the evidence that he beholds God, that he is in union with Jesus Christ. Unless we are meek and lowly, we cannot in truth claim that we have any conception of the character of God. Men may think that they possess superior qualifications. Their splendid talents, great learning, eloquence, activity, and zeal, may dazzle the eye, delight the fancy, and awaken the admiration of those who cannot read beneath the surface; but unless humility and modesty is linked with these other gifts, self-glorification and self-exaltation will be seen. Unless each qualification is consecrated to the Lord, unless those to whom the Lord has entrusted gifts seek that grace which alone can make their qualifications acceptable to God, they are looked upon by the Lord . . . as unprofitable servants. \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God thou wilt not despise.\" . . . Those whose hearts are melted and subdued, who have seen the glorious manifestation of God's character, will show no heedless presumption. . . . Self will be lost in the consciousness they have of God's wonderful glory, and their own utter unworthiness. All who value a happy and holy walk with God . . . will leave nothing undone if only they may gain a glimpse of His glory. In every place and under every circumstance, they will pray to God that they may be allowed to see Him. They will cherish that meek and contrite spirit that trembles at the word of God. \n                                                                           69", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 68}
