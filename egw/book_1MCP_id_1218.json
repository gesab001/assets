{"word": "True Ambition.--Dear youth, what is the aim and purpose of your life? Are you ambitious for education that you may have a name and position in the world? Have you thoughts that you dare not express, that you may one day stand upon the summit of intellectual greatness; that you may sit in deliberative and legislative councils and help to enact laws for the nation? There is nothing wrong in these aspirations. You may every one of you make your mark. You should be content with no mean attainments. Aim high and spare no pains to reach the standard.-- RH, Aug 19, 1884. (FE 82.) \n\n368", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 367}
