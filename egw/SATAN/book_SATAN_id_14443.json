    "word": "Dr. Paulson and others have thought that the strange sentiments to be found in the book, \"Living Temple\" are sustained by my writings. Some expressions, taken independent of their proper connection have been used to sustain this idea, even as many take statements from the Bible from their setting, and use them to testify to error. This is a scheme of Satan to deceive. I have written to Elder Jones and to Elder Tenney that they are in danger of being influenced by the sentiments found in \"Living Temple\".",
