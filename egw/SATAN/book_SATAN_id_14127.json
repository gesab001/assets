    "word": "The Lord reads the purposes of the heart. He will bring out all this to His glory. But the unwise course pursued, not the fact of the financial embarrassment, has left an influence upon the conference which will prove the ruin of souls, and those who have done this work will see it as it is in the judgment when the books shall be opened and every man will be judged out of those things that shall be written in the books. Satan has exulted at the turn things have taken. The work is retarded for years by the same spirit that moved the unfaithful spies to bring their evil report.",
