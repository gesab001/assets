    "word": "Satan is most successful when he can cover up minds in this kind of pious, sanctified consecration which has no part in the sanctification brought to view in the Word of God. It is, in short, a spurious article, that article [that] you possess. You received your views of sanctification from those who claim to be sanctified and holy, who have no love for the law of God and who have no love for His appearing. You received your light from a corrupt source; the stream that came from a corrupt fountain is impure.",
