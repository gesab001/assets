    "word": "From the light that God has given me, I know that men\u2019s great danger is in being self-deceived. Satan is watching his chance. He will come to men in human form, and will speak to them most entrancing words. He will bring against them the same temptations that he brought against Christ. Unless their minds and hearts are filled with the pure, unselfish, sanctified love that Christ revealed, they will fall under Satan\u2019s power, and will do and say and write strange things, to deceive, if it were possible, the very elect. . . .",
