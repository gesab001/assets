    "word": "Satan is putting forth his power in presenting masterly delusions, so that he may bring to pass that which is not in accordance with God's will. Let not those who believe the truth give occasion to our enemies to vindicate opposition, to give ground for the misrepresentation that men would use to oppose the advance of the truth. For the sake of Christ let every worker put forth efforts that will bring to naught Satan's assertions, and not engage in anything that God has not required at his hands. Under heavenly generalship we may work in accordance with God's will, and success will crown our efforts. Give God a chance to work, and leave men to do whatever He wishes them to do to advance His truth.",
