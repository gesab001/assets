    "word": "1, 2. An Unmuffled Message.--Our work now is to rouse the people. Satan with all his angels has come down with great power, to work with every conceivable deception to counterwork the work of God. The Lord has a message for His people. This message will be borne, whether men will accept or reject it. As in the days of Christ, there will be the deep plottings of the powers of darkness, but the message must not be muffled with smooth words or fair speeches, crying peace, peace, when there is no peace, to those who are turning away from God. \"There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.\" [Isaiah 58:1, 2, quoted.]",
