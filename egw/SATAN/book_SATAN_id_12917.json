    "word": "Will you not obey the words of Christ, \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me\" (Matthew 16:24)? The Saviour will help those who will do what they can to help themselves. Let those who are not converted seek the Lord most earnestly, that they may have clean, pure hearts, and faith to lay hold of the help that Christ is waiting to give them. Follow the light of God's Word, and you will have clear light and precious consolation. Christ will help you if you will deny the selfish inclinations that Satan wants you to gratify. The enemy wants to weaken your spirituality and to confuse your perceptions of righteousness and truth. \n\n\n                                 -84-",
