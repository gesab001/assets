    "word": "Bro. Day: The Lord let his blessing rest upon you last spring; but you did not see the relation which watchfulness and prayer sustain to a progress in the divine life. You have neglected these duties, and the result has been that darkness has enshrouded you. You have been in a state of uncertainty and distrust. You have frequently chosen for your society those who are in darkness, those whom Satan uses to scatter from Christ. You could live among the most corrupt, and remain unstained, unsullied, if God in his providence thus directed you. But it is dangerous for those who wish to honor God to choose for their companions those who fear not God, and be pleased and entertained with their society. Satan is ever surrounding such, and great darkness is around about them; and if those who profess Christ go unbidden \n                                                                           11\ninto this darkness, they tempt the Devil to tempt them. If God requires us to go amid infernal spirits, where is the blackest darkness, in order to do good and glorify his name, he will encircle us with his angels and keep us unsullied. But if we seek the company of sinners, and are pleased with their coarse jests, and are entertained and amused with their stories, sports, and ribaldry, the pure and holy angels remove their protection, and leave us to the darkness we have chosen.",
