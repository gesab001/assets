    "word": "Step away from the sound of Satan's voice and from acting his will, and stand by the side of Jesus, possessing his attributes, the possessor of keen tender sensibilities, who can make the cause of the afflicted suffering one his own. The man who has had much forgiven will love much. Jesus is a compassionate Intercessor, a merciful and faithful high priest. He, the Majesty of Heaven! The King of glory can look upon finite man, subject to the temptations of Satan, knowing that he has felt the power of Satan's wiles. \"Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren (clothing his divinity with humanity), that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.",
