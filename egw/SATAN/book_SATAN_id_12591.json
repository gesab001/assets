    "word": "We have recently been much burdened on Brother Hull's account. We about gave him up as lost. He has no help at home and Satan has been determined to overthrow him. He needed all the strength and help from his brethren he could get, but Brethren _____ and _____ told some of their difficulties and perplexities to him. It seemed they had no particular object, only to talk out what was in their minds--unbelief and darkness. They passed on but Brother Hull was just in that weak condition where the words of his brethren whom he had confidence in could take root and spring up and bear fruit. Some few difficult passages of scripture were thrown into his mind.",
