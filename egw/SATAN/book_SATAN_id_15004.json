    "word": "\"My brother, I do not cease to remember you in my prayers. You were never in greater peril than at the present time. You are giving the last message of warning to our world, and Satan will weave his nets to entangle your feet if you are not praying, and watching, and relying every moment upon God to keep you and strengthen you to resist temptation. Your soul is in peril. Should I specify the particular temptations, Satan would shift his operations and prepare some temptation you are not expecting. Therefore watch with much prayer, watch your own spirit, and God will hold you up.",
