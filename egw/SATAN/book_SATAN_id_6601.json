IN CHAPTER XXVII, \"THE SNARES OF SATAN,\" YOU FIND THAT ABOUT FOUR PAGES IN THE LATTER PART \n                                                                           453\nOF THE CHAPTER WERE OMITTED FROM THE LATER EDITIONS OF GREAT CONTROVERSY. THESE FOUR PAGES ARE TO BE FOUND IN TESTIMONIES TO MINISTERS, PAGES 472 TO 475. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THESE FOUR PAGES IS VERY VALUABLE TO SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS AND WAS VERY APPROPRIATELY INCLUDED IN THE FIRST EDITION OF GREAT CONTROVERSY, VOLUME IV, WHICH WHEN IT WAS PUBLISHED WAS LIKE THE OTHER VOLUMES CONSIDERED TO BE A MESSAGE ESPECIALLY TO SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS, AND TO [ALL] CHRISTIAN PEOPLE SYMPATHIZING WITH THEM IN BELIEFS AND AIMS.",
