    "word": "Christ has made baptism the sign of entrance to His spiritual kingdom. He has made this a positive condition with which all must comply who wish to be acknowledged as under the authority of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Before man can find a home in the church, before passing the threshold of God's spiritual kingdom, he is to receive the impress of the divine name, \"The Lord our Righteousness.\" Jeremiah 23:6.... Those who are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, at the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that they have forsaken the service of Satan and have become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. They have obeyed the command: \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, ... and touch not the unclean thing.\" And to them is fulfilled the promise: \"I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters.\" 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.",
