    "word": "We should be filled with thanksgiving that Jesus came to reveal the Father. He rolled back the cloud of thick darkness, the hellish shadow of Satan which intercepted between man and God, and revealed Him to the world as light and love. He stands before the world as the representation of the Father. \"In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.\" He was the express image of His person. The perfections of God are seen in the excellencies of Christ. His divinity was clothed with humanity, that He might speak to the human heart and place His divine impress upon the soul.",
