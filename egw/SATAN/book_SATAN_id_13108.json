    "word": "Jesus' eye is constantly upon these little ones of His fold, and those who are trying to leave all to follow Him. If a brother or sister is supposed [i.e., presumed] to err, do not whisper among yourselves, commenting upon, magnifying, and exaggerating supposed errors of others. Do not backbite with your tongue. A great deal of this is done in our churches and the result is the displeasure of God and exulting of Satan that he can weaken and annoy those who might be strong in God. The world sees their weakness; the world judges the truth they profess to love, by the fruits they see manifested by these who claim to believe the truth.",
