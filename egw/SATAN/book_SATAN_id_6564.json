    "word": "Chap. 56 - As We Near the End\n-\n\nMisleading Messages Will Be Accepted by Many \n\n\n     Test everything before it shall be presented to the flock of God. . . . In messages that profess to be from Heaven, expressions will be made that are misleading, and if the influence of these things be accepted, it will lead to exaggerated movements, plans, and devising that will bring in the very things that Satan would have current--a strange spirit, an unclean spirit, under the garments of sanctity; a strong spirit to overbear everything. Fanaticism will come in, and will so mingle and interweave itself with the workings of the Spirit of God, that many will accept it all as from God, and will be deceived and misled thereby.",
