    "word": "For thousands of years men had been in thraldom to a degenerating power. Satan had perverted their conceptions of God and of the plan and work of salvation. He had brought their minds so fully under his control that every heavenly attribute had been well nigh destroyed. Of himself man had not one thought or impulse of a spiritual nature. He could do nothing to save himself. Only as Christ should draw him could he take one step in repentance or reform.",
