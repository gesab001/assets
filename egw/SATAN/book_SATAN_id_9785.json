    "word": "But how little of the pitying tenderness of Christ is manifested by His professed followers! When one errs, others too often feel at liberty to make the case appear as bad as possible. Those who perhaps are guilty of fully as great sins in some other direction, will treat their brother with cruel severity. Errors committed through ignorance, thoughtlessness, or weakness are exaggerated into willful, premeditated sin. As they see souls going astray, some fold their hands and say, \"I told you so. I knew there was no dependence to be placed upon them.\" Thus they place themselves in the attitude of Satan, exulting in spirit that their evil surmisings have proved to be correct.--5T 604, 605.",
