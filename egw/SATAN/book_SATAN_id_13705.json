    "word": "Albert Dietschy is no help to you and you are no help to him, because you do not exercise the power of influence for good. Your influence is to strengthen the temptations of Satan, to lead each other away from truth, purity, and holiness. Angels blush over your words and your actions. You have become tempters to one another. You both need to greatly humble your souls at the foot of the cross, and learn meekness and lowliness of heart. It is genuine godliness woven into the character that will make young men a light in the world.",
