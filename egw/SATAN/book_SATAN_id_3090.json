    "word": "In the thirteenth century was established that most terrible of all the engines of the papacy,\u2014the Inquisition. The prince of darkness wrought with the leaders of the papal hierarchy. In their secret councils, Satan and his angels controlled the minds of evil men, while unseen in the midst stood an angel of God, taking the fearful record of their iniquitous decrees, and writing the history of deeds too \n60\nhorrible to appear to human eyes. \u201cBabylon the great\u201d was \u201cdrunken with the blood of the saints.\u201d The mangled forms of millions of martyrs cried to God for vengeance upon that apostate power.",
