    "word": "As we near the close of time, the human mind is more readily affected by Satan's devices. He leads deceived mortals to account for the works and miracles of Christ upon general principles. Satan has ever been ambitious to counterfeit the work of Christ, and establish his own power and claims. He does not generally do this openly and boldly. He is artful, and knows that the most effectual way for him to accomplish his work, is to come to poor fallen man in the form of an angel of light. Satan came to Christ in the wilderness in the form of a beautiful young man--more like a monarch than a fallen angel. He came with scripture in his mouth. Said he, \"It is written,\" &c. Our suffering Saviour meets him with scripture, saying, \"It is written.\" Satan takes advantage of the weak, suffering condition of Christ, who had taken upon him our human nature.",
