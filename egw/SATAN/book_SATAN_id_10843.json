    "word": "The commandments of God will be trampled underfoot, as they were trampled upon by Satan in heaven. Unless God pours His converting power and grace upon the soul, there will be no attempt to oppose Satan, but men will be under his control, his willing captives. The enmity against Satan is put in man by God Himself. God calls upon His people to occupy a distinct, decided position. The righteous fervor with which Christ denounced every abomination in our world, the unsullied purity, which made manifest the corruption of those that deceived the people by an appearance of sanctity, excited bitter hostility against Him.",
