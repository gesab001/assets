    "word": "The last prayer that Christ offered for His disciples before His trial was that they might be one in Him. Satan is determined that this oneness shall not be; for it is the strongest witness that can be borne that God gave His Son to reconcile the world to heaven. But the union for which Christ prayed must exist among God's people before He can bestow on the church the enlargement and power that He longs to bestow on it.",
