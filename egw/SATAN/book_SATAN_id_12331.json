    "word": "Satan is also watching his chances to lead us astray. He will present attractions that will lead our minds from God. But shall we not watch his devices, and be constantly seeking the aid of God to keep us from Satan's allurements? We must press toward the mark of the high calling of God in Jesus. We must not lay off the armor for one moment. You will hear the cry \"Only believe.\" Satan believed and trembled. We must have a faith that works by love and purifies the heart. The idea prevails that Christ has done all for us, and that we can go on transgressing the commandments and will not be held accountable for it. This is the greatest deception that the enemy ever devised. We must take our position that we will not violate the commandments at any cost, and be in that spiritual condition that we can educate others in spiritual things.",
