    "word": "The associations chosen by the helpers are determining their destiny for this world and the next. Some who have been for years connected with the Sanitarium were once conscientious and faithful, their deportment was such as to do credit to the institution; but these are changed, they have disconnected from God, and Satan has allured them to his side. They are now irreligious and irreverent, and they have an influence upon others who are easily molded. Evil associations are deteriorating character; principle is being undermined. \"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.\"",
