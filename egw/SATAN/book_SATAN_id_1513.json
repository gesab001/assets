    "word": "I entreat the church members in every city that they lay hold upon the Lord with determined effort for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Be assured that Satan is not asleep.

Let everyone now be soundly and truly converted, and then lay hold of the work intelligently and with faith. \n\n\n                                             (549)",
