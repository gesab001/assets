    "word": "Christ is our sufficiency. Those who indeed receive Him as a personal Saviour will reveal honesty and integrity in all their dealings. There will be no robbery, no underhand dealing. We are to be rooted and built up in Christ, that we may not be carried away by the science of the great deceiver. Already some are departing from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. There are those who boast that they have been studying science for years. But what has this science done for them? Just what it did for Satan in the heavenly courts.--Letter 141, 1905, pp. 1, 2. (To G. I. Butler, 1905.)",
