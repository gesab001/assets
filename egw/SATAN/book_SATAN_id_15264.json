    "word": "I have quoted only a few passages, but the Bible abounds in just such lessons. If it is not possible to love God unless we love our brother, the case will certainly go against us in the courts of heaven if we do not cherish Christ like love for one another. The word is very explicit. I am pained beyond measure when I see how little love is cherished and manifested among brethren. How long shall Satan use his arguments against us and weaken our influence by revealing to others how little love and deference and respect are shown for one another? Is it not time we were doers of the word, and not hearers only? Shall we not closely examine our own hearts, and see whether we are in possession of the love of God? Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh, by a pure and holy life to condemn sin in the flesh. He came to our world to represent the character of God, and it is our work to represent the character of Christ. If we have lost His love out of our hearts, our work is to seek the Lord, that our hearts may be renewed by His Holy Spirit.",
