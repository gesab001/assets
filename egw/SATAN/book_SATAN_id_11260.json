    "word": "Satan will continue to bring in his erroneous theories and to claim that his sentiments are true. Seducing spirits are at work.

God has spared my life that I may present the testimonies given me, to vindicate that which God vindicates, and to denounce every vestige of Satan's sophistry. One thing will follow another in spiritual sophistry, to deceive if possible the very elect.",
