    "word": "We are guilty of sin every hour we delay and neglect this great salvation; for before the world and angels and men we are in character saying, I will not have this man Christ Jesus to reign over me. We resist God's methods of transformation of character and grace. Men heap up wrath for themselves against the day of wrath. The continually refusing to yield the will to God's will hardens the heart, and finally God leaves the human agent to his choice. There is less and less tenderness of soul, less and less susceptibility of the Spirit's warnings, entreaties and drawings. The human agent refuses to incline his heart religiously, he will not take a step from the ranks of Satan to stand under the blood stained banner of the cross of Christ; but stands a mournful spectacle of resistance to the world, to angels, and to men.",
