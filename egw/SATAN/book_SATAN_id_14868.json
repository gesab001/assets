    "word": "Here is opened before me a Thus saith the Lord, which I present before you. God is to be feared, for He is a jealous God. Those who in his providence are placed in responsible positions to do his work have the whole heavenly universe opened before them, from which they may draw. I have been shown of God that His work has been greatly marred because the spirit and attributes of Satan have been allowed to have a controlling power. Silence gives consent, and when men who are engaged in the sacred work of God allow their own likes and dislikes to prevail, so that they themselves do, or allow another to do, the least act of injustice to the brethren of Jesus Christ, it is registered as done to himself in the person of his followers. These men may not be erring, they may make mistakes; but let those in positions of trust take heed how they treat all such; let them remember that they themselves are not free from errors and mistakes.",
