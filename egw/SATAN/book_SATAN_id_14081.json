    "word": "To keep His glory veiled as the child of a fallen race, this was the most severe discipline to which the Prince of Life could subject Himself. Thus He measured His strength with Satan. He who had been expelled from heaven fought desperately for the mastery over the One of whom in the courts above he had been jealous. What a battle was this! No language is adequate to describe it.

And as they learn what it means to overcome, they will endure the seeing of Him who is invisible.",
