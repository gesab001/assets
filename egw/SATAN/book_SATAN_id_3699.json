    "word": "It is not the will of God that we should be gloomy or impatient; nor that we should be light and trifling. It is Satan's studied plan to push persons from one extreme to the other. As \n141\nchildren of the light, God would have us cultivate a cheerful, happy spirit, that we may show forth the praises of him who hath called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. A lady once lived in our family nine years, and during all this time we did not hear an impatient word or a light expression from her lips; and yet she was the most cheerful person I ever saw. Hers was not a life of darkness and gloom, nor of lightness and frivolity. In this respect our lives should be like hers. God would not have us live under a cloud, but as in the light of his countenance.",
