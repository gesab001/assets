    "word": "We now call upon you to give yourselves to the service of God. Too long have you given your powers to the service of Satan, and have been slaves to his will. God calls upon you to behold the glory of his character, that by beholding, you may become changed into his image. There are many who have not an experimental knowledge of God or of the Lord Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. Christ came into the world because men did not have a correct knowledge of the character of God, and he came to reveal the Father. He said: \"Neither knoweth any man the Father, but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\" Jesus came to reveal to the world the love and goodness of God.",
