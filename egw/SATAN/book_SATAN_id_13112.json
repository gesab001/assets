    "word": "God has precious souls in these churches who would become ministers if they grow in the knowledge of the truth, and teach others the way of salvation, and lead them to righteousness. Satan will use every device in leading young men to form marriage connections which will defeat the purpose of God. He will seek to lower the standard of spirituality and holiness, so that the church will not be a living, working church, and its members be fitting themselves to work in the cause of God. Oh! how careful should be those who take the leading position in the church that their lives and deportment shall not scatter from Christ instead of gathering with Him. \n\n\n                                    -284-",
