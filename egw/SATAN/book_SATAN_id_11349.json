    "word": "God calls for men to give the message of warning to the world that is asleep, dead in trespasses and sins. He calls for free-will offerings from those whose hearts are in the work, who have a burden for souls, that they shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Satan is playing the game of life for the souls of men. He is seeking to secure means, that he may bind it up, so that it shall not be used to advance the missionary enterprises. Shall we be ignorant of his devices? Shall we allow him to stupefy our senses, so that we shall not discern the needs of this time?",
