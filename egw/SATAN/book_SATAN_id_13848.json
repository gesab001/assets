    "word": "The apostasy will exist in this night of spiritual darkness. It will then be destroyed by the brightness and exceeding glory of Christ's coming. Oh, what a day of gladness for the righteous that will be! What a breaking up of the spell of fanaticism and delusive sentiments when Christ shall shine forth before His ancients gloriously! Then the system of satanic delusion which souls have preferred to the truth that involves a cross, will be broken up.",
