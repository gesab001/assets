    "word": "When in Ohio I saw again the wretched state of things in New York. Satan was standing right in your midst, his evil angels exulting that through his temptations--exalting some and tempting others to be very strenuous, professing zeal for the truth and crowding your brethren, thrusting with side and with shoulder, bringing a reproach upon the truth, making yourself a stink to the places around you--you make the truth disgusting, make it an abhorrence, and you are as a people accountable to God for the wretched influence cast against the truth.",
