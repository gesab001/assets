    "word": "Students Required to be Workers With God \n\n\n     The Lord has greatly honored men, by giving Jesus Christ to recover them from Satan's claims. Will you be recovered? Will you have the precious gift of Christ? or will you refuse His service? Jesus has said, \"He that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\" He has said, \"Without me ye can do nothing,\" and, \"My grace is sufficient for thee.\" Every one who seeks to do well in his own finite strength, will find his efforts a failure; but those who accept Christ by faith, \n                                                                           5\nwill find Him a personal Saviour. They will enlist in His army, they will become His soldiers, and fight the good fight of faith. If they are students in the school, they will feel that they are enlisted to make the school the most orderly, elevated, and praiseworthy institution in the world. They will put every jot of their influence on the side of God, on the side of Christ, and on the side of heavenly intelligences. They will feel it to be their duty to form a Christian endeavor society, that they may help every student to see the inconsistency of a course of action that God will not approve. They will draw with Christ, and do their utmost to perfect Christian character. They will take upon themselves the work of leading the lame and the weak into the safe and upward path. They will form Christian endeavor meetings to make plans that will be a blessing to the institution of learning, and do all in their power to make the school what God designed and signified that it should be. They will have in mind the value and efficiency of Christian endeavor meetings, in preparing missionaries to go forth to give the warning to the world.",
