    "word": "Abstinence From Narcotics [TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH, VOL. 3, PP. 569, 570 (1875).] \n\n\n     Our people are constantly retrograding upon health reform. Satan sees that he cannot have such a controlling power over them as he could if appetite were indulged. Under the influence of unhealthful food, the conscience becomes stupefied, the mind becomes darkened, and its susceptibility to impressions is blunted. But because violated conscience is benumbed and becomes insensible, the guilt of the transgressor is not lessened.",
