    "word": "Some who are aged are unwilling to make any settlement of their worldly business, and in an unexpected moment they sicken and die.  Their children who have no interest in the truth, take the property.  Satan has managed it as suited him.  \"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?  And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?\"",
