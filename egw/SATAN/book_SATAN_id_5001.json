    "word": "The mother, watching by the sickbed of her child, exclaims, \"I can do no more. Is there no physician who has power to restore my child?\" She is told of the wonderful cures performed by some clairvoyant or magnetic healer, and she trusts her dear one to his charge, placing it as verily in the hand of Satan as if he were standing by her side. In many instances the future life of the child is controlled by a satanic power which it seems impossible to break.--PK 211 (1917). (See 5T 193; Ev 609.)",
