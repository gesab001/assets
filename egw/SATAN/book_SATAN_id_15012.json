    "word": "Then the whole universe of heaven rejoiced. Christ had passed over the ground of test and trial that Adam had failed to endure.

By overcoming in man's behalf, He was placing fallen man on the vantage ground with God. In His human nature, Jesus gave evidence that in every temptation wherewith Satan shall assail fallen man, there is help for him in God, if he will take hold of His strength, and through obedience make peace with Him.",
