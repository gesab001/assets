    "word": "There are things not pleasant in his family. His eldest children are in a fair path to ruin. Dr. Russell needs sympathy and help. But should he leave the Health Institute, the perplexities in his family would not be cured. His eldest daughter will be a grief to her parents, She is not conscientious, or religiously inclined. She is not truthful or honest. She is vain and proud, doting upon herself, and seeking to carry out her plans and purposes by any means. She \n                                                                           22\ndeceives her father. This is a trouble to the mind of Dr. Russell. She causes her mother trouble, and the mother does not always pursue a wise course. Sister Russell should have control over herself, and over her words, or they will have that influence upon the mind of Dr. Russell, that will result for the unhappiness of all around. Dr. Russell loves peace and harmony, and he is not constituted to bear trouble and perplexity. He is anxious to make a rush in almost any direction, to get rid of vexatious cares and trouble, but he cannot run away from himself. And should he change his position he would still feel the influence of his family. It is in the power of Dr. Russell, God working with his efforts, to close the door against Satan. In order to do this, he must stop reasoning with him, and vigorously fight the fight of faith. He should say, Get thee behind me, Satan, I will not be destroyed by your suggestions and temptations. Satan may seem to prevail, but if he will cast himself unreservedly upon God, he will receive spiritual strength to overcome. Our Intercessor always provides grace to bear, or a way of escape from every temptation.",
