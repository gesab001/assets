As soon as the wicked one had the people under his control, there were exhibitions of a Satanic character. The people ate and drank without a thought of God and his mercy, without a thought of the necessity of resisting the devil, who was leading them on to the most shameful deeds. The same spirit was manifested as at the sacrilegious feast of Belshazzar. There was glee and dancing, hilarity and singing, carried to an infatuation that beguiled the senses; then the indulgence in inordinate, lustful affections,--all this mingled in that disgraceful scene. God had been dishonored; his people had become a shame in the sight of the heathen. Judgments were about to fall on that infatuated, besotted multitude. Yet God in his mercy gave them opportunity to forsake their sins.",
