    "word": "What Bro. Miller needs is, to take away the deceptive gloss from his eyes, and to look, with eyes enlightened by the Spirit of God, into his own heart to test his motives, to weigh every move, and let not Satan put a false coloring upon his course of action. His position is extremely perilous. He will turn soon, either decidedly to the right, or he will go on deceiving others, and deceiving himself. Bro. Miller needs to have his inmost soul converted. He needs to be subdued, transformed by the renewing of his mind. Then he can do good. But he can never come into the light until he encourages a spirit of humble confession, and takes hold with earnest decision to right his wrongs, \n                                                                           27\nand, as far as he can, do away the reproach he has brought upon the cause of God.",
