    "word": "In their efforts to carry a point, persons who have naturally a strong imagination are in danger of deceiving themselves and deceiving others.

But those unpremeditated remarks, often so trifling as to be unworthy of notice, are viewed through Satan's magnifying glass, pondered, and repeated until molehills become mountains.",
