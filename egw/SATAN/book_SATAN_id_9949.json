SENSUALITY, LICENTIOUSNESS, AND ADULTERY ARE PRESENTED AS AMONG THE SINS COMMITTED BY THOSE WHO BEAR THE MESSAGE. BUT ON PAGE 153, ELLEN WHITE INDICATES THAT IT WAS \"SOME\" WHO WERE NOT TRUE. THESE REFERENCES ARE GROSSLY MISUSED IF IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE REBUKE APPLIES TO THE MINISTRY GENERALLY. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS A JUDAS AMONG THE TWELVE. THE WARNINGS STAND FORTH THAT EACH MAY GUARD HIS OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT THIS CONDITION SHALL NOT EXIST.",
