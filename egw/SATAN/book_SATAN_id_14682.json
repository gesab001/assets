    "word": "There are great responsibilities placed on unconsecrated, inexperienced men, in our councils, in interest connected with the great heart of the work, their decisions are not all sound, healthy, and consistent. A class have the molding and fashioning that know nothing of my work from the rise of the message. If Elder Smith stood where God would have him, if he had stood in the clear light from years back, his influence would be a power for good. But blindness is upon him and he senses it not. I have been shown that as he now stands Satan has prepared his temptations to close about his soul, that if he is not rescued the banner of truth will not be held aloft by him. Other hands will carry forward the sacred work to its close. Elder Butler will be left in the same position. This was shown me clearly in years past. They are unfaithful; they do not work with the Captain of our salvation and keep step with the providence of God.",
