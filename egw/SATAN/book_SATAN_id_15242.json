    "word": "I was saying with great power: \"Isaiah 49:8-17; 52:5.\" (See those references). Hear and understand this matter. The time is now short.

No power can conquer Satanic agencies but the power of Him who gave His life to redeem man, dying in the sinner's place, that all who will may repent and be converted. Christ is the propitiation for the sins of all who repent and believe in Him as their personal Saviour.",
