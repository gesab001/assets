    "word": "The Word of God does not repress man's activity, but guides it in pure, holy channels. All the vigor of mind and soul is needed in the work of God, but it must be sanctified by His grace. All the confederacy of Satan, with his masterly intelligence, and with all the skill of thousands of years of practice, is engaged in luring men, even professed Christians, to follow his maxims. He will insinuate his own reasoning into human minds, leading men to believe that the worldly maxims and policy are correct, that when the objects to be gained are worthy in themselves, it is admissible to employ pretense, hypocrisy, and deceit in securing them.",
