    "word": "These persons overlook the testimony of the Scriptures concerning the wonders wrought by Satan and his agents. It was by Satanic aid that Pharaoh's magicians were enabled to counterfeit the work of God. Paul testifies that before the second advent of Christ there will be similar manifestations of Satanic power. The coming of the Lord is to be preceded by \u201cthe working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.\u201d [2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10.] And the apostle John, describing the miracle-working power that will be manifested in the last days, declares: \u201cHe doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do.\u201d [Revelation 13:13, 14.] No mere impostures are here foretold. Men are deceived by the miracles which Satan's agents have power to do, not which they pretend to do.",
