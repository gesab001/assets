    "word": "\"Always teach present truth as it is in Jesus. If you have a true sense of the sacredness of the work, you will be much with God in prayer. It is God only who can bruise Satan under your feet shortly. Walk steadily. Make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way. Many are so weak in faith and experience that they will look to A. T. Jones, and what you say and do, they will say and do; for they will not look beyond you to Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of our faith.",
