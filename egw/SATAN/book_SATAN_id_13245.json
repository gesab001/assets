    "word": "MR No. 1070 - Relating to Trials and Suffering\n\n     The Purpose of Trials.--Trials are permitted to come upon the chosen people of God. The expression is used, \"God tempted Abraham\"; \"God tempted the children of Israel.\" This means that the Lord permitted Satan to tempt them in order that their faith might be found unto honor and glory when the judgment shall sit, and when every man shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body. God knows every heart, every motive, every thought in the heart of man; but He permits Satan to try, and tempt, and test His believing ones in order that their trust and confidence in God may be revealed. In the trial, if true to God, they reveal the fact that they render obedience to His written word.",
