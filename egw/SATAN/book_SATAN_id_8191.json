    "word": "I saw the rapping delusion--what progress it was making, and if it were possible it would deceive the very elect. Satan will have power to bring the appearance of a form before us purporting to be our relatives and friends that now sleep in Jesus. It will be made to appear as though they were present, the words they uttered while here, which we were familiar with, will be spoken, and the same tone of voice, which they had while living, will fall upon the ear. \n                                                                           6\nAll this is to deceive the saints, and ensnare them into the belief of this delusion.",
