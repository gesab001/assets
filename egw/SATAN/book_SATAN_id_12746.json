    "word": "MR No. 546 - Christ, the Second Adam\n\n     Christ took upon Himself humanity, and laid down His life a sacrifice, that man, by becoming a partaker of the divine nature might have eternal life. Not only was Christ the Sacrifice, but He was also the Priest, who offered the sacrifice. \"The bread that I will give,\" said He, \"is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" (John 6:51.) He was innocent of all guilt. He gave Himself in exchange for the people who has sold themselves to Satan by transgression of God's law,--His life for the life of the human family, who thereby became His purchased possession.",
