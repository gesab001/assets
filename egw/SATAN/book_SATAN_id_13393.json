    "word": "Let no one among you glory any longer against the truth by pretending that this spirit is a necessary consequence of faithfulness in righting wrongs and standing in defense of the truth. Such wisdom has many admirers, but it is very deceptive and harmful. It does not come from above, but is the fruit of a heart that needs regeneration. Its originator is Satan himself. Do not give yourselves, as accusers of others, credit for discernment; for you clothe the attributes of Satan with the garments of righteousness. I call upon you, my brethren, to purify the soul temple from all these things that defile. They are roots of bitterness.",
