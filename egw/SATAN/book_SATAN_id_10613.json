    "word": "Jesus Hunted From City to City During His Ministry\n     Jesus was hunted from place to place during His ministry. Priests and rulers were on His track. They misrepresented His mission and labor. He came unto His own and His own received Him not. Angels watched the conflict at every step. They saw the spirit and work of the enemy. They looked with amazement\n191\nupon the devices of Satan against the divine Son of God. They saw that he who had only been second to Jesus in power and glory had fallen so low that he could influence men to hunt the steps of Christ from city to city.\u2014ST Nov. 25, 1889.",
