    "word": "When Satan found his power was completely broken upon him, he went to the child again. He waked us crying at the top of his voice. He seemed to have the colic and we went up to the chamber, anointed his stomach with oil and prayed over him, rebuked Satan and he had to flee. We heard no more from him till morning. He is quite well today but rather weak. We feel quite free from his [Satan's] power today. He has made a desperate struggle to get some of us, but we have driven him back.",
