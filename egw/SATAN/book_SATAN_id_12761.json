    "word": "MR No. 570 - God's Presence in Review Office\n\n     The Lord Jehovah's presence is to be recognized in every room of the [Review and Herald] office, as His voice was recognized by Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. The Lord comes to His own place in the Review and Herald office. From thence should go forth the blessings of the light from His presence, imbuing with His Spirit every worker who is doing Him service, that not a trace of Satan's attributes shall be revealed in the look of the eye, the hearing of the ear, the words spoken, or the attitude taken.--Letter 150, 1899. (To \"Those in Responsible Positions in the Review and Herald Office,\" September 26, 1899.) \n\nReleased September 26, 1977.",
