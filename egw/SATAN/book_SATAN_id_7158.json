    "word": "God's sons and daughters must show they are of heavenly extraction. The great man in God's sight is he who in the midst of crowds, of cares and financial pressure, keeps his soul unpolluted, unstained, without one blot of worldly pollution. Firmly relying upon God by prayer and faith, the soul will stand firm in moral independence, yet with perfect kindness, love, and goodness. The temptations of society are met and resisted, communion is maintained with God, and the communication between your soul and God enables you to transmit to others through your social relations the choicest blessings which Heaven has to bestow. . . . Exact and impartial justice will be seen in all his dealings, but his duty does not end here. God requires more. He demands of you to love as Christ has loved souls. He demands of you compassion for the suffering, the erring, those who are subject to Satan's temptations. He demands of you kindness, courtesy to even the unfortunate, a generous consideration of the feelings of others. . . . You must so order your intercourse and deal with the world as to secure for yourself a calm, hallowed peace, while you leave a record behind of a godly example. \n                                                                           272",
