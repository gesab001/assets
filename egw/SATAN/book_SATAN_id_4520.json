    "word": "The wicked receive their recompense in the earth. Proverbs 11:31. They \"shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Malachi 4:1. Some are destroyed as in a moment, while others suffer many days. All are punished \"according to their deeds.\" The sins of the righteous having been transferred to Satan, he is made to suffer not only for his own rebellion, but for all the sins which he has caused God's people to commit. His punishment is to be far greater than that of those whom he has deceived. After all have perished who fell by his deceptions, he is still to live and suffer on. In the cleansing flames the wicked are at last destroyed, root and branch--Satan the root, his followers the branches.",
