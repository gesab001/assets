    "word": "Malachi turns away from the dark picture that Satan presents to these professed followers of Jesus Christ, for it is a libel on the paternal character of God. Satan has framed this picture for the contemplation of poor, unbelieving, mourning souls, and they have hung it up in memory\u2019s hall where they can gaze upon it. But the Lord has presented another picture for the contemplation of every believer. \u201cThen they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened.\u201d . . .",
