    "word": "Serving mammon. How few realize what this really means! It is Satan's work to lead men into false paths. He will if possible bring in false issues, which lead to a denial of the truth for this time. Those who in thought, word, or deed belittle or disparage the gospel ministry because it does not sustain them in erratic movements are on perilous ground. They need to study the lesson God teaches in the parable of the two sons. Unbelievers do not pretend to obey God. More dangerous are those who regard their disobedience as obedience. God will have order in his work. There are unfaithful men in the ministry, but this does not make the ministry any less the Lord's means for doing a great work. Those who accuse and disparage the ministry because the work done does not appear to be the work that should be done, are not wise men.",
