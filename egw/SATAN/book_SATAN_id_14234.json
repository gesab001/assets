    "word": "I promised the Lord that if He would give me His presence I would attend the next General Conference and would speak the words He should give me. I felt that if I was permitted to stand before you again I must have the presence of God with me as Moses had when he led the children of Israel through the wilderness, that my words might have power with you who have been partially blind to the importance of our time and work. I felt that I would make every effort in my power to urge our brethren to seek the Lord while He is to be found, to call upon Him while He is near. I would show them that unless they were imbued with the Spirit of God they could do no good in their work. Their coldness, their lukewarmness, was an offense to God. They must walk in Christ's light or Satan would put his blinder before their eyes and they would call light darkness and darkness light. \n\n\n                                     -82-",
