    "word": "There is the most distressing indifference and neglect in regard to the great salvation. The careless must be awakened, else they are lost. Since God has given His own Son to save the guilty sinner, He means through His agents to counterwork the human and Satanic agencies that are united to destroy the soul. The Lord has made every provision that the uplifted Saviour \n\n\n                     - 38 - \n\nmay be revealed to sinners. Although they are dead in trespasses and sins, their attention must be aroused by the preaching of Christ and Him crucified. Men must be convicted of the evil of sin. The eyes of the transgressor must be enlightened. Let all who have been drawn to Christ tell the story of His love. Let every one who has felt the converting power of Christ upon his own soul do what he can in the name of the Lord.",
