    "word": "In this city Charles V., Luther's great enemy, was elected to the throne of Germany, and here his coronation took place. Hither came the reformer on his way to the Diet at Worms. Having been taken suddenly ill on the journey, he rested for a short time at Frankfort. Suffering as he was, and with the prospect of a martyr's death before him, but still undaunted, he wrote to Spalatin at Worms, announcing his approach. \u201cI am arrived here,\u201d he said, \u201cthough Satan sought to stop me in my way by sickness. From Eisenach to this place I have been suffering, and I am at this moment in a worse condition than ever. I find that Charles has issued an edict to terrify me; but Christ lives, and we shall enter Worms in spite of all the counsels of hell, and all the powers of the air.\u201d The dwelling occupied by the reformer is still known as \u201cLuther's house.\u201d",
