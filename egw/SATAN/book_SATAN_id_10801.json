    "word": "I was directed by a messenger from heaven not to take the burden of picking up the sayings and doubts that Satan is putting into minds. \"Stand as the messenger of God anywhere, in any place,\" I was bidden, \"and bear the testimony I shall give you. If the Holy Spirit is not received, but rejected, all your words will be as idle tales. Be free. Bear the testimonies that the Lord Jesus has for you to bear in reproof, in rebuke, in the work of encouraging and lifting up the soul; 'teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.'\"",
