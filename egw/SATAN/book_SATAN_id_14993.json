    "word": "This is the remedy for sin. Christ says, Where Satan has set his throne, there shall stand my cross. Satan shall be cast out, and I will be lifted up to draw all men unto me. I will become the center of the redeemed world. The Lord God shall be exalted. Those who are now controlled by human ambition, human passions, shall become workers for me. Evil influences have conspired to counterwork all good. They have confederated to make all men think it righteous to oppose the law of Jehovah. But my army shall meet in conflict with the Satanic forces. My Spirit shall combine with every heavenly agency to oppose them. I will engage every sanctified human agency in the universe. None of my agencies are to be absent. I have a work for all who love me. I have employment for every soul who will work under my direction. The activity of Satan's army, the danger that surrounds the human soul, call for the energies of every worker. But no compulsion shall be exercised. Man's depravity is to be met by the love, the patience, the long-suffering of God. My work shall be to save those who are under Satan's rule.",
