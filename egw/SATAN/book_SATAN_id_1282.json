    "word": "Satan Seeks to Weaken Self-Control\nSatan seeks to lower the standard of purity and to weaken the self-control of those who enter the marriage relation, because he knows\n135\nthat while the baser passions are in the ascendancy, the moral powers grow steadily weaker, and he need have no concern as to their spiritual growth. He knows, too, that in no way can he better stamp his own hateful image upon their offspring, and that he can thus mold their character even more readily than he can the character of the parents.",
