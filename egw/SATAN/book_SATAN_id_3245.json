    "word": "Says the prophet Isaiah: \u201cWhen they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony. If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\u201d [Isaiah 8:19, 20.] If men had been willing to receive the truth so plainly stated in the Scriptures, concerning the nature of man and the state of the dead, they would see in the claims and manifestations of Spiritualism the working of Satan with power and signs and lying wonders. But rather than yield the liberty so agreeable to the carnal heart, and renounce the sins which they love, multitudes close their eyes to the light, and walk straight on, regardless of warnings, while Satan weaves his snares about them, and they become his prey. \u201cBecause they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,\u201d therefore \u201cGod shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.\u201d [2 Thessalonians 2:10, 11.]",
