    "word": "The crisis is just before us. The fierce conflict of mind with mind, of principle with principle, of truth with error, which is fast approaching, and which has already begun, calls for constant vigilance. This world is the great field where the last battle is to be fought. Now every man who is on the Lord's side will come up to the battle of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty, and the walls of antichrist shall fall before the Captain of the Lord's host. Then let not the chosen of God be found in opposition to the messengers and messages He sends; but let the ability and tact of every soul, by all Scriptural and holy means, be employed to give greater efficiency and strength in the aggressive warfare---not against brethren, not against the Lord's anointed---but against the Satanic agencies that they must meet. \n                                                                           1039",
