    "word": "MR No. 1419 - Satan the Author of Commercial Strife; Strange Occurrences Predicted\n\n     (Written Oct. 27, 1910, from Sanitarium, California, to Elder A. G. Daniells.) \n\n\n     When I took up my pen this morning to begin to write, my left eye failed me. I cannot use it, but I can use my right eye. This is a strange experience for me in recent years. But in the early years of my work, I did much of the writing for my books with my left eye bandaged. And it may be that I shall again be afflicted in the same way. But I thank the Lord that for many years now I have been able to use both eyes.",
