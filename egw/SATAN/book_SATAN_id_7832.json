    "word": "The Father decides the case of Satan, and declares that he must be turned out of Heaven for his daring rebellion, and that all those who united with him in his rebellion, should be turned out with him. Then there was war in Heaven. Christ and his angels fought against Satan and his angels, for they were determined to remain in Heaven with all their rebellion. But they prevailed not. Christ and loyal angels triumphed, and drove Satan and his rebel sympathizers from Heaven.",
