    "word": "I have felt a heavy burden that our leading ministers shall be found faithful to their trust, wise, and discriminating. If a wrong spirit is cherished by those who are appointed to be light bearers, the carrying of the soul-saving messages to the multitude will be hindered, and souls will be lost. What is needed now is thorough conversion and whole-hearted consecration. He who is closely connected with Christ will be strengthened to withstand human and satanic devisings. We are living in perilous times, and it is not in the order of the Lord that our ministers shall dwell upon questions about which there is known to be a serious difference of opinion among themselves.",
