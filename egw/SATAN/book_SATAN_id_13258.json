    "word": "Those who refuse the testimonies God has sent them are not eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God. The character developed tells its history to the end. Through the refusal to receive correct principles, and the corruption of human nature, Satan works by his sophistry to deceive if possible the very elect. Through subtlety he steals away the influence of the words of life, and truth, precious truth, is not of half as much consequence to men as their ambitious purposes.",
