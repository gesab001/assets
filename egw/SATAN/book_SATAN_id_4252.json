    "word": "Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit . . . declare publicly that they have forsaken the service of Satan and have become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. They have obeyed the command: \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the unclean thing.\" And to them is fulfilled the promise: \"I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty\" (2 Corinthians 6:17, 18). . . .",
