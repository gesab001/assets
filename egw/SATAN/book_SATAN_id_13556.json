    "word": "By overcoming in man's behalf, He [Christ] was placing fallen man on vantage ground with God. In His human nature Jesus gave evidence that in every temptation wherewith Satan shall assail fallen man, there is help for him in God, if he will take hold of His strength, and through obedience make peace with Him. Jesus stood forth in human nature a conqueror in behalf of the fallen race.--Ms 49, 1897, p. 9.",
