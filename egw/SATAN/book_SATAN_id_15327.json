    "word": "Shall the attributes of the enemy be revealed in the life practice of professed Christians? Shall men who put on the armour and stand as faithful sentinels for God, refusing to favor any man, and seeking to do the work God has given them to do with humble faith and sincerity, be despised by men who know not that they have given themselves to do the work of Satan? O how much better it would be if those who thus judge others would themselves feed on the flesh and blood of the Son of God, studying and practicing the word of God.",
