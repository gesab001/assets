    "word": "The all-sufficiency of the Saviour is brought to view in this Scripture. He experienced in his human nature all that we can possibly experience. Taking our nature, and in the strength that his humanity received from God, he coped successfully with the powers of Satan and fallen angels. He bids his servants learn of him. \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,\" He invites, \"and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" Learn of Christ. As you study his personal life, and practice his works you will find rest to your soul. \n\n\n                               -417-",
