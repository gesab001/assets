    "word": "Teaching and Healing. \n\n     The Lord's people are to be one. There is to be no separation in His work. Christ sent out the twelve apostles, and afterward the seventy disciples, to preach the gospel and to heal the sick. \"As ye go,\" He said, \"preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\" Matthew 10:7, 8. And as they went forth preaching the kingdom of God, power was given them to heal the sick \n                                                                           12\nand cast out evil spirits. In God's work teaching and healing are never to be separated. His commandment-keeping people are to be one. Satan will invent every device to separate those whom God is seeking to make one. But the Lord will reveal Himself as a God of judgment. We are working under the eyes of the heavenly host. There is a divine Watcher among us, inspecting all that is planned and carried on. \n\n                                               -",
