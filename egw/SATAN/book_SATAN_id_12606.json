    "word": "And now I can but weep as I think of the suffering, stubborn natures who will not yield to evidence. They wear an appearance of nonconcern, but it is not truth. Gladly would they change their relation to me and those whom they have deeply wronged by thoughts, by words, by influence, if they could avoid the humiliation of saying, \"I have committed an error; I confess my faults; will you forgive me?\" The haughty, stubborn will evades the very points they will have to face if their souls are recovered and converted. Oh, will they never break the spell of Satan that is upon them? Will they cherish their pride to the last? How my heart longs to see them free and not in the strong deceptions of Satan.--Ms 36, 1890, pp. 11-13. (\"Dangers of False Ideas on Justification by Faith,\" undated.)
