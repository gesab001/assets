    "word": "Human beings, possessed with energy, zeal, and perseverance, will place all their God-given powers in cooperation with Satan\u2019s despotism to make void the law of God. Impostors of every caste and grade will claim to be worthy and true, and there will be a magnifying of the common and impure against the true and the holy. Thus the spurious is accepted, and the true standard of holiness is discarded, as the word of God was discarded by Adam and Eve for the lie of Satan.\u2014Manuscript 143, 1901.",
