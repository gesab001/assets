    "word": "Parents have not restrained the selfishness of their children. Self-indulgence has been the object of pursuit. Through self-serving, multitudes are bound in servitude to Satan. They are the slaves of their own impulses and passions, which are under the control of the wicked one. In calling them to his service, God offers them freedom. Obedience to God is liberty from the thraldom of sin, deliverance from human passion and impulse.",
