    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     The enemy will seek in every way possible to obstruct the course of those who take hold of any branch of the work of God, that they may not have success. But instead of their interpreting this as an evidence that the Lord would not have them engage in labor, they should take it in altogether a different light, and see in the difficulties a vigilant foe; because the enemy is watching to block the way. And especially will this be the case with young men and women who would give themselves to the work of God. Satan will use every means to divert them from it. He attacks those who are doing errands for God, that they may be defeated. But those very ones who have had this difficulty to contend with, and have carried the matter to God, and \n378\npersevered under discouragements, will say that it is the most valuable part of their experience.",
