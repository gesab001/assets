    "word": "The word of God is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. \"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee.\" The heart preoccupied with the word of God is fortified against Satan. Those who make Christ their daily companion and familiar friend will feel that the powers of an unseen world are all around them; and by looking unto Jesus they will become assimilated to His image. By beholding they become changed to the divine pattern; their character is softened, refined, and ennobled for the heavenly kingdom.",
