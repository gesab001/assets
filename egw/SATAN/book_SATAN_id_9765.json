HE THOUGHT OF LIVING WITH THIS WOMAN AND HAVING CHILDREN BY HER IN HEAVEN.] I have much to say to you. You have been represented to me as being in great peril. Satan is on your track, and at times he has whispered to you pleasing fables, and has shown you charming pictures of one whom he represents as a more suitable companion for you than the wife of your youth, the mother of your children.",
