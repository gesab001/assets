    "word": "How to Deal with Criticism \n\n     May the Lord greatly bless you in your work, my dear brethren. I want you to guard one point. Do not be easily disturbed by what others may say. Know that you are right, and then go ahead. God will certainly lead all who will be led. The great trouble is, that we are unwilling to walk with God. Maintain the simplicity of Christ. Ask God to separate from you everything that would separate you from him, and then walk before him in all humility. Let earnestness, and sincerity, and faith characterize your prayers. The Lord is willing to do for us exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think. Talk it, pray it. Do not talk unbelief. We cannot afford to let Satan see that he has power to darken our countenances and sadden our souls. Pray in faith. Let not your faith weaken; for the blessings received are proportionate to the faith exercised. Pray, believe, rejoice! Sing praises to God because he has answered your prayers. Take him \n                                                                           14\nat his word. Not one sincere supplication is lost. I long at times to be with you, but I dare not leave my work. I commit you to a covenant-keeping God. May he give you peace, and grace, and health. Do not cease to claim the fullness of his promise. Do not be troubled by the opinions of those who talk for the sake of talking. Let us pray that their tongues may become active and eloquent in the praise of God.\"--Extract from Unpublished Testimony, July 31, 1902.",
