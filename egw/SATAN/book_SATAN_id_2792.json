    "word": "These words were clearly and forcibly spoken: \"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. Press together; press together, and love as brethren. Pray together.\" The Lord has paid the price of His own blood for the salvation of the world. He suffered every indignity that men could devise and Satan could invent, in order to carry out the plan of salvation. Let not the teacher seek to exalt self, but let him see the necessity of learning of Christ daily, and making Him the pattern. For teachers and students our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ should be the only example.",
