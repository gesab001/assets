But when confidence is lacking, it is manifested by suspicion, by criticism, by catching up things that are unworthy of notice, and making capital of whatever seems to them objectionable. In this way Satan is glorified and Christ is put to shame, dishonored in the person of His saints. I have had this matter presented to me in a variety of forms, until I can realize how cruel it is. All who love Jesus in sincerity and truth should be heartily recognized and welcomed as those who are \"laborers together with God,\" \"endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\"",
