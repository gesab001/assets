    "word": "Some in Battle Creek have indulged feelings toward Dr. Kellogg that are not justifiable. This is offensive to God. Dr. Kellogg has the frailties of humanity, and is as liable as themselves to err. He does not claim perfection, neither do his friends claim it for him. He is subject to the fierce temptations of Satan; for any deviation from the right in him will affect many others. The unwarrantable jealousy and prejudice against him are contrary to the spirit of Christ. Jealousy and evil surmisings place a wrong construction upon motive, plans, and actions. And the very fact that we are always suspecting evil, goes far to create the evil which we suspect.",
