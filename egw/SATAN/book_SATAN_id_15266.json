    "word": "At the same time there will be a power stirring every thing from beneath. The working of evil angels will be manifest in deceptions, delusions, in calamities, and casualties, and crimes of no ordinary character. While God employs the angels of mercy to work through His human agents, Satan sets his agencies in operation, laying under tribute all the powers that submit to his control. There will be lords many and gods many. The cry will be heard, \"Lo, here is Christ, and Lo, He is there.\" The deep plotting of Satan will reveal its working everywhere for the purpose of distracting attention from present duty. The appearance of a false Christ will awaken delusive hopes in the minds of those who allow themselves to be deceived. The church members that are awake will rise to the emergency, manifesting greater diligence as iniquity abounds. The very manifestations of Satanic power are to be presented in their true light before the people. There will be signs and wonders in the world of nature. The powers of earth and heaven will manifest a terrifying, destructive activity. But the eye of faith will discern in all these manifestations harbingers of the grand and awful future, and the triumphs that will surely come to God's people.",
