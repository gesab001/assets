    "word": "A Deceptive Fallacy \n\n     This science may appear to you to be very valuable; but to you and to others it is a fallacy prepared by Satan. It is the charm of the serpent which stings to spiritual death. It covers much that seems wonderful, but it is foreign to the nature and spirit of Christ. This science does not lead to Him who is life and salvation.",
