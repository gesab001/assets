    "word": "Had Peter walked humbly with God, hiding self in Christ; had he earnestly looked for divine help; had he been less self-confident; had he received the Lord's instruction and practised it, he would have been watching unto prayer. . . . Had he closely examined himself, the Lord would have given him divine help and there would have been no need of Satan's sifting. . . . There is no power in the whole satanic force that can disable the soul that trusts, in simple confidence, in the wisdom that comes from God.",
