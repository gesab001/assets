    "word": "Do not strive to have your own way. If other people do not agree with you, do not make a mountain [out] of a mole-hill and feel that you can no longer be united with them in the Lord Jesus. Do not lose your affection and love for those who do not wholly agree with you. Let not the little differences that arise be made an occasion to break up the unity that should exist among brethren. This is the work of Satan. When you quarrel with your brethren, when you are selfish and are jealous if you do not get your own way, you show that you are not meek and lowly. \n\n\n                                     -68-",
