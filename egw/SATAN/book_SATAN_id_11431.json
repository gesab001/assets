    "word": "In conducting the important interests of meetings near a large city, the co-operation of all the workers is essential. All should keep in the very atmosphere of the meetings, watching the people as they come in and go out, showing the utmost courtesy and kindness, and a tender regard for their souls. They should be ready to speak to them in season and out of season, watching to win souls. O that Christ's workers would show one half so much vigilance as does Satan, who is always on the track of human beings, always wide awake watching to lay some gin or snare to destroy them.",
