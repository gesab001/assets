    "word": "I ask you to work and walk out on my faith, if you cannot on your own. Answer the drawings of the Holy Spirit of God. Accept the prayers of the people of God in your behalf. Poor, tempest-tossed soul, only believe in Jesus' willingness to save you. Let not Satan be your spokesman any longer. Jesus has work for you to do. Satan will speak for you if you will let him, but tell him \"No; let my lips utter only words of faith and hope and truth.\" \n\n\n                                  -150- \n\nKeep talking faith, rebuke the enemy, and the great black cloud of despair will arise and roll back and disappear.",
