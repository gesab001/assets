    "word": "Burdens have been borne, projects have been entered into, and time has been given to matters that God never intended any of you to study upon, or to undertake. Now, for Christ's sake, change the order of things. In the place of having ministers drawn from their fields of labor to learn more, encourage them to communicate what they do know. You have robbed a world that is perishing in its sins, of labor it should have had. If these men will work, if they will study, and consecrate themselves to God, if they will do the work with earnestness, with zeal, with faith and prayer, we shall see something done. Satan has stolen a march on us. God desires that we shall put on the whole armor of righteousness. He says, \"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on \n\n\n                      - 25 - \n\nthe whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\" Read carefully the injunctions here given by the inspired apostle, and \"be ye doers of the word.\" \n                           Mrs. E. G. White. \n\n                                               -",
