    "word": "Those who resist the Holy Spirit of God, and provoke Him to depart, know not to what lengths Satan will lead them. \"O, that thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy peace.\" Shall the words of Christ be irrevocably spoken, \"But now they are hid from thine eyes?\" When the Holy Spirit departs from the human agents, they will do those things which they once viewed in a correct light. They will follow step by step in the footsteps of Satan. Who then can strive with them to any purpose? Will the minister plead for them and with them? All their words are as idle tales. These souls have Satan close beside them to misconstrue the words spoken, and bring them to their understanding in a perverted light. They are misinterpreted by them; for when the Spirit of God is grieved away, every appeal made through the Lord's servants is meaningless to them. They will misconstrue every word. They will laugh and turn into ridicule the most solemn words of Scripture, which, if they were not bewitched by satanic agencies, would make them tremble. Every appeal made to those who are in need of help is in vain. They will not hear a word of reproof or counsel. They despise all the entreaties of the Spirit, and disobey the commandments of God which they have once vindicated and exalted. Well may the words of \n\n\n                                    -360- \n\nthe apostle come home to such souls, \"Who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth?\" They have followed the counsel of their own heart until truth is no more truth to them.--Ms 28, 1897, pp. 11-13.
