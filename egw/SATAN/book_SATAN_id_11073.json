    "word": "It is only by watching unto prayer, and the exercise of living faith, that the Christian can preserve his integrity in the midst of the temptations that Satan brings to bear upon him. But \"whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith\" (1 John 5:4). Talk to your heart constantly the language of faith:\"Jesus said He would receive me, and I believe His word. I will praise Him; I will glorify His name.\" Satan will be close by your side to suggest that you do not feel any joy. Answer him, \"'This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.' I have everything to be glad of; for I am a child of God. I am trusting in Jesus. The law of God is in my heart; none of my steps shall slide.\"--Signs of the Times, May 15, 1884.",
