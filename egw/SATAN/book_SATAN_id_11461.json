    "word": "Frank Jones is a special agent of Satan. He has had influence to deceive some souls. When his doctrines are so manifestly originated by a mind impure and corrupt, we would think any mind that had been under the influence of the Spirit of God, and that was conversant with the Scriptures in any degree, would turn from his polluting heresy, and denounce his vagaries with loathing. But there is that in the human heart which inclines to accept anything new and odd and strange, even of the most inconsistent and revolting character.",
