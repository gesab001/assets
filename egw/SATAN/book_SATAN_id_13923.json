    "word": "I am instructed to say to those who have means to loan or to give: Help the work at Madison. You have no time to lose. Satan will soon rise up to create hindrances; plenty of them. I am instructed to say to these men: Follow the instruction of the Lord. Let the work go forward while it may. This is no time for weakness to be woven into our experience. Do not spend money for story magazines and cheap literature, now so often found in your homes; but take your means--that which you have invested in houses and lands and bank stock--and say, I will use this in employing men and women to give the last message of warning to the world. The workers at Madison are capable of giving right instruction, and they should be encouraged. This is a work that the Lord will approve.",
