    "word": "324. As our first parents lost Eden through the indulgence of appetite, our only hope of regaining Eden is through the firm denial of appetite and passion. . . .

As we near the close of time, Satan's temptation to indulge appetite will be more powerful and more difficult to overcome.--T., V. III, p. 491.",
