    "word": "There must be a change in that Sanitarium. I lift my voice in protest against the course pursued there in conforming to the habits and customs of the world. Those who are connected with that institution should be examples as reformers. When Dr. Kellogg took his stand against the dress reform, he made a wrong move; in no place was the dress advocated so appropriate and in every way proper and consistent as in an institution for the treatment of the sick. The dress is not in accordance with the fashions of the world, and this is why it is considered objectionable. Physicians and workers should firmly uphold the standard of right, and exert an influence to correct the wrong habits of those who have been worshiping at the shrine of fashion, and break the spell which Satan has had over these poor souls. Worldlings should see a marked contrast between their own extravagance and the simplicity of reformers who are followers of Christ.",
