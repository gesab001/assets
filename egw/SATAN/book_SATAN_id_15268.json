    "word": "Satan's ear caught the words spoken by John the Baptist, \"Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world,\" and he determined to unite all the power of his army and of human beings with himself to accomplish the ruin of the race. He would commence with the appetite. He could bring his temptations to bear upon this point, and by a perverted appetite destroy the mental and physical force, and make man appear a revolting, polluted being before his Maker. And Satan has carried out his purpose.",
