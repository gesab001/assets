    "word": "If you will meet together once or twice a week in the evening, and with humble minds, feeling your own weakness and defects, will ask the Lord to enlighten your understandings and fill your hearts with His love, and examine, not one another, but the Scriptures, Satan will be defeated.

Love, compassion, and respect cherished for one another should take the place of jangling and accusation.",
