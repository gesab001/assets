    "word": "Do not, because I tell you the truth, abandon yourselves to discouragement and despair. Satan may come to you with the cruel suggestion, \"It is a hopeless case. You are irredeemable.\" But this is a lie which he has originated. There is hope for you in Christ. There is no need of your turning away from the Saviour, for He is making every effort to lead you to Him. There is no need of your remaining in the condition that you are now in. You can be free in Christ if you will refuse to allow the enemy to make you a stumbling block to others. God does not tell you that you must overcome your love of yourself and of the world in your own strength. He asks you to come close to His side. He will be your helper. Will you not lay hold of His power that your influence may be a blessing, not a curse? \n\n\n                                   -273-",
