    "word": "Christian life a constant warfare\n     The Christian life is a constant warfare. The church militant is not the church triumphant. Paul says, \u201cWe wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\u201d We must meet human beings of power and influence who are on Satan's side of the controversy; \n24\nand we must also meet unseen agencies of evil. Let us be found in the right position.",
