    "word": "If you would make the Southern whites and the colored people your friends, you must meet them where they are, not to act as they act, to sin as they sin, but to present the truth to them in your daily life. This people must be taught as you would teach children their alphabet. The truth must be brought before them by presenting to them the lessons of Christ in their simplicity. . . . By unwise words the colored people will be led to think that they can defy their oppressors; therefore we must avoid stirring up their excitable natures. Speak no word that will prejudice the Negroes against the whites. Satan is seeking for opportunities to work these ignorant, passionate colored people, by causing them to misunderstand the motives of the white people in laboring for them. Let no spirit of resistance be encouraged. Teach the people to conform in all things to the laws of their State, when they can do so without conflicting with the law of God. Counsel needs to be very guardedly given; for unless you are as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves, your way will be hedged up.--Ms 118, 1899, pp. 1-3.
