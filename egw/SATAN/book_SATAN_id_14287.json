    "word": "Therefore the Lord has given man a probation, and we will work out our characters as the artist takes [an image] upon the polished plate. As he takes the features of the one that wants his picture produced, the God of heaven is taking the character of every human soul of us. That character is going up to heaven, and it is produced there; it is recorded there in the book what traits of character we manifest. If we manifest the attributes of Satan, it is that character that can find no place in the heavenly courts above.",
