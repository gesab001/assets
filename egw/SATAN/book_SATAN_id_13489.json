    "word": "Fathers and mothers can clear themselves of responsibility for the corrupt actions of their own or their adopted children only by coming into the clear light of the Sun of Righteousness, seeing the great danger of their wrong course, repenting before God, and calling evil by its true name. Too often they compromise themselves by pursuing a vacillating course, or by endeavoring to cover up the wicked deeds of their children. The Lord calls for a work of purification to be done in His church. Those who remain on the side of Satan must be counted as workers of evil.",
