    "word": "Christ said to Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not\" (Luke 22:31, 32). Who can estimate the result of the prayers of the world's Redeemer? When Christ shall see the travail of His soul and be satisfied, then will be seen and realized the value of His earnest prayers while His divinity was veiled with humanity.",
