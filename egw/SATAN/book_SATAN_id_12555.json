    "word": "Miracle-working Power of Satan Will Deceive Many. As the condition of the church and the world was opened before me, and I beheld the fearful scenes that lie just before us, I was alarmed at the outlook; and night after night, while all in the house were sleeping, I wrote out the things given me of God. I was shown the heresies which are to arise, the delusions that will prevail, the miracle-working power of Satan--the false Christs that will appear--that will deceive the greater part even of the religious world, and that would, if it were possible, draw away even the elect.--Letter 1, 1890, p. 2. (To \"Dear Brethren,\" May 14, 1890.)",
