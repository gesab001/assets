    "word": "The Lord has a controversy with all men who by their unbelief and doubt have been saying that he delays his coming, and who have been smiting their fellow servants, and eating and drinking with (working from the very same principle as) the drunken; they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. Satan has controlled their reason, and they know not at what they stumble.",
