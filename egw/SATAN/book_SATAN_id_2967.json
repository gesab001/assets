    "word": "Sometimes a case presents itself that should be made a prayerful study. The person must be shown his true character, understand his own peculiarities of disposition and temperament, and see his infirmities. He should be judiciously treated. If he can be reached, if his heart can be touched by this wise and patient labor, he can be bound with strong cords to Christ and led to trust in God. O, when a work like this is done, all the heavenly court look and rejoice; for a precious soul has been rescued from Satan's snare and saved from death! O, will it not pay to work intelligently for the salvation of souls? Christ paid the price of his own life for them, and shall his followers ask, \u201cAm I my brother's keeper?\u201d Shall we not work in unison with the Master? Shall we not appreciate the worth of souls for whom our Saviour died?",
