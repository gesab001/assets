    "word": "Although Satan has misrepresented God\u2019s purposes, falsified His character, and caused people to look upon God in a false light, yet through the ages God\u2019s love for His earthly children has never ceased. Christ\u2019s work was to reveal the Father as merciful, compassionate, full of goodness and truth. . . . The only begotten Son of God sweeps back the hellish shadow in which Satan has enveloped the Father, and declares, \u201cI and My Father are one; look on Me and behold God.\u201dManuscript 25, 1890 (Manuscript Releases, vol. 13, pp. 240-243).",
