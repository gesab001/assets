    "word": "A preacher may deal in sacred, holy things, and yet not be holy in heart. He may give himself to Satan to work wickedness, and to corrupt the soul and body of his flock. Yet if the minds of women and youth professing to love and fear God were fortified with the Spirit of God; if they had trained their minds to purity of thought, and educated themselves to avoid all appearance of evil, they would be safe from any improper advances, and be secure from the prevailing corruption around them. The apostle has written concerning himself, \u201cBut I keep under my body, and bring it in subjection; lest \n150\nthat by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:27.",
