    "word": "Will you present to the camp meeting the necessity of handling Vol. 4? It contains warnings and the prophecy of future events which will come. All should be informed that they may know how to meet these things--trials, deceptions, delusions of the devil. Here again Satan has wrought to keep from the people the very light needed for the present time. And no pen or voice is raised to set this thing before our people in its true bearing. I invested $3000 to enlarge Vol. 4, and have only received twelve cents and a half per copy. I own the plates and pay for the publishing of the book myself and then our people shoved in the Bible Readings, a cheap book easily handled, and nearly every canvasser dropped Vol. 4 to handle that book.",
