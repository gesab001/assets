    "word": "Now Satan prepares for a last mighty struggle for the supremacy. . . . As the wicked dead are raised, and he sees the vast multitudes upon his side, his hopes revive, and he determines not to yield the great controversy. . . . He represents himself to his deluded subjects as a redeemer, assuring them that his power has brought them forth from their graves. . . . At last the order to advance is given, and the countless host moves on. . . . The armies of Satan surround the city, and make ready for the onset.",
