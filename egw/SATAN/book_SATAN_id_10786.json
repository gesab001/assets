    "word": "Let none suppose that because they have been used as the Lord's instrumentalities, they are all-sufficient. The Lord uses men and honors them by giving them His wisdom, as long as they are true to Him, and do not gather glory to themselves. Those who take themselves out of the Lord's hands, and think themselves capable of managing the work, are not led by His Spirit, but by \"another spirit.\" Satan steps in, and they change leaders. Then comes the crookedness and subtlety of the serpent's guile.--Manuscript 37, May 1, 1903, \"Directions for Work.\"",
