    "word": "Satan, in his pride and arrogance, had declared himself to be the rightful and permanent ruler of the world, the possessor of all its riches and glory, claiming homage of all who lived in it, as if he had created the world and all things that were therein. Said he to Christ, \"All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.\" He endeavored to make a special contract with Christ, to make over to Him at once the whole of his claim, if He would worship him.",
