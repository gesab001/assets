    "word": "These men are not to suppose that they can compass the world, for God has not set them to embrace so much with their own labors merely. The man who invests all his powers in many lines of work cannot take in hand the management of a sanitarium and do it justice. Satan is working every moment to find an opportunity to steal in. He tells the physician that his talents are too valuable to be bound up among Seventh-day Adventists; that if he were free he could do a very large work. But the Lord has bound the physician to this people whom He has commanded to be a light in the world, and his work is to give all that the Lord has given him--to give, not as one influence among many, but as the influence through God to make effective the truth for this time.",
