    "word": "Then the Angel, who is Christ Himself, the Saviour of sinners, puts to silence the accuser of His people, declaring: \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?\u201d Israel had long remained in the furnace of affliction.

In their penitence and humiliation the compassionate Saviour will not leave His people to the cruel power of the heathen. . . .",
