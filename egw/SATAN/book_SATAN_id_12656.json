    "word": "This is the instruction every child should receive in his earliest years. This is the work the parents should do in the home. The family in the Haskell Home is an object lesson for all parents. If children who had parents and a home had one half the patient instruction given to the orphans in the home, there would be a very different condition of things. If mothers would devote less time to cooking and sewing and more time to teaching their children in the love and fear of God, how greatly pleased the Lord would be. But many parents seem to be only grown up children, who have not left behind their childish ways and inclinations. Let parents remember that Satan is playing the game of life for every soul, and that practical sympathy, forbearance, and love is the test of purity and unselfishness.--Letter 70, 1901, pp. 2, 3. (To Dr. and Mrs. J. H. Kellogg, May 1, 1901.)",
