    "word": "DID YOU KNOW THAT BEFORE CHRIST CAME TO EARTH TO REPRESENT THE FATHER, SATAN WAS ACTUALLY CONVINCED THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD EVENTUALLY JOIN HIM? AND HE HAD PLENTY OF EVIDENCE UPON WHICH TO BASE THIS BELIEF. SATAN HAD SUBTLY CONVINCED MOST MEN AND WOMEN THAT GOD'S LAW WAS UNREASONABLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP. AND THOSE WHO DID TRY TO OBEY MADE THE LAW A BURDEN, AND BY SO DOING MISREPRESENTED GOD. THEN JESUS CAME AS LIVING LAW: HIS LIFE CONTRASTED MARKEDLY WITH LAWLESS INDIVIDUALS ON THE ONE HAND, AND LEGALISTS ON THE OTHER. IN THIS SELECTION ELLEN WHITE SUGGESTS THAT A CHRISTIAN LIFE, IMAGINATIVELY LIVED, WILL REVEAL THE WISDOM OF GOD'S LAW.",
