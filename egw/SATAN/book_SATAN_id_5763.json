    "word": "226\nSEARCH THE SCRIPTURES WITH PRAYER FOR DIVINE GUIDANCE.\u2014Those who are unwilling to accept the plain, cutting truths of the Bible are continually seeking for pleasing fables that will quiet the conscience. The less spiritual, self-denying, and humiliating the doctrines presented, the greater the favor with which they are received. These persons degrade the intellectual powers to serve their carnal desires. Too wise in their own conceit to search the Scriptures with contrition of soul and earnest prayer for divine guidance, they have no shield from delusion. Satan is ready to supply the heart\u2019s desire, and he palms off his deceptions in the place of truth.\u2014(The Great Controversy, 523.)",
