    "word": "Christ cannot cooperate with a dead church. He desires His church to be full of vitality, to take hold by living faith of His power. Trials will come upon the true church. Some members will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits. Satan himself will personate Christ, declaring \n\n\n            -178- \n\nthat he is the Son of God. One will say, \"Christ is here\"; another, \"He is there\"; and still another, that He is somewhere else; but we should know individually that He is abiding with us, and that He will save us by His righteousness.",
