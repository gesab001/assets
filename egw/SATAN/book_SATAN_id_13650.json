    "word": "So long as the people of God are in this world they will have to meet conflict and trouble and deception, because men choose the attributes of Satan \n\n\n                                     -62- \n\ninstead of the attributes of God. There is a conscience that is not good. There are those whose words are \"yea\" and \"nay\" in regard to the same thing. How are we to deal with those who make these false statements? We should not try to deal with them. The Lord God of Israel will deal with minds according to His knowledge, for He reads the heart. The less we have to do with untruthful elements the better it will be for the church.",
