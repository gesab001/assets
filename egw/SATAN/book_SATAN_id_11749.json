    "word": "Had the soil of the heart been broken up by deep repentance for sin, they would have seen how wicked was their selfish love of the world, their pride and avarice, and would have put them away. The seeds of truth would have struck deep into the fallow ground prepared for them in the heart, and would have sprung up and borne fruit. But evil habits had so long held sway over their lives that their good resolutions had vanished before the voice of the tempter. \"And these are they by the wayside, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, \n                                                                           84\nSatan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.\"",
