    "word": "The Lord has shown me that we are in just as much danger in our day as were the people in the days of Christ. The Lord is speaking through His delegated messengers; but the same unbelief is exhibited. Men close their hearts against Jesus, and hold themselves in the veriest bondage to Satan, supposing that they are preserving their dignity as free men; that they are maintaining their right to act and think for themselves, to believe or doubt; and like the despisers of the gospel in the apostolic times, they wonder and perish.",
