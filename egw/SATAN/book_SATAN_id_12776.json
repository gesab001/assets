    "word": "The last meeting we there held was especially solemn. The poor souls, who had not the privileges of meeting for a long time, were greatly refreshed. While we were praying and weeping before God that night, I was taken off in vision and shown that I must return the next morning. I had not refused obedience to the Spirit of God, His hand had been with me, and His angel had accompanied us and hid us from the people, so that they did not know we were in the place. But our work was done; we could go; the emissaries of Satan were on our track, and we would fare no better than those who had been fanatical and wrong, and suffered the consequences of their inconsistent, unreasonable course by abuse and imprisonment.",
