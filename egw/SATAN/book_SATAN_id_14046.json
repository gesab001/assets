    "word": "There is more hope of the open sinner than of such. The chambers of the soul are desecrated by sin to Satan's control. Will this people be Christians? Will they heed the counsel of Christ, be zealous, and repent? Will they have true contrition of heart? Will they humble their hearts before God before it shall be forever too late? Will they repent of their backslidings? May God help you just now, in this thy day, to confess your sins and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out and your name retained in the Lamb's book of life.",
