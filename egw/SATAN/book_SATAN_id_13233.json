    "word": "In quoting this Scripture, Satan left out a very important point, which reads in Psalm 91:11: \"For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.\" In consenting to do Satan's bidding, Christ would be venturing into Satan's ways, not in ways that God had devised for His Son. That was a dare, and Satan's agents are full of presumptuous dares to get a chance to work his will with those who will accept his dare. But Christ would not accept the dare of Satan. Christ would not enter into controversy with the arch deceiver and tempter. He said, \"It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\" This means more than some understand. These words acknowledge the prerogative of the law of God, whom Satan was tempting, because Christ in His assumed humanity was working out the plan of redemption for the fallen race. \n\n\n                                  -325-",
