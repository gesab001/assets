    "word": "All the insult and despite offered to Christ, all the suffering caused to His disciples, will be as fresh in their recollection as when the satanic deeds were done. The voice which they heard so often in entreaty and persuasion will again sound in their ears. Every tone of gracious solicitude will vibrate as distinctly in their ears as when the Saviour spoke in the synagogues or on the street.",
