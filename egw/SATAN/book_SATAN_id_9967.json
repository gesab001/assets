But in the midst of the time of trouble that is coming,\u2014a time of trouble such as has not been since there was a nation\u2014God's chosen people will stand unmoved. Satan and His angels cannot destroy them; for angels that excel in strength will protect them.\u2014Letter 119, 1904. (In Selected Messages, Book 2, pages 54, 55.)",
