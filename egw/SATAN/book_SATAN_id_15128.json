    "word": "The Lord desires us to act sensibly. We shall have trials; we need never expect anything else; for the time has not yet come when Satan is to be bound. Wherever we may be, we shall continue to have trials. But if we give up to the suggestions of the enemy, we lose the battle. Can we afford to yield to the arch-deceiver? Oh, no! We are to turn for help and deliverance to Him who \"according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,\" even the hope of an eternal inheritance reserved for those \"who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.\" . . .",
