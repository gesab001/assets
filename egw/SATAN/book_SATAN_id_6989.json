    "word": "VIII. Christ Is Our Friend at Court \n\n     Our great High Priest is pleading before the mercy-seat in behalf of His ransomed people. . . . Satan stands at our right hand to accuse us, and our advocate stands at God's right hand to plead for us. He has never lost a case that has been committed to Him. We may trust in our advocate; for He pleads His own merits in our behalf.--The Review and Herald, Aug. 15, 1893.",
