I have been shown that it is a mistake to suppose that the men in positions of special responsibility at Battle Creek, have wisdom which is far superior to that of ordinary men. Those who think that they have, supposing them to have divine enlightenment, rely upon the human judgment of these men, taking their counsel as the voice of God \n\n\n                     - 38 - \n\nBut this is not safe; for unless men are wholly consecrated to God, Satan will work through them to impart that knowledge which will not be for the present and eternal good of those who hear.",
