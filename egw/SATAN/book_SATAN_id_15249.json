    "word": "The Lord has not commissioned Brother _____ to present Anna Phillips' revelations to our people. The truth of the word of God is of sufficient authority and power. It bears its own credentials. The testimonies given me from God are designed to call the attention of the people to a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Brother _____ is in positive danger, and his brethren do not see that danger. They are placing the servant where God should be. The Lord has given Brother _____ a message to prepare a people to stand in the day of God; but when the people shall look to Elder _____ as to God they will become weak instead of being strong. It is no time now to be careless and ignorant of Satan's masterly devices to draw the people into deceptions and delusions. \n\n\n                                   (Signed) \n\n\n                                            Ellen G.
