    "word": "I was shown that Brother B has not a high sense of the perfection of character necessary to a Christian. He has not a proper sense of his duty to his fellow men. He is in danger of advancing his own interests, if an opportunity presents, irrespective of his neighbor's advantage or loss. He regards his own prosperity as exceedingly important, but is not interested in the fortunes or misfortunes of his neighbors, as a follower of Christ should be. For a trifling advantage to himself, Satan can allure him from his integrity. This darkens his own soul and brings darkness upon the church. \"All this,\" says Satan, \"shall be yours, if you will depart from strict integrity. All this will I give you if you will only please me in this, or do and say that.\" And too often has Brother B been deceived by the adversary to his own hurt and the darkening of other minds.",
