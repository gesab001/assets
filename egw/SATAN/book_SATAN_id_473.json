    "word": "Those who purchase success at the fearful price of submission to the will of Satan will find that they have made a hard bargain. Everything in Satan\u2019s trade is secured at a high price. The advantages he presents are a fearful, deceptive mirage. The promised high hopes he holds out are secured at the loss of things that are good and holy and pure. Let Satan always be confounded with the words \u201cIt is written.\u201d. . .",
