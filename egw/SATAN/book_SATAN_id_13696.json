    "word": "It is time our people who profess to love God heed the voice of the Spirit of God. Press together, press together. In unity there is strength; in dissension and drawing apart there is weakness. God would not have the soldiers in His army give away their fellow soldiers to the enemy, while they are overflowing with sympathy for the enemies of Christ and the truth. Oh, consistency, thou art a jewel! God's people who have for many years been engaged in the work of God are set aside for a complaint coming from the enemies of God and the truth, and these enemies of Christ take their place. Where all of one faith \n\n\n                                   -238- \n\nshould stand true as steel to the interests of each other, there is watching as spies, there are testimonies drawn out from persons, and an educating school is formed through this process of surmising and reporting evil that will separate the souls from God and open the door wide for the polluting, corrupting power of Satan to have full sway over the minds of the workers. There will be a suspicion created against one who is entirely innocent of any wrong, but who was simply discharging his duties as best he knew how. God is not at all in this business of those of the same faith thinking the worst of believers in the truth, while the mantle of sympathy and love covers those who are full of bitterness against Jesus, who is the Truth, the Way, and the Life.",
