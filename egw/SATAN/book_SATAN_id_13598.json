    "word": "When men are selected as counsellors, they are looked upon as guardians to protect the rights of those with whom they are connected. To all in this position I would say, When any man, high or low, rich or poor, needs sympathy, advice, or help, bind that man to your heart by wise, compassionate, tender love. Let there be no harshness, no demeaning, for he is Christ's property, beloved of Jesus Christ. Satan has bound him up with sin; he finds sorrow and pain and misery in sin. He is seeking for Jesus. Lift Him up, the man of Calvary, for one soul saved is worth more than the riches of a world.",
