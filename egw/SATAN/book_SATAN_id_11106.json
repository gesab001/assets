    "word": "The greatest obstruction to your work will be the disregard of the tenderness of Christ in dealing with \n\n\n                       - 16 - \n\none another, because self is seeking the supremacy. Self loves to vaunt itself, and those who possess a spirit unlike Christ's, cannot discern what manner of spirit controls them. They speak and act like sinners, while they profess to be Christians. They more readily express their own will than the will of God, yet they are very strenuous to have their will regarded as the will of God. Satan is urging his attributes into the very midst of us; he is seeking to destroy our love for, and confidence in, each other; and the lack of confidence which brethren in the ministry repose in their fellow-laborers, is easily read in the rules and regulations concerning even the details of the work which they seek to impose upon them.",
