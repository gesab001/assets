    "word": "MR No. 493 - Intercessory Prayer in Ellen G. White's Life\n\n     When Satan found he could not take the life of the child [Edson], he tempted me that God had left me or the child would have been healed when we first prayed for him. I sank under this temptation in despair and was so until last Sabbath evening. My heart seemed within me like lead, but God delivered me that eve and Satan's power was broken.",
