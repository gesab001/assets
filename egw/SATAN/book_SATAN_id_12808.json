    "word": "MR No. 692 - Ellen White Counsels Regarding Education\n\n     Today as I have been writing upon the \"Life of Christ,\" my heart has been all subdued and broken by the thought of the great and infinite sacrifice made in our behalf. I thought, What more could God say to us in pledging His word as to what He will do than what He has said. I have thought there is nothing more, no greater assurance, that could be made of what God purposes giving us, than that manifested in giving His Son. Who can doubt that the Father is perfectly willing to accept us and to refine us; to keep us; to give us heavenly wisdom; to give us His light? Was not Christ the Word? Was not He the light? Was not He the light of men? And did not He come into the world that He might penetrate the clouds of darkness that covered the earth? \"Darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness the people.\" Now, what more could God do than to roll back the cloud, and to break that spell of Satan, by which he would chain our minds to earth and earthly things, and to bring the glorious prospect of immortality, than He had done? What more could He do, I say, than He has done?",
