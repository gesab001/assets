    "word": "Extorting Means to be Used in God's Cause--Has there been any of this rejoicing among those who have been given positions of responsibility in the work of God?  It is a shame to them, and when they see what an offense their course was to God, they will be filled with shame.  The anger of the Lord is kindled against those who can rejoice in the robbery of their fellow men, who extort means to be used for the advantage of the cause.  The Lord asks, Who gave these men this authority?  The cause of God was dearer to the ones they were robbing, than it was to them.  They exercised their ingenuity, a precious talent entrusted to them by God to be used to glorify him, to make it as hard as possible for those who were earnestly and sincerely seeking to do the will of God.  In this they manifested the attributes of Satan.--Letter 34, 1899, p. 12 (Feb. 14, 1899).",
