    "word": "Here is our sufficiency. Our defense is in the preparation of the gospel. The Lord will give wisdom to all who ask him; but let those who are to work difficult and peculiar fields, study Christ's methods. Let not their own peculiar traits of character be brought into the work; for Satan knows upon just what traits of character to work, that objectionable features may be revealed. These traits of character, received by inheritance or cultivated, are to be cut away from the soul, and the Spirit of Christ is to take possession of the organs of speech, of the mental power, of the physical and moral powers, else when in the midst of important interests, Satan shall work with his \n\n\n                       - 54 - \n\nmasterly power to create a condition of things that will call into active exercise these special traits of character, and will bring defeat just when there should be a victory, and so the cause of God will sustain a loss.",
