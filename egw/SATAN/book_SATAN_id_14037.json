Olsen.) \n\n\n     I would be so much pleased to see you both and have a visit with you, and have a praying season with you. We are now to be on our guard every moment, lest Satan shall obtain victories over us. We need to brace up in the Lord Jesus Christ, and pray and believe, for time is short. Be of good courage.",
