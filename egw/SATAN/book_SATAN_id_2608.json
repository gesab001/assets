    "word": "How is it that many who profess the name of Christ utter so many vain, idle words? Satan watches to obtain an advantage over those who speak in a reckless manner. . . . When we utter meaningless and silly words we encourage others to indulge in the same kind of conversation. . . . The only words that should come from our lips should be pure, clean words. No one can tell how much sin is created by careless, foolish, unmeaning words. . . . Every word you speak is as a seed that will germinate and produce either good or bad fruit.",
