    "word": "Satan Will Appear to Succeed.--All things in nature and in the world at large are charged with intense earnestness. Satan, in cooperation with his angels and with evil men, will put forth every effort to gain the victory, and will appear to succeed. But from this conflict, truth and righteousness will come forth  triumphant in victory. Those who have believed a lie will be defeated, for the days of apostasy will be ended.-- Manuscript 24, 1891. \n                                                                           394",
