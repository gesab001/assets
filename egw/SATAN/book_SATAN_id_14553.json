From the light God has given me, there never was any new light that came from heaven but that Satan could find something in it to pick at. And so it is with some of the people of today-- they will pick at little things. They want the light, but there comes along the enemy just as he did to the men of Nazareth, and although the Spirit of God told them that Jesus was the anointed one and Christ told them what His work was--to break the power of the enemy and let the oppressed go free, to loose the bands of wickedness and to preach the gospel to the poor [see Luke 4:18]--[they remained in doubt and unbelief].",
