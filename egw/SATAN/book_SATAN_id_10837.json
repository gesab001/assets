    "word": "Those who have fallen asleep at their post are now to awake and trim their lamps. They are to entertain not a vestige of doubt as to the truth for this time. The hypnotism of Satan must be shown in its true bearing. We are not to turn our steps toward Egypt, but toward Canaan, the land of promise. The Lord says to me, \"I have strengthened you to bear a message for this time. Wake up the men who have been receiving sophistries. They are asleep as to the great importance of the present time and the dangers of the future.\" Some who in the past have had a genuine experience will awake, because their lives have not been a continual contradiction of truth. . . .",
