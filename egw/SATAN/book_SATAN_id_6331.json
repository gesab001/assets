    "word": "Ellen G. White Worked No Miracles \n\n     Some declare their unbelief in the work that the Lord has given me to do because, as they say, \"Mrs. E. G. White \n                                                                           54\nworks no miracles.\" But those who look for miracles as a sign of divine guidance are in grave danger of deception. It is stated in the Word that the enemy will work through his agents who have departed from the faith, and they will seemingly work miracles, even to the bringing down of fire out of heaven in the sight of men. By means of \"lying wonders\" Satan would deceive, if possible, the very elect.",
