    "word": "Our faith in reference to the messages of the first, second, and third angels was correct. The great waymarks we have passed are immovable.

These pillars of truth stand firm as the eternal hills, unmoved by all the efforts of men combined with those of Satan and his host. We can learn much, and should be constantly searching the Scriptures to see if these things are so.",
