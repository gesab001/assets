    "word": "You have strong natural passions, which need to be chastened and controlled. Although a man in years, you are not a man in self-control, but have the unreasonable prejudices and stubborn disposition of an uncontrollable child. When once your position is taken, you will uphold it at any cost. Knowing your disposition and temperament, knowing that when you start upon a wrong track, any efforts made to change your course only render you more persistent, I have made no special effort for you, fearing that your resistance would carry you fully over to Satan's side, placing you altogether under the black banner of unbelief.",
