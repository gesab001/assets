    "word": "Parents who would teach their children the evil of following the fashions of the world, have a hard battle. They are met with, \"Why, mother, sisters A., B., and C., wear hoops; if it is wicked for me, it is for them.\" What can the parents say? They should set a right example before their children, and although the example of professed followers of Christ causes the children to think that their parents are too careful and severe in their restrictions, yet God will bless the efforts of these conscientious parents. If the parents do not take a decided, firm, course, their children will be borne down with the current, for Satan and his evil angels are working upon their minds, and the example of unconsecrated professors is against their efforts, \n                                                                           70\nwhich makes the work of overcoming far more laborious for their children. Yet with faith in God, and earnest prayer, believing parents may press on in this rugged path of duty. The way of the cross is an onward, upward, way. And as we advance therein, seeking the things that are above, we must leave farther and farther in the distance the things which belong to the earth. While the world and carnal professors are rushing downward to death, those who climb the hill will have to put forth efforts or they will be carried down in the broad road.",
