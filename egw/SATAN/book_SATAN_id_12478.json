    "word": "Those who have not ceased to sin and who have not repented and sought pardon for their transgressions are not represented in this company; for this company vex their souls over the corruptions and iniquity abounding around them, and God will recognize those who are sighing and crying because of the abominations done in the land. They were not mixed up in these abominations. They had not corrupted their ways before God, but had washed their robes of character and had made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Satan pointed to their sins which had not yet been blotted out, and which he had tempted them to commit, and then reviled them as being sinners clad with filthy garments. But Jesus changes their appearance. He says, \"Take away his filthy garments from him.\" \"Behold I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment, and I said, let him set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.\"--Letter 51, 1886, pp. 8, 9. (To \"Dear Brother G. I. Butler,\" September 6, 1886.) \n\n\n                                    -251-",
