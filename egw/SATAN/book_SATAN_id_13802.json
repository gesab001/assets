    "word": "By doing this, men are doing just what Satan wished them to do. When those who claim to love God refuse to obey His Word as plainly stated in the fourth precept of the decalogue, and accept a common working day as their sabbath, they show respect to a day exalted by the enemy of God. But notwithstanding this, God's law still stands firm. The Man of sin has thought to change this law; he has thought to do it; but not while God holds the throne will he be able to change one jot or tittle of His law.",
