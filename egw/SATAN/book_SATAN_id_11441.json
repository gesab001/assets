    "word": "The duties and qualifications of a physician are not small. The students need daily to lift responsibilities, that they may become burden-bearers. They may be inclined to prescribe the duties devolving upon them as medical practitioners, when they know nothing of their inability as far as experience is concerned. There is only one power that can make these students what they ought to be, and keep them steadfast. It is the grace of God and the power of the truth, exerting a saving influence upon the life and upon the character. These students, who intend to deal with suffering humanity, will find no graduating place this side of Heaven. Every bit of knowledge that is termed science, should be acquired, while the seeker daily acknowledges that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Every item of experience and everything that can strengthen the mind, should be cultivated to the utmost of their power, while at the same time they should seek God for his wisdom, their consciences illuminated, quick and pure; for unless they are guided by the wisdom from above, they become an easy prey to the deceptive power of Satan, they become inflated, large in their own eyes, pompous, self-sufficient. The policy principle will most assuredly lead into difficulties. The truth, God's truth, must be cherished in the heart, and held in the strength of God, or the powers of Satan will wrench it from you. You need to be self-reliant and yet teachable, when you can have strength \n\n\n                             -18- \n\nto be faithful to duty. To trust to your own resources, your own wisdom or strength, is folly. You will be brought to confusion if you do this. You can walk securely only when you follow the counsel of God.",
