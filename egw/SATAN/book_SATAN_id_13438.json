    "word": "Brother J's family are too ready to sympathize with their children, and however crooked are unwilling for the church to take action in their case. But this is wrong. God will have only those in the church who are earnestly striving to be right. Opportunity is given to develop character, and if \n\n\n                                 -336- \n\nmembers of the family develop a character unworthy [of] the Christian name, they have no right to the privileges of the house of God. False sympathy must die. It commenced in heaven at the fall of Satan, and has existed ever since. This sympathy has blunted the straight testimony. It pleases Satan well.",
