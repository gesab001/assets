    "word": "My brethren, you need to bear in mind that you are in the presence of One who has compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.\" Let all our workers in every place keep this in mind. He who puts his trust in Christ can never be severed from him by any man. \"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.\" Will you believe this, even when sorely tempted by Satan to speak unadvisedly? Not a word can be spoken to arouse in another man's mind feelings that will unbalance Him, but that Christ himself is hurt in the person of one of the members of his family.",
