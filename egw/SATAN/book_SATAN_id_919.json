    "word": "From garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds, from mountains and deserts, from the caves of the earth and the caverns of the sea, Christ will gather His children to Himself. On earth they have been destitute, afflicted, and tormented. Millions have gone down to the grave loaded with infamy because they refused to yield to the deceptive claims of Satan.

And \"they shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord.\"--Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 179, 180.",
