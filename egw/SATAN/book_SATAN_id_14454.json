    "word": "The words have been spoken of you \"Is it because there is not a God in Israel that ye go to the god of Ekron to inquire?\" You have turned from and despised the law of God, given in awful grandeur from Sinai until you now follow the way of transgression of these laws whenever your will and way is opposed, without realizing the seriousness of your course. Truly truth and righteousness have fallen in the streets, and equity can not enter. You have become linked up with the tempter, and your mind has been led by the one who tried in the wilderness of temptation to gain control of the mind of Christ. The Saviour would not enter into controversy with the tempter, but quoted His Father's words. \"It is written.\" Not one word did He speak of which Satan could take the least advantage.",
