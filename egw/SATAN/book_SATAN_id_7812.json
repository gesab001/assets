Come with zeal, and when you sincerely feel that without the help of God you perish; when you pant after him as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, then will the Lord strengthen you speedily. Then will your peace \n                                                                           258\npass all understanding. If you expect salvation, you must pray. Take time. Be not hurried and careless in your prayers. Beg of God to work in you a thorough reformation, that the fruits of his Spirit may dwell in you, and you shine as lights in the world. Be not a hindrance, or curse to the cause of God. You can be a help, a blessing. Does Satan tell you that you cannot enjoy salvation, full and free, believe him not.",
