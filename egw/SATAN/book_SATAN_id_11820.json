    "word": "Those under Satan's dictation become very zealous in their work. They magnify self, and work at cross purposes with God. Therefore too much caution can not be shown by men who are chosen of God and faithful, to see that in every institution God has established every part of the work is firmly bound about, that the cause shall not be hindered by the counsels of those inspired from beneath, that Satan shall not intrude through unconverted, unconsecrated men.",
