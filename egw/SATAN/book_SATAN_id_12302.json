    "word": "You are not to criticize one another, but love as brethren. You are not to feel hurt because every plan is carefully considered from end to end.

You must be minute men, all the time watching to make an aggressive movement, and not let the enemy pre-occupy the field before you are ready to act. This slowness to advance is not in the order of God, for Satan presses in himself and hedges up the way, or he will make it very hard when you decide to act.",
