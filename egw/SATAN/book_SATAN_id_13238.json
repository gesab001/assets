    "word": "With pity and compassion, with tender yearning, the Lord is looking upon His tempted and tried people. For a time the oppressors will be permitted to triumph over those who know God's holy commandments. All are given the same opportunity that was granted to the first great rebel to demonstrate the spirit that moves them to action. It is God's purpose that every one shall be tested and proved, to see whether he will be loyal or disloyal to the laws which govern the kingdom of heaven. To the last God permits Satan to reveal his character as a liar, an accuser, and a murderer. Thus the final trial of His people is made more marked, more glorious, more full and complete. The words of the prophet will then be fulfilled, \"The day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come\" [Isaiah 63:4]. The song of God's people will be, \"The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: He sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved. The Lord is great in Zion; and He is high above all the people\" [Psalms 99:1, 2].",
