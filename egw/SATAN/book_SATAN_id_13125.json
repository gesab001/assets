    "word": "Satan has placed his active agents along the passage to dispute the way of every soul. Christ has encouraged His followers not to be intimidated. Press on; urge your way through. \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able\" (Matthew 13:24). Darling, cherished idols will have to be given up, and the sins that have been indulged, even if it comes as close as the plucking out of the right eye or cutting off the right arm. Agonize! Force your way through the very armies of hell that oppose your passage.",
