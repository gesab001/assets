    "word": "Those whom God has placed in positions of responsibility should never seek to exalt themselves, \n\n\n                      - 28 - \n\nor to turn the attention of men to their work. They must give all the glory to God. They must not seek for power that they may lord it over God's heritage; for only those who are under the rule of Satan will do this.",
