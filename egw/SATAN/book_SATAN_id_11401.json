    "word": "The case referred to above is not an isolated one. If it were, I would not introduce it here. When Satan takes possession of the mind, how soon the light and instruction that the Lord has graciously given, fade away, and have no force! How many excuses are framed, how many necessities made, which have no existence, to bear them up in their course of wrong, in setting aside the light and trampling it under foot! I wish to speak with assurance, that the greatest objection to health reform is, this people do not live it out, and they will gravely say they cannot live the health reform and preserve their strength.",
