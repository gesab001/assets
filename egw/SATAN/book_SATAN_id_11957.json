    "word": "The lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God will not enjoy our company; for our conversation, our deportment, the Spirit of Christ we cherish, will rebuke their spirit and give no encouragement in their vain propensities. The church now most want men whose minds can comprehend and bear the thought of their responsibility to God,--men who are made strong by the consciousness that they are doing God's work, and that they will do it with fidelity. Satan's work is to make us contented with superficially doing our work and meeting our responsibilities, and he has been wonderfully successful here.",
