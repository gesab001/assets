    "word": "In the afternoon, near evening, we were happily disappointed in receiving quite a large stack of letters. W.C.W. received a long communication of the conference doings from Elder Olsen. I received two important letters from Elder Olsen and Leroy Nicola, with a most thorough confession of the part he acted in Minneapolis. It is thorough, and I praise the Lord for the victory he has gained over the enemy who has held him four years from coming into the light. Oh, how hard it is to cure rebellion! How strong the deceiving power of Satan! \n                                                                           1170",
