    "word": "I then saw the holy city, and that we should rest in the city through the 1,000 years, and reign as kings and priests unto God. Then Jesus will descend upon the Mount of Olives, and the mount will part asunder and become a mighty plain for the Paradise of God to rest upon. The rest of the earth will not be cleansed until the wicked dead are raised and come up around the city at the end of the 1,000 years. Then fire will come down from God out of heaven and devour them, burn them up root and branch. Satan is the root, and his children are the branches. Then the same fire that will devour the wicked will purify the earth. I saw that the feet of the wicked would never desecrate the earth made new. All the immortality we now have is by faith in hope of immortality at the appearing of Christ.--Ms 4, 1850. \n\nWhite Estate, Washington, D. C. May 1, 1986. Entire Manuscript.",
