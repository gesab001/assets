    "word": "You should be careful not to preach the truth from contention or strife; for if you do, you will most assuredly turn the battle against yourself, and be found advancing the cause of the enemy, rather than the truth of God. Every contest wherein you engage should be from a sense of duty. If you make God your strength, and subdue yourself, and let the truth bear away the victory, the devices of Satan and his fiery darts will fall upon himself, and you be strengthened, and kept from error, and guarded from every false way. You need to cultivate caution, and not rush on in your own strength. The work is important and sacred, and you need great wisdom. You should counsel with your brethren who have had experience in the work. But, above everything else, you should obtain a thorough knowledge of your own weakness and your dangers, that you may not make shipwreck of faith. You should strengthen the weak points in your character.",
