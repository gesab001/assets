    "word": "The armies of Satan gained a decided victory, and God was dishonored. The angels of God were on the grounds, not to approve, but to disapprove. The angels, the ministering spirits that minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation, were grieved, ashamed of the exhibition of the sons and daughters of God. As it was represented to me, One stood up, and in solemn words laid open the after effects of all similar programs. Words were spoken which I cannot write now, but I may have liberty to write hereafter. I am too much burdened to be able to produce the words on paper.",
