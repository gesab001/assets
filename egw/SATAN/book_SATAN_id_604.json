    "word": "Just before Peter\u2019s fall, Christ said to him, \u201cSimon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.\u201d How true was the Saviour\u2019s friendship for Peter! How compassionate His warning! But the warning was resented. In self-sufficiency Peter declared confidently that he would never do what Christ had warned him against. \u201cLord,\u201d he said, \u201cI am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.\u201d His self-confidence proved his ruin. He tempted Satan to tempt him, and he fell under the arts of the wily foe. When Christ needed him most, he stood on the side of the enemy and openly denied his Lord.",
