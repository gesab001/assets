    "word": "Just before us is the \"hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.\" [Revelation 3:10.] All whose faith is not firmly established upon the word of God will be deceived and overcome. But to those who earnestly seek a knowledge of the truth, thus doing what they can to prepare for the conflict, the God of truth will be a sure defense. \"Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee,\" is the Saviour's promise. He would sooner send every angel out of Heaven to protect his people, than leave one soul that trusts in him to be overcome by Satan.",
