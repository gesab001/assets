[THIS COUNSEL WAS GIVEN IN 1893, WHEN \"CITY MISSION \" WAS A NAME FOR A PARTICULAR FORM OF EVANGELISTIC ENDEAVOR. IT CONSISTED OF A TEAM COMPOSED OF MINISTERS, COLPORTEURS, NURSES, AND OTHERS. TODAY IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED A \"FIELD SCHOOL.\"] Missions are essential as the foundation of missionary effort in our cities; but unless those standing at the head of these missions make strenuous efforts to guard every post, so that Satan shall not control, losses will be sustained. . . .",
