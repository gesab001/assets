    "word": "Christ was strong to save the whole world. He wept at the grave of Lazarus at the thought that He could not save everyone whom Satan\u2019s power had laid low in death. . . . From the light of His exalted purity, the world\u2019s Redeemer could see that the maladies from which the human family were suffering were brought upon them by transgression of the law of God. Every case of suffering He could trace back to its cause. . . . He knew that He alone could rescue them from the pit into which they had fallen. He alone could place their feet in the right path. His perfection alone could avail for their imperfection. He alone could cover their nakedness with His own spotless robe of righteousness. . . .",
