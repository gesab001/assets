    "word": "This is the way Satan has wrought among us effectively. If these men are not converted, [these men] who are so ready to block the wheel, who will oppose things which commend themselves to the judgment of those who generally preside at these meetings, let them be left off the board, for although they may have some excellent ability they have mingled with it a self-esteem and ideas that they wish to have prevail which will be carrying out Satan's line as he wants it. They are a detriment, a hindrance, to your business meetings, and make them unsatisfactory, wanting in dignity and make most tedious delays of business that might be executed with expedition and thoroughness.",
