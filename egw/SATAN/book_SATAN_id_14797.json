    "word": "To the early church the hope of Christ's coming was a blessed hope, and they were represented by the apostle as waiting for his Son from heaven, as loving his appearing. As long as this hope was cherished by the professed followers of Christ, they were a light to the world. But it was not the design of Satan that they should be a light to the world; and because iniquity abounded, the love of many waxed cold, and the unfaithful servant is represented as saying, \"My Lord delayeth his coming.\" As a result of loss of faith in the appearing of Jesus, the unfaithful servant begins to smite his fellow-servant, and to eat and drink with the drunken. Satan was at work to cause apostasy in the early church; and in accomplishing his purpose, doctrines were introduced through which the church was leavened with unbelief in Christ and his coming. The adversary of God and man cast his hellish shadow athwart the path of the believers, and dimmed their star of hope, even their faith in the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.",
