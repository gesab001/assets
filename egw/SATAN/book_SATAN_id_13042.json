    "word": "Among the Jews was a remembrance made of sins every year, and they felt that sin needed a fresh sacrifice. Sins forgiven in Christ are remembered no more. Saith God, \"I will remember their sin no more\" (Jeremiah 31:33). The Lord accepts the sinner that comes to Him in contrition, repenting of His sins; and treats Him just as if he were innocent. Again, He says our sins are covered. Will the youth think seriously and begin to inquire, What shall I do to be saved? \"Behold! The Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). The more your mind is educated and trained to think of Jesus, to talk of Jesus, the less power will Satan have over your mind. He cannot bear to belong in the company of those who will meditate upon the love of God, and Jesus Christ.--Letter 43, 1892, pp. 5,6. (To Elder S. N. Haskell, Sept. 18, 1892.) \n\n\n                                     -365-",
