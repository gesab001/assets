    "word": "Those who have weighty responsibilities to bear in connection with the work of God are the ones that will be beset with the strongest temptations. If Satan can cause them to waver from the right, he not only takes away their own strength, but he destroys their influence for good over others. They lose their confidence in God, and feel that they hardly dare approach him in prayer; for they are under condemnation. Acting upon the principle that Christ presented in his prayer, \u201cI sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth,\u201d they should take the position that they will be steadfast to God under every circumstance, that they may exert an influence to make others steadfast.",
