    "word": "For all created beings there is the same great principle of life, dependence upon and co-operation with God. The relationship existing in the pure family of God in heaven was to exist in the family of God on earth. Under God, Adam was to stand at the head of the earthly family to maintain the principles of the heavenly family. This would have brought peace and happiness. But the law that none liveth to himself Satan was determined to oppose. He desired to live for self. He sought to make himself a center of influence. It was this that brought rebellion in heaven, and it was man's acceptance of this principle that brought sin to earth. When Adam sinned, man broke away from the heaven-ordained censor. A demon became central power in the world. Where God's throne should have been, Satan had placed his throne. The world laid its homage, as a willing offering, at the feet of the enemy. \n\n\n                                   - 16 -",
