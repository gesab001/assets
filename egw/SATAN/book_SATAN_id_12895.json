    "word": "The doctrines must be plainly understood. The men accepted to teach the truth must be anchored; then their vessel will hold against storm and tempest, because the anchor holds them firmly. The deceptions will increase and we are to call rebellion by its right name. We are to stand with the whole armor on. My brethren, you are not meeting men only, but principalities and powers. We wrestle not against flesh and blood. (Let Ephesians 6:10-18 be read carefully and impressively before the church.) These men are voicing the words of the dragon. We have to meet the satanic agencies who went to make war with the saints. \"The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ\" (Revelation 12:17). These men who have apostatized leave the true and faithful people of God, \n\n\n                                 -363- \n\nand fraternize with those who represent Barabbas. \"By their fruits ye shall know them\" (Matthew 7:20).",
