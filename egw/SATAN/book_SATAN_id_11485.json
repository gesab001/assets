    "word": "The Sanitarium as a Missionary Field. \n\n\n     Let the Christian physician remember that he has pledged himself to represent Christ to others in practise, in character. If he does not strictly guard himself, if he allows the barriers to be broken down, Satan will overcome him with his specious temptations. There will be a blemish in his character which will tell in its evil workings upon other minds, and leave a molding influence upon others characters.",
