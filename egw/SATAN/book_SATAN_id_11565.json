    "word": "Satan took advantage of the sufferings of the Son of God, and prepared to beset him with manifold temptations, hoping he should obtain the victory over him, because he had humbled himself as a man. Satan came with this temptation: If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. He tempted Jesus to condescend to him, and give him proof of his being the Messiah, by exercising his divine power. Jesus mildly answered him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. Satan was seeking a dispute with Jesus concerning his being the Son of God. He referred to his weak, suffering condition, and boastingly affirmed that he was stronger than Jesus. But the word spoken from Heaven, \"Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased,\" was sufficient to sustain Jesus through all his sufferings. In all his mission he had nothing to do in convincing Satan of his power, and of his being the Saviour of the world. Satan had sufficient evidence of his exalted station and authority. His unwillingness to yield to Jesus' authority, shut him out of Heaven.",
