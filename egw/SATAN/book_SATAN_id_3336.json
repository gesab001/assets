    "word": "THE FIRST PERSECUTING POWER IS REPRESENTED BY THE DRAGON ITSELF; IN HEATHENISM THERE WAS OPEN ALLIANCE WITH SATAN, AND OPEN DEFIANCE OF GOD. IN THE SECOND PERSECUTING POWER, THE DRAGON IS MASKED; BUT THE SPIRIT OF SATAN ACTUATES IT,\u2014THE DRAGON SUPPLIES THE MOTIVE POWER. IN THE THIRD PERSECUTING POWER, ALL TRACES OF THE DRAGON ARE ABSENT, AND A LAMB-LIKE BEAST APPEARS; BUT WHEN IT SPEAKS, ITS DRAGON VOICE BETRAYS THE SATANIC POWER CONCEALED UNDER A FAIR EXTERIOR, AND SHOWS IT TO BE OF THE SAME FAMILY AS THE TWO PRECEDING POWERS. IN ALL THE OPPOSITION TO CHRIST AND HIS PURE RELIGION, \u201cTHAT OLD SERPENT, CALLED THE DEVIL, AND SATAN,\u201d\u2014\u201cTHE GOD OF THIS WORLD,\u201d\u2014IS THE MOVING POWER; EARTHLY PERSECUTING POWERS ARE SIMPLY INSTRUMENTS IN HIS HANDS.",
