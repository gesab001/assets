    "word": "Why Miracles are Less Important Today \n\n     The way in which Christ worked was to preach the Word, and to relieve suffering by miraculous works of healing.

God's servants today could not work by means of miracles, because spurious works of healing, claiming to be divine, will be wrought.",
