    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     All must practise economy. No worker should manage his affairs in a way to incur debt. The practise of drawing money from the treasury before it is earned is a snare. In this way the resources are limited, so that laborers can not be supported in missionary work. When one voluntarily becomes involved in debt, he is entangling himself in one of Satan's nets which he sets for souls.",
