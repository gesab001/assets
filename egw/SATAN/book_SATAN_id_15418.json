    "word": "The Lord bids me say to those who are opposing the work centering in Nashville; Discern your spiritual condition. Return to the first love that you have left. Satan is seeking to entice all to leave their first love, and to devote their God-given talents to the enemy's service, tearing down that which the Lord desires to build up. I ask those at Nashville and at Graysville whose names I have not mentioned, to seek the Lord while He may be found. \"Call ye upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thought! Let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God; for he will abundantly pardon. For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. \n\n\n                                      -290- \n\nFor as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.\"",
