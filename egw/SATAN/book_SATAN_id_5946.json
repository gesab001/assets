    "word": "Good Illustrations No Detriment.--Do not read in public the letters I have written in regard to the illustrations of The Desire of Ages. There are minds that cannot comprehend the matter, and they think the book is condemned because [it is] profusely illustrated. Satan takes any word of which he can make a handle and so presents it before minds that they come to strange conclusions.",
