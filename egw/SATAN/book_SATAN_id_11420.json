    "word": "What must be the thoughts of the angels of God as they look upon the church of Christ, and see how slow is the action of those who profess to be the followers of Christ, to impart the light of truth to the world which lies in moral darkness?

What is the character of my work? What is the character of the fruit I bear. . . .",
