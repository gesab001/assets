    "word": "I saw the necessity of the messengers, especially, watching, and checking all fanaticism wherever they might see it arise. Satan is pressing in on every side, and unless we watch for him, and have our eyes open to his devises and snares, and have on the whole armor of God, the fiery darts of the wicked will hit us. There are many precious truths, contained in the word of God, but it is \u201cpresent truth\u201d that the flock needs now. I have seen the danger of the messengers running off from the important points of present truth, to dwell upon subjects that are not calculated to unite the flock, and sanctify the soul. Satan will here take every possible advantage to injure the cause.",
