    "word": "A Change of Heart Needed \n\n     The men who have accepted kingly authority need to be converted; for the self-exaltation they have manifested is dishonoring to God. The word of God is to be exalted as the rule of faith and practice, for this word reveals the standard of character we are to reach and teaches us our duty to love as brethren. Its requirements are to be strictly obeyed. At this time, when God is calling every man to put away his natural and cultivated tendencies to wrong, and to rid himself of his preconceived opinions; at this time, when Satan's influences are coming into our ranks with such power, God's servants must understand the way of the Lord. The word of man is fallible, imperfect, unreliable; but the word of the Lord standeth sure, and is done in truth and uprightness. \n\n\n                            -222-",
