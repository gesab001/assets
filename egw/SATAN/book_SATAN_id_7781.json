    "word": "About this time sister C. S. Minor came from Philadelphia, and we met in Boston. Different errors were affecting the Advent people. The spiritual view of Christ's coming, that great deception of Satan, was ensnaring many, and we were often obliged, through a sense of duty, to bear a strong testimony against it. Sr. M.'s influence went in favor of spiritualism, although she felt unwilling to acknowledge it. Those who would stand clear from this influence were obliged to be decided, and have nothing to do with it, but in the fear of God bear their testimony against it.",
