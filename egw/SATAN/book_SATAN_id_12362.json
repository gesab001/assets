    "word": "The Lord is a living, personal God. A living, personal Saviour came to our world to make of none effect the specious twistings and serpentine turnings of Satan. He came to carry out His plans written before Him in a book. Men who had large religious knowledge, but no depth of piety or experimental knowledge of God in obeying the Scriptures, were speculating about God. Christ revealed to men the moral and religious constitution.--Ms 117, 1898.",
