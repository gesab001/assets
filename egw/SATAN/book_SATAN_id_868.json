    "word": "Looking Constantly to Jesus--No man is so high in power and authority but that Satan will assail him with temptation, And the more responsible the position a man occupies, the fiercer and more determined are the assaults of the enemy.  Let God's servants in every place study His word, looking constantly to Jesus, that they may be changed into His image.  The inexhaustible fullness and the all-sufficiency of Christ are at our command if we walk before God in humility and contrition.--Manuscript 140, 1902 (Nov. 6, 1902, Principles for the Guidance of Men in Positions of Responsibility).",
