    "word": "Multitudes embrace the truth who have not its living principles incorporated into their lives. Christ has presented the conditions for all men if they would have eternal life. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\" \"This do,\" said the world's Redeemer, \"and thou shalt live,\" This is not obeyed, and in consequence of this disregard of the special injunctions of the Great Teacher, sin and iniquity are cherished in the heart, plead for, wept for, and clung to as precious acquisitions. Anything is preferable to putting away evil. They profess \n\n\n                         -10- \n\nto believe God, but they do not. With the knowledge of sacred truth is cherished the affection for sin. The Word not obeyed hardens the heart, makes the conscience unimpressible, and their ruin more sure than if they had no knowledge of the truth. The affections must be drawn away from worldly pleasures, worldly enjoyments, and centered on Heaven and heavenly things. The heart is the soul temple, and until that is fully on the Lord's side it will be the stronghold of the enemy; for the partial surrender to truth and the partial indulgence of self give free access to Satan; his suggestions become mixed and mingled in the mind with truth, and are received as all truth and the effect is that souls over whom these minds have influence are led far away from the grand old landmarks into false paths which separate from God.",
