    "word": "Stephen was the first Christian martyr. . . . The enemies of God and the truth felt stirred with hatred and opposition. Satan impelled them to resist the truth. Stephen had to meet in argument the most artful, deceptive disputants, hoping to confuse and put down his arguments. If Stephen had not searched the Scriptures and himself become fortified with the evidence of God\u2019s Word, he could not have borne the test; but he knew the foundation of his faith and was firm, and he was ready to answer his opponents.",
