    "word": "You have, Brother Albert, offended your brethren. This is a sin in the sight of heaven. They were jealous for the cause of God. You spurned their fears. Your judgment was perverted, and they now have to suffer on your account. I have seen, Brother Albert, that you have been imprudent, and Victor has noticed things which have cast a sad gloom upon his spirits. You have manifested a preference for the society of Sister Johnson which has been noticed and caused unbelievers to make remarks. These things have hurt your influence. It is not safe for two families to be so closely united as your two families have been. By so doing the shield which should guard the privacy and sacredness of every family is broken down and Satan leads on to take a course to injure and ruin the cause of God and one another.",
