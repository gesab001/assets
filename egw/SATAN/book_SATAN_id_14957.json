    "word": "The Lord sends his message to you. Satan is playing the game of life for your soul. Temptation is upon you, but shall the enemy have the victory? Will you ward off financial embarrassment by a crime which will re-act upon you both with a force that you do not now dream of? The test to barter your own soul for a mess of pottage, to become a traitor, is upon you. I want you to humble yourself before God. The Lord asks you to draw your feet from the precipice upon which you are standing, and walk in safe paths. Will you pursue a course that will forever separate you from the people of God? Ask yourself, Will it pay? Will you reveal to the world that you are a traitor, a betrayer? Will you rob the cause of God in order to be revenged? What a position for you to be in. Fearful and fatal will be the effect upon your eternal welfare. As the test came to Hazael, just so surely your test has come.",
