    "word": "If we could discern the exultation of Satan when his temptations are received, when a captious, faultfinding, uncharitable spirit is revealed, there would be less judging one another. The human agent can do nothing of himself. He can work as Christ worked only as he cooperates with divine intelligences. If he realizes their sacred companionship he will not yield to the suggestions of the enemy. He will not permit his mind to be stirred up to a state of dissatisfaction and half smothered disaffection toward his brethren. Others will not hear from his lips regrets and complaints. When the imagination is sanctified, the soul will be surrounded with a healthful atmosphere. \n                                                                           1155",
