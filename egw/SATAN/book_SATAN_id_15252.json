    "word": "I tell you all this that you may be enlightened, and may enlighten others, in regard to the character of the work in these missions. It is very difficult for those so far distant to lift their eyes to see far off. If they desire to build as they have done in Battle Creek, they will do so, adding building to building, when God has cautioned them not to do it. Battle Creek will not escape the dragon's wrath; there will be stormy times, perilous times. The interests that have been centered and accumulating in this modern Jerusalem will be a mark for the arrows of Satan. It becomes those who are connected with our institutions to move as God shall direct, and not follow the imagination of their own heart. If they choose their own way, they will become entangled in perplexities, and lose the favor of God because they do not move aright. They have absorbed the means which the Lord desired to have placed in missionary fields where the believers have nothing of their own to give character to the work. As this has been laid out before me, I have tried to present it to my brethren in Battle Creek, and at the Pacific Press, and I still cry aloud, and spare not. Your counselors need to be under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, they need to be converted and transformed, need to look and labor more decidedly for regions beyond.",
