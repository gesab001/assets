    "word": "It is one thing to profess to be a follower of Christ; it is another thing to do honor to Him by sincere faith, standing with firm purpose of heart as His witnesses, bearing public testimony in His name. It is the application of practical godliness that will strengthen the ranks of the professors of the faith. With many the truth is at first enthusiastically received. Then there comes some statement from the Word which is needed for the purification of the soul, and Christ is abandoned by these false disciples. Pride is offended, and Satan's hellish shadow wraps them about. Thus it has been, and thus it will continue to be to the close of this earth's history.--Ms 111, 1898, pp. 6, 8. (\"Prayer and Faith,\" typed September 8, 1898.)",
