    "word": "We received your letter, and I have only encouraging words to write you in reply. I can sympathize with you in your feelings of doubt and perplexity; for there are times when Satan seeks to bring to me the same trouble of mind; and I have to guard myself, that the tempter may not gain the advantage. When these times of doubt come to you, my brother, remember that the Lord Jesus is your friend and keeper. He has not forsaken you. You must not despond; you must not grieve the dear Saviour by cherishing unbelief or distrust of Him.",
