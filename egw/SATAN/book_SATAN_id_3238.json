    "word": "Satan beguiles men now as he beguiled Eve in Eden, by flattery, by kindling a desire to obtain forbidden knowledge, by exciting ambition for self-exaltation. It was cherishing these evils that caused his fall, and through them he aims to compass the ruin of men. \u201cYe shall be as gods,\u201d he declares, \u201cknowing good and evil.\u201d [Genesis 3:5.] Spiritualism teaches \u201cthat man is the creature of progression; that it is his destiny from his birth to progress, even to eternity, toward the Godhead,\u201d And again: \u201cEach mind will judge itself and not another.\u201d \u201cThe judgment will be right, because it is the judgment of self. . . . The throne is within you.\u201d Said a Spiritualistic teacher, as the \u201cspiritual consciousness\u201d awoke within him, \u201cMy fellow-men, all were unfallen demigods.\u201d And another declares, \u201cAny just and perfect being is Christ.",
