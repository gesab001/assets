    "word": "Now Satan has his hand in all this work to narrow down the work of God. Ministers of Jesus Christ are to be constantly receiving light from the Source of all light. They are not to be simply receivers of other men's thoughts, they themselves not plowing deep into the mines of truth. If a minister is not a worker himself, digging for the truth as for hidden treasure to find \n                                                                           835\nthe precious jewels of truth, he is forfeiting his God-given privileges. He is not to put any human mind, any human intelligence, between his soul and God. There is to come no authority from human minds that will in the least degree interpose between him and God's authority to lead, to guide, and to dictate. The ministers of Christ should gather up every ray of light, every jot of strength and illumination from other minds whom God has blessed, but that is not enough. They must go to the Fountainhead for themselves. God has given men reasoning minds and He will not hold them guiltless if they trust in man or make flesh their arm. He wants you individually to come to Him, to draw from Him, to use the ability God gives to understand the living oracles. If one man can see light in examining the Scriptures, so may every true Christian have the right to read, to examine, to search the Scriptures with unabated interest, and gather light therefrom.",
