    "word": "Satan Rules the Will That's Not Under God's Control. --Christ declared, \"I came ... not to do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me\" (John 6:38). His will was put into active exercise to save the souls of men. His human will was nourished by the divine. His servants today would do well to ask themselves, \"What kind of will am I individually cultivating? Have I been gratifying my own desires, confirming myself in selfishness and obstinacy?\" If we are doing this, we are in great peril, for Satan will always rule the will that is not under the control of the Spirit of God. When we place our will in unison with the will of God, the holy obedience that was exemplified in the life of Christ will be seen in our lives. --MS 48, 1899. (HC 107.) \n\n\n                                                       693",
