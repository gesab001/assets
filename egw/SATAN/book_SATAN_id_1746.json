    "word": "I feel intensely desirous that every word that is published by our people shall reflect light that will pierce through the dark shadow of Satan. Put in our papers the encouraging experiences that show the goodness and love of God in His dealings with His people. This will strengthen and cheer them. Make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way. Keep the warning message of truth before the people; for the end is at hand. We are to cry aloud and spare not. Some will pay no heed, but others will repent and be converted.",
