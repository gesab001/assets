    "word": "Ambition for the highest position excluded Satan from heaven, and he means to work upon every human being to lead them to sin as he has sinned. But ambition to do large things wears away the life with a great many perplexities. The invitation of Christ is, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30).",
