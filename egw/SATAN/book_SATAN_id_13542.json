    "word": "You sent Brother Ertzenberger to us as a child of God, to be qualified to enter the missionary field in Europe. We took him in, a stranger, and spared no means to educate him in the English language. We all tried to be his instructors. We took no advantage of his ignorance of our language and our customs, but we labored in our work for God to qualify him for his work. He was humble, hopeful, and God was with him. He returned to you, and there were those who felt jealous that he was bringing too much of American knowledge with him. You thought him lifted up. His testimony was not accepted, and he became very much discouraged. Satan finally succeeded in overcoming him with temptations, and he was lost to the cause of God for years. But \n\n\n                                   -323- \n\nthe eye of infinite compassion was upon him; and God in mercy let him see the fearful position he was in, and said, \"Return unto Me, and I will return unto thee, and heal all thy backslidings.\" And yet this dear brother should walk carefully and tremblingly before God. Just so long as he will cling to the arm of infinite power he will be shielded; but if he trusts to himself, he will surely fail.",
