    "word": "Through human instrumentalities he [Satan] has cast contempt upon the Sabbath of Jehovah and has stigmatized it as \"the old Jewish sabbath.\" Thousands have thoughtlessly echoed this reproach, as though it were something to which was attached great weight of argument; but they have lost sight of the fact that the Jewish people were especially chosen of God as the guardians of His truth, the keepers of His law, the depositaries of His sacred oracles. They received the lively oracles to give unto us. The Old and New Testaments both came through the Jews to us. Every promise in the Bible, every ray of light which has shone upon us from the Word of God, has come through the Jewish nation.--Ms 91, 1894, pp. 3, 4. (\"A Perpetual Memorial,\" 1894.)",
