    "word": "I am about to write upon this wrong, deceptive work which is carried on under the cover of religion. The lust of the flesh has control of men and women. The mind has been depraved through a perversion of the thoughts and feelings, and yet the deceptive power of Satan has so blinded their eyes that poor, deceived souls flatter themselves that they are spiritually minded, especially consecrated, when their religious experience is composed of lovesick sentimentalism more than of purity, true goodness, and humility of soul; the mind is not drawn out of self, is not exercised and elevated by blessing others, by doing good works. \"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\" True religion ennobles the mind, refines the taste, sanctifies the judgment, and makes its possessor partaker of \n                                                                           253\nthe purity and influences of heaven; it brings angels near, and separates more and more from the spirit and influence of the world. \n\n\n     Battle Creek, Michigan. \n\n                                               -",
