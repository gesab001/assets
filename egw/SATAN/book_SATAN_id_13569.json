    "word": "The God-fearing Christian sees that Satan is tempting, \"Worship me\" and \"all these things will I give thee.\" But naked duty must be chosen. Worship God in obeying His commandments, and [do] not bow the knee to the man of sin. Let not Satan's bribe be accepted, but manfully be true to God. Even if the world calls you singular, that which is right in God's sight, do. \"He that walketh uprightly walketh surely\" (Proverbs 10:9).",
