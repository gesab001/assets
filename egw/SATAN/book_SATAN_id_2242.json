    "word": "Death Not Eternal Life in Misery\n\n\n     Satan commenced his deception in Eden. He said to Eve, \"Ye shall not surely die.\" This was Satan's first lesson upon the immortality of the soul, and he has carried on this deception from that time to the present, and will carry it on until the captivity of God's children shall be turned. I was pointed to Adam and Eve in Eden. They partook of the forbidden tree, and then the flaming sword was placed around the tree of life, and they were driven from the garden, lest they should partake of the tree of life, and be immortal sinners. The fruit of this tree was to perpetuate immortality. I heard an angel ask, \"Who of the family of Adam have passed that flaming sword, and have partaken of the tree of life?\" I heard another angel answer, \"Not one of the family of Adam has passed that flaming sword, and partaken of that tree; therefore there is not an immortal sinner.\" The soul that sinneth, it shall die an everlasting death-- a death from which there will be no hope of resurrection; and then the wrath of God will be appeased.",
