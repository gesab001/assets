    "word": "But what did Adam, after his sin, find to be the meaning of the words, \u201cIn the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\u201d? Did he find them to mean, as Satan had led him to believe, that he was to be ushered into a more exalted state of existence? Then indeed there was great good to be gained by transgression, and Satan was proved to be a benefactor of the race. But Adam did not find this to be the meaning of the divine sentence. God declared that as a penalty for his sin, man should return to the ground whence he was taken: \u201cDust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\u201d [Genesis 3:19.] The words of Satan, \u201cYour eyes shall be opened,\u201d proved to be true in this sense only: After Adam and Eve had disobeyed God, their eyes were opened to discern their folly; they did know evil, and they tasted the bitter fruit of transgression.",
