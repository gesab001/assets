    "word": "Paul continues his charge: \"Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.\" Now that Paul is called to finish his course, he would have Timothy supply his place, and guard the churches from the fables and heresies with which Satan and his agents would in various ways endeavor to seduce them from the simplicity of the truth. He therefore admonishes him to shun all temporal pursuits and entanglements which would prevent him from giving himself wholly to this work; to endure with cheerfulness the opposition, reproach, and persecution to which his faithfulness would expose him; to \"make full proof of his ministry,\" by employing to the uttermost every means of doing good to the souls of men for whom Christ died.",
