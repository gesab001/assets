    "word": "In the midst of the fiercest pain, Satan presents temptations to doubt the goodness and love of God to me; but I resist him. I find comfort in prayer. I go back over our past history and \"Call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions.\" What a multitude of blessings we received! The presence of Jesus was often in our very midst. We could not doubt it. The bright rays of the Sun of Righteousness shone upon us. The proclamation of the mercy and love of God was to us rich morsels of food from heaven's storehouse. Oh what a wealth of experience have all those who acted a part in the first part of the proclamation of the third angel's message! I am living over again those precious experiences. . . .",
