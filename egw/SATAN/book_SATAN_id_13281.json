    "word": "My brother, never feel that it is a light matter to change captains and forsake Jesus, your true and safe Commander, and sail under false colors. You must take Jesus on board. If you expect to be respected, you must yourself respect your Commander. You will always be exposed to circumstances that are not pleasant while in this world. Satan will present himself to you in order that you may choose him as your commander.",
