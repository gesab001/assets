    "word": "Elder Prescott and others united with you have been inclined \n     to search out things to be criticized or condemned in our printed \n     publications. Were encouragement given you, changes and revisions \n     would be made in accordance with the ideas that you have in mind. \n     But you must never forget that Satan, disguised as an angel of light, \n     is always ready to encourage anything that would lead to a loss of \n     confidence in our denominational literature. . . .",
