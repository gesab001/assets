In our Saviour the life that was lost through sin is restored; for He has life in Himself.\u2014DA 785, 786. \n\n\nChapter 12 -- Some Who Will Not Be There\n\nCAIN.\u2014Notwithstanding that Cain had by his crimes merited the sentence of death, a merciful Creator still spared his life, and granted him opportunity for repentance. But Cain lived only to harden his heart, to encourage rebellion against the divine authority, and to become the head of a line of bold, abandoned sinners. This one apostate, led on by Satan, became a tempter to others; and his example and influence exerted their demoralizing power, until the earth became so corrupt and filled with violence as to call for its destruction.\u2014PP 78.",
