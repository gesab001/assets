    "word": "25\n     Ministers of the gospel have a sacred work. They have a solemn message of warning to bear to the world,\u2014a message which will be a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. They are God's messengers to man; and they should never lose sight of their mission or of their responsibilities. They are not like worldlings; they cannot be like them. If they would be true to God, they must maintain their separate, holy character. If they cease to connect with Heaven, they are in greater danger than others, and can exert a stronger influence in the wrong direction; for Satan has his eye constantly upon them, waiting for some weakness to be developed, whereby he may make a successful attack. And how he triumphs when he succeeds! for when one who is an ambassador for Christ is off his watch, the great adversary may through him secure many souls to himself.",
