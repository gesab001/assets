    "word": "We are as a church to be wide awake, and to work for the erring among us, as laborers together with God. We are furnished with spiritual weapons, mighty to the pulling down of the fortress of the enemy. We are not to hurl the thunderbolts against the church of Christ militant; for Satan is doing all he possibly can on this line, and you who claim to be the remnant of the people of God had better not be found helping him, denouncing, accusing and condemning. Seek to restore, not to tear down, discourage and destroy.--Ms 21, 1893, pp. 1-10.
