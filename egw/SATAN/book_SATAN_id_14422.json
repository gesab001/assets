R. \n\nElders Prescott, Irwin, Jones, Smith and Waggoner \n\nDear Brethren: \n\n\n     I have written to Brother John Kellogg in regard to matters which should come before him, asking him not to pursue a course which will in any way detract from his influence. The Lord has greatly exalted and blessed His servant, Dr. Kellogg. He has used him to honor His name upon the earth and to give character to the work. Dr. Kellogg has been obtaining a most precious experience. But there are some who have acted as though they had been appointed to work against him. The Lord has reproved their course of action. They knew not that they were working on Satan's side of the question. As men and women have thus worked out their own attributes, this has been a hindrance to the doctor. His brethren have had evidence that he has been working in accordance with the will of God. But although they have had light on this point, they have not all stood by his side to help him. Some have held up his hands, but others have not heeded the admonitions given. Every evidence that could be given has been given, but some have shown that they have not practiced self-denial. They have not taken up the cross to follow Christ. Such ones reveal the principles which have corrupted them.",
