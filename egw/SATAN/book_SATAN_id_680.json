    "word": "Look, oh, look. Listen to the voices and powers that prevail in the world. The heavenly Watcher sees the earth filled with violence and crime. Is there any voice of prayer? Do you see any sign that God is recognized? . . . Look, you who are hesitating between obedience and disobedience. Look in imagination at the vast multitudes worshiping at Satan\u2019s altar. Listen to the music, to the language\u2014called higher education. But what has God written upon it? Mystery of iniquity.",
