IN 1848 MYSTERIOUS RAPPINGS WERE HEARD IN THE HOME OF THE FOX FAMILY AT HYDESVILLE, A COMMUNITY ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE MILES EAST OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER, NEW YORK. AT A TIME WHEN THERE WERE VARIOUS CONJECTURES AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE RAPPINGS, ELLEN WHITE ANNOUNCED, ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE VISION GIVEN TO HER, THAT THEY WERE A MANIFESTATION OF SPIRITUALISM, THAT THIS PHENOMENON WOULD DEVELOP RAPIDLY, AND IN THE NAME OF RELIGION WOULD GAIN POPULARITY AND DECEIVE MULTITUDES, DEVELOPING INTO SATAN'S LAST-DAY MASTERPIECE OF DECEPTION.",
