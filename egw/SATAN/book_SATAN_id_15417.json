    "word": "Time is too short, our work too important, for any one to engage in an effort to tear down the work of another man whom God has appointed to service. My brethren, the schemes that seem so plausible to you, are not of God's devising. Satan will instigate all that he possibly can to discourage, to draw men of talent from the work of preaching the Word, publishing the truth, and circulating our publications in the highways and byways. You have not time to aid the enemy in his effort to drive God's workers out of the Southern field. This is not the work that God has given you.",
