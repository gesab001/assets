    "word": "Satan had been at war with the government of God, since he first rebelled. His success in tempting Adam and Eve in Eden, and introducing sin into the world, had emboldened this arch foe, and he had proudly boasted to the heavenly angels, that when Christ should appear, taking man's nature, he would be weaker than himself, and he would overcome him by his power. He boasted that Adam and Eve in Eden could not resist his insinuations when he appealed to their appetite. The inhabitants of the old world he overcame in the same manner, through the indulgence of lustful appetite and corrupt passions. Through the gratification of appetite he had overthrown the Israelites. He boasted that the Son of God himself was not able to resist his power, and lead the favored people of his choice to Canaan; for nearly all who left Egypt died in the wilderness.",
