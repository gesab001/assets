    "word": "The form Satan assumed in Eden when leading our first parents to transgress was of a character to bewilder and confuse the mind. He will work in [just] as subtle a manner as we near the end of earth\u2019s history. All his deceiving power will be brought to bear upon human subjects, to complete the work of deluding the human family. So deceptive will be his working that people will do as they did in the days of Christ, and when asked, \u201cWhom shall I release unto you, Christ or Barabbas?\u201d the almost universal cry will be \u201cBarabbas, Barabbas!\u201d And when the question is asked, \u201cWhat will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?\u201d the cry again will be \u201cCrucify Him!\u201dManuscript 39, 1894 (Review and Herald, Apr. 14, 1896).",
