    "word": "Oh, the greatness of the work to save souls! How few feel it! How few are doing all they can to gather souls to Christ! Satan is working with his might--persevering, diligent, untiring--while many who profess the truth are asleep, doing nothing to save souls, not even living the truth they profess. It is no tame testimony that will meet the people. We must reach the people through God. We must be flexible in the hands of God, to be molded as clay in the hands of the potter. There is sufficiency in the grace of God for every hour of conflict, for every hour of trial. Let us take hold of God more firmly. His Spirit will help, His Spirit will strengthen and sustain.",
