    "word": "Let us honor our profession of faith. Let us adorn our lives with beautiful traits of character. Harshness of speech and action is not of Christ, but of Satan. Shall we by clinging to our imperfections and deformities make Christ ashamed of us? His grace is promised to us. If we will receive it, it will adorn our lives. Then, in the place of disparaging our fellow workers, we shall help them to climb the ladder of progression. Deformity will be exchanged for practical godliness. Our lives will be adorned with the Christian graces.",
