    "word": "You are in danger of overestimating your own value. So long have you followed plans of the enemy's devising, that you seem powerless to break the spell, or to resist evil influences. In the name of the Lord I ask to seek the Lord with all the power at your command. Repent, and be rebaptized, that you may act a part in union with Christ as a laborer together with God. Just as long as you seek to have your own way, trying to serve God and mammon, you \n\n\n                                      -272- \n\nwill continue your record of mistakes and failures. You have now an opportunity to redeem the past, but nothing will avail you short of a complete surrender to God. Do not continue to make war against those whom you suppose ought to help you and favor you. Those who cherish a spirit of warfare against those who might help them will never find their way out of perplexities, or be free from the deception of Satan. Why should you continue in an evil way, even though others may have treated you unjustly? . . .",
