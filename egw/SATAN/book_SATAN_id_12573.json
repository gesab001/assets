    "word": "This morning my heart is full of gratitude to my Saviour for His healing power. Yesterday I suffered all day with heartache as I thought of how Satan is working to gain entrance to every mind that is open to his devisings. He will use his artifice as he used it among the heavenly angels, presenting his scientific problems to deceive, sowing seed that would bear the fruit of rebellion, and yet working with such apparent innocence that when the seed that he himself had sown had taken root, he drew from the angels expressions of disaffection, and then reported the result of his own seed-sowing as sentiments held by certain of the angels. This work could not be dealt with \n\n\n                                      -7- \n\nuntil the results of his artful suggestions had fully developed.--Ms 13, 1906. p. 1. (\"Israel's Apostasy at Sinai,\" December 11, 1905.)",
