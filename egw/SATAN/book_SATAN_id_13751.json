    "word": "Test and trial will come to every soul that loves God. The Lord does not work a miracle to prevent this ordeal of trial, to shield His people from the \n\n\n                                    -365- \n\ntemptations of Satan. If they are tempted severely, it is because circumstances have been so shaped by the apostasy of Satan that temptations are permitted in order that characters may be developed that will decide the fitness of the human family for the home in heaven, characters that will stand through all the pressure of unfavorable circumstances in private and public life, and though tried by every species of Satan's temptations, through the grace of God grow brave and true, and firm as a rock to principles, and come forth from the fiery ordeal of more value than the golden wedge of Ophir. Those who have such characters God will endorse with His own superscription as His chosen elect.",
