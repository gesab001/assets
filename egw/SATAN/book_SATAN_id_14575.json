    "word": "The first step taken in the path of unbelief and rejection of light is a dangerous thing, and the only way for those who have taken this step to recover themselves from the snares of Satan is to accept that which the Lord sent them but which they refused to receive. This will be humiliating to the soul but will be for their salvation. God will not be trifled with. He will not remove all reason to doubt, but He will give sufficient evidence upon which to base faith.",
