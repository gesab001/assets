    "word": "There are schools out of and away from Battle Creek that are in far less danger of losing their respect for the testimonies that have been coming to the people of God for the past half century. Representations are given me that the first proposition to reopen the school in Battle Creek was the first note of opposition to the light God has given. However, the result has proved as I was instructed it would be. The plausible excuses and reasons for the starting of this school were not inspired by God, but by the enemy of God, to confuse minds, and place our people where they would not know where they are standing. That this has been the result, I know. The testimonies borne are not heeded. The enemy is at work, and a neglect of the warnings sent is preparing the way for Satan to come in with his sophistries and errors.",
