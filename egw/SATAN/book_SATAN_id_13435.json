    "word": "While these evils remain untouched everything passes along smoothly, but when the straight testimony comes and reproof and rebuke are given, there is a rising up against the straight testimony. It does not agree with the carnal mind, their carnal security is disturbed, they resist the work of God, and some will fall off. The names of those who will be purified, made white, and tried are borne into the sanctuary and mentioned by Jesus to His Father, and they are brought before the special notice of God. But those who choose their own selfish course, their own dark way, will be permitted to go on. Satan will control the will, and they will lose everlasting life. Those who are saved must yield their will, their way, and be controlled by the Spirit of God. They must die daily all the way along, die, die to self and be purified by the truth.",
