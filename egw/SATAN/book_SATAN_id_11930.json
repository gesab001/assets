    "word": "Christ speaks of the church over which Satan presides, as the synagogue of Satan. Its members are the children of disobedience. They are those who love to sin, and choose to sin, always laboring to make void the law of God, which is holy, just, and good. It is Satan's work to mingle evil with good, and to confuse the distinction between good and evil. Christ would have a church that labors to separate the evil from good, whose members will not knowingly tolerate wrong-doing, but will expel it from their own hearts and lives. How careful should we be in passing judgment on the work of others, how careful lest we become guilty of ascribing to evil agencies the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. \n                                  Mrs. E. G. White. \n\n\n                       [20]",
