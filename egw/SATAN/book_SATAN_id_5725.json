    "word": "PRAYER ACCOMPLISHES MORE IN SOUL WINNING THAN WORDS ALONE.\u2014Satan is on your track. He is an artful opponent, and the malignant spirit which you meet in your work is inspired by him. Those whom he controls echo his words. If the veil could be rent away from their eyes, those thus worked would see Satan plying all his arts to win them from the truth. In rescuing souls from his devices, far more will be accomplished by Christlike, humble prayer than by many words without prayer.\u2014(Colporteur Ministry, 81.)",
