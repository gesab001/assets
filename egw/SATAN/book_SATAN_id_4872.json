    "word": "Violated Conscience Becomes Unreliable.--He who after hearing the truth turns from it because to accept it would retard his success in business lines turns from God and the light. He sells his soul in a cheap market. His conscience will ever be unreliable. He has made a bargain with Satan, violating his conscience, which if kept pure and upright, would have been of more value to him than the whole world. He who refuses light partakes of the fruit of disobedience, as did Adam and Eve in Eden.--MS 27, 1900.",
