    "word": "28: Modern Spiritualism\n\n     August 24, 1850, I saw that the \"mysterious rapping\" was the power of Satan; some of it was directly from him, and some indirectly, through his agents, but it all proceeded from Satan. It was his work that he accomplished in different ways; yet many in the churches and the world were so enveloped in gross darkness that they thought and held forth that it was the power of God. Said the angel, \"Should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?\" Should the living go to the dead for knowledge? The dead know not anything. For the living God do ye go to the dead? They have departed from the living God to converse with the dead who know not anything. See Isaiah 8:19, 20.",
