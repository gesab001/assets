    "word": "Satan was once the most glorious angel in the heavenly courts. But he allowed a desire for supremacy to take possession of him, and he was expelled from heaven. He came to this earth, and entered with great zeal into commercialism. And unless we stand loyal and true by the side of Prince Emmanuel, we shall be ensnared. Some of our ministers have been led astray because they would not follow the light that the Lord gave them. Those who have thus departed from the faith may not realize it, but they are following the fallen angel.",
