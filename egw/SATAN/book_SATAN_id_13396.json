    "word": "Will those whose names are upon the church books, who claim to be sons and daughters of God, consider their relation to God and to their fellow men? While we must depend so entirely upon the mercy of a sin-pardoning Saviour, shall our hearts remain hard and unsympathizing? Can any provocation authorize unkind feelings, or should it cause us to harbor resentment or seek revenge? Can we cast the first stone in condemnation of a brother when God is extending His mercy to us and forgiving our trespasses against Him? Should God enter into judgment with us our debt would be found to be immense, yet our heavenly Father forgives us our debt. Men will be dealt with by God, not according to their opinion of themselves, nor according to their self-confidence, but according to the spirit they reveal toward their erring brethren. A spirit of harshness and severity is the spirit of Satan.",
