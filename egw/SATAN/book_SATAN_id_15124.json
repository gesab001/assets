    "word": "If we keep a firm hold of self, we cannot possibly get hold of Christ. Let us now who believe that the end of all things is at hand, seek the Lord most earnestly. It is no time to be depressed. There is no safety in trusting in self. We must educate our souls to trust in God. I see that Satan will contest every step of progress we may make. There is no safety for us only as we walk with our hands in the hand of Christ. Our feet will sometimes slip upon the supposed safest path. But the only safe path is to be sure we love God supremely and our neighbor as ourself.",
