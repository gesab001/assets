    "word": "If the teacher is connected with God, if he has Christ abiding in his heart, the spirit that is cherished by him is felt by the children. When a teacher manifests impatience or fretfulness toward a child, the fault may be not in the child one-half as much as it is in the teacher, who himself needs to be disciplined and trained, and observe a heavier punishment than he puts upon the child, for he is old enough to know better. Teachers become tired with their work, then something the children say or do does not accord with their feelings; but will they let Satan's spirit enter into them and lead them to create feelings in the children very unpleasant and disagreeable, through their own lack of tact and wisdom from God? There should not be a teacher employed, unless you have evidence by test and trial, that he loves and fears to offend God. If teachers are taught of God, if their lessons are daily learned in the school of Christ, they will work in Christ's lines. They will win and draw with Christ, for every child and youth is precious.",
