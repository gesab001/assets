    "word": "When Satan shall have accomplished his work of ensnaring all who will subject themselves to his deceptive influence, when he shall have finished his work of scattering abroad, Christ will rise up and bring deliverance to every one whose name is found written in the book of life. Satan and his followers will be destroyed. Then \"they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.\"--Letter 268, Dec. 17, 1903, to Dr. David Paulson, at the time director of the American Medical Missionary College in Chicago and editor of The Life Boat.",
