    "word": "Nothing is to be tolerated in the school that will counterwork the very object for which the school was established. In believing and receiving the truth, we may be doers of the words of Christ. Thus day by day we receive grace sufficient for the duties and trials of the day. But no students should be allowed to remain connected with the school who allow their own mischievous, cheap, common practices to control their whole minds. They themselves receive no good, and others are hindered from receiving good. Satan takes possession of them, and works through them to bring not only their own souls into captivity, but the souls of other youth who have not moral power sufficient to say, We have had enough of this malarious atmosphere which poisons our thought. By their words, students can confess or deny Christ.",
