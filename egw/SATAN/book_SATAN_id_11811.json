    "word": "\"God sanctioned none of this spirit. He could not place his signature upon this devising. He would forsake these men, remove his Spirit from those who entered upon this course, and the glory of his presence would depart from them. The cause of God in any line is not to be advanced by such policy; for it is born of Satan, and can only have his inspiration. All who do not repent and seek to set things right, God will leave to stumble on in darkness.\"",
