    "word": "Satan sought to make it appear that he was working for the liberty of the universe. Even while Christ was on the cross, the enemy was determined to make his arguments so varied, so deceptive, so insidious, that all would be convinced that God\u2019s law was tyrannical.

He himself inspired the cruel deeds that added to the suffering of the Son of God\u2014the pure, the holy, the innocent.",
