    "word": "If ever Satan had faithful workers, it is among the members of our churches in the suburbs of _______. Those who live in spiritual darkness cannot diffuse light. Those who have not kindled their tapers from the divine altar are cold and dead at heart. They have no overflowing and subduing influence for good to pour out upon the lost. They grumble like the Pharisees because so much time is devoted to hunting up the lost sheep. This is a terrible representation to the heavenly universe. These churches have had \n\n\n                                     -32- \n\nevery spiritual advantage. They have been given the most solemn truths for this time, and yet they do not trim their lamps that they may shine. Whatever may be their numbers, such churches are weak. The worst of all is that they do not feel the least burden or the least love or sympathy for the souls for whom Christ has given His life. They complain of those who do carry this burden, who watch and hunt for souls. They seem to think that they should have all the attention that the breath of life may be kept in their souls. They expect to be nursed like sick babies, not like babes who long for the sincere milk of the Word.",
