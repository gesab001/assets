    "word": "Parents should command their households after them, as did Abraham, to keep the way of the Lord. If this is not done, Satan will gladly undertake the work of the parent, and train the child as it pleases him; and, oh, how much this work is left to him! Let parents do their duty to those who are dependent upon them, and fashion their characters after the divine Pattern.
