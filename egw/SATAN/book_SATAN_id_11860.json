    "word": "The people of God need now to pray and humble their hearts before the Lord. Then they will see all things clearly. It is heart-humiliation that is needed by those who have in trust so great and so important a truth,--a truth which, if received and believed, will purify the life from all selfishness, all emulation. Let the Lord's people draw near to Him, and let them love one another as brethren. A guilty world is going to destruction; and if Satan can keep at variance those whose hearts should be full of tenderness and love, on whose lips there should ever be the law of kindness, how pleased he is!",
