    "word": "I do feel sorry for you, my brother, because God has bestowed upon you great light, great talents and ability, but the possession of these will not save you. They lay you under heavier responsibilities, and if these are not fully and entirely consecrated to Him who gave them to you, it would be far better for you if you did not possess them. I know you have been in the snare of the enemy, but I have kept your case on my soul. I have prayed in the night season. I have prayed in the daytime, and I have still the deepest interest for you that Satan shall not prevail over you but that you may break his bands and come boldly to the front in the very time when your earnest efforts are most needed.",
