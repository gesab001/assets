    "word": "This plan of Satan has been carried on through the ages. He will work upon some minds to get into a dispute about some things in the church whenever the Lord begins to revive His people. He lays hold of human elements in the church, upon something that might be as well left wholly alone, to quench the spirit of harmonious action and to divert the mind from living issues. In every church \n                                                                           322\ngathering for worship, Satan is there also, to use every element that he can use in human nature to serve his purpose. He will use to bring in unbelief, evil surmising, and [he will endeavor] to get up side issues to divert the mind from the living issues; and [so] the Lord Jesus has warned us to watch and pray [lest] ye enter into temptation.",
