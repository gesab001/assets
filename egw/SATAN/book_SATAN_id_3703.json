    "word": "As the laborers go forth into the vineyard of the Lord, it should be remembered that they are human, and that they will have many temptations and trials to meet.

Satan's temptations are the strongest against those who have the greatest responsibilities to bear. In \n145\nview of this, the hearts of those who remain at home should be drawn out in sympathy for them, and the prayers of their brethren should ascend as often as once a day that the special blessing of God may go with them, and open the way before them, that they may reach the hearts of the people. If all were to do this, they would feel a deeper interest in the progress of the truth, and in those engaged in proclaiming it.",
