    "word": "Satan, the great apostate, has drawn the world to himself; but if the gift of the only-begotten Son, the Father has provided that divine power shall work in opposition to the powers of darkness. Jesus said, \"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me.\" Satan has placed his seat on the earth where should be the throne of God, and men prostrate themselves before the prince of evil, rendering to him the homage that belongs alone to God. But the cross of Christ has been erected between earth and heaven, and Jesus, the Prince of Life, says: \"Through My love, I will draw the idolatrous hearts of men to Myself. I will place Myself in harmony with human nature, and will engage every holy influence and agency in the universe to array itself against the forces of evil.\"",
