He has instructed me that Satan is the inventor of unimportant, nonsensical fables, which he presents to human minds to eclipse the grand, elevating, purifying truths for this time. The enemy strives by these miserable inventions to lower the sacred principles of truth, to lead the mind away from health-giving truth to sham ceremonies.",
