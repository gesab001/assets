    "word": "Anxiety in Regard to Money \n\n     It is frequently the case that aged persons are unwilling to realize and acknowledge that their mental strength is failing.  They shorten their days by taking care which belongs to their children.  Satan often plays upon their imagination and leads them to feel a continual anxiety in regard to their money. It is their idol, and they hoard it with miserly care.  They will sometimes deprive themselves of many of the comforts of life, and labor beyond their strength, rather than use the means which they have.  In this way they place themselves in continual want, through fear that sometime in the future they shall want.",
