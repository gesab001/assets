    "word": "3-5 (Matthew 26:14-16; Mark 14:10, 11; John 13:2, 27). Christ Purchased by Temple Money.--At the Passover the case of Judas was decided. Satan took control of heart and mind. He thought that Christ was either to be crucified, or would have to deliver Himself out of the hands of His enemies. At all events, he would make something out of the transaction, and make a sharp bargain by betraying his Lord. He went to the priests and offered to aid them in searching for Him who was accounted the troubler of Israel. Thus it was that the Lord was sold as a slave, purchased by the temple money used for the buying of the sacrifices (ST Dec. 17, 1912).",
