    "word": "Here is a branch of work in the Lord's vineyard that has not received due attention. I have been shown in these very matters where these things have been neglected much has been lost. There should be more wise generalship manifested in doing the Lord's word. Minds must be arrested and held to the point, else Satan will steal away the seed sown. There will be but a small number in comparison with the rejectors of truth, that will receive it; but one soul is of highest value. The value of all the world sinks into insignificance in comparison to the value of one human soul.--Manuscript 1, 1875.",
