    "word": "Unbelief has kept the work centered in a few places, and the message has not advanced as it should. Satan is seeking to hinder the work of God by filling the hearts of the workers with a desire for recognition and the supremacy. Contention and strife as to who shall be the greatest have taken the strength and grace and power from the working forces. God calls for a decided change in every church, that all may become one in Christ Jesus. It is no time now for us selfishly to draw apart from our brethren. There is to be unity and love among God's people.",
