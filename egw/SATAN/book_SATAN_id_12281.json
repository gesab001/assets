    "word": "Those who are laborers together with God will have the mind and spirit of Christ, and will experience His joy in seeking to help souls who are benighted \n\n\n                                     -271- \n\nto find hope in Jesus Christ. The Lord has commissioned us to push forward His work in the earth, but Satan is determined to counteract the work of redemption.

He is constantly seeking to make men feel the same hatred toward God as he himself feels, but we are to put forth diligent efforts to unfurl the banner of the third angel's message upon which is written, \"The commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\"",
