    "word": "In the last vision I was shown that some in Waukon were just beginning to see themselves, but they had been in the snare of the devil so long, and been influenced by evil angels so many years to resist the testimonies God had sent them, that they could not recover themselves from Satan's snare at \n\n\n                                      -353- \n\nonce; and that such ones would have to walk in deep humility, and live a life of continual repentance before they could redeem the past. I saw that their former experience has been so dark and evil that they had not discernment enough to know the work and spirit of Satan. They would as soon call darkness and error light, and reject the true light and think themselves very near to God, when Satan was controlling them. Therefore it was not safe for them to follow their own judgment or to attempt to lead or dictate in the least; but they must submit to do what their stubbornness has made exceeding difficult for them to do--be led by the judgment of others who have been true to the cause of God. . . .",
