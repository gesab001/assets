    "word": "The agency of God can be discerned by all who are enlightened by the word of God. Man is not furnished with machinery, set in motion like the machinery of a clock, and then left to himself to take care of these wonderful organs. No, the agency of God is constantly at work to preserve His wonderful workmanship. Satan is busily at work inventing schemes to make man, through his disregard and violation of the physical laws which God has established, become disordered.",
