    "word": "Our Saviour could receive the heavenly revelation without becoming self-exalted. Let us seek for His humility. The enemy is subtle and very daring, but he is not invincible. He is a strong man armed, but if we keep close to the Captain of our salvation, using the weapon that He has given us, we shall be victorious. Satan is armed with sophistry and deceptive statements. It is a mistake to quote his words, and then seek to refute them. This always gives him an advantage. Keep close to Christ. Do not tell all that you know, thinking thus to baffle the enemy. By allowing yourself to contradict him, you give him opportunity to confuse you by his subtle reasoning.",
