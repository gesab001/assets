    "word": "Here Satan spread the world before Christ in the most attractive light, and intimates to him that he need not endure so much suffering to obtain the kingdoms of earth. He will yield all his claims if he will but worship him. Satan's dissatisfaction first commenced in Heaven because he could not be first and highest in command--equal with God, exalted above Christ. He rebelled and lost his estate, and he, and those who sympathized with him were turned out of Heaven. In the wilderness he hoped to gain advantage through the weak and suffering condition of Christ, and obtain from him that homage he could not obtain in Heaven. Jesus, even in his faint and exhausted condition, yields not to the temptation of Satan for a moment, but shows his superiority and exercises his authority by bidding Satan, \"Get thee hence\"--or, depart from me. Satan was baffled, and then studied how he could accomplish his purpose and receive the honor from the human race which was refused him in Heaven, and by Jesus upon earth. Could he have succeeded in tempting Jesus Christ, then the plan of salvation would have failed, and he would have succeeded in bringing hopeless misery upon mankind. That which Satan failed to effect in coming to Christ, he has accomplished in coming to man.",
