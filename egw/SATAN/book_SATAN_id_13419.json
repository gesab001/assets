    "word": "Young men are needed in the work--those who will undertake the work interestedly, and will carry it forward zealously and strongly. But the Lord is, and ever will be, with the old, steadfast leaders who have held fast to the truth in times of peril. When the foundation of the faith of the younger men seems to be swept away and their houses falling, the testimony, like that of Caleb, will be heard from the old warriors, \"Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it\" [Numbers 13:30]. Then the voice of unbelief was heard. \"We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we\" [verse 31]. One word of unbelief prepares the way for more. Satan does not easily let alone any man whom he can tempt to dishonor God by his unbelief.",
