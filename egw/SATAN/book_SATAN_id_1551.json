    "word": "Overcoming Natural Selfishness \n\n\n     Men are not naturally inclined to be benevolent, but to be sordid and avaricious, and to live for self. \n                                                                           139\nAnd Satan is ever ready to present the advantages to be gained by using all their means for selfish, worldly purposes; he is glad when he can influence them to shirk duty, and rob God in tithes and offerings. But not one is excused in this matter. \"Let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.\" The poor and the rich, the young men and the young women who earn wages, -- all are to lay by a portion; for God claims it. The spiritual prosperity of every member of the church depends on personal effort and strict fidelity to God. -- 5T 382.",
