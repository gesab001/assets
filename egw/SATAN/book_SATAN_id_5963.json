    "word": "Satan Delayed Publishing Great Controversy.--I mourn now that I did not do the very work I ought to have done when E and H were in responsible positions and had not an appreciation of The Great Controversy, volume 4, which the people should have had then as they are having now. . . . The delay was Satan's own devising. He was working diligently and has brought about a condition of things that the work cannot now go as it would have gone and done its work, which the Lord presented before me needed to be done. Those who hindered the work will have to answer to God for this.--Lt 55, 1894.",
