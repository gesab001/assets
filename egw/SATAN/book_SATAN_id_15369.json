    "word": "I have been shown that all who love indulgence in sin, are the ones who do not hear, do not perceive the words spoken. Why? Because evil angels have so long led them and controlled their powers, that the words, spoken to awaken conviction, are changed by Satan to mean something else. This is evidencing the power of Satan over human ears to hear things all crooked and strange; and the very things which the Lord would have them hear, they do not understand. They say that you never spoke to them the words that you know you did speak. But Satan interrupted the words so that they did not hear them.",
