    "word": "Shall men whom God has chosen to carry out the reformation against the papacy and idolatry be represented in an objectionable light? The banner of the ruler of the synagogue of Satan was lifted high, and error apparently \n\n\n                                  -272- \n\nmarched in triumph, and the reformers through the grace given them of God, waged a successful warfare against the host of darkness. Events in the history of the reformers have been presented before me. I know that the Lord Jesus and His angels have with intense interest watched the battle against the power of Satan, who combined his hosts with evil men for the purpose of extinguishing the divine light, the fire of God's kingdom. They suffered for Christ's sake scorn, derision, and the hatred of men who knew not God. They were maligned and persecuted even unto death, because they would not renounce their faith. If anyone presumes to take these men in hand, to lay before the world their errors and mistakes, let him remember that he is dealing with Christ in the person of His saints.",
