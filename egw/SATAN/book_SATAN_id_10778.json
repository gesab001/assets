    "word": "If you would walk wisely, walk in the way of God's commandments. The Word of God you have in your keeping, right at hand. This Word is so plain that none need go astray unless they allow themselves to be led by their hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong. Your Redeemer met Satan's treacherous advances with the words, \"It is written,\" and with the imperative command, \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\" I counsel you to receive with meekness the engrafted Word, which is able to save your soul. The Word of God is your haven. It is a tower of strength, into which you may run and be safe. . . .",
