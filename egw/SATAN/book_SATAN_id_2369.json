    "word": "Many become decided transgressors of God's holy law as the result of union, concord, and co-operation with companions who are instruments of Satan. God sends them light to undeceive them, but they refuse to take the Word of God as it reads. They accept error, choosing the lies of Satan rather than a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" And these advocates of error make it very hard for those who see the truth to obey it. Human sight can see nothing but starvation before those who keep the Sabbath.--Manuscript 19, 1894. \n                                                                           240",
