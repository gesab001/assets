    "word": "How many there are who forget that the home is a school in which children are trained to work either for Christ or Satan. Fathers and mothers, remember that every word you speak in the hearing of your children has an influence upon them, an influence either for good or for ill. Remember that if you find fault with one another you are educating your children to find fault.",
