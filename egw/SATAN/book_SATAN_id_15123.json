    "word": "The Ministry of Trials \n\n     In Christian experience, the Lord permits trials of various kinds to call men and women to a higher order of living and to a more sanctified service. Without these trials there would be a continual falling away from the likeness of Christ, and men would become imbued  with a spirit of scientific, fanciful, human philosophy, which would lead them to unite with Satan's followers.",
