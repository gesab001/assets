Psychological Effects of Mild Intoxicants \n\n     Inherited Tendencies Aroused by Wine and Cider.--For persons who have inherited an appetite for stimulants, it is by no means safe to have wine or cider in the house; for Satan is continually soliciting them to indulge. If they yield to his temptations, they do not know where to stop; appetite clamors for indulgence, and is gratified to their ruin. The brain is clouded; reason no longer holds the reins, but lays them on the neck of lust. Licentiousness abounds, and vices of almost every type are practiced as the result of indulging the appetite \n                                                                           93\nfor wine and cider.--Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, pages 32, 33.",
