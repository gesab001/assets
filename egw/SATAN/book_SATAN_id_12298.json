    "word": "I was greatly blessed while engaged in washing the feet of my dear mother. It seemed to me to be the last time I should have the privilege. I felt called out to cry earnestly unto God that those weary feet might run in the way of God's commandments, travel the whole length of the Christian road, and after her weary pilgrimage is ended lay off her armor at the feet of her Redeemer, and finally stand upon the Mount Zion and walk the streets of gold. We wept together and that season will be long remembered. A holy solemnity pervaded the congregation. The place seemed awful and solemn on account of the presence of the Lord. After we had followed the example of our Lord in washing feet, we partook of the communion. It was an impressive scene as we called to mind the sufferings of our dear Saviour for our sins. Our hearts were deeply melted, \n\n\n                                      -347- \n\nand overflowed with gratitude and love to Him who had paid such a dear price to ransom us from the power of Satan and hopeless misery.--Ms 2, 1859.",
