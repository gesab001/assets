{"word": "Christ gives no example in his life for men and women to shut themselves in monasteries in order to become fitted for Heaven. He has never taught that love and sympathy must be repressed. The Saviour's heart overflowed with love. The nearer man approaches to moral perfection, the keener are his sensibilities, the more acute is his perception of sin, and the deeper his sympathy for the afflicted. The pope claims to be the vicar of Christ; but how does his character bear comparison with that of our Saviour? Was Christ ever known to consign men to the prison or the rack because they did not pay him homage as the King of Heaven? Was his voice heard condemning to death those who did not accept him? When he was slighted by the people of a Samaritan village, the apostle John was filled with indignation, and inquired, \\93Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?\\94 Jesus looked with pity upon his disciple, and rebuked his harsh spirit, saying, \\93The Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.\\94 [Luke 9:54, 56.] How different from the spirit manifested by Christ is that of his professed vicar.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 570}
