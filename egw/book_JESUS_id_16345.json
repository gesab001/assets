{"word": "Let the men to whom God has entrusted great responsibilities be perfectly sure that they are following their great Leader, even Christ, and are not moving under the impulse of their own natural tempers. We shall be safe only when we consecrate ourselves to God and look unto Jesus, earnestly longing to work out His plan. Men may follow many kinds of lights, but there is only one Light that it will be safe for them to follow. Be sure that you are following Jesus whithersoever He goeth. Let none run ahead of Christ, \n                                                                           212\nbut wait for the word of command, \"Follow Me.\" Let our leaders be distrustful of their own counsel, of their own ambitious fancies. Let them not suppose that the sparks of their own kindling are the true light, or after a while they will find that, instead of following the heavenly guiding Star, they are following an uncertain leader.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 211}
