    "word": "The idea that prayer is not essential is one of Satan's most successful devices to ruin souls. Prayer is communion with God, the Fountain of wisdom, the Source of strength, and peace, and happiness. Jesus prayed to the Father \"with strong crying and tears.\" Paul exhorts believers to \"pray without ceasing,\" in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, making known their requests to God. \"Pray one for another,\" James says. \"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\" Hebrews 5:7; 1 Thessalonians 5:17; James 5:16.",
