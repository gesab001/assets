{"word": "We have been taken as rough stones out of the quarry of the world by the cleaver of truth and placed in the workshop of God. He who has genuine faith in Christ as his personal Saviour, will find that the truth accomplishes a definite work for him. His faith is working faith, and faith works by love, and purifies the soul. The Lord Jesus has paid the ransom money for us; He has given His own life in order that those who believe on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Those who receive the truth by faith will bear testimony to the quality of the faith they exercise. They will continually make improvements, looking unto Jesus who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. We cannot create our faith; but we can be colaborers with Christ in promoting the growth and triumph of faith. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 219}
