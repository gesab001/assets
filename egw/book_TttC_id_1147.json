    "word": "\"God's loyal people are the light of the world and the salt of the earth, and they should ever remember that their influence is of value.

Unbelievers, whom it is their duty to benefit and seek to bring to the Lamb of God, would be disgusted. Many improvements can be made in the dress of women in reference to health without making so great a change as to disgust the beholder.",
