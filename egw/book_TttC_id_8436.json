    "word": "We should beware that we do not give place to doubt and unbelief, and in our attitude of despair complain of God and misrepresent Him to the world. This is placing ourselves on Satan's side of the question. \"Poor souls,\" he says, \"I pity you, mourning under sin; but God has no pity. You long for some ray of hope; but God leaves you to perish, and finds satisfaction in your misery.\" This is a terrible deception. Do not give ear to the tempter, but say: \"Jesus has died that I might live. He loves me, and wills not that I should perish. I have a compassionate heavenly Father; and although I have abused His love, though the blessings He has graciously given me have been squandered, I will arise, and go to my Father, and say: 'I have sinned, . . . and am no more worthy to be called Thy son: make me as one of Thy hired servants.\"' The parable tells you how the wanderer will be received. \"When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\" Thus the Bible represents God's willingness to receive the repentant, returning sinner.",
