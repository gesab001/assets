{"word": "We must not rely on human judgment alone in selecting ministers.--Those who are about to enter upon the sacred work of teaching Bible truth to the world should be carefully examined by faithful, experienced persons. After these have had some experience, there is still another work to be done for them; they should be presented before the Lord in earnest prayer that He would indicate by His Holy Spirit if they are acceptable to Him. The apostle says: \"Lay hands suddenly on no man.\" In the days of the apostles, the ministers of God did not dare to rely up on their own judgment in selecting or accepting men to take the solemn and sacred position of mouthpiece for God. They selected the men whom their judgment would accept, and then they placed them before the Lord to see if He would accept them to go forth as His representatives. No less than this should be done now.--4T 406.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 44}
