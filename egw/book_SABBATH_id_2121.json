{"word": "Chapter XII. - Meeting at Randolph.\n\n     By invitation of Bro. and Sr. Nichols, my sister S. and myself again went to Massachusetts, and made their house our home. There was in Boston and vicinity a company of fanatical persons, who held that it was a sin to labor. Their principal message was, \"Sell that ye have and give alms.\" They said they were in the Jubilee, the land should rest, and the poor must be supported without labor. Sargent, Robbins, and some others, were leaders. They denounced my visions as being of the Devil, because I had been shown their errors. They were severe upon all who did not believe with them. While we were visiting at Bro. N.'s, R. and S. came from Boston to obtain a favor of Bro. N., and said they had come to have a visit, and tarry over night with him. Bro. N. replied that he was glad they had come, for sisters Sarah and Ellen were in the house, and wished them to become acquainted with us. They changed their mind at once, and could not be persuaded to come into the house. Bro. N. asked if I could relate my message in Boston, and if they would hear, and then judge. \"Yes,\" said they. \"Come into Boston next Sabbath, we would like the privilege of hearing her.\" \n                                                                           76", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SG", "page": 75}
