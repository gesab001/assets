{"word": "All who become learners in the school of Christ excel both in the quality and the extent of their education. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" [Proverbs 9:10.] A knowledge of God and his requirements will open the understanding of the student to realize his responsibilities to God and to the world. To this end he will feel that his talents must be developed in that way which will produce the very best results. This cannot be done unless all the precepts and principles of religion are connected with his school education. In no case should he disconnect God from his studies. In the pursuit of knowledge, he is searching for truth; and all truth comes from God, the source of truth. Students who are virtuous, and are imbued with the Spirit of Christ, will grasp knowledge with all their faculties. Education acquired without Bible religion is disrobed of its true brightness and glory.--\"Testimony,\" No. 28. \n\n                                               -", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CE", "page": 246}
