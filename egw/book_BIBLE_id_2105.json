{"word": "Our continual prayer is that the Lord will open the way for the truth to find access to the people of these valleys. I have felt grieved to see them being deceived by men who claim to be teachers of the Bible, but who misinterpret its plainest teachings.

The truth is sure to triumph gloriously; but how and when it is not for us to decide.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 238}
