{"word": "After completing the Lord\\92s Prayer, Jesus added: \\93If ye forgive \n240\nmen their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\\94 Matthew 6:14, 15. He who is unforgiving cuts off the very channel through which alone he can receive mercy from God. We should not think that unless those who have injured us confess the wrong we are justified in withholding from them our forgiveness. It is their part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by repentance and confession; but we are to have a spirit of compassion toward those who have trespassed against us, whether or not they confess their faults.\\97(The Faith I Live By, 131.)", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 239}
