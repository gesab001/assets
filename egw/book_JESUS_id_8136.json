{"word": "\"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.\" Jesus desires the service of those who have the dew of youth upon them. He wants them to be heirs of immortality. They may grow up into noble manhood and womanhood, notwithstanding the moral pollution that abounds, that corrupts so many of the youth at an early age. They may be free in Christ; the children of light, not of darkness.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 369}
