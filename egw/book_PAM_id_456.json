{"word": "Testimonies should be short and of a nature to help others.--The prayer and social meeting should be a season of special help and encouragement. All should feel it a privilege to take part. Let every one who bears the name of Christ have something to say in the social meeting. The testimonies should be short, and of a nature to help others. Nothing will so completely kill the spirit of devotion as for one person to take up twenty or thirty minutes in a long testimony. This means death to the spirituality of the meeting.--GW 171.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 185}
