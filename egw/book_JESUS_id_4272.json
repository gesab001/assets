{"word": "England and Its Cities \n\n     How Are They to Be Warned?--Here are the great cities in England and on the continent with their millions of inhabitants that have not yet heard the last warning message. How are these to be warned? If the people of God would only exercise faith, He would work in a wonderful manner to accomplish this work. Hear the words of Christ: \"If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven.\" Precious promise! Do we believe it? What marvelous results would appear if the united prayers of this company were to ascend to God in living faith! Jesus stands ready to take these petitions and present them to His Father, saying, \"I know these persons by name. Send answers to their prayers; for I have graven their names on the palms of My hands.\"--Historical Sketches, p. 152. (1886)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 414}
