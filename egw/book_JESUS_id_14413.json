{"word": "Jesus made no murmur of complaint; His face remained pale and serene, but great drops of sweat stood upon His brow. There was no pitying hand to wipe the death dew from His face, nor words of sympathy and unchanging fidelity to stay His human heart. He was treading the winepress all alone; and of all the people there was none with Him. While the soldiers were doing their fearful work, and He was enduring the most acute agony, Jesus prayed for His enemies--\"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\" Luke 23:34. That prayer of Christ for His enemies embraced the world, taking in every sinner who should live, until the end of time.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 222}
