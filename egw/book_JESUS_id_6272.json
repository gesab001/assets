{"word": "Adam and Eve listened to the voice of the tempter, and sinned against God. The light, the garments of heavenly innocence, departed from these tried, deceived souls, and in parting with the garments of innocence, they drew about them the dark robes of ignorance of God. The clear and perfect light of innocence which had hitherto surrounded them, had lightened everything which they had approached, but deprived of that heavenly light, the posterity of Adam could no longer trace the character of God in his created works. Therefore, after the fall, nature was not the only teacher of man. In order that the world might not remain in darkness, in eternal, spiritual night, the God of nature must meet man through Jesus Christ. The Son of God came to the world as a revelation of the Father. He was \"that true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HL", "page": 289}
