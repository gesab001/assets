{"word": "NOW, I TEACH THAT THIS BLESSING IS THE BLESSING OF SANCTIFICATION THAT THEY RECEIVED, THAT HE BESTOWED UPON THEM; AND WHEN WE SEEK GOD--IF WE ARE A SINNER, UNTIL WE ARE CONVERTED; IF WE ARE CONVERTED, THEN WE PUT UP THE PRAYER FOR THE POWER OF SANCTIFICATION TO LIVE CLEAN, WHOLESOME LIVES. NOT THAT IT IS THE WORK OF AN INSTANT; NOT \"ONCE SANCTIFIED, ALWAYS SANCTIFIED\"; THAT IS NOT TRUE. BUT WE SHOULD SO FIRMLY AND EAGERLY PUT UP OUR PETITION THAT WE RECEIVE THE BLESSING. IT HAS THE SAME PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT ON US--OH, WE JUST WANT TO PRAISE JESUS, AND IT MAKES US SO LOVING AND GENTLE AND KIND. BUT WE NOTICE THAT THE DISCIPLES WERE NOT READY YET TO GO OUT WITH THAT BLESSING TO DO WORK FOR THE MASTER. HE TOLD THEM TO TARRY UNTIL THEY WERE ENDUED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH. \n                                                                           365\nTHEN WE PUT UP OUR PETITION AND HOLD RIGHT ON BY FAITH, AND THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED US TO DO THIS WAS THE CHAPTER ENTITLED \"THE SHAKING TIME\" IN EARLY WRITINGS--WE HUNG RIGHT ON BY FAITH, UNTIL GREAT DROPS OF SWEAT STOOD ON OUR BROW. BELIEVING THAT THE SAME POWER THAT THE DISCIPLES HAD WAS FOR US TODAY, WE WERE ENCOURAGED TO HOLD ON.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 364}
