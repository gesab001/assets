{"word": "Although England covers a small territory, it has a vast population, and is a large missionary field. Hundreds could find room to work here if they had the missionary spirit. The city of London alone has twice as many people as all the Pacific Coast States and Territories. But where, oh where are the men who have love enough for the truth and precious souls to give themselves with unselfish devotion to the work? Men are wanted who are willing to leave their farms, their business, and their families, if need be, to become missionaries. There have been men, who, stirred by the love of Christ and the love of souls, have left the comforts of home and the society of friends, even that of wife and children, to go into foreign lands, among savages and idolaters, in hope of sowing the seeds of truth. Many have lost their lives in the attempt, but others have been raised up to carry forward the work. Thus the work has progressed step by step, and the seeds of truth sown in sorrow have borne a bountiful harvest. The knowledge of the Bible has been extended, and the gospel banner has been established in heathen lands.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 164}
