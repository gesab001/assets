{"word": "Our ministers who have gone to important places to hold tent meetings, have often made a serious mistake in devoting all their time to sermonizing. There should be less preaching and more teaching--teaching the people, and also teaching young men how to labor successfully. Ministers should become efficient in teaching others how to study the Bible, and in training the minds and manners of those who would become workers in the cause of God. And they should be ready to counsel and instruct those who have newly come to the faith, and who give promise of possessing ability to work for the Master.--GW 76.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 308}
