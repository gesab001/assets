{"word": "Chap. 26 - Robbing God of Rightful Service\n\n     There are men in the ranks of Sabbathkeepers who are holding fast their earthly treasure. It is their god, their idol; and they love their money, their farms, their cattle, and their merchandise better than they love their Saviour, who for their sakes became poor, that they, through His poverty, might be made rich. They exalt their earthly treasures, considering them of greater value than the souls of men. Will such have the \"Well done\" spoken to them? No; never. The irrevocable sentence, \"Depart,\" will fall upon their startled senses. Christ has no use for them. They have been slothful servants, hoarding the means God has given them, while their fellow men have perished in darkness and error.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CS", "page": 123}
