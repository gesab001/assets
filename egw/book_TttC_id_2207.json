    "word": "You acted your part, and some others felt to draw back, fearing the expense and calculating that they would lose time in attending meetings if the effort should be made. Christian zeal was lacking. A world was before us lying in wickedness, exposed to the wrath of God, and poor souls were held by the prince of darkness; and yet those who ought to be awake and engaged in the noblest of all enterprises, the salvation of perishing souls, had not interest enough to call into action every means they could employ to hedge up the path to destruction and to turn the footsteps of the faltering ones into the path of life. Eternal life should engage the deepest interest of every Christian. To be a co-worker with Christ and the heavenly angels in the great plan of salvation! What work can bear any comparison with this!
