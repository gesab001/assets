    "word": "When a man who professes to be a teacher, a leader, ventures in the course which you have pursued because of your stubbornness, he will have a heavy weight of responsibility to bear for the souls who have stumbled over him to perdition. A minister cannot be too careful of his influence. Stubbornness, jealousy, and selfishness should have no part in his being; \n                                                                           548\nfor if they are indulged, he will ruin more souls than he can save. If he does not overcome these dangerous elements in his character, it would be better for him to have nothing to do with the cause of God. The indulgence of these traits, which may not appear very bad to him, will place souls beyond his reach and beyond the reach of others. If such ministers would let things entirely alone, the souls susceptible to the influence of the Spirit of God might be reached by those who can give them an example worthy of imitation, in accordance with the truth they teach. By a consistent life the minister will retain the confidence of the seekers after truth, until he can help them to fasten their grasp firmly upon the Rock of Ages; and afterward, if they are tempted, that influence will enable him to warn, exhort, reprove, and counsel them with success.",
