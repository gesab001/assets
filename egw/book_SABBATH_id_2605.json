{"word": "Caring for our Own Poor \n\n     We are commanded to \"do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.\" Galatians 6:10. In our benevolent work special help should be given to those who, through the presentation of the truth, are convicted and converted. We must have a care for those who have the moral courage to accept the truth, who lose their situations in consequence, and are refused work by which to support their families. Provision should be made to aid the worthy poor and to furnish employment for those who love God and keep His commandments. They should not be left without help, to feel that they are forced to work on the Sabbath or starve. Those who take their position on the Lord's side are to see in Seventh-day Adventists a warmhearted, self-denying, self-sacrificing people, who cheerfully and gladly minister to their brethren in need. It is of this class especially that the Lord speaks when He says: \"Bring the poor that are cast out to thy house.\" Isaiah 58:7.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "6T", "page": 85}
