{"word": "There are many places in which the voice of the minister cannot be heard, places which can be reached only by our publications,--the books, papers, and tracts filled with the Bible truths that the people need. Our literature is to be distributed everywhere. The truth is to be sown beside all waters; for we know not which will prosper, this, or that. In our erring judgment we may think it unwise \n                                                                           5\nto give literature to the very ones who would accept the truth the most readily. We know not what may be the results of giving away a leaflet containing present truth.-- Manuscript 127, 1909.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CM", "page": 4}
