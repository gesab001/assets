{"word": "\"Walk in the light.\" To walk in the light means to resolve, to exercise thought, to exert will-power, in an earnest endeavor to represent Christ in sweetness of character. It means to put away all gloom. You are not to rest satisfied simply in saying, \"I am a child of God.\" Are you beholding Jesus, and, by beholding, becoming changed into His likeness? To walk in the light means advancement and progress in spiritual attainments. Paul declared, \"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but . . . forgetting those things which are behind,\" constantly beholding the Pattern, I reach \"forth unto those things which are before.\" To walk in the light means to \"walk uprightly,\" to walk \"in the way of the Lord,\" to \"walk by faith,\" to \"walk in the Spirit,\" to \"walk in the truth,\" to \"walk in love,\" to \"walk in the newness of life.\" It is \"perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 200}
