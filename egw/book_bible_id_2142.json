{"word": "Let all bear in mind that the Christian ministration is not a work for drones. God calls for men who will do and dare danger. Hold no parleying with Satan, but meet him with \"It is written.\" \"Quit you like men, be strong.\" Faith alone, unfeigned, can be the basis of our actions and prove by a clean, pure example that it is possible to be active, \"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord\" (Romans 12:11), and then all commercial enterprises will be conducted on Bible principles. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 277}
