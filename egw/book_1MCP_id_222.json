{"word": "Brain Controls the Body.--There are many invalids today who will ever remain so because they cannot be convinced that their experience is not reliable. The brain is the capital of the body, the seat of all the nervous forces and of mental action. The nerves proceeding from the brain control the body. By the brain nerves, mental impressions are conveyed to all the nerves of the body as by telegraph wires, and they control the vital action of every part of the system. All the organs of motion are governed by the communications they receive from the brain.--3T 69 (1872). \n\n\n                                                       73", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 72}
