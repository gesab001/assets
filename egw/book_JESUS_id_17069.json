{"word": "During the night I . . . passed through an experience similar to that which I had at Salamanca, New York, two years ago. When I awoke from my first short sleep, light seemed to be all around me, the room seemed to be full of heavenly angels. The Spirit of God was upon me, and my heart was full to overflowing. O what love was burning in my heart! I was exclaiming aloud, \"Lord Jesus, I love Thee; Thou knowest that I love Thee. My heavenly Father, I praise Thee with my whole heart. 'For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life' (John 3:16). 'The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day' (Proverbs 4:18). Jesus, my Redeemer, the Representative of the Father, I put my trust in Thee.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 17}
