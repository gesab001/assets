    "word": "Christ's work for the paralytic is an illustration of the way we are to work. Through his friends this man had heard of Jesus and requested to be brought into the presence of the mighty Healer. The Saviour knew that the paralytic had been tortured by the suggestions of the priests that because of his sins God had cast him off. Therefore His first work was to give him peace of mind. \"Son,\" He said, \"thy sins be forgiven thee.\" This assurance filled his heart with peace and joy. But some who were present began to murmur, saying in their hearts, \"Who can forgive sins but God only?\" Then that they might know that the Son of man had power to forgive sins, Christ said to the sick man: \"Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.\" This shows how the Saviour bound together the work of preaching the truth and healing the sick. \n\n\n                                             (235)",
