{"word": "The children of Sabbath-keeping parents, who have had great light, who have been the objects of the tenderest solicitude, may be the ones who will leave a heritage of shame, who will sow to the wind and reap the whirlwind. In the judgment the names of those who have sinned against great light will be written with those who are condemned to be separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power. They will be lost, \n                                                                           88\nlost, and will be numbered with the scorners of the grace of Christ.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MYP", "page": 87}
