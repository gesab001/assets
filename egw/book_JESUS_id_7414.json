{"word": "Christ neglected no opportunity of proclaiming the gospel of salvation. Listen to His wonderful words to that one woman of Samaria. He was sitting by Jacob's well, as the woman came to draw water. To her surprise He asked a favor of her. \"Give me to drink,\" He said. He wanted a cool draft, and He wished also to open the way whereby He might give to her the water of life. \"How is it,\" said the woman, \"that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.\" Jesus answered, \"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water\" (John 4:7-10). . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 183}
