{"word": "The Glorious Resurrection Morning \n    A Message to Friends on Pitcairn Island \n\n\n     We were made very sad last Thursday to learn of your deep affliction. Our hearts are pained to hear of the deaths of those of our beloved Brother [J. R.] McCoy's family. Our sympathies go out to all who are bereaved by this affliction. We extend our sympathy to the children and members of the family who have been thus sorely bereaved, but we would point you to Jesus as your only hope and consolation. The dear companion of our afflicted Brother McCoy, and the mother of the bereaved children whom she loved, is silent in death. But while we weep with those that weep, we joy at heart because this loved mother and daughter, and Brother Young, the elder of your church, and others who may have been removed by death, believed in and loved Jesus.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 269}
