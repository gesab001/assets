{"word": "While we were here, this matter was presented to me in a dream. The question was asked one of our laborers, \\93How far would a light send its rays if it were placed under a bushel?\\94 \\93No farther than the compass of the bushel,\\94 was the answer. \\93How far would it shine if put under a bed?\\94 \\93It would not illuminate the room,\\94 replied the one addressed; \\93it would be too low and too obscure.\\94 \\93Then,\\94 said the questioner, \\93place your light on a candlestick, and it will give light to all that are in the house. Your ideas need to be enlarged and elevated. The people have lost an opportunity to obtain light that God desired them to have.\\94 When the Lord sends his people help, they should show that they value it. Those \n201\nwho stand at the head of the work in these countries should be careful that they do not give it a narrow mould. As they treat the work, so will be the impression made upon the minds of those who are left to carry it forward in their absence. Brethren, we need less of self, and more of Jesus. We should seize upon every God-given privilege and opportunity, and by example as well as words show the sacredness and importance of the message of warning which God sends to the world.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 200}
