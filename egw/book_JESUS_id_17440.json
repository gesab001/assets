{"word": "Jesus condemned their practices, declaring that their custom in oath taking was a transgression of the commandment of God. Our Saviour did not, however, forbid the use of the judicial oath, in which God is solemnly called to witness that what is said is truth \n                                                                           67\nand nothing but the truth. Jesus Himself, at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did not refuse to testify under oath. The high priest said unto Him, \"I adjure Thee by the living God, that Thou tell us whether Thou be the Christ, the Son of God.\" Jesus answered, \"Thou hast said.\" Matthew 26:63, 64. Had Christ in the Sermon on the Mount condemned the judicial oath, He would at His trial have reproved the high priest and thus, for the benefit of His followers, have enforced His own teaching.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MB", "page": 66}
