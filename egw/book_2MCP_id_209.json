{"word": "Human Beings Made Necessary One to Another.-- In the Lord's plan human beings have been made necessary to one another. If all would do their utmost to help those who need their help, their unselfish sympathy and love, what a blessed work might be done. To everyone God has entrusted talents. These talents we are to use to help one another to walk in the narrow path. In this work each one is connected with the other, and all are united with Christ. It is by unselfish service that we improve and increase our talent.--Lt 115, 1903. (HC 182.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 431}
