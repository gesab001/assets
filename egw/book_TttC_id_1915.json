    "word": "If you lose heaven, you lose everything; if you gain heaven, you gain everything. Do not make a mistake in this matter, I implore you. Eternal interests are here involved. Be thorough. May the God of all grace so enlighten your understanding that you may discern eternal things, that by the light of truth your own errors, which are many, may be discovered to you just as they are, that you may make the necessary effort to put them away, and in the place of this evil, bitter fruit may bring forth fruit which is precious unto eternal life. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" Every tree is known by its fruit. What kind of fruit shall henceforth be found upon this tree? \n                                                                           89\nThe fruit you bear will determine whether you are a good tree, or one of which Christ shall say to his angel: \"Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?\" \n\n                                               -",
