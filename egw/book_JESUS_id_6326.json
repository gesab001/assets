{"word": "We are pilgrims and strangers in this world; but we are traveling to a heavenly country. We shall meet with disappointments; but it is our privilege to turn every apparent defeat into a victory. Satan will contend for our souls every step of the way; but if we look over to Jesus, our present help in every time of need, he will lift up for us a standard against the enemy. Instead of complaining at every difficulty, we are to fight the good fight of faith, enduring hardness as good soldiers of the cross of Christ. The wounds and scars of our warfare will be to us, as to Paul, the trophies of victory.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 130}
