{"word": "Instructing With Self-possession and Sympathy.-- Before you engage in the work of teaching your children the lesson of self-control, you should learn it yourself. If you are easily agitated and become impatient, how can you appear reasonable to your children, while instructing them to control their passions? With self-possession and feelings of the deepest sympathy and pity, you should approach your erring children and faithfully present to them the sure work of ruin upon their constitutions if they continue the course they have begun-- that as they debilitate the physical and mental, so also the moral must feel the decay, and they are sinning, not only against themselves, but against God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 459}
