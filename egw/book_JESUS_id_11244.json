{"word": "But suppose that we sin after we have been forgiven, after we have become the children of God, then need we despair?--No: for John writes: \"My little children, these things I write unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous\" (chap. 2:1). Jesus is in the heavenly courts, pleading with the Father in our behalf. He presents our prayers, mingling with them the precious incense of His own merit, that our prayers may be acceptable to the Father. He puts the fragrance into our prayers, and the Father hears us because we ask for the very things which we need, and we become to others a savor of life unto life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 197}
