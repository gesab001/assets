{"word": "We may have a vision of the future, the blessedness of heaven. In the Bible are revealed visions of the future glory, scenes pictured by the hand of God, and these are dear to His church. By faith we may stand on the threshold of the eternal city, and hear the gracious welcome given to those who in this life cooperate with Christ, regarding it as an honor to suffer for His sake. As the words are spoken, \"Come ye blessed of my Father,\" they cast their crowns at the feet of the Redeemer, exclaiming. \"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.... Honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever\" (Matthew 25:34; Revelation 5:12, 13).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 349}
