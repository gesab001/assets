{"word": "I long to see you improving the capabilities given you by God, so that you can respond to the inquiry, \"What must I do to be saved?\" Let the words fall from sanctified lips, \"Be saved by accepting Christ by faith as your personal Saviour.\" God is love. The sinner need not perish if he will exercise faith in the wonderful efficacy of the cross of Christ. The cross is the stupendous expedient by which is harmonized the love and justice of God. It is the sinner's only means of salvation. . . . The image of His love may be so stamped upon the mind that it can never be effaced. Then Jesus Christ will be so evidently set forth crucified before you that you will be a partaker of the dignity of His suffering. I have such an intense longing that you may look into the heart of this great mystery, and find that its interpretation is love. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 252}
