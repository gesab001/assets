{"word": "Trust yourself in the hands of God. Do cease complaining, even though you suppose that there is something to complain of. Satan says, \"I will harass him until he shall make shipwreck of faith\"; but you need not be overcome by his devices. God will uphold you if you will only let Him. At times you are inclined to make a complete surrender of yourself to God, and then you feel at rest; but you take yourself back again, you do not let Jesus carry your burdens.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 314}
