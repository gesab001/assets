    "word": "No taint of self-seeking is to mar our service. \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary. Lift Him up by living faith in God, that your prayers may prevail.

He declares: \"I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand.\" Let us place ourselves where He can hold us by the hand, where we can hear Him saying with assurance and authority: \"I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore.\" \n\n\n     (72)",
