    "word": "Many of the tried servants of God have fallen asleep in Jesus. Let the help of those who are left alive to this day be appreciated. Let their testimony be valued. The good hand of the Lord has been with these faithful workers. He will uphold them by His strong arm, saying: \"Lean on Me. I will be your strength and your exceeding great reward.\" Those who were in the message at its beginning, who fought bravely when the battle went hard, must not lose their hold now.",
