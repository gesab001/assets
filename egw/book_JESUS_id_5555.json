{"word": "If we are converted, we shall no longer represent Satan by warped, one-sided characters; but in character, in words, and in actions, we shall conform to the perfect character given us in the life of Christ. Unless we follow this perfect example, evil practices \n437\nwill confirm us in Satan's snare. We cannot afford to dally with the tempter,\\97to persist in one wrong habit, to cherish one darling sin. If we confess and forsake our sin; if we come to Jesus in penitence and humility of soul, acknowledging our inability to remove one spot or stain of sin, and relying wholly on the merits of a crucified Saviour, we may expect forgiveness; for his word is pledged. He has said that he will pardon our transgressions, and blot out our sins. We must dwell upon the matchless love and compassion of Jesus, and not upon our own unworthiness and sinfulness. If we look to ourselves, all will be darkness; but Jesus is all light and life, and we have only to \\93look and live.\\94 We may look \\93unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame.\\94 [Hebrews 12:2.] What tenderness, what mercy, what love, are here manifested!", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 436}
