{"word": "Kindness to Those Who Differ in Doctrine.--Those who differ with us in faith and doctrine should be treated kindly. They are the property of Christ, and we must meet them in the great day of final account. We shall have to face one another in the judgment, and behold the record of our thoughts, words, and deeds, not as we have viewed them, but as they were in truth. God has enjoined upon us the duty of loving one another as Christ has loved us.--The Youth's Instructor, Dec. 9, 1897.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 638}
