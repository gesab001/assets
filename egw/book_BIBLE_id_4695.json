{"word": "\"But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. . . . When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. . . . He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ\" (Ephesians 4:7-13). Here the members of the church of God are shown acting their different parts, all under the supervision of the great Master Worker, who knows just what each one in His service should do to meet the necessities that arise.--Bible Training School, Apr. 1, 1903.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 220}
