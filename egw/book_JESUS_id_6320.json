{"word": "When souls are deciding for or against the truth, do not, I beseech you, allow yourselves to be drawn away from your field of labor. Do not abandon it to the enemy, I might say, even if one lay dead in your house. Christ said, \\93Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.\\94 If you could only see the importance of the work as it has been presented to me, the paralysis that is upon many would be shaken off, and \n128\nthere would be a rising from the dead and a coming to life through Jesus Christ.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 127}
