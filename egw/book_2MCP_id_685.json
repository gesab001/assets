{"word": "Chap. 62 - Communication\n\n\n     Far-reaching Influence of Words.--The voice and tongue are gifts from God, and if rightly used, they are a power for God. Words mean very much. They may express love, devotion, praise, melody to God, or hatred and revenge. Words reveal the sentiments of the heart. They may be a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. The tongue is a world of blessing or a world of iniquity.--MS 40, 1896. (3BC 1159.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 572}
