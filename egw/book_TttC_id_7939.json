    "word": "I have not been able to sleep since three o'clock, and have been pleading with God for a larger measure of His Spirit. I inquire over and over again: Who is sufficient for these things? I dare not hold my peace when light has been given me of God. I must speak; and yet it is with trembling, fearing that the message will be rejected, and the souls to whom it is addressed will be enshrouded in darkness more dense than before the light came to them. I must come close to Jesus. I have laid my hand in His, with the earnest prayer: \"Lead me, guide me; I have not wisdom to go alone.\" Jesus seems very near; and I am deeply impressed that He is about to do a special work for His people, particularly for those that labor in word and doctrine. He is willing to help you both if you will receive help in His own appointed way, but I cannot speak one word of encouragement to you while you remain in your present position. The words of Christ to the Pharisees, \"Ye will not come to Me, that ye might have life,\" are applicable to you.",
