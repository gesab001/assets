    "word": "Brethren, your own lamps will surely flicker and grow dim until they go out in darkness unless you make decided efforts to reform. \"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works.\" The opportunity now presented may be short. If this season of grace and repentance passes unimproved, the warning is given: \"I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place.\" These words are uttered by the lips of the long-suffering, forbearing One. They are a solemn warning to churches and individuals that the Watcher who never slumbers is measuring their course of action. It is only by reason of His marvelous patience that they are not cut down as cumberers of the ground. But His Spirit will not always strive. His patience will wait but little longer.",
