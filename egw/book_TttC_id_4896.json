    "word": "It is a sacred work in which we are engaged. The apostle Paul exhorts his brethren: \"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" It is a sacred duty that we owe to God to keep the spirit pure, as a temple for the Holy Ghost. If the heart and mind are devoted to the service of God, obeying all His commandments, loving Him with all the heart, might, mind, and strength, and  our neighbor as ourselves, we shall be found loyal and true to the requirements of heaven.",
