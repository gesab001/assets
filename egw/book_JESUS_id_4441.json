{"word": "From these scriptures it is evident that it is not God's will \n                                                                           106\nthat you should be distrustful and torture your soul with the fear that God will not accept you because you are sinful and unworthy. \"Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you\" (James 4:8). Present your case before Him, pleading the merits of the blood shed for you upon Calvary's cross. Satan will accuse you of being a great sinner, and you must admit this, but you can say: \"I know I am a sinner, and that is the reason I need a Saviour. Jesus came into the world to save sinners. 'The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin' (1 John 1:7). 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness' (verse 9). I have no merit or goodness whereby I may claim salvation, but I present before God the all-atoning blood of the spotless Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is my only plea. The name of Jesus gives me access to the Father. His ear, His heart, is open to my faintest pleading, and He supplies my deepest necessities.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 105}
