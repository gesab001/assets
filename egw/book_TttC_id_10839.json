    "word": "We are to be \"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" Romans 12:11. We are to be active in our work; but another element is to mingle with this energy--a living zeal in the service of God. Into our daily work we are to bring devotion, piety, godliness. If you carry on your business without this you make the greatest mistake of your lives; you commit robbery toward God while professing to serve Him. \n\n\n                                               (197)",
