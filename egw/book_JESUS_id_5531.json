{"word": "It is natural for us to have much self-confidence and to follow our own ideas, and in so doing we separate from God; and we do not realize how far we are from him until the sense of self-security is so firmly established that we are not afraid of failure. We should be much in prayer. We need Jesus as our counselor; at every step we need him as our guide and protector. If there was more praying, \n419\nmore pleading with God to work for us, there would be greater dependence upon him, and faith would be strengthened to take him at his word. This faith would honor our Redeemer. It would be easier to believe that if we ask for grace or wisdom, we shall receive it, because his word says, \\93Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\\94 \\93If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\\94 [Matthew 7:7; James 1:5.]", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 418}
