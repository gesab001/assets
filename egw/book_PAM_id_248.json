{"word": "Pastor-President\n \n\n     There must be harmony between pastors and their presidents.--For the last forty years the Lord has been revealing to me the necessity of harmony of action on the part of ministers and the presidents of Conferences. The president of a Conference should be careful to give respect to all who are laborers together with God. One man's mind and judgment is not to control. The ministers who are connected with him in the work are to be respected and loved; criticism should have no room to work. Let envy and evil-surmising be expelled from the soul. Nothing can grieve the Spirit of God more than dissension and depreciation of brethren. In order to have prosperity in labor, there must be confidence in and union with our brethren, who are laboring just as earnestly and disinterestedly as we are. There are those who do not possess a harmonious character in all respects, yet God has accepted them as laborers together with Christ. Then, how out of place it is for one to stand apart from another because their ideas and judgment do not in all things agree.--GCB Feb. 11, 1895.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 104}
