    "word": "Chap. 45 - A Dishonest Steward\n\n     I was shown that the Spirit of God has had less and less influence upon F, until he has no strength from God to overcome. Self and self-interest have been prominent with him for some length of time. Pride of heart, a set, unsubdued will, and an unwillingness to confess and yield his wrongs, have brought him to the dreadful position he is in. Long has the cause been injured by his injudicious course.",
