{"word": "Christ is calling souls to come unto Him, and it is for our present and eternal interest to hear and respond to the call. Jesus says, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you\" (John 15:16). Then let all who would be called children of God respond to the invitation of Christ, and place themselves where the light of heaven will shine upon them, where they will realize what it is to be hearers and doers of the words of Christ, what it is to follow the Light of the world, and be accepted in the Beloved.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 41}
