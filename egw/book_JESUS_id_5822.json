{"word": "In 1821, three years after Miller had arrived at his exposition of the prophecies pointing to the time of the judgment, Dr. Joseph Wolff, \\93the missionary to the world,\\94 began to proclaim the Lord's soon coming. Wolff was born in Germany, of Hebrew parentage, his father being a Jewish Rabbi. While very young he was convinced of the truth of the Christian religion. Of an active, inquiring mind, he had been an eager listener to the conversations that took place in his father's house, as devout Hebrews daily assembled to recount the hopes and anticipations of their people, the glory of the coming Messiah, and the restoration of Israel. One day hearing Jesus of Nazareth mentioned, the boy inquired who he was. \\93A man of the greatest talent,\\94 was the answer; \\93but because he pretended to be the Messiah, the Jewish tribunal sentenced him to death.\\94 \\93Why, then,\\94 rejoined the questioner, \\93why is Jerusalem destroyed? and why are we in captivity?\\94 \\93Alas, alas!\\94 answered his father, \\93because the Jews murdered the prophets.\\94 The thought that was at once suggested to the child, \\93Perhaps Jesus of Nazareth was also a prophet, and the Jews killed him when he was innocent.\\94 So strong was this feeling, that though forbidden to enter a Christian church, he would often linger outside to listen to the preaching.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 357}
