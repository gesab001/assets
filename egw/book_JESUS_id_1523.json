{"word": "In his grateful humility, Matthew desired to show his appreciation of the honor bestowed upon him; and, calling together those who had been his associates in business, in pleasure, and in sin, he made a great feast for the Saviour. If Jesus would call him, who was so sinful and unworthy, He would surely accept his former companions, who were, thought Matthew, far more deserving than himself. Matthew had a great longing that they should share the benefits of the mercies and grace of Christ. He desired them to know that Christ did not . . . despise and hate the publicans and sinners. He wanted them to know Christ as the blessed Saviour. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CC", "page": 284}
