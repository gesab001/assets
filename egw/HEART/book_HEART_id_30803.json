    "word": "Influences have been brought to bear upon minds and hearts to lead men away from God, that they should obey men, and show to men the honor that belongs alone to God. He alone is to be honored and glorified. Men placed in positions of trust may be a help to the churches, but they are not to lord it over God's heritage. Neither are they to show favors to certain ones, with the expectation that they will in return receive certain favors from these persons.",
