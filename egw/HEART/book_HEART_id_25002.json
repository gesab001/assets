    "word": "This is the kind of education the enemy delights in. It is sorcery. The great apostle inquired, \"Who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth?\" Those who receive and admire the sentiments of these so-called great men are in danger, for through the subtlety of the enemy the sophistical reasoning of these false teachers takes root in the heart of our youth, and almost imperceptibly they are converted from truth to error.
