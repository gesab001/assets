    "word": "I know you are full of responsibilities and anxieties. Your position is of such a character that this cannot be otherwise. Then unload from every unnecessary burden. You need Christ's comfort and peace and love every day, and He will give it. He wants you to believe in Him that He may be by your side in every critical operation. He can give you His wisdom. He can cooperate with you and give you success. But you must trust in Him. Complain of no one. Cease every murmur, and let the praise of God come into your heart.",
