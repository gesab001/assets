    "word": "Were they ignorant of the miracle of the loaves and fishes, which had just been performed? No; those who asked Him the question, \"What sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee?\" had been among the multitude miraculously fed. They came to Christ in the hope that in response to their words, He would again work a similar miracle. They desired to see just how He increased the food, supposing it was some science they could catch and be benefited by. Christ desired to awaken faith in their hearts, to lead them to accept him, the Son of God, as the Bread of life; but they despised the lesson He sought to teach. They had witnessed many of His wonderful miracles, but they were not willing to receive Him as the Son of God.",
