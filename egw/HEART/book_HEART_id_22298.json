    "word": "The Great Medical Missionary. \n\n     This world has been visited by the Majesty of heaven, the Son of God. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16. Christ came to this world as the expression of the very heart and mind and nature and character of God. He was the brightness of the Father's glory, the express image of His person. But He laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and stepped down from His high command, to take the place of a servant. He was rich, but for our sake, that we might have eternal riches, He became poor. He made the world, but so completely did He empty Himself that during His ministry He declared, \"Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head.\" Matthew 8:20.",
