    "word": "A talent of great value, and one that nearly all possess, is the talent of speech. Let us be careful not to misuse it. Let us not be rough or coarse in speech. We are to offend no one, not even little children. Christ says, \"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\" The angels who watch over the children bear to heaven every word, be it cheering or disheartening, that is spoken to the little ones.",
