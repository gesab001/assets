    "word": "Last Tuesday night I felt pressed as a cart beneath sheaves. While praying in Brother Woods's family, I wept in agony of soul with strong crying and tears. I sought the Lord after I went to my room. I could not forebear crying aloud. My heart was grieved for the people of God--the sheep of His pasture. Most of the night was spent in prayer. After two o'clock, I slept until after four, that is all. Tears and prayers were my meat through the night.",
