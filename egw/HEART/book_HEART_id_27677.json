    "word": "My brother, had you had elevated and correct views in regard to the obligations of children to their parents, you would not have pressed your attentions upon the daughter against the known wishes of her God-fearing parents. You would have seen that by urging her to disregard their counsels and to link her destinies with yours, you were influencing her to break the fifth commandment. When she looks at this matter in the light of the Bible, she feels forbidden to dishonor her parents and bring sorrow to their hearts; but when you urge your claims and set matters before her in a perverted light, she is unsettled and feels that she will be miserable if she does not marry you.",
