    "word": "Those who are destitute of sympathy, tenderness, and love cannot do Christ's work. Before the prophecy, The weak shall be \"as David,\" and the house of David, \"as the angel of the Lord,\" \n\n\n                     - 13 - \n\ncan be fulfilled, the children of God must put away every thought of suspicion against their brethren. Heart must beat in unison with heart. Christian benevolence and brotherly love must be far more abundantly shown. The words are ringing in my ears, \"Draw together, draw together.\" The solemn, sacred truth for this time is to unify the people of God. The desire for pre-eminence must die. One subject of emulation must swallow up all others,--who will most nearly resemble Christ in character, who will most entirely hide self in Jesus?",
