    "word": "Solomon\n     The hearts of the people were turned toward Solomon, as they were to David, and they obey him in all things. The Lord sends His angel to instruct Solomon by a dream, in the night season. He dreams that God converses with him. \u201cAnd God said, Ask what I shall give thee. And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David, my father, great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. . . . Give, therefore, thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?\u201d\u20144aSG 96, 97.",
