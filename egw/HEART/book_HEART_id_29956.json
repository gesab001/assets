    "word": "Because you have imagined that you were not treated with candor and were not appreciated, you heart has been closing to love. Because you have not always had all the consideration that was your due, though your experience in this line has been limited, you think that generally you are not appreciated. You do not have confidence--shall I speak it?--in any one. If all your plans are not adopted, and all your ideas are not received, you think it is because your brethren have some personal grievance against you, and you gather clouds of darkness about your soul. Now Elder Haskell, I entreat you to keep your soul in the love of God by faith. You have only a little period in which to walk in the footsteps of Jesus. The time calls for advanced movement in the work of reform. The light shining upon us will be received by some, and rejected by many. Characters will be developed by the testing of God, and those who have been ambitious to be first will be found to be last, because the unholy ambition that prompts this desire for the prominence of self, places men on Satan's side of the controversy. Self must be crucified in all who would be laborers together with God.",
