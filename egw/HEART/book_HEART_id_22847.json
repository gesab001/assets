    "word": "The most powerful appeals may be made and the solemn realities of eternity, the danger of losing the soul, be set before them in consequence of disregarding the express injunction of Jehovah, and they heed it not. They resent the messages given them with, \"You are too particular, too critical.\" The Bible presents the authority and claims of Jehovah, his righteous indignation because of the careless inattention of those whom Christ came, through infinite sacrifice, to redeem, but they are not moved by the messages of warning. The terrors of the Lord will not have any permanent effect upon them to lead them to heed the warning to \"come out from among them and be separate, and touch not the unclean.\" The love of Jesus reflected from the cross of Calvary may be presented vividly before them; his pity, his compassion for fallen man which led him to leave the royal courts and royal throne, and lay aside his robes of royalty, and for our sakes to become poor that through his poverty we may become rich; his life of continual self-denial and self-sacrifice, may be brought before them; the entreaties of Christ, the most heart-felt invitations mingled with the richest promises, may all be employed, but the selfish heart is proof against them all. The truth of God can find no acceptance, the claims of God presented by his servants they \n\n\n                           -9- \n\nfeel are too arbitrary. There must be more license, and less constraint. Thus pleads the carnal heart that is untrue to God, that would give him casual service.",
