    "word": "Professed Christians who are being transformed into the likeness of Christ, and who love him with all the heart, will earnestly labor to establish the truth in many places. This is the very work the great Medical Missionary has given us to do. Steadfast faith and perseverance in practical godliness will open the way before every true Christian. And when souls are converted through the instrumentality of such workers, they will give all the glory to God, and will rejoice with exceeding great joy. \n\n\n                                        Ellen G.
