    "word": "Dear sister, do not be discouraged. God is sifting His people. He will have a clean and holy people. We cannot read the heart of man. God has not placed in man a window, that we can look into his heart and see what is there, but He has opened ways to keep the church pure and clean. A people have arisen, a corrupt people that could not live with the people of God. All their evil passions must be gratified. They had a suitable time to repent if they would, and overcome their wrongs, but no. Self was too dear to die. They nourished it and it grew strong, and they separated from the peculiar, self-denying people of God. . . .",
