    "word": "My brother, you need a daily baptism of brotherly love, love that will not savor of dissension, but love like that which in the days of the apostles made the whole company of disciples of one accord. This will have a telling influence upon others. It will bring health to mind, body, and soul. It will bless others, molding the characters of children and youth; for joy, peace, courage, hope, and divine charity have power to propagate themselves. These attributes have their influence upon human minds, and especially upon the mind of children and youth, transforming and assimilating their young, impressionable minds and hearts by divine grace.",
