    "word": "MR No. 801 - Acceptable Prayer\n\n     Interaction Between the Human and the Divine--The richest treasure in the sight of God is a humble, contrite heart. The power of the Lord is magnified when the human heart is tender, sensitive to another's woe, and pitiful for his suffering. Angels of God are ready to work with the human instrumentality in ministering to help souls. When the Holy Spirit works upon our minds and hearts, we shall not shun duty and responsibility, and like the priest and Levite, pass by on the other side, leaving the wounded, helpless soul to its misery. Let there be no departure from the example given us in the Word of life. Charity and godliness are worthy of constant exercise. . . .",
