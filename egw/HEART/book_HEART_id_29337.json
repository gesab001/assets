    "word": "I want to say to my brethren, Shall we humble our hearts before God and be converted? Shall we put off all of the self-sufficiency and the lifting up of ourselves, and come down at the foot of the cross? The lower we lie at the foot of the cross the more clear will be our view of Christ. For just as soon as we begin to lift ourselves up and to think that we are something, the view of Christ grows dimmer and dimmer and Satan steps in so that we cannot see Him at all. But what we want is to come and dwell in view of the cross. \n                                                                           160",
