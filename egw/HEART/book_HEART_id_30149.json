    "word": "The world is asleep. The watchmen are asleep crying peace and safety, in the place of laboring with energy and searching the Scriptures diligently to know what all this wickedness means, that is swelling to such fearful proportions. They say to the wicked who are trampling upon the law of God, It shall be well with you. Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily the hearts of the sons of men are fully set in them to do evil. In place of being softened by the long-suffering of God, and His long patience, they are encouraged by His forbearance to further resistance, flattering themselves in their sinfulness and impenitence that He that has not awakened His wrath against them to curse their wicked inventions will spare a little longer, and they may be ambitious and persistently follow in their own way, with nothing to interpose or to molest them in their inventions, and at some future time they will repent. \n                                                                           1202",
