    "word": "The Spirit of God has not had a controlling influence upon Elder E, Dr. F, Sister G, and many others not in as responsible positions. Dr. F would have a different state of things, in some respects, if he could. But his position is well understood--that he is questioning and philosophizing and seeking through science to make of none effect the working of God's special Providence, his finite mind seeking to comprehend God. He could know more of God in one hour by opening the door of his heart to divine grace than he will find out by a lifetime through his vain philosophy and \"so-called science.\" He must become a fool, in the sense God terms it, in order to become wise in the things of God and in the workings of His Spirit. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned.",
