Do not delay to seek the Lord, each making a personal application to his own case of the lessons Jesus would have him learn. If each one now seeks the Lord; [if] each one now humbles himself before God, He will accept you. Make diligent, earnest work to set your hearts in order. The consecration must be complete; you must be willing to do and to suffer cheerfully for Christ's sake. Hide yourself in Jesus. Jesus loves you; He can be honored by you if you will abide in Him.",
