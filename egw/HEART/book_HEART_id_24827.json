    "word": "I will tell you what I saw in the street coming to this place. A boy was abusing a dog. He was a small boy, but I thought, That child is educating himself in cruelty. I thought how my heart would ache if one of you should do as he was doing. I passed along another street and a well-dressed man, who appeared like a gentleman, was driving a fine horse. The \n\n\n                                   -49- \n\nwind blew a piece of paper under the horse's feet and he started and jumped to one side. That was all, but the man who appeared to be a gentleman whipped the horse cruelly. He was not satisfied with this. He became more and more excited until he was worked up into a rage. He jumped from the carriage and seized the bit and jerked the horse's head back and then kicked the horse several times with his heavy boot. I thought probably that man began his acts of cruelty as did the little boy--upon small animals. He acted the tyrant over God's helpless creatures until the temper and spirit were educated to cruelty. That man could not be a patient, kind, affectionate father. He was cultivating traits of character which would cause others sorrow and make himself miserable.",
