    "word": "Many who are not connected with any church, and who appear wholly unmindful of the claims of God, are not at heart so indifferent as they seem. Even the most irreligious have their hours of conviction, when there comes to them a longing for something they have not. In every town and city there are large numbers who do not attend any place of worship. Many of these are attracted to the camp-meeting. Many come who are slaves of sin, the helpless victims of evil habits. Many are convicted and converted. As they by faith grasp the promise of God \n\n\n                       - 46 - \n\nfor the forgiveness of their sins, the bondage of habit is broken. The liquor drinker and the tobacco devotee forsake their indulgences. They become free men in Christ Jesus, and rejoice in the liberty of the sons of God. This is the work to be done in all our camp-meetings. Through this means thousands will be won to Christ and the Truth.",
