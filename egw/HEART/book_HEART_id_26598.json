    "word": "Nicodemus, a chief ruler and a rabbi, was also a disciple of Christ. He had come to the Saviour by night, as if afraid to have it known that his heart was troubled. That night he listened to the most important discourse that ever fell from the lips of man. The words he heard had penetrated his soul. He had been enlightened by them, but still he had not identified himself with Christ. He had been among the number spoken of by John: \"Among the chief rulers also many believed on Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue\" [John 12:42]. But Nicodemus had endeavored, as far as he could, to defend \n\n\n                                    -420- \n\nChrist. On one occasion he had asked the priests, \"Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?\" [John 7:51]. \"Art thou also of Galilee?\" was the retort. \"Search, and look; for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet\" [verse 52].",
