    "word": "I purposed in my heart that no word or act of mine should cause irritation. When others were irritated, I would say, \"We are all Christ's little children, members of His family. Let us bring all the sunshine that we can into our home.\" Do not speak one word that would hurt the feelings of another. When you are tempted to speak or act unadvisedly, look to Jesus, and remember that when the feelings are stirred, silence is eloquence.--Letter 29, 1904, pp. 2, 3. (To J. A. Burden and wife, January 17, 1904.) \n\nReleased June 21, 1978.",
