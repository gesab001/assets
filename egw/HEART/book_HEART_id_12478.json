    "word": "We are fallible, and have erred many times. Let us return to the Lord with repentance and confession. As we assemble to participate in the ordinances of the Lord's house, let us make every wrong right, so far as lies in our power. When bowing before a brother, washing his feet, ask yourself, \"Have I aught in my heart that separates me from this brother? Have I said or done anything that estranges us?\" If so, take it away by heartily confessing your sin. Thus heart will be cemented to heart, and the blessing of God will be manifest.--Manuscript 102, 1904.",
