    "word": "Self-cultured, self-controlled, under discipline in the school of Christ, having a living connection with the great Teacher, they will have an intelligent knowledge of practical religion, and keeping their own souls in the love of God, they will know how to exercise the grace of patience and Christlike forbearance. The patience, love, long forbearance, and tender sympathies are called into activity. They will discern that they have a most important field in the Lord's vineyard to cultivate. They must lift up their hearts unto God in sincere prayer. Be thou my pattern, and then by beholding Jesus they will do the works of Jesus Christ. Jesus said, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do. So with the sons and daughters of God: they steadfastly and teachably look to Jesus, doing nothing in their own way, and after their own will and pleasure; but that which they have in the lessons of Christ seen him, their pattern, do--they do also. Thus they represent to the students under their instruction at all times and upon all occasions the character of Jesus Christ. They catch the bright rays of the Sun of righteousness and reflect these precious beams upon the children and youth whom they are educating. The formation of correct habits is to leave its impress upon the mind and characters of the children, that they may practice the right way. It means much to bring these children under the direct influence of the Spirit of God, training and disciplining them in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The formation of correct habits, the exhibition of a right spirit, will call for earnest efforts in the name and strength of Jesus. The instructor must persevere, giving line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, in all longsuffering and patience, sympathy and love, binding these children to his heart by the love of Christ revealed in himself.",
