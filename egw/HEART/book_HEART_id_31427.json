    "word": "There is none too much land in the school farm. The school is to be so conducted that Christ can look upon it with pleasure. The farm is to be a noble representation of the work that the Lord wishes to see done on it. All connected with the school are to be trees of the Lord\u2019s planting, revealing in their lives fruit that harmonizes with the purposes and work of the school. Their words and deeds are to bear witness to the difference between sin and obedience, revealing the transforming power of the grace of Christ on the hearts of those who give themselves to Christ as His children.",
