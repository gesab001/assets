    "word": "I would say to the workmen: God will strengthen and encourage you, if you will look constantly to Him. If He smiles upon you, it is worth more to you than silver or gold. Let all recognize their dependence upon the guidance of God. Let the heart be hopeful and peaceful. Do not permit yourselves to cherish any feelings of discontent. It is the duty of each to endeavor to impart courage and good cheer to those who are connected with Him.",
