    "word": "Teachers, Jesus is in your school every day. His great heart of infinite love is drawn out not only for the best behaved children, who have the most favorable surroundings, but for children who have by inheritance objectionable traits of character. Even parents have not understood how much they are responsible for the traits of character developed in their children, and have not had the tenderness and wisdom to deal with these poor children, whom they have made what they are. They fail to trace back the cause of these discouraging developments, which are a trial to them. But Jesus looks upon these children with pity \n\n\n                               -106- \n\nand with love, for he sees, he understands from cause to effect.",
