    "word": "Paul says, \"When I am weak, then am I strong.\" [2 Corinthians 12:10.] When we have a realization of our weakness, we learn to depend on a power not inherent. Nothing can take so strong a hold on the heart as the abiding sense of our responsibility to God. Nothing reaches so fully down to the deepest motives of conduct as a sense of the pardoning love of Christ. We are to come in touch with God, then we shall be imbued with His Holy Spirit, that enables us to come in touch with our fellow-men.",
