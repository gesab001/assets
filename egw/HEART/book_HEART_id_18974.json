They have not become able men in the Scriptures, mighty men in God, and yet every privilege has been within their reach.

They have not a new, clean heart, but a heart that is open to the temptations of Satan. Such can never lead the people to the true, pure fountain of living waters. They may make others acquainted with the reasons of our faith, but it will be impossible for them to do the work which a true shepherd of the flock will do, to \"feed the flock of God.\". . .",
