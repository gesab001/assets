    "word": "The Lord brings his people by ways which they know not, that he may test and try them. This world is our place of proving. Here we decide what our eternal destiny will be. God never exalts his people. He humbles them, that his will may be wrought in them. Thus God dealt with the children of Israel as he led them through the wilderness. He told them what their fate would have been had he not laid his restraining hand upon that which would have hurt them. He speaks to them. Hear what he says. It is a revelation of the ministration of angels. \"Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought \n                                                                           150\nthee forth water out of the rock of flint; who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end: and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto the fathers, as it is this day. And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, to walk after other gods, to serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. As the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God.\"",
