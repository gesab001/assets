    "word": "I write you this because I asked you some questions in reference to the heart. But now, after bringing myself to a very strict diet, I find no special difficulty. When overtaxed, I suffer from exhaustion and inability to breathe. But I think I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord. I adhere strictly to the two meal system, and know this to be a blessing to me. If I could walk much, I would do considerable walking, but my right hip will not admit of this. I am as active upon my feet, in walking about the house and about my premises, as I have been at any period in my life.",
