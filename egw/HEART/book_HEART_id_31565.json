    "word": "It is necessary to the best education that we give the students time to do missionary work, time to become acquainted with the families among whom they live.

They should be encouraged to do faithful missionary work, by becoming interested in those in the darkness of error, taking to them the truth where they are. With all humility of heart seeking knowledge from Christ, praying, and watching unto prayer, they may make known to others the truth that is placed before them day by day.",
