    "word": "There are many who speak of coming to Christ who will leave the matter indistinct and indefinite. The question is asked \"What shall I do to be \n\n\n                                    -197- \n\nsaved?\" And Christ answers the question positively. He asks, \"What is written in the Law?\" And the answer comes to this, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself.\" Luke 10:25-27. Now we can see that the conditions are not made on emotions but it is by taking a distinct course that is laid out for us. It is a very important question with every one of us what we shall do in order to be saved.",
