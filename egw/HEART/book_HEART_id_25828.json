    "word": "Has God been mistaken in us? Are we not His chosen vessels? Are we not the agents He has selected through whom to send forth the last message of mercy to a world? Oh, if we only had Jesus in our hearts, if His Spirit controlled our actions, if His law was the rule of our life, what a power for good we would be in the world! We must remember that others have pleaded and preached for souls--persons more learned and talented than we--and have pleaded in vain. But the humble, devoted worker, feeling his own weakness, and depending only upon God, will realize the strength and sufficiency of the mighty Helper.--Letter 56, 1887, pp. 1, 5, 9, 10. (To D. T. Bourdeau, 1887.)",
