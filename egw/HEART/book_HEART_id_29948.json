    "word": "\"Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.\" But when the Holy Spirit is in the heart, the minister will manifest it to others by his godly life and holy conversation. Do you think that the minister who has no burden for souls is fit for the sacred office to which he has been ordained?--No; he does not know what it means to keep his own soul in the love of God. The minister should realize that souls are the purchase of the blood of Christ, ransomed at an infinite cost. Can the minister who is standing under the shadow of Calvary engage in jesting and joking, and indulge his carnal propensities? Would such a one be a safe guide for the flock of God? Would he not cause them to stumble? He would cause them to stumble; for he would not discern between the sacred and the common, and eternity would be lost out of his reckoning.",
