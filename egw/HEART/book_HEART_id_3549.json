    "word": "\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart\" [and] \"thy neighbour as thyself.\"  This is God's command. Jesus has given an additional requirement, \"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\"  We are not merely to love our neighbor as ourselves; we are to love one another as Christ has loved us. \"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you,\" He declared \"Continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.\"",
