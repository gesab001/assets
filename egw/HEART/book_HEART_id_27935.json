    "word": "Human beings are left free to choose under whose banner they will enlist, which general they will choose. If they take their stand under the banner of Prince Emmanuel, they must make a complete surrender to Him, willingly and heartily obeying His orders. Those who refuse to come under the command of Christ, who think they are at liberty to be a rule to themselves, will be found under a banner opposed to that of Christ.",
