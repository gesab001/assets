    "word": "Our natural heart has to be subdued and we will find that it is an everyday work. The promise is to the overcomer, and as we gain an experience on one point it will strengthen us for the duties that follow, and as we thus draw nigh to God, angels will draw nigh to us to strengthen us for our duty. If temptations come they will prove beneficial if resisted, because we shall learn to fly to Christ for help, and then we shall gain an experience that will fit us for eternal life.",
