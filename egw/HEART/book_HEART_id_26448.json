    "word": "A Christian life is a living reality, for it is constantly reproducing itself. Please remember that you have not to do only with business matters, but with minds, differently organized minds. Your influence reaches the soul; you touch not a wire but that vibrates back to God. You have a personal influence; your words, your actions, leave their trace on other minds. It is your duty to be Christians in the highest sense of the word--\"Christ-like.\" It is through the unseen lines that attract you to other minds with which you are brought in contact that may, if you are in constant connection with God, leave impressions that will make you a savor of life unto life. Otherwise, if you are selfish, if you are self-exalted, if you are worldly minded, no matter what your position, no matter what your experience has been, or how much you know, if you are not having the law of kindness on your lips, sweet fragrance of love springing from your heart, you can do nothing as it ought to be done. You want to come closer to hearts, never to merely touch the hand you take with the tip ends of your fingers, and in a lifeless way saying, Stand off, don't come too near me, I am better than thou. Let heartiness come into your life and be revealed in your connection with those whom God has valued so highly as to give His own life that they might live with Him through eternal ages.-- Letter 37, 1891. (To Emma Weber, March 10, 1891. Written from Battle Creek, Michigan, on February 12, 1891.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. October 27, 1982",
