    "word": "I am instructed to say to all our people, It is best to bear the yoke of Christ. Let each be so glad for an opportunity to work with Christ in bearing His message to the cities, that there will be no inclination to murmur. Christ calls for the heart to be surrendered to Him, that He may mold and fashion it after the divine similitude. When the spirit is worked by the Holy Spirit, the efforts to reach souls will be effectual.",
