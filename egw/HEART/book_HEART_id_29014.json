For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" You may go to this place and that place in search of amusement and self-gratification, but when these are found, what real happiness do they bring? Christ says, \"Come unto Me . . . and ye shall find rest.\" This promise was uttered by lips that never lie. We have the positive assurance that by coming to Christ, we shall find rest. This rest each student may have if he will give to the Saviour the powers of his being.",
