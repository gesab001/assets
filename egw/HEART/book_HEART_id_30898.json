White \n\n\n     Words addressed to board of directors of the College \n     of Medical Evangelists, Loma Linda, Calif., Nov. 9, 1912. \n\n\n     I feel very thankful that it is our privilege to believe in God, and to walk carefully in accordance with the instruction He has given us in His Word. If we do this, our hearts will respond to the impressions of the Spirit of God, and we shall follow on to know the Lord, whose going forth is prepared as the morning, so we are to expect the revelations of His grace as we advance.",
