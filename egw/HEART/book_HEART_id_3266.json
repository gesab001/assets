    "word": "The Christian youth should be trained to bear responsibilities with brave heart and willing hand. He should learn to encounter the trials of life with patience and fortitude, to follow maxims of worth, and to confirm himself in habits that will enable him to win the victor's crown. There is no time more favorable in which to acknowledge the power of Christ's saving grace and to be controlled by the principles of the divine law. \n\n                                               -",
