    "word": "\"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" Blessed results would appear as the fruit of such a course. \"With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" Here are strong motives which should constrain us to love one another with a pure heart, fervently. Christ is our example. He went about doing good. He lived to bless others. Love beautified and ennobled all his actions. We are not commanded to do to ourselves what we wish others to do unto us; we are to do unto others what we wish them to do to us under like circumstances. The measure we mete is always measured to us again. Pure love is simple in its operations, and is distinct from any other principle of action. . . . Love should be cherished and cultivated, for its influence is divine (Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 135, 136).",
