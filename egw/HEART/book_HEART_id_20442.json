    "word": "The apostle tells us that we are to give to everyone that asks us a reason of the hope that is within us, with meekness and fear. \u201cThe entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\u201d It is not enough to merely read, but the Word of God must enter into our hearts and our understanding, in order that we may be established in the blessed truth. If we should neglect to search the Scriptures for ourselves, that we may know what is truth, then if we are led astray we are accountable for it. We must search the Scriptures carefully, so that we will know every condition that the Lord has given us; and if we have minds of limited capacity, by diligently searching the Word of God we may become mighty in the Scriptures, and may explain them to others.",
