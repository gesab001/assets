    "word": "Those upon whom Satan exercises his power the most decidedly are the ones who awaken the sympathy of the Saviour's great heart of love. He is ever having the ones gathered into the fold to go out into the wilderness to seek and rescue the lost sheep.

And when the lost sheep are indeed found by Jesus, what joy and rejoicing there is in the whole universe of heaven. . . .",
