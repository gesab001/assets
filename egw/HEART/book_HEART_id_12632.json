    "word": "A Prescription for Healing \n\n     When the gospel is received in its purity and power, it is a cure for the maladies that originated in sin.  The Sun of Righteousness arises, \"with healing in His wings\" (Malachi 4:2).  Not all that this world bestows can heal a broken heart, or impart peace of mind, or remove care, or banish disease.  Fame, genius, talent -- all are powerless to gladden the sorrowful heart or to restore the wasted life.  The life of God in the soul is man's only hope.",
