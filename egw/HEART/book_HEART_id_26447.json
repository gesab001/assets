    "word": "Let every page in your lifework be fresh and pure and clean in the morning, then keep your heart uplifted to God, breathing out your prayer to Him for guidance, for the upholding by His free Spirit; pray for wisdom that comes from above, that the angels of God may be by your side to help you. You see not in life the end of human actions; their influence never dies. Every morning bear in mind that you are sowing seeds which will bear fruit to life eternal, or to death. If you are in a position where you can mold others, you want first to be molded by the Lord Jesus, then you can be a vessel unto honor. The sphere in which you act may not be large, but you are transmitting impressions that may be for good through the ceaseless ages of eternity. The blessing of God resting upon you will repeat itself by being reflected upon others, and in their turn they may reflect the same upon others.",
