    "word": "It is your duty to grasp every ray of light. You owe it to yourselves, to your family, and to your God, to overcome your objectionable traits of character. If these are not checked and overcome, they will develop, so as to work not only your ruin, but the ruin of others. Sanctified resolution, self-control, supreme love for Christ, will place you in right relation to God and to humanity. God has sent message upon message to His people, and it has nearly broken my heart to see those who, we thought, were taught and led by God, fall under the bewitching power of the enemy, who led them to reject the truth for this time.",
