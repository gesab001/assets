    "word": "The Saviour condescended to come to this earth and give His life for us, but the world would not receive Him and in return for His goodness and mercy rejected Him. But what a condescension on the part of Christ to leave the royal throne and to make the infinite sacrifice, to clothe His divinity with humanity! Here was the Creator of the world, and the ones He came to bless rejected Him. How can we account for this insult to the Majesty of high heaven? Only on the ground that the heart is carnal. It is not in the natural heart to love the Christian graces, but the Spirit is given us to help our infirmities. Is it not a marvel that Christ came to this world, that He, being the Creator, has a special interest for the human race, and that His matchless love yearns for us and He invites us to come unto Him and gain happiness and rest? This can only be done through the knowledge of our divine Lord. By obtaining this we have strength to overcome. The flesh will war against the Spirit, but by divine power this knowledge can be obtained. \n\n\n                                     -83-",
