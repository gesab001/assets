    "word": "May the beginning of this year be a time that shall never be forgotten--a time when Christ shall come in among us, and say, \"Peace be unto you.\" John 20:19. Brethren and sisters, I wish you, one and all, a happy new year. \n     \"We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths; \n      In feelings, not in figures on a dial. \n      We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives \n      Who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best.\"",
