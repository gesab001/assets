    "word": "We are glad the school is located in the very best locality. We shall have to begin to plan to build a meetinghouse; but where is the money coming from? We meet now in a dirty, unwholesome, ill-ventilated building. Oh! my heart sickens at the thought of worshiping God in these places used for theaters and for shows. It must not be; but you know it costs to build here, anywhere. There was a mistake in locating the office where it is hemmed into a crowded block -- no chance to enlarge unless it be heavenward. The time is not far distant when the office will be disposed of and a far better one secured, and suitable buildings erected for office, church, and school. As yet there is no way that we can devise, but the Lord knows best, \"The cattle upon a thousand hills\" are His, and He can work for those here in Australia if they will walk humbly with God.",
