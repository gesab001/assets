    "word": "Thinking, Action and Reaction in.--The Lord made the brain, that the mind may be able to think to a purpose. There is action and reaction in thinking. God designs that man shall use the brain with a vital earnestness. The whole human machinery is to be under the control of the One who made man. Mind, heart, soul, strength, are required in the service of God.--Letter 100, 1898.",
