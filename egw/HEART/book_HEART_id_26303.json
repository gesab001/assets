    "word": "I thought it was my duty to go to Des Moines, Iowa. I hoped to meet most of the ministers in that State. . . . I wished I had all the conference that I could address, for my heart was full of the Spirit of God just as it was at Minneapolis. The Spirit of the Lord came into our morning meetings and many humble testimonies were borne with weeping. I will say to the glory of God that He did sustain me and hearts were touched. I did hope to see some who had taken an active part in Minneapolis bend their proud wills and seek the Lord with their whole heart. I believed this would be done, but although the Lord was manifestly at work upon hearts, no thorough confessions were made. They did not fall upon the Rock and be broken, so that the Lord could put His mold upon them. Oh, if they had only yielded their pride, the light and love of God would have come into their hearts!--Ms 30, 1889, pp. 8, 9. \n\n\n                                      -255-",
