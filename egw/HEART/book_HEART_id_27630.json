    "word": "Marvelous blessings may be expected by the faithful, humble followers of Jesus Christ who follow on to know the Lord. \"God so loved the world that He \n\n\n                                   -236- \n\ngave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" \"The world by wisdom knew not God, but it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God\" [1 Corinthians 2:9, 10].",
