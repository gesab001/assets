    "word": "Last Sabbath, Elder Corliss, Emily Campbell, and I rode out to Seven Hills to attend the service. I could not venture to enter the private house where so many men, women and children were assembled; I had been very ill with affection of the heart for one week, with difficulty of breathing. I sat in the carriage, in the grove outside, while Elder Corliss opened the Scriptures to feed the little company in the house. They had Sabbath School, followed by a Bible reading, which was interesting and instructive to all.",
