    "word": "MR No. 218 - Miscellaneous Requests\n\n     Unbelievers have inquired, \"Why are not miracles wrought among those who claim to be God's people?\" Brethren, the greatest miracle that can be wrought is the conversion of the human heart. We need to be reconverted, losing sight of self and human ideas, and beholding Christ, that we may be transformed into His likeness. When this the greatest of all miracles is wrought within our hearts, we shall see the workings of other miracles.",
