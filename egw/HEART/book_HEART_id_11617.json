    "word": "Before leaving the house for labor, all the family should be called together; and the father, or the mother in the father\u2019s absence, should plead fervently with God to keep them through the day. Come in humility, with a heart full of tenderness, and with a sense of the temptations and dangers before yourselves and your children; by faith bind them upon the altar, entreating for them the care of the Lord. Ministering angels will guard children who are thus dedicated to God.\u2014(Child Guidance, 519.)",
