    "word": "To those who have come to a time of decision, let us say, \"With humility of heart seek the Lord earnestly.\" The longer you tread the path of doubt and perplexity, the less will you feel the influence of the Spirit of God.

(To Dr. William Sadler, July 9, 1906.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. April 24, 1979",
