    "word": "\"The love of Jesus that once burned in the heart has become dim and almost extinguished. Spiritual strength has become enfeebled. The displeasure of the Lord is against his people. In their present condition it is impossible for them to represent the character of Christ. And when the True Witness has sent them counsel, reproof, and warning because he loves them, they have refused to receive the message; they have refused to come to the light, lest their deeds should be reproved. Jesus said, \"I lay down my life for the sheep. . .Therefore doth my Father love me.\" By taking your sins upon myself, I am opening a channel through which his Grace can flow to all who will accept it. In giving myself for the sins of the world, I have prepared a way for the unrepressed tide of his love to flow to men.",
