    "word": "THE LORD DOES NOT ACCEPT FAMILY WORSHIP THAT HAS BECOME A MERE FORM.\u2014In many cases the morning and evening worship is little more than a mere form, a dull, monotonous repetition of set phrases in which the spirit of gratitude or the sense of need finds no expression. The Lord accepts not such service. But the petitions of a humble heart and contrite spirit He will not despise. The opening of our hearts to our heavenly Father, the acknowledgment of our entire dependence, the expression of our wants, the homage of grateful love\u2014this is true prayer.\u2014(Child Guidance, 518.)",
