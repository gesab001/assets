    "word": "A machine may be perfect in all its parts, and yet there be much friction and wear in its movements; but apply oil, and it performs its work quietly and well. So with us. It is necessary to have the oil of grace in our hearts, in order to prevent the friction that may arise between us and those for whom we labor. Then, having not only the arguments of truth but the oil of grace, we can bear the message with power. Prejudice will be broken down, and a great work will be accomplished. \u201cWithout me.\u201d says Christ, \u201cye can do nothing.\u201d The branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine; neither can we except we abide in Christ.",
