But the full establishment of the kingdom of His glory will not take place until the second coming of Christ to this world. \u201cThe kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole \n168\nheaven,\u201d is to be given to \u201cthe people of the saints of the Most High.\u201d Daniel 7:27. They shall inherit the kingdom prepared for them \u201cfrom the foundation of the world.\u201d Matthew 25:34. And Christ will take to Himself His great power and will reign.\u2014MB 108.",
