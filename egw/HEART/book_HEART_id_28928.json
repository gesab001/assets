    "word": "I am thankful this morning to see so many of our brethren and sisters that we did not expect to see when coming so slowly over the plains, and it was the delay of the cars that has thrown us with you. I would greet you heartily this morning; and my earnest wish is that your souls may be in prosperity. This should be our most important question, \"Is it well with my soul?\" As we see everyone busy in this life we see that everyone has an object. Some have their eyes turned away from the law of God to things of minor interest; but yet God presents before us the love of His infinite Son. He presents before us that which He has given for the salvation of the fallen world.",
