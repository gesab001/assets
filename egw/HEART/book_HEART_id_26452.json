    "word": "Daniel knew the value of prayer, its aim, and its object. The prayers which he and his three companions offered after being chosen by the king for the courts of Babylon received answers, which he acknowledged. But prayer is not understood as it should be. Our prayers are not to inform God of anything which He does not know. The Lord is acquainted with the secrets of every soul. Prayers need not be loud and long. The prayers that are offered to tell the Lord of all our wretchedness, when we do not feel wretched at all are the prayers of hypocrisy. \"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones\" [Isaiah 57:15].",
