    "word": "In many places where I go to visit our health institutions this instruction is repeated to me, because our workers need to climb higher. We are satisfied with too low a standard in spiritual things. We must learn to work away from this low standard. The promise is, \"If ye do these things,\"--if you work on the plan [of] adding grace to grace,--\"ye shall never fall; for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord.\" The workers need to encourage the presence of the Spirit of God in their hearts and minds; then He will be manifest in the speech. Then the angels of God can connect with them, and lasting impressions for good will be made. It is impossible for the human agent, unaided, to make the desired impression; but Christ will do this. He will work with those who work with Him.",
