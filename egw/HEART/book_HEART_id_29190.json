    "word": "Awake, my brethren, awake, Seek righteousness, and stand under the broad shield of Omnipotence. This is your only safety. God calls upon you to seek Him with humility of heart. Read Daniel's prayer, and see if your experience will stand the test of fire. God will richly bless those who humble themselves before Him. His mercy and grace will be extended to all who wear the yoke of Christ, responding to the invitation, \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.\"",
