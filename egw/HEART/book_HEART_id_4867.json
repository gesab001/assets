    "word": "The Response to the Impotent Man \n\n     There was the impotent man, and as Christ talked with him, he told the pitiful story of how, just as soon as he would go down into the water to be healed, somebody else would step in before him. Christ asked him, \"Wilt thou be made whole?\" (John 5:6). What a question! That was what he was there for, but Christ wanted to call forth the expression of desire in that man's heart to be made whole. And when Christ bade him to rise, take up his bed and walk, he did just as Christ told him to do. He did not say, \"Why, I have been here thirty years and have not taken a step during that time.\" He did not stop to argue, but did just as he was bidden. He took up his bed and walked out and was healed from that time.",
