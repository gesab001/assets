    "word": "Many have deceived the world, betrayed the cause of Christ, and put the Lord of glory to an open shame by misrepresenting His character. These lie against the truth. They countenance and practice principles that in no way correspond with the truth of God. Many are willing to benefit themselves at another's disadvantage, and this proves that the truth has not been brought into the sanctuary of the soul, and that God's law is a dead letter to them. The commandment is, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God will all thy heart, \n                                                                           216\nand . . .thy neighbor as thyself\" (Matthew 22:37-39). They have failed to learn the lesson of the pure Son of God. The True Witness says, \"I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent\" (Revelation 2:4, 5).",
