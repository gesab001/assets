    "word": "O that the Lord would heal the wounds and bruises that Satan has made. Would that you might become an entirely free man! Come to the light, and fully acknowledge the light, rejoice in the light, and not make half way work with the matter in order to preserve your dignity. O for Christ's sake, for your soul's sake, make clean work, and put up the bars behind you. It is the only safe thing you can do. A work of self-renunciation is essential, and unreserved casting of yourself, all broken on Christ Jesus. Then He will gather you in His ever lasting arms. Open the door of the heart, and bring into your soul all the heavenly agencies and attributes that will make you a workman that needeth not to be ashamed.",
