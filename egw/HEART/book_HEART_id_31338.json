    "word": "The change of the natural, inherited, and cultivated tendencies of the human heart, is that change of which Jesus spoke when he said to Nicodemus, \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see (discern) the Kingdom of God.\" Nicodemus did not understand Christ's words. He inquired, \"How can these things be?\" The answer comes home to every man in responsible positions, \"Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen: And ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven.\"",
