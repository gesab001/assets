    "word": "Teachers see a child who has not the experience they think he ought to have and they don't stop to plead with him. They don't remember how it was with them in their childhood--if one came upon them like a storm, how it braced them in that very evil that ought to be corrected. Some go at these children as though they had no heart, feeling, conscience, or reason, and by their course of action stir up the worst passions of the human heart.",
