    "word": "This message from God is sent to you in love. Will you receive it? Will you be saved from yourself? Forever stop finding fault with others, for this is an offense to God, but get your own perverse heart right by humiliation, contrition, and penitence before God. This is your work. Be careful and make straight paths for your feet lest the lame be turned out of the way. Now is your time. Now is your day of opportunity and privilege. Time is closing--you are unready. Make haste in this thy day, lest the knell of irrevocable doom shall sound, \"Now they are hid from thine eyes\" (Luke 19:42).--Letter 33, 1879. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. April 14, 1988. Entire Letter.",
