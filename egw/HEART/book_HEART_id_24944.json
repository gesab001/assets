    "word": "Many mothers show very little wisdom in the way in which they dress their children. They allow the dictates of fashion to rule them, to the great detriment of the health of their children. It would seem almost as if they did not have reasoning powers. They dress their little girls in such a way \n\n\n                                 -320- \n\nthat the limbs are left unprotected, while those parts of the body nearest the heart, and therefore naturally the warmest, are covered with several thicknesses of clothing. Thus the blood is driven from those parts of the body which need it most, because they are the most remote from the heart, and they are chilled.--Ms 4, 1905.",
