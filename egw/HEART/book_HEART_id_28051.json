    "word": "I wish I had the power with pen or voice to present before the teachers of our youth and all who preach the truth to others what they have lost by trusting in human wisdom. It has led them to close the door of their hearts to the bright and morning Star. I wish I could teach those who feel superior in their own wisdom, those who are self-sufficient, that in order to be wise they must step down from their loftiness and become fools in their own estimation, that they must become learners if they would drink in wisdom.",
