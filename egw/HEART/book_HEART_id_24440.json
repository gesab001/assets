    "word": "O that thousands more of our people had a realization of the time in which we are living, and of the work to be done in field service, in house-to-house labor! There are many, many, who know not the truth. They need to hear the call to come to Jesus. The sorrowing are to be cheered, the mourners comforted. The poor are to have the gospel preached to them. I urge my brethren and sisters not to engage in work that will hinder them from proclaiming the gospel of Christ. You are God's spokesmen. You are to speak the truth in love to perishing souls. Christ says, \"Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that My house may be filled.\" Luke 14:23. Do not these words plainly outline the work of the canvasser? With Christ in his heart, he is to go forth into the highways and byways of life, giving the invitation to the marriage supper. Men of wealth and influence will come, if they are invited. Some will refuse, but, thank God, not all.",
