    "word": "ANSWERED PRAYERS ARE CAUSE FOR PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING.\u2014In the second chapter of 1 Samuel is recorded the prayer of a consecrated woman who served and glorified God. She prayed: \u201cMy heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. There is none holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.\u201d Hannah\u2019s offering of thanksgiving for the answer to her prayer is a lesson to those who today receive answers to their requests. Do we not neglect to return praise and thanksgiving to God for His lovingkindness?",
