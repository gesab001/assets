    "word": "Great improvement can be made in singing. Some think that the louder they sing, the more music they make; but noise is not music. Good singing is like the music of the birds--subdued and melodious. In some of our churches I have heard solos that were altogether unsuitable for the service of the Lord's house. The long-drawn-out notes, and the peculiar sounds common in operatic singing, are not pleasing to the angels. They delight to hear the simple songs of praise sung in a natural tone. The songs in which every word is uttered clearly, in a musical tone, are the songs that they join us in singing. They take up the refrain that is sung from the heart with the spirit and the understanding.",
