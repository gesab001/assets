    "word": "In a petition of this kind, no lack of faith is manifested. There are cases that are clear, and the Lord works with His divine power in their restoration. The will of God is evidenced too plainly to be misunderstood. The Lord does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him. For He knoweth our frame, He remembereth what we are dust. He knoweth our hearts, for He reads every secret of the soul. He knows whether or not those for whom petitions are offered would be able to endure the trial and test that would come upon them if they lived. He knows the end from the beginning.",
