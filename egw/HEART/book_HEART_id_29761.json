    "word": "I know time and again the Lord Jesus has longed to communicate the Holy Spirit in rich measure, but there was no place for it to rest. It would not be recognized or valued. The blindness of mind, the hardness of heart, would interpret it as something of which they should be afraid, or [they would] use it to exalt themselves. Some will think [that] some hidden evil lies lurking in the revealings or manifestations of God's power, that would harm them. When things come to this pass, the Spirit does not descend.",
