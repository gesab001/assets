    "word": "Abridged\n\n16 - Blend Together\n\nDate: July 22, 1905 Location: St. Helena, California Source: Letter 211, 1905 Status: Previously unpublished\nContext: Mrs. White writes to her overworked son. In this letter she gives counsel as to how men in responsibility at Oakwood should conduct themselves. A duplicate copy of this letter was also sent to G.I. Butler, then Southern Union president.\nMy dear son Edson,\n     I have written you some things sorrowfully. I dare not confide these things to you alone, but have sent them to Elder Haskell to be read to you. There are many who suppose that I sustain you in things that are not right. It would be doing an injustice to them and to you for me to keep back the warnings that I have received for you; therefore, though I feel more sad at heart than I can tell you, I dare not withhold these things from you.",
