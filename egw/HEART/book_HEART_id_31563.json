    "word": "In America the Bible has been brought in to some extent, but teachers and students have depended too much upon the books of authors whose ideas and sentiments are misleading. When the light of truth for these last days came to the world in the proclamation of the first, second, and third angel's messages, we were shown that a different order of things must be brought into school work; but it has taken much time to come to an understanding of the changes \n\n\n                               -120- \n\nthat should be made in the lines of study and the manner of teaching. It is the most difficult to follow right principles after being so long accustomed to the practices of the world; but reforms must be entered into with heart, and soul, and will. Altogether too long have the old habits and customs been followed.",
