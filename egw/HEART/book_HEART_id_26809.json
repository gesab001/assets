    "word": "You want heaven; well, Jesus wants you to have heaven, and to enjoy its glories, or He would not have given His precious life to save you. Jesus is near you, inviting you to come unto Him that you might have life. Come just as you are every day. Come to Jesus confessing your mistakes, your errors, and your sins. Come with true contrition of soul; seek pardon, and Christ will forgive you your sins and let the bright beams of His righteousness shine into your hearts and minds. May the Lord bless you and make you complete in Jesus Christ, is my prayer.--Manuscript 1, 1894. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. September 27, 1984 Entire Manuscript",
