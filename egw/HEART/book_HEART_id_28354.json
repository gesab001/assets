    "word": "Jesus is our strength, our support, the crown of our rejoicing. Every one brought into the truth and soundly converted, may be the means of bringing others to the knowledge of the truth, and through that one churches may be raised up an scores brought to Jesus Christ. We may neither one of us live long, but it is our privilege to enshrine ourselves in the hearts of those who love God, and when we lay off the armor we want to look back with pleasant recollections upon the souls saved through our instrumentality.",
