    "word": "Let none feel that they can claim any merits because of their advantages of birth or position or education. How did they obtain those advantages? Only through Christ: God calls upon all who would have everlasting life to copy the Pattern. Truth and righteousness are the first principles of the gospel, and the only principles that Christ will recognize in any human agent. There must be heartfelt surrender of our will to God; we must renounce all our own supposed merits, and look to the cross of Calvary. This surrender to God involves effort on the part of the human agent to cooperate with the divine agencies; the branch must abide in the vine. . . .",
