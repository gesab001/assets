    "word": "It is the humble ones that God accepts. When Christ came from His home in glory He did not go to the talented and great men of the earth to choose teachers, for He knew He could not educate such ones. He selected poor fishermen as His companions and scholars. To these He gave lessons of instruction that would fit them for their future duties, and these lessons are recorded in the Word of God and will have their weight until the end of time. Judas was not such a learner as was John. He did not let the lessons given have a sanctifying influence on his heart; his natural disposition was not brought under discipline, and it finally led to the betrayal of Christ. But John not only learned the lessons but put them in practice, and after the death of his Master, when assailed by the enemies of truth, he stood firmly upon the principles which he had learned.",
