    "word": "I have been shown that we were not doing our duty in the gratuitous circulation of small publications. There are many honest souls who might be brought to embrace the truth by this means alone. . . . These small tracts of four, eight, or sixteen pages, can be furnished for a trifle, from a fund raised by the donations of those who have the cause at heart. When you write to a friend, you can inclose one or more without increasing postage. When you meet persons in the cars, on the boat, or in the stage, who seem to have an ear to hear, you can hand them a tract.-- Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 551, 552.",
