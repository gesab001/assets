    "word": "Thus is pictured the mission and work of Christ and his co-labourers, but how different is the work of the prince of darkness, and the work of those who labour on his side of the controversy. Those who are united with the prince of darkness in degrading the souls of their fellow-men, often cloak their iniquity under the garb of religion, but of them the Lord says, \"When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood\" Isaiah 1:15. Those who sell strong drink to their fellow-men come under this reproof. They receive the earnings of the drunkard, and give him no equivalent for his money. Instead of this, they give him that which maddens him, and turns him into a demon of cruelty. He exchanges his reason at the bar of the liquor-dealer for a glass of rum or brandy, and under its influence he may treat his wife and children with cruel abuse, and may even kill them outright, or do so by degrees, through neglect, through failure to supply them with the necessities of life. The heart-broken women who have inebriate husbands, if they do not die of abuse or of outright and horrible murder, do die from the effects of starvation, insufficient clothing, and a continual sense of degradation and shame through the poverty, want, and suffering that are consequent upon the drink habit. These poor women see their children suffering, despised, abused, debased \n                                                                           3\nThey see them hooted at because of their relation to their drunken fathers, and even the liquor-seller is not careful to refrain from adding insult to injury. Everything,--clothing, food, comfort, home self-respect, happiness, and peace, is swallowed up, and at last life itself is practically laid down, a sacrifice to the liquor-dealer.",
