    "word": "My Brother, I have some things to say to you in the name of the Lord. The matter has been opened before me, and this morning urges itself upon my mind in a most impressive manner. . . . It is unfortunate for your wife and children that you are an invalid, because your mind is affected by the condition of your stomach, and you are often very exacting. . . . Your health will improve when your heart is under the subduing influence of the Spirit of God, and you let the peace of God rule, not be a transient guest, in your soul. Now I wish to tell you something of what the Lord has shown me, in my own case and a score of others, in reference to diet. Some years ago Elder Loughborough's family were living very much as yours have been, discarding salt, and rigidly following a certain course they had marked out. All were dyspeptics. Elder Loughborough did not have strength to perform his ministerial labors, and the children ate double the amount of food they should have had, because the wants of the stomach were not met.",
