G. White.\n\n     Christ labored untiringly to accomplish the great work that He came to this world to perform. His desire to save the lost race was manifest on all occasions. During His ministry He went about doing good. It was His mission to help those in need of help, to seek the lost, to lift up the bowed down, to heal the sick, to speak words of sympathy and consolation to the sorrowing and the distressed. His heart was ever touched with human woe. How earnestly He worked for sinners! How constant were His efforts to prepare His disciples to carry the Gospel message to the ends of the earth! He placed Himself on the altar of service, a living sacrifice.",
