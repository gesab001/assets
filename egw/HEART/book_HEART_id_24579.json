    "word": "Brother and Sister_____, seek the Lord. When you find Him, you will be meek and lowly of heart. Individually you will not subsist on the flesh of dead animals, neither will you put one morsel into the mouths of your children. You will not prescribe flesh, tea, or coffee, for your patients; but you will give talks in the parlor, showing the necessity of a simple diet. You will put away injurious things from your bill of fare.",
