    "word": "If you connect with God, fearing Him, loving Him, obeying Him, and giving to the world a living example of what the Christian's life should be, you will fulfill your obligation to God and to your fellow men. You are to show forth in your life what it means to love God with all your heart, and your neighbor as yourself. Connected with the God of wisdom and love, you will demonstrate to the world the fact that you are not living for this world, but for that which is not temporal but eternal.",
