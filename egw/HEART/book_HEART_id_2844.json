    "word": "Our bodies belong to God. He paid the price of redemption for the body as well as the soul. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. \"The body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.\" Verse 13. The Creator watches over the human machinery, keeping it in motion. Were it not for His constant care, the pulse would not beat, the action of the heart would cease, the brain would no longer act its part.",
