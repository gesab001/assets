    "word": "Among the people of God there is to be no colonizing. The word of the Lord to them is, \"Thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left\" (chap. 54:3). They are to make plants in all places. Everywhere the truth for this time is to be proclaimed. Those into whose hearts the light has shone are to remember that they are God's workmen, His witnesses. To serve and honor Him is to be their science. They are to call upon others to keep His commandments, and live. Obedience to the law of God is the question that is to test the world. . . .",
