    "word": "I was suffering with cold, [and was] sick at the stomach. I arose at about three o'clock and dressed and then prayed. I felt that the Lord indeed drew me near to Himself, and my spirit was lightened. I prize these tokens of His love more than language can express. I felt a sweet assurance while praying for you. I believe God hears my prayer and will send His help, His strength, and His joy to your heart.",
