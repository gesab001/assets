    "word": "If you have the precious light from heaven, talk about it. And have we not everything from Jesus to talk about? I could give you subjects that would put to the stretch your thoughts and mind, and yet there is a great deal more. The great plan of redemption is not half comprehended. If we could only understand the plan of salvation, we would be the happiest people upon the face of the earth. The truth that God has given us would so fill our minds that we could not talk of earthly things. And then it is almost impossible for you to explain to others the greatness of salvation that you feel in your own heart. Jesus wants you to dwell upon this salvation.",
