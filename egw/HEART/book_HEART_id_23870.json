    "word": "The Lord has sent you Testimonies of instruction, of rebuke, and warning. Some have come to the light that they may see and know their errors, and put them away. Others are deceived and deluded in regard to their spiritual standing before God. They do not bring their character and works to the test by comparing them with the word of God and the declaration of Scripture that plainly condemns their course and marks out the only true path \n                                                                           13\nfor them to walk in. These have not had true Bible repentance. The word of God has not been their rule of action. It has not been received with deference and reverence as it should have been. This word requires of them true sorrow for sins and thorough confession if they would have from their Redeemer peace and pardon. But there are men standing in responsible positions who teach one thing and practice another. While they have been forward to condemn their brethren, their own character is more faulty in the sight of God than the ones they would criticise and condemn. These men are blind leaders of the blind, and both leaders and those led by them will be ruined unless there is true repentance and heart-felt confession before God. These who bind souls in deception are themselves deceived. They form their judgment of duty from the general practice of professed Christians who have a form of godliness, but who deny the power thereof. They have a superficial, hasty, erroneous conception of the nature of virtue and of piety. It is their opinion, if not guilty of out-breaking sins that human eyes can discern, they are not called upon to show the fruits of true repentance and sorrow for sin. This is in direct contradiction to the words of inspiration.",
