    "word": "Christ taught the people that all true knowledge is divine, and that, acted upon, it would lead them heavenward. In all His teachings there was suggested to His hearers a new train of thought, in harmony with the transforming principles of truth. By meeting the people where they were, He was able to carry them with Him to a higher plane of thought and life. Their hearts were prepared to receive the rays of light from the great Light of the world.",
