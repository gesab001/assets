    "word": "EARNEST PRAYER AVAILS MUCH.\u2014That prayer which comes forth from an earnest, believing heart is the effectual, fervent prayer that availeth much. God does not always answer our prayers as we expect, for we may not ask what would be for our highest good; \n72\nbut in His infinite love and wisdom He will give us those things which we most need.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, 531.)",
