    "word": "Let the heart be softened and subdued by the spirit of prayer before the Bible is read. Truth will triumph when the spirit of truth cooperates with the humble Bible student. How precious the thought that the Author of truth still lives and reigns. Ask Him to impress your minds with the truth. Your search of the Scriptures will then be profitable. Christ is the great Teacher of His followers, and He will not leave you to walk in darkness.",
