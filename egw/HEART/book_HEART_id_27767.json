    "word": "Much money is expended in every way to bring the light of truth to bear on human minds, and then the ones who are building with one hand are pulling down with the other.

It is Christ that takes the sins of the guilty upon His divine soul, and imputes to the guilty His own righteousness. Shall we not work in these lines when we come in contact with sins, with presumptuous, high-headed, and hard-hearted souls who irritate and provoke with their ways and manners?",
