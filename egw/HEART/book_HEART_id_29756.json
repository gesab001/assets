    "word": "P.S. I was urged by our ministering brethren to return to Lynn and speak on Tuesday and Wednesday evening. I have consented to do this. Brother Fifield is doing all he can to get the people to the meetings on these two evenings. May the Lord move upon their hearts, is my prayer. On Thursday night we go to Boston, take the sleeper for Washington, and arrive in that city on Friday at eleven o'clock.--Letter 43, 1890. (To Elder O. A. Olsen, Dec. 15, 1890.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. December 2, 1982",
