    "word": "If you walk carefully before God, those who believe in Christ will respect you for Christ's sake. Jesus receives and welcomes you as His own friend. He loves you, He has pledged Himself to open before you all the treasures of His grace for your appropriation. He says, \"At that day ye shall ask in My name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father Himself loveth you, because ye have loved Me, and have believed that I came out \n\n\n                                    -216- \n\nfrom God\" [John 16:26, 27]. He virtually says, Make use of My name, and it will be your passport to the heart of My Father and to all the riches of His grace. \"Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it to you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full\" [verses 23, 24]. \"And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son\" [John 14:13]. You should educate the soul to have implicit trust in God; for what we need is more faith.--Letter 92, 1895. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. June 16, 1988. Entire Letter.",
