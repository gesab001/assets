We were glad to find the church well filled with those who had come to receive benefit from the meetings. [THIS WAS AMONG THE FIRST MEETINGS IN WHICH ELLEN WHITE PARTICIPATED IN PRESENTING THE MESSAGE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH IN THE FIELD SUBSEQUENT TO THE MINNEAPOLIS CONFERENCE. THROUGH 1889 SHE FREQUENTLY LED OUT IN CARRYING THE MESSAGE TO THE CHURCHES. SOME OF HER SERMONS WERE REPORTED, AS WAS THE ONE AT OTTAWA, KANSAS, ON MAY 11. THIS TYPICAL SERMON IS PUBLISHED IN FAITH AND WORKS, PP. 63-79.] . . . Delegates were present from Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and other States. We realized that there was a work to be done in setting things in order, which man's best efforts could not accomplish without the aid of God. Our hearts were drawn out in earnest supplication to God that He would work in our behalf. . . .",
