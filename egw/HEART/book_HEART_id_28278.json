    "word": "The only safety for any of us is to plant our feet upon the Word of God and study the Scriptures, making God's Word our constant meditation. Tell the people to take no man's word regarding the Testimonies but to read them and study them for themselves, then they will know that they are in harmony with the truth. The Word of God is the truth. Of a good man the psalmist declares, \"His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law doth he meditate day and night.\" He who puts mind and heart into this work gains a solid, valuable experience. The Holy Spirit is in the Word of God. Here is the living, undying element so distinctly represented in the sixth chapter of John. [John 6:53-57, 63, quoted.]",
