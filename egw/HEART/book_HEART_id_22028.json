    "word": "Personal Devotion Sadly Neglected. \n\n     Those who have not lost their first love will have a care for the souls of those with whom they are associated; but if one in a responsible position is found whose morals are tainted with dishonesty or impurity, be on your guard that his godless spirit and example do not contaminate your soul, and so the contagion of evil spread. The moral tone of piety among us must be raised, and in order that it may be, we must take time for the personal culture of heart religion. Let each one feel, I must be an example in patience; I must do good \n\n\n                       - 31 - \n\nwhether others appreciate my motives or not; I must not stand allied with evil, or cover it with a mantle of false charity. Bible charity is not sentimentalism, but love in active exercise. To heal the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, \"Peace, peace,\" when there is no peace, is called charity. To confederate together, to call sin holiness and truth, is called charity; but it is the counterfeit article.",
