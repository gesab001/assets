    "word": "God has given to no man the power to bless or curse. This is His prerogative. You are not to feel at liberty to rule or oppress His heritage, to set up or cast down as you please. You are but a man, compassed with infirmities. The power which you have thought was yours to exercise is God's power. You can not, like God, read the hearts of men and know who to favor or condemn. You cannot be conscience for them. God has not given you any such work. You are only a human agent. You have taken burdens on you which do not belong to you, and have presented in word and spirit an objectionable representation of Christ.",
