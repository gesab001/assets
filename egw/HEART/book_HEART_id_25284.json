    "word": "But Elder [E. P.] Daniels is an acceptable speaker and, as I have been shown, a man of not the deepest judgment, one who needed a counselor; but he is a man who could come close to the hearts of the people and one who possesses sympathy in personal efforts that would penetrate the barriers built up about the soul that resisted the influence of the truth.
