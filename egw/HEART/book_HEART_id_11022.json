    "word": "Value the gift of peacemaking.--Where are those who do not stint or measure their loving labor for the Master? Who are striving to quell every dissension in the church, being peace-makers in Christ's name? Who are seeking to answer the prayer of Christ, \"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us; . . . I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me\"? Could our Lord speak these words, so gracious, so full of meaning, of the churches in their present state of feeble love, of dissension and petty trial,--churches that are calling ministers from important work to settle their little manufactured difficulties, thus showing that they have no connection with God?--No. The members of the church must come into unity; and in order to do this, they must have less of self, and more of Jesus. They must learn of Christ. They must be meek and lowly of heart. Their selfish pride must die. Then their mountains of difficulty will be reduced to mole-hills.--RH Jan. 6, 1891.",
