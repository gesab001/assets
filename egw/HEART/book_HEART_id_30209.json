    "word": "Let the prayer go up to God, \"Create in me a clean heart;\" for a pure, cleansed soul has Christ abiding, therein, and out of the abundance of the heart are the issues of life. The human will is to be yielded to Christ. Instead of passing on, closing the heart in selfishness, there is need of opening the heart to the sweet influences of the Spirit of God. Practical religion breathes its fragrance everywhere. It is a savour of life unto life.",
