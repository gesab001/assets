    "word": "I cannot express to you the intense desire of my soul that you should all seek the Lord most earnestly while he may be found. We are in the day of God's preparation.

Let not cold unbelief hold your souls away from God; but let his love burn on the altar of your hearts.--\"Testimony,\" No. 33, pp. 117, 118.",
