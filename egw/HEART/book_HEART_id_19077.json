    "word": "We are not Working Alone \n\n     There is a work to be done by God's people. What is true eloquence in the human life? It is a heart full of pure sentiments, a veneration for all God's commandments. But earnest work has not been done. A certain round of duties has been performed, but this is not enough. Step out of the common channel. If you cannot reach the members of the churches, do not become discouraged. Take the work into the highways, and if the self-righteousness of those for whom you labor will not be penetrated by the leaven of truth, go out of the usual round into the byways, and there do your missionary work.",
