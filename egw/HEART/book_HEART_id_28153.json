    "word": "\"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.\" He is not with Christ in mind and heart, and he cannot rightly appreciate or enjoy the high, exalted truths of God's Word. It seems foolishness to him to put on the white garment of Christ's righteousness. With him the religious experience is a matter of chance. He is not born of the Spirit, therefore he cannot judge correctly concerning spiritual things. Many of those who claim to believe in Christ reveal by their words and actions that they are not partakers of the divine nature. They do not appreciate the truths of eternal value.",
