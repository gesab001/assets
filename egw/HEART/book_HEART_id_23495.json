    "word": "The buds and blooming flowers of this bouquet which I hold, God has touched with varied delicate tints, most beautiful to the eye. The artistic skill of earth can produce nothing that will compare with the natural beauties given us by the great Master-Artist. As we look upon the lofty trees waving with fresh, green foliage, and the earth covered with its green velvet carpet, and the flowers and shrubs springing from the earth, we should remember that all these beauties of nature have been used by Christ in teaching his grand lessons of truth. As we look upon the fields of waving grain, and listen to the merry songsters in their leafy homes, and view the boats upon the water of the lake, we should remember the words of Christ upon the lake-side, in the groves, and on the mountains, and the lessons there taught by him should be repeated to us by the similar objects of nature which surround us. Such scenes should be sacredly regarded by us, and should bring joy and gladness to our hearts.",
