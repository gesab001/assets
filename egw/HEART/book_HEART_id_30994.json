    "word": "A Gracious Invitation \n\n     Our Redeemer sends His messengers to bear a testimony to His people. He says, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock. If any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\" But many refuse to receive Him, because \n                                                                           100\nthey fear that He will be an expensive guest. The Holy Spirit waits to soften and subdue hearts, but they are not willing to open the door and let the Saviour in; for they fear that He will require something from them. And so Jesus of Nazareth passes by. He longs to bestow on them His rich blessings and gifts of grace, but they refuse to accept them.",
