    "word": "\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures \n upon earth.\" Matthew 6:19. \n\n\n     Treasure laid up on earth will not endure; thieves break through and steal; moth and rust corrupt; fire and storm sweep away your possessions. And \"where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" Treasure laid up on the earth will engross the mind to the exclusion of heavenly things.",
