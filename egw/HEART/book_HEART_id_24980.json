    "word": "Sunday, Elder Smith came to me, and we had a lengthy talk; I was encouraged to see that he did not brace against me, and I withheld nothing from him as to how I regarded his position and how hard he had made my work. He felt deeply over this. Tuesday he called on me again and asked me to attend a meeting which should be composed of a select few. This meeting was held on Wednesday. Brother Smith read the matter I had written to him, and he made a straightforward confession to Professor Bell who was present, of the manner in which he had treated him. Then he commenced with Minneapolis, and made his confession. He had fallen on the Rock and was broken. I cannot describe to you my joy. Brother Rupert then confessed quite fully, and this was a very solemn meeting indeed. I knew the Lord was in our midst. As we separated, Brother Smith took my hand and said, \"Sister White, will you forgive me for all the trouble and distress that I have caused you? I assure you this is the last time if the Lord will pardon me. I will not repeat the history of the past three years.\" Bless the Lord, O my soul! Bless His holy name! My return from Washington, D. C., to Battle Creek was indeed the Lord's doing, and as soon as I reached home, the affliction left my heart and has not returned since.--Ms 3, 1891, pp. 2, 3.
