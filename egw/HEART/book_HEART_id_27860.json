    "word": "The smoking steamboat inspector was told it was the tobacco smoke which had acted like poison upon me. He threw away his cigar and we had no more smoking on the train. A physician on board stated that he feared it was to me a fatal poison and that I would never become conscious again. He told me never to consent to be in the room or in the car, carriage, or steamboats where I would be obliged to breathe the air poisoned by tobacco, for he had in his practice treated many cases of mothers and children with affection of the heart caused by living in and inhaling constantly tobacco-poisoned air. Notwithstanding he warned the husband and father of the sure result, he thought there could have been no change [in the man's habit], for the afflicted ones lived only a short time and were [as] verily poisoned to death as if a dose of arsenic or strychnine had been administered. The blood was poisoned.",
