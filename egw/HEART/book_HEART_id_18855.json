    "word": "Gentle Words. When discouraging words are spoken to you, do not reply unless you can return a pleasant answer. When you are tried and tempted by unkind words, do not \n                                                                           51\nretaliate. Say to yourself, \"I will not disappoint my Saviour.\" Every man who is a Christian is a gentleman; and every woman who is a Christian is a gentlewoman. The law of kindness is ever on the lips of the Christian woman. She utters no hasty words. To speak gentle words when you feel irritated will bring sunshine into your heart, and will make your path more smooth. A school girl, in answer to a question, said, \"Meek people are those who give soft answers to rough questions.\" Christ says, \"Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.\" They will be fit subjects for the kingdom of heaven, because they are willing to be taught.",
