    "word": "If a boy of mental abilities, as George Warren; would surrender his heart to Christ, this would be his salvation. His intellect would, by the means of pure religion, be brought into a healthy channel. His mental and moral powers would grow vigorously and harmoniously. The conscience illuminated with divine grace, would be quick and pure, controlling the will and desires, leading to frankness and uprightness in every act of life. Without the principles of religion this boy will be cunning, artful, sly, in an evil course, and will poison all he associates with. I warn all the youth to beware of this young man, if he continues to slight religion and the Bible. You cannot be too guarded in his society.",
