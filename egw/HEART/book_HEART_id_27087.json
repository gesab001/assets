    "word": "I think that in watching and accusing us, you were both engaged in the same work as were the Pharisees in accusing Christ. They watched to catch Him in His words or to find something in His actions that they could use as an occasion against Him. As Christ said to them, I say to you, \"Ye strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.\" Set your poor, proud hearts right, and you will have so great a work to do you will feel that you have nothing to do in accusing your brethren and sisters. I do not think the best way to glorify God in observing the Sabbath is to go to bed and sleep away the sacred hours.",
