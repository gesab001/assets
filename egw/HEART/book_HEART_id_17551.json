    "word": "The Sabbath school work is important, and all who are interested in the truth should endeavor to make it prosperous. Brother ----- could have served well in this branch of the work had he and others in the church pursued a right course. But he has been praised and petted too much. It has nearly ruined him. The Lord can do without him, but he cannot afford to do without God. The Lord will entrust His work to men with clean hands and a pure heart; therefore it is an honor to bear responsibilities in His cause.",
