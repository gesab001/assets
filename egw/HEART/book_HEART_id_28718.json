    "word": "\"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ\" [verse 6]. How are we to get it? We are to be God's witnesses and reflect the character of Christ in our character. There is no use for a man to be low and sensual, with his mind on sensual things, and yet think he can reveal the knowledge of God that is Jesus Christ. He must have the grace of God in his own heart and practice it in his life.",
