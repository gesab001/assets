    "word": "From the heart of the work an influence is carried, even by some who are called foreign missionaries, that is not pleasing to God. Many are not emptied of self, that are not vessels unto honor. If they had never had a connection with men who were unsanctified they would have done far better work; but the principles they have woven into the character are not an acceptable kind to God, and He will not minister of His grace to the spirit they cherish. Then how can they be lights to the world: How can they be laborers together with God? How can they be called lightbearers? The maxims \n                                                                           214\nof the world have been woven with the precious truth of God. Men are deceived in every department and branch of the work, because of their own selfish desires, their selfish plans; for their hearts are not imbued with the spirit of Christ. The example of Christ is lost sight of. Many are unable to clearly distinguish between the truths of God and the frauds of men, and no plat of their religious experience stands forth entirely weeded from the noxious tares of selfishness. Many profess to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, but selfish purposes and projects actually shut out the view of the eternal realities, and the world is not slow to discern its own standard. I have been shown that many make pretense of godliness scorning the too apparent inconsistencies, yet at the same time encouraging themselves in putting God out of their knowledge. Men barter and haggle for little or large advantage as the circumstances may be, and in so doing they barter away their security to the kingdom of God. They value that kingdom less than did Judas his Lord.",
