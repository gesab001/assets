    "word": "I thought best to change the exercise and I asked those who had never surrendered their hearts to God and those who were being overcome with temptation to come forward. There were eight seats occupied. Some bore testimony of their needs before a season of prayer. The Lord indited prayer. Brethren Goodrich and A. T. Robinson prayed with great fervor. The Lord gave me freedom in prayer and the blessing of the Lord rested upon myself and many others. The pain of heart left me and the peace of the Lord took possession of my heart. Thank the Lord.",
