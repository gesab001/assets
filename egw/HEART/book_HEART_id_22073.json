    "word": "Obstacles to the Work. \n\n     After these things were spoken, I heard men conversing together in a discouraging way. Poverty was, they thought, the greatest obstacle to the advancement of the work. Their words were more negative than positive, expressing little faith, hope, or courage. All admitted that the field was a hard one, to be worked with so little means, and so few workers. Then the Teacher said that these were not the most disheartening features; the most weighty difficulty is, that unless imbued with the Spirit of God, you will be inclined to allow your natural temperament to shape the work, and will leave Jesus out of the conflict. You have neglected to cherish love for one another, and it has not been strengthening in the heart. Criticism is the school in which some have been educated. Who are feeling a burden to come into perfect unity? Who will deny self, and make any and every sacrifice of your own ideas and preferences, that you may be in harmony with your brethren? It is the lack of the grace of the Holy Spirit, which makes the professed followers of Christ so decided and unyielding, so determined to please themselves.",
