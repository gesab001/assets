    "word": "Those who gave, also erred, not being particular to inquire into the necessities of the case, whether there was actual need or not. Those who had means were thrown into great perplexity. One brother was much hurt by too much means being put into his hands. He did not study economy; but lived extravagantly, and in his travels laid out money here and there to no profit. He spread a wrong influence by making such free use of the Lord's money, and would say to others, and in his own heart, There is means enough in Jackson, more than can be used before the Lord \n                                                                           12\ncomes. Some were very much injured by such a course, and came into the truth with wrong views, not realizing that it was the Lord's money they were using, and not feeling the worth of it. And I saw that these poor souls who have just embraced the third angel's message, and have had such an example set before them, will have much to learn, to deny self, and suffer for Christ's sake. They will have to learn to give up their ease, and cease studying their convenience and comfort, and bear in mind the worth of souls. Those who feel the \"woe\" upon them will not be for making great preparations and fixings outwardly, to travel in ease and comfort. Those who have no calling have been encouraged into the field. Others have been affected by these things, and have not felt the need of economy, of denying themselves, and putting into the treasury of the Lord. They would feel and say, \"There are others who have means enough; they will give for the paper. I need not do anything. The paper will be supported without my help.\"",
