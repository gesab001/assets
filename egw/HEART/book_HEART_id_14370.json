    "word": "When God commanded Moses to do anything, he did it without stopping to consider what the consequences might be. He gave God credit for wisdom to know what he meant and firmness of purpose to mean what he said; and therefore Moses acted as seeing the Invisible. God is not seeking for men of perfect education. His work is not to wait while his servants go through such wonderfully elaborate preparations as our schools are planning to give; but the Lord wants men to appreciate the privilege of being laborers together with God,--men who will honor him by rendering implicit obedience to his requirements, regardless of previously inculcated theories. There is no limit to the usefulness of those who put self to one side, make room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon their hearts, and live lives wholly sanctified to the service of God, enduring the necessary discipline imposed by the Lord without complaining or fainting by the way. If they will not faint at the rebuke of the Lord, and become hard-hearted and stubborn, \n                                                                           121\nthe Lord will teach both young and old, hour by hour, day by day. He longs to reveal his salvation to the children of men; and if his chosen people will remove the obstructions, he will pour forth the waters of salvation in abundant streams through the human channels.",
