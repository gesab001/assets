    "word": "Those who do not walk in all faith and purity find the thought of coming into the presence of God a thought of terror. They do not love to think or speak of God. They say in heart and by their actions, \"Depart from us, O God; we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.\" But through faith in Christ the true Christian knows the mind and will of God. He understands by a living experience something of the length and depth and breadth and height of the love of God that passeth knowledge.",
