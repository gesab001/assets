    "word": "There is much that needs to be set in order in every institution that is in operation in our world. Finite men are not to make themselves lords, and seek to govern men's minds and principles, when their own minds and their own principles are very shaky. This uncertainty is being communicated to the churches by men in prominent positions. Unbelief goes in the very atmosphere. Everything is to be shaken that can be shaken, that those things that cannot be shaken may remain. All who truly love Jesus Christ will now stand enlisted under his banner, eager to magnify his name and accomplish his will. Every opportunity is given in an open field, for the manifestation of love and loyalty. There is nothing that Christ hungers and thirsts for so much as whole-hearted disciples, possessing his love and gentleness. Who, I ask, will in these days of approaching peril, when the faith of every one is to be severely tested, comprehend through the Holy Spirit's teaching, the design of God to win all the ability, all the God-entrusted endowments of Christ, to the service of the Prince of Peace? Who will extend the work of God to all places where souls are ignorant of the light? In the cities of America, as well as in foreign countries, a great work is to be done. God calls for cheerful co-workers, and they are not to be repressed, discouraged, and disheartened by counterworking agencies, who themselves refuse to be worked by the Holy Spirit of God. God's ministers are in service to God.",
