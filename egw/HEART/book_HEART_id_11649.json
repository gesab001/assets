    "word": "PRAYER FOR GOD\u2019S GUIDANCE MAY BE OFFERED ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.\u2014There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer up a petition to God. There is nothing that can prevent us from lifting up our hearts in the spirit of earnest prayer. In the crowds of the street, in the midst of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God and plead for divine guidance, as \n224\ndid Nehemiah when he made his request before King Artaxerxes. A closet of communion may be found wherever we are. We should have the door of the heart open continually and our invitation going up that Jesus may come and abide as a heavenly guest in the soul.\u2014(Steps to Christ, 99.)",
