    "word": "Let everyone feel that this school in Lodi is to be an example of what all our schools should be. That this may be so, let the students remember that their conduct must be of the right order. The older students especially should feel that upon them rests this responsibility to maintain for themselves a high standard of propriety, that they may exert an influence for good over those who are younger. What a blessing would result if, when they see another student doing something wrong, they would say to him, \"That is not right. You cannot be happy if you pursue such a course as that,\" and then talk to him kindly. The Spirit of the Lord would manifest His presence in their hearts, and old and young would be restrained from doing wrong actions.",
