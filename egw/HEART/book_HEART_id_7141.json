    "word": "At 3 p.m. we arrived in Frederickshaven, and were glad to step off the boat, and to feel solid ground again beneath our feet. It was a welcome \n222\nchange to our compartment in the car, and the gentle, gliding motion of the train. We lay down upon the seats, and cared only to enjoy the luxury of rest. We were sleeping soundly when at three in the morning the cars stopped, and the guard informed us that we had reached the borders of Germany, and must all pass through the custom-house. It was bitterly cold, and Bro. Kellogg went to the officers and asked permission for the ladies to remain in the car, stating that one of them was ill, and must not be disturbed. But no, nothing would avail; sick or well, we must all appear for inspection. Two officials came to the car door, and the other ladies of the party at once started to leave the car, but they had only stepped on the platform when the officers said, \u201cThat is enough; you can go back.\u201d But they were not fully satisfied about the reputed sick woman. As I lay covered with shawls and blankets, they evidently suspected that I might be a bundle of dry goods which our party were trying to smuggle into Germany. As the officers again came to the door, flashing the bright light of their lanterns into the compartment, I quickly sat up and said, \u201cHere I am, gentlemen, please look, and see that I am a living woman.\u201d I do not know whether they understood my words, but they burst into a hearty laugh, said in German, \u201cAll right,\u201d and left us to compose ourselves to sleep again if we could after this untimely interruption.",
