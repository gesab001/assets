    "word": "Let superintendents and teachers inquire, Do I believe the Word of God? Am I giving myself to Him who hath given Himself for me, suffering a cruel death upon the cross, that I might not perish \n50\nbut have everlasting life? Do we believe that Jesus is drawing the souls of those around us, even those who are living in impenitence and do not respond to His drawing power? Then, in contrition of soul, say: \u201cMaster, I will draw with all my powers of influence, I will draw unto Thee. I trust in Thee and in Thee alone to touch and subdue the heart by the power of the Holy Spirit.\u201d\u2014S. S. W., January, 1892.",
