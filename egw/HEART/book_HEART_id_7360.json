    "word": "The home is to be a school in which children are to be trained for the higher school. The father and mother should make the decision, \"I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. . . . I will walk within my house with a perfect heart\" (Psalm 101:2). . . . Parents are the first teachers of their children, and by the lessons that they give, they, as well as their children, are being educated. As parents consecrate themselves, body, soul, and spirit, to the doing of their God-given work, the Lord will teach them precious lessons, giving them wise words to speak and helping them to show patience and forbearance under provocation. . . .",
