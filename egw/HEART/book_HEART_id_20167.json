    "word": "Every soul who is saved must surrender his own plans, and follow where Christ leads the way. The understanding must be yielded up to Christ for Him to cleanse and refine and purify.

We need to enter into His purpose, and to carry out His will, saying with the whole heart, \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" . . .",
