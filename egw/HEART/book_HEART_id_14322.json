    "word": "The authors of these books, which have sowed the seeds of doubt and infidelity broadcast over the world, have been under the training of the great enemy of God and man, the acknowledged head of principalities and powers, the ruler of the darkness of this world. The word that God has spoken concerning them is, They \"became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools;\" \"because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful.\" They rejected divine truth in its simplicity and purity for the wisdom of this world. Whenever books by these infidel authors are given the precedence, and the word of God is made secondary, a class of students will be sent out of the schools no better fitted for the service of God than they were before they received their education.",
