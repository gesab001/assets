    "word": "We are told that \"whoso offereth praise glorifieth God.\" How much do we glorify God by our praises? We frequently hear the expression, \"I am so sorry.\" Have we not heard enough sorry stories? Let us tell some stories that will uplift and bring cheer and courage. Let us tell what it means to be an overcomer. With the sunshine of heaven in our hearts, let us praise and glorify God. Let there be no quarrelling among us, no differences. With sanctified lips and tongues, let us sing the praises of God, even though we may feel discouraged.",
