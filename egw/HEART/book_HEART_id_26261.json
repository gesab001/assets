    "word": "Near Kansas City, Missouri, 1884--We had a very pleasant season with our brethren, then were taken in the hack back to depot. From this point we had a dusty time; could not sleep well. The smoke from the engine was blown \n\n\n                                    -146- \n\nback and it was very strong and throat and lungs were severely affected with this coal smoke. But all this is over. We are at Edson's. He is pleasantly situated in a location separate from other houses and standing high and dry. The location is every way better then the one they had before. I cannot write all I would be pleased to write, for I am not feeling [as if I had] much life and energy. I had a severe pain in my heart yesterday. Today my hip troubles me considerably.--Letter 49, 1884, p. 2. (To Children, August 10, 1884.)",
