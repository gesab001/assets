    "word": "I am afraid that we do not always appreciate the blessings that God gives us. We pass by the blessed tokens of His goodness and love, and look upon His special providences as common occurrences, and scarcely make mention of them. We do not place them in memory's hall, and reflect glory to Him who hath done abundantly for us. Oh that the Lord will give us thankful hearts, that we may praise Him, and be joyful in God. I hope to hear from you as soon as possible after you reach South Africa.",
