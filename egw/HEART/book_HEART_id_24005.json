    "word": "Sister Daniels loves dress. She is weak on this point. She desires to see her children arrayed according to the customs of a fashionable world. The word of God has specified how Christians should dress, and parents are to see that his directions are carried out rather than \n\n\n                         [14] \n\nthe wishes of their children. God will hold parents accountable for sowing seeds of vanity in the hearts of their little ones. Paul writes concerning the dress of women, saying: \"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array, but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.\" \"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\"",
