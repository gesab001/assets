    "word": "If those connected with the work of God will not hear His voice and do His will, they should be separated \n                                                                           53\nentirely from the work. God does not need the influence of such men. I speak plainly; for it is time that things were called by their right name. Those who love and fear God with all the heart are the only men that God can trust.
