    "word": "28. Jesus wants you now to realize your deficiencies while mercy lingers, that you may turn unto him with your whole heart, and be supplied out of his abundant fulness, so that you shall be perfect, wanting in nothing. \"And prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Mark it, this is not man that is addressing you, but the Lord of hosts. Will you hear him? Will you obey him? \"If I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.\"",
