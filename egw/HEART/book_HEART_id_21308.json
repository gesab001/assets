There should be interspersed with the prophecies, practical lessons of the teachings of Christ. There should ever be the softening, subduing influence of the Spirit of God upon our own heart. The self-denial and the sufferings of Christ should be brought into our labors, and the great love wherewith He has loved us appear in all our efforts.--Lt 48, 1886.",
