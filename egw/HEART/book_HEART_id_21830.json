    "word": "The Lord desires you to be soul winners; therefore, while you should not force doctrinal points upon the people, you should \"be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear\" (1 Peter 3:15). Why fear? Fear lest your words should savor of self-importance, lest unadvised words be spoken, lest the words and manner should not be after Christ's likeness. Connect firmly with Christ, and present the truth as it is in Him. Hearts cannot fail to be touched by the story of the atonement.",
