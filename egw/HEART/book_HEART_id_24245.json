And your example would have shown that you considered the truth you profess of that importance that your affections and heart could go only where the image of Christ was discernible. Christ now says to you, -----, Which will you have, me, or the world? Here is your decision to be made. Will you follow the promptings of the unsanctified heart? turn away from self-denial for Christ's sake? step over the cross without lifting it? or will you lift that cross, heavy though it may be, and make some sacrifice for the truth's sake? May God help you to see where you are, that you may place a true estimate upon eternal things.
