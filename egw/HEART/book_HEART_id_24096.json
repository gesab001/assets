    "word": "I would admonish Bro. Wales to be less earnest and forward in searching out the faults of others. \"Let him that is without sin, cast the first stone.\" I counsel you and your son Willie, to take a more humble position. Examine your own hearts and lives, and then ask yourselves if you would be willing to have others set upon your track as you have hunted the steps of Bro. Bell. Look well to your own path. \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" You have earnest work to do for your own souls. If this remains undone, you will be left outside the gates of the city of God.",
