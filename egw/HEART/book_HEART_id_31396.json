    "word": "My dear brethren and sisters, all the money we have is the Lord\u2019s. I now appeal to you, in the name of the Lord, to unite in carrying to successful completion enterprises that have been undertaken in the counsel of God and that are waiting for their portion of the $150,000 fund which has been called for by the General Conference Committee. Let not the work on the Nashville Sanitarium and the Takoma Park Sanitarium be hindered for lack of means. Let not the work of rebuilding at Huntsville be made difficult and burdensome because the necessary means is withheld. Let not those who are struggling to build up the other enterprises, great and small, that are needing the promised aid, become disheartened because we are slow to unite in making up the fund that is asked for. Let all our people arise, and see what they can do. Let them show that there is unity and strength among Seventh-day Adventists.",
