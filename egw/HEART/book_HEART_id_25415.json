    "word": "Immorality and ignorance prevail in our world; but it is because the carnal heart chooses darkness rather than light. The light shines from the written word in bright, clear rays; and if ignorance now exists, it is because men do not for themselves become diligent students of the pages of knowledge that they may become intelligent. The intelligent mind is one of heaven's most precious gifts. It is beyond estimate. And God demands of us the full improvement of this entrusted talent.--Ms 57, 1897, p. 2.
