    "word": "A single unrighteous act of will, or bitterness, envy, jealousy, or evil surmising will quench the Spirit of God and banish from your heart true happiness. One emotion of hatred or ill will or of revenge, or an evil act or word toward one whom Christ calls \"the least of these My brethren,\" gives Satan the advantage over you, makes you a transgressor of God's law, and will surely destroy the peace of the soul, and will stand as an act done to Jesus Christ in the person of His saints.",
