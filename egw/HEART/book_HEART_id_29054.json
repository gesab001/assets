    "word": "\"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\" Those who are brought into covenant relation with God are pledged to speak of Him in the most respectful, reverential manner. Many refer to God and mention His name in their religious conversation much as they would mention a horse or any other common creature. This dishonors God. By precept and example parents should educate their children on this point, lest by irreverence they grieve away God's Spirit from their hearts and the hearts of their children.",
