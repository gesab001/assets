    "word": "The human heart has never been in harmony with the requirements of God. Human reasoning has ever sought to evade or set aside the simple, direct instructions of his word. Those precepts which enjoin self-denial and humility, which require modesty and simplicity in conversation, deportment, and apparel, have, in every age, been disregarded, even by the majority of those who \n93\nprofessed to be followers of Christ. The result has ever been the same, \u2014 the adoption of the fashions, customs, and principles of the world.",
