    "word": "I gave myself to Jesus when I was not as old as you now are. I sought my Saviour with my whole heart; and how deeply I regretted that I had not before yielded my will, that I might be drawn to Christ. I found peace in Jesus, believing that He heard my prayers, and that He would do in my behalf just what He had promised in His word, \"Those that seek Me early shall find Me.\" (Proverbs 8:17.) I laid my Bible open before the Lord and said, \"There Lord, is Thy pledged word, 'him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out' (John \n\n\n                                    -213- \n\n6:37). 'Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you' (Luke 11:9).\"",
