    "word": "Accountable to God--Let every one who sits in council and committee meetings write in his heart the words, I am working for time and for eternity; and I am accountable to God for the motives that prompt me to action.  Let this be his motto.  Let the prayer of the psalmist be his prayer: \"Set a watch O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.  Incline not my heart to any evil thing.\" Psalm 141:3, 4.--Testimonies, Vol. 7, pp. 258, 259.",
