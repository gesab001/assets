You have so long studied your pleasure, that you are disqualified to benefit those around you. You \n                                                                           24\nneed to discipline yourself. Take time for self-examination to bring all your powers in subjection to the mind and will of God. You need secret discipline of your affections which is so important in order that even the thoughts may be brought into subjection. You are shut up to self. It is the privilege of every true Christian to exert an influence for good upon the character of every one with whom they associate.",
