    "word": "I have evidence that the Lord impresses the hearts of those who read what is written in Vol. IV concerning those scenes of thrilling interest, --the things that are, and that shall be. And if those who claim to believe the third angel's message would carefully and prayerfully read the important, solemn truths that relate to this time, as presented in Vol. IV and would give heed to them, they would be led to search the Scriptures more earnestly and prayerfully, and would better comprehend the word of God, and the trying scenes just before us. \n                             (Signed) Ellen G. White. \n                                                                           664",
