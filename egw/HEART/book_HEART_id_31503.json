Did his brethren kneel down and seek the Lord in his behalf, making his case their own? There are souls to be saved everywhere, but he did not have courage to work, because he had fallen into debt. He needed a brother, with the Elder Brother's heart of sympathy and humanity, to touch his heart of humanity.
