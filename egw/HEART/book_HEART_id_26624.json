    "word": "\"These things will bear your consideration. Jesus found no place for the precious lessons He came to the world to give to those who would receive them. He represented the situation of the Scribes and Pharisees by old, dried-up skin bottles, that could not hold the new wine of His kingdom; and He had to make the bottles into which He could put the new wine. He found a place for His truth in the heart of a Samaritan woman, and she a sinner. He made a bottle for the wine of His kingdom when He called Matthew, the publican. He made bottles into which He could pour the new wine when He called the fishermen.\"",
