    "word": "Elder Olsen and Willie stepped on board the small boat, and through some misunderstanding went off before we stepped aboard. Emily felt much disappointed. I never saw her so unbalanced. She cried heartily and I felt so sorry on her account. The mate entered into conversation with her and told her that the boat would come to the steamer again before it went to the wharf, then he said much the same as the stewardess had said in regard to the wickedness of the sailors and the crew. He said, \"I have been much impressed that this boat will go down with all hands on board ere long. I have felt so strongly exercised that I shall not, if I can possibly disconnect from it, continue to remain on the boat.\" [E. G. WHITE POSTSCRIPT: \"THIS NICE BOAT WENT DOWN, SUNK WITH ALL ON BOARD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO, IN A FEW WEEKS AFTER THIS. THE MATE WAS ONE THAT WAS SAVED. THE STEWARDESS-NURSE WAS ADVERTISED AMONG THE LIST OF THE LOST.\"]",
