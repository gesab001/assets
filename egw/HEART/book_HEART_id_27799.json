    "word": "Please read carefully Revelation 3:15-18. The voice of Jesus Christ is heard. \"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore [not half-hearted], and repent. Behold, I [your Saviour] stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcome, and am set down with My Father in His throne\" [Revelation 3:19-21]. \n\n\n                                   -176-",
