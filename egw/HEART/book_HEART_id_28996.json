    "word": "Here is faithfully portrayed our religious obligations to one another. The test and measurement of genuine religious experience and sanctification through the truth is clearly defined. Our course of action on all occasions must be fashioned after the divine pattern. The teaching of the Word is clear and explicit in regard to the love we should cultivate one for another. The love of Christ in the heart will be like the leaven. The grand truths of the Bible are to be our bread for spiritual life. The leaven of truth, through its life-giving power, brings all that there is of mind and soul and strength into complete harmony with the divine life.",
