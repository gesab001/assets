    "word": "The Lord \u201cdoth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.\u201d Lamentations 3:33. \u201cLike as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.\u201d Psalm 103:13, 14. He knows our heart, for He reads every secret of the soul. . . . He knows the end from the beginning. Many will be laid away to sleep before the fiery ordeal of the time of trouble shall come upon our world. . . .",
