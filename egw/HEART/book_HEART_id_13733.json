    "word": "Let us strive with all the power that God has given us to be among the hundred and forty-four thousand (RH March 9, 1905).  {7BC 970.10}  \n     9 (chs 3:5; 19:7-9; John 12:12, 13). The Palms and the Robes.--The palms signify that they have gained the victory, and the white robes that they have been clothed with the righteousness of Christ. Thank God that a fountain has been opened to wash our robes of character, and make them as white as snow (Und. MS 23).  {7BC 970.11} \n     14. See EGW on chs. 3:18; 19:7-9; Matthew 22:11, 12.  {7BC 970.12} \n     17. See EGW on ch. 22:1, 2; Romans 11:33.  {7BC 970.13}\n \n                            Chapter 8 \n\n     3, 4 (Isaiah 1:18; Hebrews 9:13, 14; see EGW on Romans 8:26, 34; Hebrews 7:25). Prayers Made Fragrant by Christ's Merit.--As the high priest sprinkled the warm blood upon the mercy seat while the fragrant cloud of incense ascended before God, so, while we confess our sins and plead the efficacy of Christ's atoning blood, our prayers are to ascend to heaven, fragrant with the merits of our Saviour's character. Notwithstanding our unworthiness, we are to remember that there is One who can take away sin, and who is willing and anxious to save the sinner. With His own blood He paid the penalty for all wrongdoers. Every sin acknowledged before God with a contrite heart, He will remove [Isaiah 1:18; Hebrews 9:13, 14 quoted] (RH Sept. 29, 1896). \n                                                                           971\n {7BC 970.14} \n     (Ch. 5:8; Psalm 141:2;  1:29; Ephesians 5:2.) Incense Represents Blood of Atonement.--[Revelation 8:3, 4 quoted.] Let the families, the individual Christians, and the churches bear in mind that they are closely allied to heaven. The Lord has a special interest in His church militant here below. The angels who offer the smoke of the fragrant incense are for the praying saints. Then let the evening prayers in every family rise steadily to heaven in the cool sunset hour, speaking before God in our behalf of the merits of the blood of a crucified and risen Saviour.",
