    "word": "Southampton, England, July 10, 1887. Elder Haskell spoke in forenoon. Not many outsiders present. In the afternoon had a much larger number out. I spoke to the people at 5:00 p.m. \"Let not your heart be troubled,\" etc. The Lord helped me to speak, else I could not have done so. . . . The people listened with attention. One lady came and spoke to me requesting an interview with me, for which a time was set.--Ms 36, 1887, pp. 1, 2, 4-6. (\"Third Visit to England,\" Diary, June 29-July 10, 1887.)",
