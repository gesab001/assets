Dear Sister:- \n     We have come to this beautiful place from the Los Angeles camp-meeting, where I spoke six times in the large tent to a congregation of about two thousand. The last Sabbath of the meeting the tent was especially crowded. In order to speak so that all could hear I was obliged to take very deep inspirations, and that night I suffered with severe pain in my chest and around my heart, caused by inhaling the impure air of the crowded tent.",
