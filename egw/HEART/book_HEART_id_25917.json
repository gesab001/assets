    "word": "As Jehovah, the supreme Ruler, God could not personally communicate with sinful men, but He so loved the world that He sent Jesus to our world as a revelation of Himself. \"I and My Father are one,\" Christ declared. No man knoweth \"the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him\" (Matthew 11:27). And Christ is also the revealer of the hearts of men. He is the exposer of sin. By Him the characters of all are to be tested. To Him all judgment has been committed, \"because He is the Son of man.\"",
