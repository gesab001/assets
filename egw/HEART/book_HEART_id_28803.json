    "word": "The law cannot save you, but it is the standard of character, and to represent the character of Jesus Christ you must live the law, for He lived the law in our world. Paul says, \"I have taught them from house to house, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (See Acts 20:20, 21.) This is the way. We behold Him for the perfection of His character and then we see the defects in our own character. Do you stand before God and say, \"Cleanse us and change us\"? You should flee to Jesus Christ and lay hold of the divine merits of the Son of God, and then you are washed from the defilements and stains of sin. There is not a stain in the character because God is enthroned in the heart and Christ does not war against Christ. Christ does not war against the Father. \"I and the Father are one.\" He was in the express image of the Father's person, and we want to express the character of Jesus Christ.",
