    "word": "The Ruler of the universe has protested against the greed of the natural heart, saying, \"He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent\" [Proverbs 28:20]. God records them as guilty of fraud and transgression. \"Nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy\" [1 Timothy 6:17]. \"Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure\" [Leviticus 19:35]. \"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life\" [Proverbs 22:4]. \"Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee\" [Hebrews 12:5]. \"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, not he that loveth abundance with increase\" [Ecclesiastes 5:10]. He who says to gold, \"Thou art my confidence\" [Job 31:24], shall find himself \"pierced through with many sorrows\" [1 Timothy 6:10]. \"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" [Mark 8:36].",
