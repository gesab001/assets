    "word": "If Christ does not abide in the hearts of the parents, the children will be filled with selfishness, and the door of their hearts will ever be opened to evil things. Let the conversation at the family board be such as is calculated to leave a fragrant influence on the minds of the children. The parents walk directly contrary [to the counsels] of God brought to His people by men whom He has chosen. Even when quite young, children notice, and if the parents show that the Word of God is not their guide and counsellor, if they disregard the messages brought to them, the same reckless spirit of, \"I don't care; I will have my own way,\" will be shown by the children.",
