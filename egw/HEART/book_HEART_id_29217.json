    "word": "I have no liberty to withhold any longer the matters that I have written. There is so much that must be brought out. And yet I say unto you, as I have said many times before, I have an intense desire that you shall show by your words of confession and by your actions that you will now make thorough work for repentance. Let the plowshare of truth go deep and thorough into your heart. Do not surface work; for God will not accept superficial promises. The Lord Jesus reaches out His hand once more to you, and He will not be trifled with. You have a work to do. Cease your underhand work, which show that you would spoil the work of God. If you will repent, and be converted, the Lord will have mercy upon you. \n\n\n                            -122-",
