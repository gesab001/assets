    "word": "There is a cause for the great weakness in our churches, and that cause it is hard to remove. It is self. Men have none too much will, but they must \n\n\n                                     -226- \n\nhave it wholly sanctified to God. They need to fall on the Rock and be broken. Self must be crucified in everyone who shall enter the gates of the city of God. The fierce spirit which rises up in the hearts of some in the church when anything does not please them, is the spirit of Satan, and not the spirit of Christ. Is it not fully time that we return to our first love, and be at peace among ourselves? We must show ourselves to be not only Bible readers, but Bible believers. If we are united to Christ, we shall be united to one another. (See John 13:34; Romans 15:1-5.)",
