    "word": "Taught of God \n\n     The youth will not become weak-minded or inefficient by consecrating themselves to the service of God. To many, education means a knowledge of books; but \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" The youngest child who loves and fears God is greater in His sight than the most talented and learned man who neglects the matter of personal salvation. The youth who consecrate their hearts and lives to God are placing themselves in connection with the Fountain of all wisdom and excellence.",
