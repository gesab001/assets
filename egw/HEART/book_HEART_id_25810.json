    "word": "In order to do this work there must be schools similar to the schools of the prophets to educate in the Word of God, to shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto the more ungodliness. This Scripture [2 Timothy 2:14, 15] is directly to the point. Those books which may contain some truth, but are intermingled with vain babblings, should not be placed in the student's hands, for they are seed sown in the human heart which in time of temptation will spring into life and lead the minds of students into paths that will lead away from God, away from truth into ungodliness. Attention should be given to the matter of keeping a pure line of study before teachers as well as scholars, for \"their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.\" (2 Timothy 2:17, 18.)--Ms 16, 1897, pp. 4, 5, 9, 10.
