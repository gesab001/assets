    "word": "\"If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love\" (John 15:10). This is the yoke which Christ invites us to wear--the yoke of obedience. Can we not say, \"Lord, I take Thee at Thy word; I receive Thy promise. I come to Thee because I need Thee as a personal Saviour. I must have an abiding Christ. I am dependent on Thee. Thou art mine.\" Christ says, \"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them\"--not in pretense, but with the whole mind, heart, soul, and strength--\"he it is that loveth me\" (John 14:21). This is the true test of character. We must be doers of the Word.",
