    "word": "Oh that the power of God may rest upon us before we separate for our homes and fields of labor! Oh that we may consider the importance of improving every day that we may have a good record in heaven! Christ has said, \u201cHe that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\u201d My heart has been made to ache as I have seen some of my brethren considering so seriously whether or not they would make a little sacrifice for Christ's sake. It seems such a great thing in their eyes to deny inclination.",
