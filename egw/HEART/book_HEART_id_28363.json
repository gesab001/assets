    "word": "I presented the invitation, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" [Matthew 11:28-30]. Simple enough, is it not? Thus it appears. The promise is large and far-reaching. Rest for the soul is comprehensive. It implies much. It means deliverance from constant, perplexing, uncertainty. The word rest is repeated--\"I will give you rest.\" In wearing Christ's yoke and learning from Him His meekness and lowliness, \"Ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Here is a giving by Christ, and on our part, an acceptance of the promise, a conscious finding, a sense of relief from all perplexing doubt.",
