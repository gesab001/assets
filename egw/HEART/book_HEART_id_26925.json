    "word": "There is always a danger of taking upon ourselves a work that the Lord has not placed in our hands, and neglecting that which He has given us to do and which would better honor His name. That which to human eyes may appear praiseworthy may not be the very thing God has chosen for us to do. Then let us individually consider the many branches of the work. There are various kinds of missionary work to do. Consider prayerfully what work would best tell for the advancement of the cause of God. If there is a humble, unselfish heart and contrite spirit in seeking to know the Lord's will, He will lead each of us in the path where He would have us walk.",
