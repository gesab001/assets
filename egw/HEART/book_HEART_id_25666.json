    "word": "\"We bowed before God at the commencement of the Sabbath. I \n     commenced to pray and my heart went out after God. I wept and \n     prayed and I felt the consolation of the Spirit of God. Jesus \n     seemed so precious, so very precious to me. I laid all my burdens \n     upon my Saviour and I was relieved.\"--Letter 7, 1876.",
