    "word": "MR No. 1228 - Dependence on God\n\n     [2 Kings 6:15-23, quoted.] \n     When the people of God are brought into strait places, when apparently there is no escape for them, the Lord alone must be their dependence. There is, you think, a need to meet Picton. If you do meet him in controversy, to vindicate the truth, be sure that the Lord identifies His interest with you. Nothing should lead you into debate with men who have no honor for God or for man. Always refuse to enter into such a contest. If the honor of God demands that the truth be vindicated in a discussion, put self out of sight, and let Christ alone appear. Nothing can then befall you as a representative of Christ but that will redound to His name's glory. Open the heart in contrition to God. Do not follow your opponent, but cast the seeds of truth, leaving a present Christ to take care of the question.",
