    "word": "Satan is at work now to make of none effect the truth of God upon human hearts. Will you encourage a man to stand in the sacred desk when God cannot stand by his side? Better, far better, for the man to be working with his hands than standing in the desk; for this religious labor throws a covering of sanctity over the crooked course of action he has taken. Be careful how you extol the man. \n\n\n                          [22] \n\nI know that the course you have taken toward him in the past, soliciting his labors as though he was the only instrument through whom God could work, has had a disastrous influence upon him and placed him where all the reproofs and warnings and counsels of God cannot reach him or have the effect God designed they should have upon his heart and character. The church in Fresno will have something to answer for in the judgment, because, in doing so much for him and making so much of him, you have turned the man's head. Let every man stand for what he is in the sight of God,--a finite man.",
