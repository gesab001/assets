    "word": "The merciful \"shall obtain mercy.\" \"The soul of blessing shall be made fat; and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.\" There is sweet peace for the compassionate spirit, a blessed satisfaction in the life of self-forgetful service for the good of others. The Holy Spirit that abides in the soul, and is manifest in the life, will soften hard hearts, and awaken sympathy and tenderness. You will reap that which you sow.",
