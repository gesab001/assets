    "word": "Mothers who have youthful minds to train and the characters of children to form should not seek the excitement of the world in order to be cheerful and happy.

Those who indulge their disposition to be in company will soon feel restless unless visiting or entertaining visitors. Such have not the power of adaptation to circumstances. The necessary, sacred home duties seem commonplace and uninteresting to them. They have no love for self-examination or self-discipline. The mind hungers for the varying, exciting scenes of worldly life; children are neglected for the indulgence of inclination; and the recording angel writes: \"Unprofitable servants.\" God designs that our minds should not be purposeless, but should accomplish good in this life.",
