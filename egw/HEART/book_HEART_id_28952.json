    "word": "Do not get together and give expression to criticism and questioning in regard to matters you have learned by hearsay. Do not draw within yourselves and work in secrecy and darkness with a select few, giving no words of encouragement, offering no prayer for the blessing of the Lord to rest upon your president. Come right up to help him, talk with him, encourage him. Keep distrust out of your own hearts. Give the man who carries the heavy responsibilities your hearty cooperation. Do not \n\n\n                -77- \n\nmanufacture burdens to perplex his tired brain and wearied nerves.",
