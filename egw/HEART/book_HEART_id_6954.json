    "word": "719. Careful attention and training should be given to the vocal organs. They are strengthened by right use, but become enfeebled if improperly used. Their excessive use will, if often repeated, not only injure the organs of speech, but will bring an undue strain upon the whole nervous system. The delicate harp of a thousand strings becomes worn, gets out of repair, and produces discord instead of melody. . . . It is not necessary to talk in a loud voice or in a high key; this does great injury to the speaker. . . . The human voice is a precious gift of God; it is a power for good, and the Lord wants his servants to preserve its pathos and melody. The voice should be cultivated so as to promote its musical quality, that it may fall pleasantly upon the ear and impress the heart. But the vocal organs are strangely abused, greatly to the injury of the speaker and the discomfort of the hearers.--Sp. T., No. 7, p. 9.",
