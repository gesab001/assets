    "word": "This work needs to be guarded most strenuously. At present time the means from the churches must not be diverted into so many different channels that the treasury is emptied. Our people need to be faithful in paying their tithe, that the ministry may be supported, and the necessary work done in this line. Many more camp-meetings must be held. Efforts are to be put forth for the people all through the camp-meeting. Visiting is to be done. Words in season are to be spoken. Efforts are to be made to make the meetings revival meetings. And after the camp-meetings the work is not to cease. \"Ye have not chosen me,\" Christ said, \"but I have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, He may give it to you. These things I command you, that ye love one another.\" God's servants are to watch and pray, losing no opportunity of speaking a word for Christ or of giving away a paper or a tract. The Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost. Christ's love for souls will fill the heart of the sincere worker. It is a most deplorable thing that any human being should stray from God. Those who have any connection with God will work to help sinners. And there is to be perfect unity among all the workers in God's great moral vineyard.",
