    "word": "I love Jesus. I had things trouble me before I went on the cars. I was afraid the shadow would hang over me all the way; and I could not forbear as I would wake up in the night season, saying over and over, \"I love the Lord; I love the Lord; I know I love Thee; Oh, I love Jesus who gave His life for me. I love the souls of all those for whom Christ has died.\" And thus I feel the sweet comfort of peace and hope and light and love in my heart. Well, let us educate our minds; let us educate our thoughts.",
