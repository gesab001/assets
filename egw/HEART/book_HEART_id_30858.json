    "word": "Students should go as far as possible in thought, training, and intelligent enterprise; but they should never infringe (767) upon a rule, never disregard one principle, that has been interwoven into the upbuilding of the institution. The dropping down is easy enough; the disregard of regulations is natural to the heart inclined to selfish ease and gratification. It is much easier to tear down than to build up. One student with careless ideas may do more to let down the standard, than ten men with all their efforts can do to counteract the demoralizing influence.",
