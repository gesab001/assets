    "word": "The opinions we have received through listening to the traditions of men must not be permitted to bar the way so that we shall not receive the light that requires reformation and transformation. Enter your closets with the Bible in your hand, and there commune with God, having an ear to hear what the Spirit saith unto you. Let your heart be humbled and teachable, softened and subdued by the Holy Spirit. If you find that your former views are not sustained by the Bible, it is for your eternal interest to learn this as soon as possible; for when God speaks in His Word, our preconceived opinions must be yielded up and our ideas brought into harmony with a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Christ said, \"Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.\" With submissive spirit you are to obey the truth at any cost, knowing that the precepts of the Bible are the word of the eternal God.",
