    "word": "Daniel prayed to God, not exalting himself or claiming any goodness: \u201cO Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for Thine own sake, O my God.\u201d This is what James calls the effectual, fervent prayer. Of Christ it is said: \u201cAnd being in an agony He prayed more earnestly.\u201d In what contrast to this intercession by the Majesty of heaven are the feeble, heartless prayers that are offered to God. Many are content with lip service, and but few have a sincere, earnest, affectionate longing after God.\u2014(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, 534.)",
