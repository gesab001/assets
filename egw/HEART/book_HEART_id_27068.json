    "word": "Christ says, \"Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" \"Take My yoke upon you.\" Will we do this? Will we wear the yoke of Christ? Will we be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and daily strive to cultivate humility and childlike simplicity, willing to be the least of all, and the servant of all? Without this spirit our life is not hid with Christ in God. The self-importance which many manifest is exactly opposite to the meekness and lowliness of Christ. Those who think least of self and exalt Jesus most, will be greatest in the kingdom of heaven. \n\n\n                                     -197-",
