    "word": "God holds up before us as a high standard--perfect obedience to His law. Only through obedience, and faith in the Saviour, can we gain eternal life. Christ pitied the fallen race, and gave His life for them, that, through His grace, they might be overcomers, and at last enter the city of God.

Should not the love shown for us awaken in us an earnest desire to bring our lives into conformity to the will of God?",
