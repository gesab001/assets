    "word": "Through self-love, through self-indulgence, the love of Christ is extinguished from the heart. But let us weave Christ into our plans, and let self have far less importance. Let the voices that have been heard so frequently in your councils be heard less frequently, and let Christ, the light, the truth, the way, preside in your midst as your counselor.--Letter 22, 1894, p. 13.
