    "word": "The historic events related in the king's dream were of consequence to him; but the dream was taken from him, that the wise men, by their claimed understanding of mysteries, should not place upon it a false interpretation. The lessons taught in it were given by God for those who live in our day. The inability of the wise men to tell the dream, is a representation of the wise \n                                                                           12\nmen of the present day, who have not discernment and learning and knowledge from the Most High, and therefore are unable to understand the prophecies. The most learned in the world's lore, who are not watching to hear what God says in his word, and opening their hearts to receive that word and give it to others, are not representatives of his. It is not the great and learned men of the earth, kings and nobles, who will receive the truth unto eternal life, though it will be brought to them.",
