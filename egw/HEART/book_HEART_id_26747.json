    "word": "The Lord God is exact and infallible in His comprehension. He understands the working of the human mind, the active principles of the human agents He has formed, just how they will be moved upon by the objects that come before them, and in what manner they will act under every temptation that can try them and in every circumstance in which they are placed. \"The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and He pondereth all his goings\" [Proverbs 5:21]. \"The eyes of the Lord are in every place\" [Proverbs 15:3]. \"He looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heavens\" [Job 28:24]. \"The Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts\" [1 Chronicles 28:9]. He knows the things that \n\n\n                                   -312- \n\ncome into our minds, every one of them. \"Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight; but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do\" [Hebrews 4:13].",
