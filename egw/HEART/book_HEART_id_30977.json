    "word": "Evil Associations to be Shunned \n\n     By association with those who have no faith in God, wrong ideas are imperceptibly insinuated into mind and heart by the masterwork of deception. These prove the ruin of many. Will you choose the association of the irreligious and the disloyal, who are openly transgressing God's law? Will you separate yourselves by your own choice from those who love God? Will you place yourselves as far from the light as possible? This is a way of delusion. You will never be where you will find too much light, but woe to those who choose darkness rather than light.--MS. 74, 1893. \n\n                                               -\n \n\n\n     In this connection see also: \n     F.
