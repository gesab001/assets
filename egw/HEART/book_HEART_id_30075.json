    "word": "We are busily at work to limit our expenses where it is possible, and yet in many things we must broaden if the work advances. One hundred men could labor in Melbourne and suburbs and not interfere with one another, and yet there is not one laborer in this great city. How are the people to be warned in these countries, is the question. What can be done to proclaim the message when we have so little means to work with, and so few workers. If several families who could understand the situation would move to these countries and engage in some business in places where a few are keeping the Sabbath, and do missionary work for Christ's sake, I know that by personal labor and holding a steady influence they could do much good. O that the Lord would stir up the minds of many in America to give themselves to this work! I have tried again and again to place the situation before our people in Battle Creek, but no one responds. There are \n                                                                           1084\nmen in America, who with their industrious habits could make a good living and yet exert an influence to win souls to the truth. I wish I could make some impression on hearts while we remain here that we might persuade them to come for Christ's sake, for the sake of perishing souls for whom Christ has died. We could counsel together, and set in operation plans that would not require a great outlay of means, and yet effect much good. Every one here who can work is at work, but there is so large a territory to be worked, so many that have not yet heard the first sound of the message of warning.",
