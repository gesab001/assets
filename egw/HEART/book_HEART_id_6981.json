    "word": "1011. A sore, sick heart, a discouraged mind, needs mild treatment; and it is through tender sympathy that this class of minds can be healed. The physician should first gain their confidence, and then point them to the all-healing Physician. If their minds can be directed to the Burden-Bearer, and they can have faith that he will have an interest in them, the cure of their diseased bodies and minds will be sure.--T., V. III, p. 184.",
