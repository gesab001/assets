    "word": "As I have seen the course that has been taken for the last two years, I have waited and prayed, and said to my soul. The Lord will set this matter right. But I know that our brethren are not doing their duty. What courage have I to attend camp meetings? What reason have I to hope that my testimony will now be received and respected any more than Vol. IV has been? My experience since the conference at Minneapolis has not been very assuring. I have asked the Lord for wisdom daily, and that I may not be utterly disheartened, and go down to the grave broken-hearted, as did my husband. \n                                 (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
