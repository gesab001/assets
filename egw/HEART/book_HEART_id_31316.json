    "word": "I was instructed that the Lord's will was not fulfilled when the leaders in the office were willing to take such large wages; but how quickly was the bribe taken, how quickly selfishness was manifested. This is greatly at variance with the principles upon which the publishing house was established; and it is not in harmony with the spirit and work of God. There have been serious mistakes made in exalting business above the service and worship of God. Here is where thousands have made shipwreck of faith, and made the greatest possible mistake. The Lord says we are to be \"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" The Lord has left a wide door open for those who would go into his work, but energy must be mingled with another element, with living zeal in the service of God. We must be not only diligent in business, but \"fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" Devotion and piety and godliness must be interwoven with every transaction. Without this in your business, you will commit robbery toward God, while professing to serve him. We see family and home religion neglected, altars broken down, first love abandoned, and the religion of Christ expelled from the soul, to give place to engaging in speculation and business enterprises, and these things are constantly multiplying. Men are leaving God and Heaven out of their calculations, and time spent in searching the heart is considered wasted. The Bible is neglected, and a multitude of cares overbalance the precious truth of God in the heart, and spiritual eyesight is put out. How much men need the heavenly anointing! \n\n\n                         (Signed) Ellen G. White \n\n                                               -",
