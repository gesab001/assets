    "word": "The words, \"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches\" are repeated after these promises, weighty with importance to the children of God. It is for our eternal interest to know and understand what the Spirit saith unto the churches, and we should search carefully for light and knowledge that we may not be in ignorance of what God has commanded and promised in His precious Word. We have souls to be saved or lost, and with the greatest earnestness we should inquire, \"What shall I do in order to obtain eternal life?\" At the best, life is but short, and it is necessary that we should live this short life in harmony with the law of God, which is the law of the universe. We must have ears to hear, and hearts to understand, what the Spirit saith unto the churches.",
