    "word": "Order and Discipline\n     I was shown that ministers of Christ should discipline themselves for the warfare. Greater wisdom is required in generalship in the work of God than is required of the generals engaged in national battles. Ministers of God's choosing are engaged in a great work. They are warring not merely against men, but against Satan and his angels. Wise generalship is required here. They must become Bible students, and give themselves wholly to the work. When they begin to labor in a place, they should be able to give the reasons of our faith, not in a boisterous manner, not with a perfect storm, but with meekness and fear. The power which will convince, is strong arguments presented in meekness and in the fear of God. Able ministers of Christ are required for the work in these last days in peril, \u2014 able in word and doctrine, acquainted with the Scriptures, and understanding the reasons of our faith. I was directed to these scriptures, the meaning of which has not been realized by some ministers: \u201cSanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\u201d \u201cLet your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.\u201d \u201cAnd the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.\u201d [1 Peter 3:15; Colossians 4:6; 2 Timothy 2:24-26.]",
