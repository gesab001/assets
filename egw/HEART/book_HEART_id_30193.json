    "word": "Great principles and minute practice cannot be disconnected in a symmetrical life. Such disconnection misrepresents the religion of Christ, and mars the character. The one class of work is made up of great things, and regulated by the law of God, while in the other, made up of so called little things, the law of God, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor\" is ignored. This sphere of work is left to caprice, subject to variation of feeling, to natural and cultivated tendencies or inclinations; and let me say that these little things, left to impulse, often shamefully neglected, mean much to those who are really affected by the neglect. These neglects cut off a large portion of the life of God from the soul, because the human agent is not in co-operation with God, and thus a large revenue of praise and thanksgiving is prevented from going forth to God from human hearts and human lips. Thus God is robbed of the glory that belongs unto him. Our religion will bless wherever it acts. Let the Christian religion act, \n                                                                           1276\nand it will bless. Wherever it works, there is brightness.",
