    "word": "The Lord is constantly working for us, and our eyes should be opened to understand and to know His ways. We are to come to Him in living faith. His arm is not shortened, that it cannot save; His ear is not heavy, that He cannot hear. It is our iniquities that separate us from God. What we individually need is the living testimony in our souls that we are seeking God with the whole heart, that we are putting from our lives those things which God declares should not be found there. God desires that we shall stand before the world a holy people. Why? Because there is a world to be saved by the light of present truth. As we give to the people the truth that is to call them out of darkness into God's marvelous light, our lives, sanctified by the Spirit of truth, are to bear witness to the verity of the message we proclaim.--Ms 35, 1909, pp. 2, 3.
