    "word": "Many parents who are called the best of men and women are thus educating their children to become transgressors of the law of God, to become inmates of prisons or almshouses. They bring them up with passions unrestrained, tempers ungoverned, and with but little painstaking effort on their part to educate them in moral principle. Could such parents look into the future and see the path into which they are placing the feet of their children, they would come to their senses before it is too late, before the evil that has been left uncorrected has molded and fashioned the character. But they allow them to be controlled by the enemy of man. Satan is their chosen leader. It is while men sleep that the enemy sows his tares in the heart.",
