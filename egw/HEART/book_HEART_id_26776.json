    "word": "There is room in the work of God for all who are filled with the spirit of self-sacrifice. We have a solemn work before us. God is calling for men and women who are consecrated to His work. We need in this country men who \n\n\n                                -398- \n\nhave a solid experience in the things of God, who, when they encounter difficulties, will hold firmly to the work, saying, \"We will not fail nor be discouraged.\" We want men who will strengthen and build up the work, not tear down and seek to destroy that which others are trying to do. We need men and women whom God can work, the fallow ground of whose heart has been broken up.",
