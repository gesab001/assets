    "word": "It is whole-hearted, thoroughly decided men and women who will stand now. Christ sifted His followers again and again, until, at one time, there remained only eleven and a few faithful women, to lay the foundation of the Christian church. There are those who will stand back when burdens are to be borne, but when the church is all aglow,  they catch the enthusiasm, sing and shout, and become  rapturous; but watch them. When the fervor is gone, only a few faithful Calebs will come to the front and display  unwavering principle. These are salt that retains the savor. It is when the work moves hard that the churches develop the true helpers.--Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 130.",
