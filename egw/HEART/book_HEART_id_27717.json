    "word": "Every man must be left free for God to convict and operate upon his heart, that he may obtain an experience for himself, founded in God. Great caution should be preserved lest efforts be made to mold minds and to work their judgment and character to our ideas when God may be moving upon that mind and operating upon it to call forth its powers and develop an individual strength for a special work. Man's hand and man's training and discipline may spoil him for the work God would have him accomplish.",
