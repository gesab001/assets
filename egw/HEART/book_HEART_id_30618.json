    "word": "Men and women are wandering in the mist and fog of error. They want to know what is truth. Tell them; not in high-flown language, but with the simplicity of children of God. Satan is on your track. He is an artful opponent, and the malignant spirit which you meet in your work, is inspired by him. Those whom he controls echo his words. If the vail should be rent away from our eyes, those thus worked would see Satan plying all his arts to win them from the truth. There are those who do not believe in the personality of Satan. These do not oppose his work in their hearts. They are ignorant of his devices.",
