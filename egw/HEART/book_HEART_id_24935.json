White Materials Desired for Use in the Compilation Presenting \"Principles of True Science\"\n\n     Adam and Eve, Made in God's Image.--God is a being, and man was made in His image. After God created man in His image, the form was perfect in all its arrangements, but it had no vitality. Then a personal, self-existing God breathed into that form the breath of life, and man became a living, breathing, intelligent being. All parts of the human machinery were put in motion. The heart, the arteries, the veins, the tongue, the hands, the feet, the perceptions of the mind, the senses, were placed under physical law. It was then that man became a living soul.--Ms 117, 1898.",
