    "word": "The combative armor, the debating spirit, must be laid off. If we would be Christlike we must reach men where they are. True eloquence flows from the lips of the man whose heart is full of the love of God and for his fellow man. The pure heart, loyal and true to God, has veneration for all that comes from God. Christ does not attach Himself to man because it is habit, but because He is merciful and just and righteous. The soul that is purified and refined by the grace of Christ will not be selfish, will not think the sin of licentiousness and earthliness and sensuality a small matter that should be treated with leniency. Spiritual culture brings men into harmony with Jesus Christ, \n\n\n                                     -248- \n\nand the soul that abides in Christ will always be tender, kind, simple but earnest, and inspired with the Spirit of Christ, willing to suffer for Christ's sake or to rejoice for Christ's sake. The words of such are eloquent in their simplicity.",
