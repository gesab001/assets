    "word": "Molding Other Men's Minds--How my heart aches to see presidents of conferences taking the burden of selecting those whom they think they can mold to work with them in the field.  They take those who will not differ with them, but will act like mere machines.  No president has any right to do this.  Leave others to plan; and if they fail in some things, do not take it as an evidence that they are unfitted to be thinkers.  Our most responsible men had to learn by a long discipline how to use their judgment.--Testimonies to Ministers, p. 304.",
