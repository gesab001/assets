    "word": "Those who have subdued, contrite hearts are tenderly regarded by the Lord. \"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones\" [Isaiah 57:15]. Thank the Lord! I praise His name that He does not judge unrighteously. \"His mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation. He hath showed strength with His arm; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich He hath sent empty away\" [Luke 1:50-53]. Read also every verse of the 62nd and 34th Psalms, for they both contain important lessons.",
