    "word": "Many of our ministers have made a great mistake in giving discourses which were wholly argumentative. There are souls who listen to the theory of the \n12\ntruth, and are impressed with the evidences brought out, and then, if a portion of the discourse presents Christ as the Saviour of the world, the seed sown may spring up and bear fruit to the glory of God. But in many discourses the cross of Christ is not presented before the people. Some may be listening to the last sermon they will ever hear, and others will never again be so situated that they can have the chain of truth brought before them, and a practical application made of it to their hearts. That golden opportunity lost, is lost forever. Had Christ and his redeeming love been exalted in connection with the theory of truth, it might have balanced them on his side.",
