    "word": "Pharaoh saw the mighty working of the Spirit of God; he saw the miracles the Lord performed by His servant; but he refused obedience to God\u2019s command. The rebellious king had proudly inquired, \u201cWho is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.\u201d And as the judgments of God fell more and more heavily upon him, he persisted in stubborn resistance. By rejecting light from heaven, he became hard and unimpressible. . . . Those who exalt their own ideas above the plainly specified will of God are saying, as did Pharaoh, \u201cWho is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?\u201d Every rejection of light hardens the heart and darkens the understanding; and thus people find it more and more difficult to distinguish between right and wrong, and they become bolder in resisting the will of God.",
