    "word": "Many of you have hindered the work of God in your own country, as the Pharisees hindered the advancement of the kingdom of Christ when He was in their midst. I saw God looking upon you with displeasure. There might have been an army of Sabbathkeepers in your own country, had you received God's messengers as you should and given them your sympathy, your confidence, and your love. You have not deserved their labors in your midst. You know but little of the discouragements, sadness, and grief you have brought to the hearts of Brethren Andrews and Bourdeau, but especially to that of Brother Andrews, who was placed at a disadvantage because he did not understand your language.",
