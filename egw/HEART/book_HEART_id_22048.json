    "word": "We have increased light. We have a solemn, weighty message to bear to the world, and God designs that his chosen disciples shall have a deep experience, and be endowed with the power of the Holy Spirit. \"The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh at the outward appearance; but the Lord looketh upon the heart.\" This was a lesson that David never forgot, and in his dying testimony to Solomon he said, \"And thou, Solomon my son, know the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off forever.\"",
