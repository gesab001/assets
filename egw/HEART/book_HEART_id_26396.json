    "word": "Do not let depression or discouragement mar your representation of Christ [1 Peter 2:9, quoted.] Then let your light be seen. Educate your heart and lips to speak the praises of God for His matchless love to you. If you will educate your soul to be hopeful and to see the light shining from the cross of Calvary, you will not walk in the shadow, but in the glorious rays of His righteousness. You will see His salvation brought near, and rejoice in the hope of a glorious immortality. As you contemplate the cross, you will realize that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that you should not perish, but have everlasting life. This theme will ever be as fresh manna from heaven. It is indeed sacred and yet is brought so near to us that we can by faith bring it into our practical life. When we have done this, we shall indeed realize that we are \"laborers together with God,\" and in giving all diligence to make our calling and election sure, we are doing our Master's work, for the more consecrated we are, the better we can work to save the souls of those for whom He has given His life.--Letter 24, 1895, pp. 1-9.
