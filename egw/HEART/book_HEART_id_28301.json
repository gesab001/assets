    "word": "Jesus loves His people. It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but when He shall appear, then shall we also appear with Him in glory. Let us open mind and heart to receive the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, and then we can but impart that which we have received. May the Lord bless and strengthen you to labor, for women workers are needed so much. There is a large field for women workers whose hearts are imbued with the Spirit of God. May the Lord bless you is my prayer.--Letter 96a, 1899. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nOctober 25, 1990. Entire Letter.",
