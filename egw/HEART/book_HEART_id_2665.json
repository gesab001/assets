    "word": "\"If any man will come after Me,\" said Jesus, \"let him \n                                                                           140\ndeny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\" Luke 9:23. Let us follow the Saviour in His simplicity and self-denial. Let us lift up the Man of Calvary by word and by holy living. The Saviour comes very near to those who consecrate themselves to God. If ever there was a time when we needed the working of the Spirit of God upon our hearts and lives, it is now. Let us lay hold of this divine power for strength to live a life of holiness and self-surrender.",
