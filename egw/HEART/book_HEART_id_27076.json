    "word": "For a time after the warnings of God are given, if there is shown a careless, heedless disregard, the proving continues. The Lord bears long with the one who chooses his own way, giving him every opportunity to repent. But His judgments will certainly fall on those who go on in hardness of heart. Man may take to himself might, but if that might is opposed to God, and used to forward transgression and injustice, God will certainly punish the transgressor.--Manuscript 151, 1905. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. November 7, 1985. Entire Manuscript.",
