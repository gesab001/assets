    "word": "Existing Evils and their Remedy. \n\n     My heart has been sad as I have seen so little accomplished by our laborers. The members of our churches are not incorrigible; the fault is not so much to be charged upon them as upon their teachers. Their ministers do not feed them. All heaven is actively engaged in the work for man's salvation; the rich gifts of the Holy Spirit are waiting to be given to God's human agents; but the hearts and minds of men are so fully occupied with earthly, sensual things, that there is no room to receive the treasures of grace; and that which they do not receive, they cannot impart to others. Those who are trying to teach others the Bible truth, and are not themselves sanctified through obedience to the truth, are sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.",
