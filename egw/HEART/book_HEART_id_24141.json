    "word": "To be a shepherd is to occupy a very important, responsible position. It is a high and sacred work to feed the flock of God. Bro. Buck, the Lord does not regard you fit to be an overseer of his flock. Had you been learning the lesson of self-government in your religious experience, and had you felt the necessity of elevating your mind, and purifying your heart by sanctification of the Spirit, and bringing all your powers into subjection to the Spirit of God, seeking humility and meekness, you might now be in a position to do good, and to exert an influence which would be elevating and saving.",
