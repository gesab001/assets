    "word": "Those who will now support and build up the truth of God are ranging on one side and are standing with heart to heart, with one mind, with one voice, with one judgment, glorifying God by keeping a united front in defense of the truth which will eventually triumph, while those who will break up and confuse and do not labor to have harmony of purpose and action are verily doing the work of Satan, not the work of God. They feel annoyed because all honor and all praise is not given to their superior judgment. They feel fully capable to grasp in their arms large responsibilities, and to be an independent body under no control. They do not keep the way of the Lord. They are ranged on the other side, ready to say, \"Has not God spoken by us? You take too much upon yourselves.\"",
