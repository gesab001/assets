    "word": "For centuries God bore with the inhabitants of the old world. But at last guilt reached its limit. \"God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart.\" He came out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth, and by a flood cleansed the earth of its iniquity.",
