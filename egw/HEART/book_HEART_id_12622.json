You cherish the idea that you are not appreciated where you are.  I ask you to put away this impression.  Lay off this supposed responsibility to do missionary work in another field.  You have reason to be thankful for the health and strength that is given you; but if you permit yourselves to be unhappy, you disqualify yourselves for the missionary work that you might do at home.  You can be a blessing to each other and to those about you.  Be cheerful and happy right where you are; cultivate the peace of God in your hearts.  Do not be discouraged, but let your words be such as to inspire hope and good cheer, and your influence be of a character to uplift.  May the Lord bless you and guide you, is my prayer.",
