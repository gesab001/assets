    "word": "No longer lay upon the foundation stone, wood, hay and stubble, perishable material which will be burned, but lay thereon gold, silver, and precious stones that will be valuable for all time, and enduring as eternity.  You must love the Lord supremely.  He cannot accept halfhearted service, work that is negligently performed.  His curse is upon all those who do the work of God deceitfully or negligently.  You have been on the losing side.  You have not kept your lamp trimmed and burning.  As you both now stand you cannot indeed be a light to the world in good works.--Letter 23, 1890, p. 9 (Jan. 6, 1890 to Brother Stone).",
