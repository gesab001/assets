    "word": "It is living earnestness that God requires. Ministers may have little learning from books; but if they do the best they can with their talents, if they work as they have  opportunity, if they clothe their utterances in the plainest and most simple language, if they are humble men who walk in carefulness and humility, seeking for heavenly wisdom, working for God from the heart, and actuated by one predominating motive--love for Christ and the souls for whom He has died--they will be listened to by men of even superior ability and talents. There will be a charm in the simplicity of the truths they present. Christ is the greatest teacher that the world has ever known.",
