    "word": "God is represented as weighing all men, their words, their deeds, their motives, that which determines character. \"The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.\" \"Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.\" \"Thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.\" \"All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits.\" Important lessons are suggested to us in these scriptures. There is not a thought or motive in the heart that God is not acquainted with. He sees all as clearly as if it stood out registered in living characters, and He weighs individual motives and actions. \n                                                                           439",
