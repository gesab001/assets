    "word": "God's Love For Us. [John 17:15-23, quoted.] It seems almost too good to believe that the Father can and does love any member of the human family as He loves His Son. But we have the assurance that He does, and this assurance should bring joy to every heart, awakening the highest reverence, and calling forth unspeakable gratitude. God's love is not uncertain and unreal, but a living reality.",
