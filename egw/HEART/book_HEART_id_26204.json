WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IN AMERICA UNDER THE DIRECTION OF GOD IS TO BE DONE IN PLANTING THE STANDARD OF TRUTH, AND BUILDING UP THE WORK IN AUSTRALIA'\" (GC BULLETIN, 1899, P. 131).\n     THE LORD ALWAYS KNOWS HOW TO OVERRULE EVIL FOR GOOD. HE USED ELLEN WHITE TO HELP BUILD A STRONG WORK IN AUSTRALIA.]\n\n     Dear Brother [O. A.] Olsen: . . . I have not, I think, revealed the entire working that led me here to Australia. Perhaps you may never fully understand the matter. The Lord was not in our leaving America. He did not reveal that it was His will that I should leave Battle Creek. The Lord did not plan this, but He let you all move after your own imaginings. The Lord would have had W. C. White, his mother, and her workers remain in America. We were needed at the heart of the work. . . . But the Lord read the hearts of all. There was so great a willingness to have us leave, that the Lord permitted this thing to take place. Those who were weary of the testimonies borne were left without the persons who bore them. Our separation from Battle Creek was to let men have their own will and way, which they thought superior to the way of the Lord.",
