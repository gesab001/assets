    "word": "My brethren, seek the Lord; humble your hearts before Him. I have an intense desire to see you walking in the light, as Christ is in the light. I pray most earnestly for you. But I cannot fail to see that the light God has given me is not favorable to our ministers or our churches. You have left your first love. Self-righteousness is not the wedding garment. A failure to follow the clear light of truth is our fearful danger. The message to the Laodicean church reveals our condition as a people.",
