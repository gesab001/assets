    "word": "You may be successful in heaping up treasure on the earth, for the glory of self; but \"where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\" (Matthew 6:21). Eternal considerations will be made of secondary importance. You may take part in the outward forms of worship; but your service will be an abomination to the God of heaven. You cannot serve God and mammon. You will either yield your heart and put your will on the side of God, or you will give your energies to the service of the world. God will accept no half-hearted service.",
