    "word": "Those who can sever their connection with the Lord's work for some worldly inducement may think they have a degree of interest in the cause of God; but the selfishness and covetousness lurking in the human heart are most powerful passions, and the outcome of the conflict is not a mere conjecture. Unless the soul is daily living upon Christ's flesh and drinking his blood, the godly element will be overcome by the Satanic. Selfishness and covetousness will bear away the victory. A self-confident, independent spirit will never enter into the kingdom of God. It is only those who are partakers with Christ in his self-denial and sacrifice that will be partakers with him in his glory.",
