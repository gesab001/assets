    "word": "It is not safe to trust to physicians who have not the fear of God before them. Without the influence of divine grace, the hearts of men are \"deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.\" Jeremiah 17:9. Self-aggrandizement is their aim. Under cover of the medical profession, what iniquities have been practiced, what delusions supported! The physician may claim to possess great wisdom and marvelous skill, while at the same time his character is abandoned, and his practice contrary to the laws of health. The Lord our God assures us that He is waiting to be gracious; He invites us to call upon Him in the day of trouble.",
