    "word": "If we can preserve the peace and grace of Jesus Christ, we shall go through trial and difficulty without discord, distraction, or division. We should continually cultivate love--love for God, giving Him our supreme devotion, and love for one another, which will bring sunshine into the heart. We will have trials, for we cannot control circumstances, but we have One in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered.",
