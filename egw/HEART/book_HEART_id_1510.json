    "word": "It is now that we must keep ourselves and our children unspotted from the world. It is now that we must wash our robes of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. It is now that we must overcome pride, passion, and spiritual slothfulness. It is now that we must awake, and make determined effort for symmetry of character. \"Today\n191\nif ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.\" Hebrews 4:7. We are in a most trying position, waiting, watching for our Lord's appearing. The world is in darkness. \"But ye, brethren,\" says Paul, \"are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.\" 1 Thessalonians 5:4. It is ever God's purpose to bring light out of darkness, joy out of sorrow, and rest out of weariness, for the waiting, longing soul.",
