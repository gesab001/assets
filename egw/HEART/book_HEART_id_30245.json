    "word": "We are not doing our duty unless we are laborers together with God, working out our own salvation with fear and trembling. As servants of Jesus Christ, we are to place ourselves in the channel of light, doing all that we do to the glory of God. But you have not walked in the light as it has come to you. You have not opened the door of your heart to the knock of Christ. Instead of this you have opened your heart to the agencies which have no connection with God. God calls upon you to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure. This is the principle that must guide all who would be among the redeemed in the kingdom of God.",
