    "word": "I saw that you have a knowledge of the truth and a form of godliness, but the power has been lacking. You have not had faith in God as you should have had, and when you have obtained the victory it has lasted you but a short time. I saw that we must have victory every day and come up steadily. I saw . . . selfishness in your families, and I saw that there has not been true faith in the visions--that some have doubted them and still have not true faith in them, and if they remained where they were they would doubt them still more.
