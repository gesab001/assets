    "word": "The Christian physician occupies a position as responsible as that of the gospel minister, and he should be as fully consecrated to God. Careless words and deportment do great harm. They are a savor of death unto death. But if in your daily life you practice the pure principles of the gospel, your example will be a savor of life unto life. Christ's holy maxims will ever be upon your lips, because they are cherished as a priceless treasure in the heart.",
