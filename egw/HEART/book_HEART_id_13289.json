    "word": "7 (1 Corinthians 3:9; Acts 17:28). Man Under God's Supervision.--The physical organism of man is under the supervision of God; but it is not like a clock, which is set in operation, and must go of itself. The heart beats, pulse succeeds pulse, breath succeeds breath, but the entire being is under the supervision of God. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" In God we live and move and have our being. Each heart-beat, each breath, is the inspiration of Him who breathed into the nostrils of Adam the breath of life,--the inspiration of the ever-present God, the Great I AM (RH Nov. 8, 1898).",
