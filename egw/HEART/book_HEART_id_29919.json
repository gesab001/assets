    "word": "The Lord sent prophets and messages from heaven to save men, but they refused to accept the terms. The Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to flash light into every dark corner of the world, but Satan interposed himself between Christ and men, to shut out the divine communications, as if to crush out all hope from the heart of Omnipotence. In his counsels he set in operation a line of action which caused the humanity to drop out of the hearts of men and the satanic to take possession of them.",
