    "word": "The invitation is gracious, full, and free to all who receive Christ as their personal Saviour. To all such He gives power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe in His name. Christ's dying love is the pledge we bring to the Father for reconciliation with Him, and to all who advance toward Him He gives a hearty welcome. We may take God at His word. There is a oneness between man and his God. Christ is an all-sufficient Saviour. Fallen man may place himself under his Father's protection. The prodigal may be covered with the robe of Christ's righteousness, and given a place at His table.",
