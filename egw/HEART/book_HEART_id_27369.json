    "word": "Now, you can never cure these evils till you see the necessity of subduing and controlling J. G. Matteson. The truth must be planted deep in your own soul first, and then in the souls of others. I want you to be a conqueror; God wants you to be a conqueror; but you are far from this today. You need to be busy and earnest with your own soul. A solemn message is to be given to the world, and you are standing directly in the way of our reaching the hearts of many because all their experience and all their religion centers in their high estimate of yourself. No one can ask you to labor more than you do; but you must have a living connection with God so that you will have His grace to be with you. You must bring religion into your home; religion must regulate your life. The truth must sanctify your words, your thoughts, and your actions. Your faith must produce beauty of soul that will be manifested [in] words and actions, else it will be as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.",
