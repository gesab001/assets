    "word": "The fast-fulfilling signs of the times declare that the great day of the Lord is right upon us. In that day shall it be said of any of us: \"This man was called by God, but he would not hear, he would not give heed. Again and again the Spirit moved upon his heart, but he said, 'Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.' This man saw the Saviour's sacrifice in a beautiful light, but some matter of minor importance came in, and his heart was captivated. . . . Every gracious, heavenly influence was dismissed.\"",
