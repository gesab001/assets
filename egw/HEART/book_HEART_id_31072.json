    "word": "Letters have come to me from Ohio. They have erected a health institution there. Some of our ministers and leading men in Ohio have acted a prominent part in the building of this institution, and now they find that they have no one that is able to run such an institution. There was monied men, I have been told, who would put thousands into this institution, but could not be induced to invest means in our home or foreign missions. I came fresh from Europe, where I had seen fields open before us on every side. Hearts were being softened, and were longing for the truth. Calls were constantly coming from all countries for books and for preachers. All was done that could be done, but there was an empty treasury, and a want of qualified men who had experience to do a good work in wisdom, presenting the truth as it is in Jesus. I attended camp-meetings. I tried to set the condition of things before the people, and besides that, wrote to several for means, either to loan or to donate. One of these returned answer that his means were invested in the Sanitarium in Ohio, and he could do nothing. Of some ten letters that we sent, only one was responded to. Brother Smouse, of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, sent one hundred dollars.",
