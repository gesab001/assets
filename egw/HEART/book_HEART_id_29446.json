    "word": "The testimonies from Thursday had a different ring. The tame, lukewarm tone was gone. They were characterized by deep, earnest feeling. Men and women confessed how destitute of the love of Christ in the soul and of love for their brethren their religious experience had been. They humbly and thankfully expressed their gratitude for the light received. They had been clinging closely to their own righteousness; now by faith they trust in Christ's might and His power and His righteousness. They can do literally nothing without divine help. Their prayers now are filled with earnest, simple faith that takes God at His word. All now seem to have warm hearts. The love of Christ is assurance to them of their acceptance, and they long to speak and acknowledge the great goodness of God in providing them a righteousness which is pure, spotless, efficacious. Well may we trust in Jesus. Who is so worthy of honor and confidence as He who suffered and died for us? \n                                                                           284",
