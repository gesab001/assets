    "word": "The question is, What shall be done? Here are two institutions, one endeavoring to hold up and follow the principles of health reform, and the other allowing its patients to indulge in the use of flesh meat, and because of this, drawing patients away from the first institution. The matter is to be treated in a fair, Christ-like manner. When the one who has established himself so close beside the Lord's institution, is converted in heart and mind, he will see the necessity of carrying out the principles of the word of God, and will harmonize with his neighbors. If he cannot blend with them, he will go to some other place. There are many other places to which he could go.",
