    "word": "I spoke at eleven o'clock with much freedom from Isaiah 6:8. We had a social meeting and many excellent testimonies were borne. The presence of Jesus was in our midst and our hearts were made glad to see that as many as one-half of the number had been united with the church since I was here two years ago. There was a most intelligent company present. My soul was blessed on this day.--Ms. 53, 1890, p. 2 (Diary 16, p. 412).",
