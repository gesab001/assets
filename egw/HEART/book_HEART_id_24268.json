    "word": "You think you understand health reform; but you are merely a novice in this matter. You are too great a talker; you talk, talk, talk, and people are not made better by it. Your words are not in meekness and wisdom. You exalt yourself, but not Jesus Christ. You have much to say in regard to your knowledge and experience, when you do only harm. You are puffed up, conceited, unsanctified in heart and life. What have you to do to declare the statutes of the Lord? You only mar his work and reproach his cause. If you get some proselytes, they will need a greater work done for them to bring them to a correct knowledge of the truth than if you had made no effort for them, and they had remained in ignorance of the truth altogether. Your strength is to keep quiet, and set your own heart right before God. You have no work to do in preaching or talking the truth to others.",
