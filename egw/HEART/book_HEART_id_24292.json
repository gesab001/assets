    "word": "Bro. Waggoner, you have much to learn. Your failures and your discouragements \n                                                                           148\nyou have been inclined to charge to Bro. White; but close investigation of your motives and of your course of action would reveal other causes which exist in yourself for these discouragements. Following the inclinations of your own natural heart brings you into bondage. Your severe and torturing spirit which you sometimes indulge in cuts off your influence. Bro. Waggoner, you have a work to do for yourself which no other can do for you. Each must give an account of himself to God. God has given us his law as a mirror into which we may look and discover the defects in our character. This mirror into which we are to look is not for the purpose of seeing our neighbor's faults reflected, for us to watch to see if he comes up to the standard, but to see the defects in ourselves, that we may remove these defects. Knowledge is not all that we need. We must follow the light. We are not left to choose for ourselves, and to obey that which is agreeable to us, and disobey to suit our convenience. Obedience is better than sacrifice. \n\n                                               -",
