    "word": "MR No. 1015 - Men and Women Physicians\n\n     [2 Peter 2:1-12, quoted.] Now here is a rule for us that we can carry out if we will. I am so thankful that the Lord is so gracious to us, that He has given us Jesus as a Pattern. He did not exalt Himself; He came to this earth, and was meek and lowly in heart. He traveled around on foot from place to place, and yet He was the greatest Teacher that has ever stepped on the soil. Now, the Lord would have us in the position of learning from Him and of being just what He would have us to be. I want to speak something of how the Lord would have us carry on the work of God sensibly, men and women connected in the work, and each carrying their part, but in a way that God will be glorified.",
