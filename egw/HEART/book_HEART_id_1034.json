    "word": "Nicodemus, a chief ruler and a rabbi, was also a disciple of Christ. He had come to the Saviour by night, as if afraid to have it known that his heart was troubled. That night he listened to the most important discourse that ever fell from human lips. [See John 3.] The words he heard had penetrated his soul. He had been enlightened by them, but still he had not identified himself with Christ. He had been among the number spoken of by John. \u201cAmong the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue.\u201d But Nicodemus had endeavored, as far as he could, to defend Christ.
