    "word": "When Ahaziah, king of Israel, was sick, \u201che sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.\u201d On the way they met Elijah, and instead of a message from the idol, the king heard the awful denunciation from the God of Israel, \u201cThou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.\u201d [2 Kings 1:4.] It was Christ that bade Elijah speak these words to the apostate king. Jehovah Immanuel had cause to be greatly displeased at Ahaziah's impiety. What had Christ not done to win the hearts of Israel, and to inspire them with unwavering confidence in himself? For ages he had visited his people with manifestations of the most condescending kindness and unexampled love. From the time of the patriarchs, he had shown how his \u201cdelights were with the sons of men.\u201d [Proverbs 8:31.] He had been a very present help to all who sought him in sincerity. \u201cIn all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them.\u201d [Isaiah 63:9.] Yet Israel had revolted from God, and turned for help to the Lord's worst enemy.",
