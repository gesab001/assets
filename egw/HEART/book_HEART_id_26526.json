    "word": "Ministers, after repeated urgent calls, are called from a profitable field of labor to let the interests waver and die, in order to settle some matters in the church, among brethren, which they have manufactured by disregarding the orders of their Captain. While in this divided state of feeling, their hearts are unimpressible, and the minister's efforts are like blows upon cold iron; each party is more firmly set in its own way, and will, after making so much of little matters that might have been adjusted at the outset by following the rule Christ has given them, refuse to make any concession.",
