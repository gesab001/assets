    "word": "Those who preach the gospel without putting the whole being--heart, mind, soul, and strength--into their work, are consumers and not producers. God calls for men who realize that they must put forth earnest action, men who bring thought, zeal, prudence, capability, and the attributes of Christ's character, into their work. The saving of souls is a vast work, which calls for the employment of every talent, every gift of grace. Those engaged in this work should constantly increase in efficiency. They should have an earnest desire to \n\n\n                                   -306- \n\nstrengthen their powers, realizing that they will be weak without a constantly increasing supply of grace. They should seek to attain larger and still larger results in their work.",
