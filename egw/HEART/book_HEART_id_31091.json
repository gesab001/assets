    "word": "We are fully aware that dishonest men, immoral men, who preach the word, are not always reproved and warned. They are not unmasked. They learn to hold the truth in unrighteousness, and can tamper with it without a trembling heart and rebuke of conscience. O that with pen and voice we might lead the people who claim to be depositaries of sacred and eternal truth to feel the necessity of enthroning the word of God in their heart, and bringing every thought, word, and action into subjection to Jesus Christ. It is a fearful responsibility to be in daily connection with the truth of God, telling others of eternity, and yet be unsanctified through the truth.",
