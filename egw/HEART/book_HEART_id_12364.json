    "word": "Many times in the day is the cry of Mother, Mother, heard, first from one little troubled voice and then another. In answer to the cry, mother must turn here and there to attend to their demands. . . . A word of approval will bring sunshine to the heart for hours. Many precious beams of light and gladness can the mother shed here and there among her precious little ones. How closely can she bind those dear ones to her heart, that her presence will be to them the sunniest place in the world.",
