    "word": "Will you do your best to awaken the dormant energies of the people of God, to seek the Lord with all the heart, that they may find Him, and to keep His love burning in their hearts because they love the truth as it is in Jesus? I am determined not to be discouraged. I am determined to keep my face lifted up to the Sun of Righteousness. I want the light and power of God in my soul. We need not become cold and dark and Christless. We are to pray and believe, and watch unto prayer.",
