    "word": "Let no partiality be shown to one or more who are your favorites, to the neglect of others of your brethren whom you do not love. Beware lest you deal harshly with those who, you think, have made mistakes, while others, more guilty and deserving of reproof, and who should be even severely rebuked for their unchristlike conduct, are sustained and treated as special friends. Paul, in his epistle to Titus, bids him exhort the brethren to be \"ready to every good work,\" \"to speak evil of no man, to be not brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men. For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.\" The mercy and favor of God toward us is an example of how we should treat the erring. When those who claim to believe the truth will humble their hearts before God and obey His word, then the Lord will listen to their prayers.",
