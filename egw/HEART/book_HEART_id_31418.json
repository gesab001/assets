    "word": "The one who had been acting as principal of the school had been retained for some time longer than he should have been, for there were sufficient reasons for his removal. His inefficiency and the necessity for a change were laid before me, but I did not consider it my duty to enter into details and give publicity to the deficiencies of the one who had been serving as principal of the school. When it was decided by the brethren that it would be best for him to be removed, he felt greatly injured. My heart ached for the man, and I did not expose the worst features of his case. I greatly pitied him, that he should stand in such an objectionable light. I wrote to him and calmly pointed out his inefficiency and unfitness to accomplish the work that must be done in Huntsville, and that should have been done long ago.",
