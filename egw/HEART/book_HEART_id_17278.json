    "word": "The selfish love of \"me and mine\" keeps many from doing their duty to others. Do they think that all the work they have to do is for themselves and their own children? \"Inasmuch,\" says Christ,\" as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.\" \"Are your own children of more value in the sight of God than the children of your neighbors? God is no respecter of persons. We are to do all we can to save souls. None should be passed by because they have not the culture and religious training of more favored children. Had these erring, neglected ones enjoyed the same home advantages, they might have shown far more nobility of soul and greater talent for usefulness than many who have been watched over day and night with gentlest care and overflowing love. Angels pity these stray lambs; angels weep, while human eyes are dry, and human hearts are closed against them. If God had not given me another work, I would make it the business of my life to care for those whom others will not take the trouble to save. \n                                                                           424",
