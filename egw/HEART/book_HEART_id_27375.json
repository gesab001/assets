    "word": "Instead of exposing and publishing one's faults to others, you will put forth the most patient efforts to heal and bind up. \"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\" A harsh-spirited man is unrefined, coarse; he is not spiritual, he has not a heart of flesh, but a heart as unimpressible as a stone. His only help is to fall on the Rock, and be broken. The Lord will place all such in the crucible, and try them in fire, as gold is tried. When He can see His image reflected in them He will remove them; but if there proves to be no genuine gold, then they consume like dross.",
