    "word": "The Gift of the Holy Spirit--\"The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you\" (John 14:26). There is a multitude of errors in our world, but the truth is a unit always. Those who cherish the truth in the heart will manifest its sanctifying power, for true faith works by love and purifies the soul. \"Nevertheless I tell you the truth,\" Christ declared, \"It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you\" (John 16:7).",
