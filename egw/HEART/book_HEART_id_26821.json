    "word": "God is weary of professional falseness and hollow hypocrisy. \"And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.\" What grand words, how cheering and uplifting. \"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully,\" \"he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness, and keepeth the truth in his heart,\" \"he shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation\" [Psalms 24:3-5; 15:2].",
