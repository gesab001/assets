    "word": "\u201cWe took the packet on our way to Madison county, N.Y. It left us within twenty-five miles of Brother Abbey's. Here we hired a carriage to complete the journey. It was Friday when we arrived at the house, and it was proposed that one should go to the door and make inquiries, so that if we should be disappointed in receiving a welcome we could return with the driver, and keep the Sabbath at a public house. Sister Abbey came to the door, and my husband introduced himself as one \n251\nwho kept the Sabbath. Said she, \u2018I am glad to see you. Come in.\u2019 He replied, \u2018There are three more in the carriage with me. I thought if we all came in together, we might frighten you.\u2019 \u2018I am never frightened at Christians,\u2019 was the reply. Heartily were we welcomed by Sister A. and her family. She expressed much joy at seeing us, and when Brother Bates was introduced she said, \u2018Can this be Brother Bates who wrote that hewing book on the Sabbath? And come to see us? I am unworthy to have you come under my roof. But the Lord has sent you to us, for we are all starving for the truth.\u2019",
