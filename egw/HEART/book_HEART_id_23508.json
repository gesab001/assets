    "word": "Meet around the cross of Calvary in self-sacrifice and self-denial. As you stand before the cross, and see the royal Prince of heaven dying for you, can you seal your heart, saying, \"No; I have nothing to give\"? God will bless you as you do your best. As you approach the throne of grace, as you find yourself bound to this throne by the golden chain let down from heaven to earth to draw men from the pit of sin, your heart will go out in love for your brethren and sisters who are without God and without hope in the world.",
