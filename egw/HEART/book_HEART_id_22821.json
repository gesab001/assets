    "word": "Fellow-labourers, we must have Jesus, the precious Jesus, abiding in our own hearts much more fully if we meet with success. We are in great need of the heavenly influence, God's Holy Spirit, to give power and efficiency to our work. We need to open the heart to Christ. We need much firmer faith and more fervent devotion. We need to die to self, and in mind and heart to cherish an adorning love for our Saviour. When we will seek the Lord with all the heart, we shall find Him, and our hearts will be all aglow with His love. Self will sink into insignificance, and Jesus will be all and in all to the soul.",
