    "word": "Whole-Hearted Tenderness \n     We should not place in office men who will exercise a dominating spirit. We need men who manifest a wholehearted tenderness. We must deal with erring ministers and with church members as with God's property, not as though they were school children. We need to remember that we are dealing with men with like passions as ourselves. We cannot use our influence to place in office those who have not a control over their own spirit, or who have a disposition to be easily excited. Such men know not how to deal with human minds.",
