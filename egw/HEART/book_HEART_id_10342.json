    "word": "For three hundred years Enoch had been seeking purity of heart, that he might be in harmony with heaven. For three centuries he had walked with God. Day by day he had longed for a closer union; nearer and nearer had grown the communion, until God took him to Himself. He had stood at the threshold of the eternal world, only a step between him and the land \n172\nof the blest; and now the portals opened, the walk with God, so long pursued on earth, continued, and he passed through the gates of the holy city,\u2014the first from among men to enter there.",
