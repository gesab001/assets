    "word": "\u201cNo man knoweth the day nor the hour,\u201d was the argument most often brought forward by rejecters of the Advent faith. The scripture is, \u201cOf that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of Heaven, but my Father only.\u201d [Matthew 24:36]. A clear and harmonious explanation of this text was given by those who were looking for the Lord, and the wrong use made of it by their opponents was clearly shown. The \n371\nwords were spoken by Christ in that memorable conversation with his disciples upon Olivet, after he had for the last time departed from the temple. The disciples had asked the question, \u201cWhat shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?\u201d [Matthew 24:3, 33, 42-51]. Jesus gave them signs, and said, \u201cWhen ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.\u201d [Matthew 24:3, 33, 42-51]. One saying of the Saviour must not be made to destroy another. Though no man knoweth the day nor the hour of his coming, we are instructed and required to know when it is near. We are further taught that to disregard his warning, and refuse or neglect to know when his advent is near, will be as fatal for us, as it was for those who lived in the days of Noah not to know when the flood was coming. And the parable in the same chapter contrasting the faithful and the unfaithful servant, and giving the doom of him who said in his heart, \u201cMy Lord delayeth his coming,\u201d shows in what light Christ will regard and reward those whom he finds watching, and teaching his coming, and those denying it. \u201cWatch therefore,\u201d he says; \u201cblessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing.\u201d [Matthew 24:3, 33, 42-51]. \u201cIf therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on these as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\u201d [Revelation 3:3.]",
