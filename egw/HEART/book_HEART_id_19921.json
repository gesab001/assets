    "word": "Our hearts need to be wholly sanctified to God. Let us not seek to retain our own way and will. God has given us His truth, that it may sanctify, refine, and ennoble the whole man. \"This is the will of God\" concerning you, He said, \"even your sanctification\" (1 Thessalonians 4:3). \"His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue\" (2 Peter 1:3).--Manuscript 70, Feb. 26, 1899, \"Laborers Together With God\"",
