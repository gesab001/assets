    "word": "Your father sends you a very nice Bible. I hope it will please you, my dear boy. We want to love the Lord more and more earnestly. We wish you to pray for His Holy Spirit to guide you. You have not strength to keep yourself; you must trust in God, and pray to Him alone all by yourself. \n\n\n                                     -124- \n\nThink what you desire most, and then ask your kind heavenly Father for the very things you need, and He will grant you the desire of your heart. He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than earthly parents to give good gifts to their children. Be true, be frank, be honest, be patient. This was the character of your divine Lord.",
