    "word": "When the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the early church, \"The whole multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.\" The spirit of Christ made them one. This is the fruit of abiding in Christ. But if dissensions, envy, jealousy, and strife are the fruit we bear, it is not possible that we are abiding in Christ. To draw nourishment from the Living Vine is the same that Christ represents as eating His flesh and drinking His blood. And if we are feeding upon Him, we shall manifest His spirit.",
