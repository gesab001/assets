    "word": "My brethren in the ministry, we need Jesus every moment. To lose His love from our hearts means much. Yet He Himself says: \"I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love\" (Revelation 2:4). There is danger of presenting the truth in such a way that the intellect is exalted, leaving the souls of the hearers unsatisfied. A correct theory of the truth may be presented, and yet there may not be manifested the warmth of affection that the God of truth requires every one of His messengers to cherish and manifest.",
