    "word": "My husband must have a change. Losses may occur at the Office of publication for want of his long experience; but the loss of money cannot bear any comparison to the health and life of God's servant. The income of means may not be as large for want of economical managers. But if my husband should fail again it would dishearten his brethren and weaken their hands. Means cannot come in as an equivalent.",
