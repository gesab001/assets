    "word": "Luther trembled as he looked upon himself,\u2014one man opposed to the mightiest powers of earth. He sometimes doubted whether he had indeed been led of God to set himself against the authority of the church. \u201cWho was I,\u201d he writes, \u201cto oppose the majesty of the pope, before whom the \n132\nkings of the earth and the whole world trembled?\u201d \u201cNo one can know what I suffered in those first two years, and into what dejection and even despair I was often plunged.\u201d But he was not left to become utterly disheartened. When human support failed, he looked to God alone, and learned that he could lean in perfect safety upon that all-powerful arm.",
