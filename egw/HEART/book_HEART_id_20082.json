    "word": "Let us watch unto prayer. This will help us to realize that we are to be under the control of Christ, our divine Leader. He endows us with steadiness of purpose, with subdued, Christlike impulses, and with sound judgment, enabling us to think soberly, and yet kindly. Time is altogether too short for us to make ourselves unhappy. We will, my dear brother and sister, cherish the spirit of happiness, because we know that we have a Saviour who loves us, and who will bless us if we will welcome His presence into our hearts.",
