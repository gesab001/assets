    "word": "We are very grateful to the Lord of hosts for this possession; for we have here just what we hoped to have in the Buena Vista estate,--place where we can study the works of nature, and in the woods and mountains around us, learn of God through His works. And here, by the study of His handiwork, we can learn how to present God to others. I thank God with heart and soul and voice for the abundant advantages we have. We realize that the Lord knew what we needed, and that it is His providence that brought us here. Our disappointment in regard to the Buena Vista estate was great; and it was hard to know that all our expectations concerning it must be given up; but we thank the Lord that the matter has worked out to the glory of God. Let us be thankful, and let us give expression to our thankfulness.",
