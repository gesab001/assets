    "word": "And our sanitariums have been erected to supply a great necessity in healing the sick and suffering ones, and thus counterwork the work of Satan. And as in the miracles when Christ was in the world, we His followers are to discard drugs. We are to have faith, living faith, to read the Word, to inspire faith, to pray by the bedside of the sick, to talk faith. And Christ says, \"Go ye therefore, and baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\" Thus many are to be converted; the power of living faith is inspired in human hearts.",
