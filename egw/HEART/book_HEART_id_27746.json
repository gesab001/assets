    "word": "Brother and Sister Buzzell have taken the same stand. They have had the same feelings. Would you wish all your remarks, as well as your feelings in regard to these sisters, registered in the book of heaven? It is a shame that men who have been as long in the truth as you have been, are not qualified to stand in the church and build up the cause of God by faithful, earnest labor. But should you or Brother B attempt to take any responsible position in the church it would not prosper, for neither of you is right with God. The converting power of God must come to your own hearts and sanctify your own lives and refine and purify your own characters, before you will be a help to the cause of God in any place. You are both far from God. Self and self-esteem are standing directly in the way of your advancement, and you will not make progress until you have a sense of your own defects of character.",
