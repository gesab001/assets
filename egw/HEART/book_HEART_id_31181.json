    "word": "And God wants us to be converted. O, how my heart aches for our children. We want them saved, but we must save them in God's appointed way. And I want you to understand that we have a Heaven to win, a heaven to win. And when I think of it, that so many children are not prepared nor getting prepared to enter heaven, I want to give every place something of this that we have got. We want heaven, and we want every one of these children should enter the courts of heaven and enjoy that life. What is it? Eternal life in the kingdom of glory. One child saved; one child taken from the clutches of the enemy, and we want you to walk in this direction to save the children. We have got a people that are watching us. And we are to conduct ourselves in such a way that they will be convinced we have got something that they have not got. And we are seeking for heaven, and we want every soul here to gain heaven.",
