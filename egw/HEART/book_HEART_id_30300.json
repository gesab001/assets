    "word": "When John the Baptist pointed to Jesus saying, Behold the Lamb of God,\" the disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. The Saviour \"turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him. Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.\" After hearing the gracious words that proceeded from the lips of Jesus, words that flashed light into their minds, the hearts of the disciples were aglow with faith and assurance that this was indeed the Messiah. With inexpressible love their hearts went out to Jesus, and they did not sit down in happy contemplation, to hear more and more of the gracious words. They wanted others to have the same knowledge they had received. Andrew went in search of some one to whom he might tell the wonderful story, that seemed almost too good to be true. He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, \"We have found the Messias;\" and he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, \"Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation a stone.\"",
