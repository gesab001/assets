    "word": "The eternal word is reliable, but the word of man is not reliable. I have felt very deeply over this treacherous work; it has been as a sword in my heart. Now where are these men? McCullagh is still in Adelaide. He reported that he was going to Sydney, but he has not yet come. He wrote a letter to Mrs. Hextall in Sydney, who was his special admirer, saying that he wished her to get up a subscription paper and raise money to get his family back to Sydney. This one woman and her son put their names to the paper, and that was all. We feared that the churches in N.S.W. would be tried and shaken because they are new in the faith. McCullagh has sent letters to different ones appealing to them for sympathy and bemoaning his poverty. But these letters contained the most bitter spirit against me and were a list of lies.",
