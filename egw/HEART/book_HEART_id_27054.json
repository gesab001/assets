    "word": "By the help of God you must bridle your tongue; talk less, and pray more. Never question the motives of your brethren, for as you judge them God has declared that you will be judged. Open your hearts to kindliness, to the dictates of the Spirit of God, to the cheering rays of the Sun of Righteousness. You need an enlightened understanding. Encourage kindly thoughts and holy affections. Cultivate the habit of speaking well of others. Let neither pride nor self-righteousness prevent you from making frank and full confession of your wrong doings if you desire the forgiveness of God. If you do not love those for whom Christ has died, you have no genuine love for Christ. Your worship will be a tainted offering before God. If you retain unworthy thoughts, misjudging your brethren and surmising evil of them, God will not hear your self-sufficient, self-exalted prayers. When you go to those you think are doing wrong, you must have the spirit of meekness, of kindness, full or mercy and good fruits. \n\n\n                                     -184-",
