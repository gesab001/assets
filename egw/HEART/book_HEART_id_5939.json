    "word": "The grace of Christ must be an abiding principle in the heart and be exemplified in the life. Self will then be laid at the foot of the cross, and Christ will be accepted as all and in all. There will be no inclination to exalt self, but Christ will be revealed as \u201cthe chiefest among ten thousand,\u201d the One \u201caltogether lovely.\u201d [Song of Solomon 5:10, 16.] There are great possibilities open to every sincere worker, if all the powers of mind and body are consecrated to God, to do his will, and not to serve self. The very thoughts are to be brought into subjection to the will of Christ. Then the affections will be refined and ennobled; those who carry the burden of the work will not be impure in thought or word or act, neither will they be light and trifling. All frivolity, all cheapness of conversation, all jesting and joking, weakens the soul, and weans the heart from prayer. Like Paul, the true followers of Christ will ever bear about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus; they cannot keep in mind the sufferings of Christ for them, and yet be light and trifling. They will manifest a true, Christ-like dignity and holy solemnity; yet there will be no Phariseeism. There will be cheerful faith and courage in the Lord; for they trust the keeping of their souls unto God as to a faithful \n234\nCreator. The Sun of Righteousness shines upon them in bright beams, and they keep their souls in the sunshine, and not in the shadow. They talk light, and not darkness. They do not lead souls to forget God, but keep the mind refreshed by speaking of his goodness, his love, and his power.",
