    "word": "If we walk loftily and in self-sufficiency, we shall walk alone, without the companionship of Jesus. \"The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.\" We should labor less in self, and more in the spirit of Jesus Christ. My husband's voice might have been a power in its pathos and melody to reach hearts. One of God's best gift is the voice. God has given cautions which have not been heeded. My husband has perverted this gift, but now he may do much to redeem the past. He has no time to lose. God in mercy brings our defects to light, that we may remedy them before it is too late. We must look from ourselves, our self-righteousness, our alms giving, our religious conflicts, to Jesus. His merits alone will save us. Living faith in Jesus will bring rich blessings.",
