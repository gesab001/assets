    "word": "But there is a time coming when every case shall be judged according to their works. Every action of robbery, of appropriating the Lord's tithe money, will be considered, unless you repent of your robbery toward God, that we may come to Him with His own and, as David said, \"Of thine own, oh Lord, we freely give thee\" [see 1 Chronicles 29:14]. It is God that has given us everything. As we sit at our table He has given us this provision; through Jesus Christ it comes. The rain, the sunshine, the dew, and everything that is a blessing to us, He has given us, and yet many are so hard-hearted, so full of selfishness, that they cannot see the claims that God has upon them. Not all, thank God! There are many of us glad to give back to the Lord His own, and give it freely. We give it as freely as did David. Of Thine own, we freely give Thee.",
