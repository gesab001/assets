    "word": "The so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men from the obligation of obedience to God is not faith, but presumption. \"By grace are ye saved through faith\" (Ephesians 2:8). But \"faith, if it hath not works, is dead\" (James 2:17). Jesus said of Himself before He came to earth, \"I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart\" (Psalm 40:8). And just before He ascended again to heaven, He declare, \"I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love\" (John 15:10). The Scriptures says, \"Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments\" (1 John 2:3). . . .",
