    "word": "The work of Christ was not a divided heart service. Christ came not to do His own will but the will of Him that sent Him. Jesus says, \"Step in the footprints of my Sonship in all obedience. I obey as in partnership with the great firm. You are to obey as in co-partnership with the Son of God. Often you will not see the path clearly; then ask of God, and He will give you wisdom and courage and faith to move forward, leaving all issues with Him.\" We want to comprehend so far as possible the truly human nature of our Lord. The divine and human were linked in Christ, and both were complete.",
