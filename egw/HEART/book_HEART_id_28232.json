    "word": "The Lord has a church upon this earth. He has a people who are working with an undivided interest, a people who is dear to His heart because they are consecrated to Him. There are also men whose names are on the church books who are not serving God, who are robbing Him by withholding the tithes and offerings which He, as the householder, requires as His portion. But because there are tares among the wheat, shall we disparage the church of God? Never! We may disparage ourselves, but never disparage those who are striving amid temptation and trial. These are the ones whom God loves.",
