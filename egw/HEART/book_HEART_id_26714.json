    "word": "I am instructed to say that the church needs to take a much higher view of what is comprehended in yielding all to God. When the individual members of the church are obedient to the commands of God, following in the way which Christ has trodden before them, they will find fewer difficulties to encounter. The distress and sorrow that are the result of wrong moves, will no more prove their destruction. Self-sufficiency will be purged from the soul. God's people will eat the flesh of Christ and drink His blood. From the heart they will obey the commandments. \n\n\n                               -222-",
