    "word": "Kindness, Courtesy, and the Lowliness of Christ--You need the kindness, courtesy, meekness, and lowliness of Christ.  You have many valuable qualifications that can be perfected for highest service if sanctified to God.  You should feel the necessity of approaching your brethren with kindness and courtesy, not with harshness and severity.  You do not realize the harm you do by your sharp, domineering spirit toward them.  The ministers in your conference become disheartened, losing the courage they might have if you would give then respect, kindness, confidence, and love.  By your manner of dealing you have separated the hearts of your brethren from you, so  \n7\nthat your counsel has not had much influence over them for good.  This is not as the Lord would have it.  He is not pleased with your attitude toward your brethren.--Letter 3, 1888, p. 4, Jan. 10, 1888.",
