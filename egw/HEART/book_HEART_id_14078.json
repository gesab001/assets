    "word": "But the Communion service was not to be a season of sorrowing. This was not its purpose. . . . They are not to recall the differences between them and their brethren. The preparatory service has embraced all this. . . . Now they come to meet with Christ. They are not to stand in the shadow of the cross, but in its saving light. They are to open the soul to the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. With hearts cleansed by Christ's most precious blood, in full consciousness of His presence, although unseen, they are to hear His words, \"Peace I leave with you.\" . . .",
