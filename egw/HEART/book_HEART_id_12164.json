    "word": "Health Reform Literature Will Win Souls.--Publications upon health reform will reach many who will not see or read anything upon important Bible subjects.... The truth must come to the people upon health reform.

Many are being drawn by the Lord Jesus Christ, who will respond.--MS 1, 1875.",
