    "word": "What have you been willing to suffer for the truth's sake? You have a short, very short, period in which to cultivate the noble traits of your character. You have all been, to some extent, dissatisfied and unhappy. You have had many complaints to make. You have talked, especially ----- and -----, your unbelief, and censured others. You have had hearts filled with pride, and even bitterness, at times. Your closets have been neglected, and you have not loved the exercises of religious duties. If you had been persevering in your efforts to grow up into Christ your living head, you would now be strong, and competent to bless others with your influence.",
