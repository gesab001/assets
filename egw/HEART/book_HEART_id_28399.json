    "word": "In the future there will be perplexity and trouble and deception. The only safety of God's people is their unity in the work He has given them to do, over which He alone can act as supervisor. All who hold the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end will receive in their foreheads the mark of God. Of them He will say, \"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy\" (Revelation 3:4.) At the appointed time the glad tidings of their deliverance will come, filling their hearts with gladness and their lips with joyful praise.",
