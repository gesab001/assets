    "word": "Where you are, you have every facility for work, and you know nothing about the hardship of starting the work in new fields, among a people that have scarcely any knowledge of missionary work. Workers are appointed as missionaries to these foreign fields, and then they are left to get along as best they can, while those at the heart of the work think it is very important to do something that had better be left undone. O if you could only once have a sense of how the Lord looks upon your course for several years past, you would hide your heads for shame. You would labor, you would deny self, that you might send all you could possibly gather, to foreign fields. If you only knew what you should know, the calls of missionaries would stir every fibre of your being. How intensely you would labor; how self-denying you would be, that you might send facilities to those who must have them. Missionaries must have facilities, or else it is their duty to leave the field; for they consume their God-given strength \n                                                                           1500\nin doing very little.",
