    "word": "These ideas in relation to prophesying, I do not hesitate to say, might better never have been expressed. Such statements prepare the way for a state of things that Satan will surely take advantage of to bring in spurious exercises. There is danger, not only that unbalanced minds will be led into fanaticism, but that designing persons will take advantage of this excitement to further their own selfish purposes. Jesus has raised His voice in warning: \"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits.\" \"Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.\" \"If any man shall say to you, Lo here is Christ, or lo, He is there, believe him not; for false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall show signs and wonders to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. \n\n\n                                    -189- \n\nBut take ye heed; behold, I have foretold you all things\" [Mark 13:21-23].--Letter 6a, 1894, pp. 3, 4.
