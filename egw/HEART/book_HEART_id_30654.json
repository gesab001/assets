    "word": "Let every church member carefully consider his responsibilities, and look himself in the face. Become acquainted with yourself. Urge home upon your own hearts that you are not to seek to make yourself a specialty, for effect, for praise, but a specialty in seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, inquire seriously, \"Am I faithful?\" Be first a most faithful steward over yourself. Search your own heart, and often compare it with the great mirror of the word of God, until tried and searched by God, you will be approved of him, not having your own righteousness, but the righteousness of Jesus Christ. Strengthened by his might in the inner man you will be accepted as a vessel unto honor.",
