    "word": "If you will only follow on to know the Lord, and do His bidding, you will know by your experience that God will suggest thoughts to you as you attempt to speak words to those who are around you, to restrain them from doing wrong, and to point out to them the way of life. It is your privilege to tell them of the Word of the living God, and to counsel them in kindness and in love. Never get impatient, even if their requirements may seem unreasonable, but thank the Lord with heart and soul and voice that you have the privilege of becoming a child of God, and heir of heaven. \"Rejoice in the Lord always,\" and through His grace you may overcome one difficulty after another. Such an experience will strengthen your faith, that you may believe that it is possible for you to be an overcomer.",
