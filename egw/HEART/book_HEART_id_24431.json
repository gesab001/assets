    "word": "I am glad that our people are established here at Madison. I am glad to meet these workers here, who are offering themselves to go to different places. God's work is to advance steadily; his truth is to triumph. To every believer we would say: Let no one stand \n\n\n                   -12- \n\nin the way. Say not, \"We cannot afford to work in a sparsely-settled field, and largely in a self-supporting way, when out in the world are great fields where we might reach multitudes.\" And let none say, \"We cannot afford to sustain you in an effort to work in those out-of-the-way places.\" What! Cannot afford it! You cannot afford not to work in these isolated places; and if you neglect such fields, the time will come when you will wish that you had afforded it. There is a world to be saved. Let some of our consecrated teachers go out into the highways and the hedges, and compel the honest in heart to come in,--not by physical force; oh, no! but with the weight of evidence as presented in God's Word.",
