    "word": "Chapter 15 \u2014Jesus\u2019 Example in Prayer\n\nFOLLOW JESUS\u2019 EXAMPLE BY STARTING THE DAY WITH PRAYER.\u2014It was in hours of solitary prayer that Jesus in His earth life received wisdom and power. Let the youth follow His example in finding at dawn and twilight a quiet season for communion with their Father in heaven. And throughout the day let them lift up their hearts to God. At every step of our way He says, \u201cI the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, . . . Fear not; I will help thee.\u201d Isaiah 41:13. Could our children learn these lessons in the morning of their years, what freshness and power, what joy and sweetness, would be brought into their lives!\u2014(Education, 259.)",
