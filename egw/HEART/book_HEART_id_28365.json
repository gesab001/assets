    "word": "I said, If you have not found the rest that Christ has offered to give you upon condition that you learn of Him who is meek and lowly of heart, would you not better without delay yoke up with Christ, bear only His burdens, and not pile upon yourselves burdens that weigh you down to the earth? All your trouble is that you are so anxious to run things yourselves that you do not wear the yoke of Christ, which He declares is easy. The yokes of your own manufacturing gall the necks that wear them. Christ says, Try My yoke, it is easy; lift My burdens, for they are light.",
