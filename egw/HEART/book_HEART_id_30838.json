    "word": "Let the Lord's work go forward, Let the medical missionary and the educational work go forward. I am sure that this is our great lack,--earnest, devoted, intelligent, capable workers. In every large city there should be a representation of true medical missionary work. Let many now ask, \"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\" It is the Lord's purpose that His method of healing without drugs shall be brought into prominence in every large city through our medical institutions. God invests with holy dignity those who go forth farther and still farther, in every place to which it is possible to obtain entrance. Satan (690) will make the work as difficult as possible, but divine power will attend \n\n\n                              -385- \n\nall true-hearted workers. Guided by our heavenly Father's hand, let us go forward, improving every opportunity to extend the work of God.",
