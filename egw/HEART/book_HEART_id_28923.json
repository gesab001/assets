    "word": "Believers who have the true principle at heart will serve God every day as though it were their last. They will separate sin and iniquity from them and will keep before them the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And whosoever \"hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself even as He is pure.\" If we get careless and think that we have many days of probation, then the enemy comes in and takes possession of us. And now supposing that every one of us should be in that state of watchfulness that Christ requires us to be in, then how much better condition would the church be in.",
