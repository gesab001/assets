    "word": "The law of God is a complete standard of righteousness. Man has not in himself sufficient wisdom to frame a perfect rule of right, and therefore God has given His law as a safe guide. Man is not left to his own fallacious reasoning in regard to his course of action toward his fellow men or his service to God. He is not left to stumble along, following the imagination of his own heart and mind. God calls the attention of men to a comprehensible rule of action, commandments that have God for their Author, the law pronounced by inspiration holy, just, and good. The service that God expects of His servants is not left to question and doubt. Will man love God supremely, and his neighbor as himself? \n\n\n                                   -113-",
