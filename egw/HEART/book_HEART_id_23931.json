    "word": "Be Ye Therefore Merciful. \n\n     \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" It was the love of God that gave Christ to the world, that he might draw all men unto himself. It is for this end that the Spirit is striving with human hearts, that their hardness may be melted away, that they may be purified, ennobled, refined. God would have us of the same mind as was Christ, that we may be fitted for eternal life, and be the sons and daughters of God.",
