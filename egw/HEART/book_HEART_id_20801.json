    "word": "\"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day\" (Isaiah 58:9, 10). Praise God with heart and voice for this possibility! Praise God that we can bring this promise to the Lord for fulfillment, when we comply with the conditions. When we do not know which way to turn, light direct from God will come to us, if we will follow His directions. . . .",
