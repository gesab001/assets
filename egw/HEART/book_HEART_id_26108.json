    "word": "Christ bids you, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). The members of the church of Christ are to act out the principles of truth, representing the character of the meek and lowly Jesus. This is contrary to the spirit of the world.",
