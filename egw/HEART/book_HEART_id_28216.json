    "word": "Many parents have never yet been converted, therefore their old self-indulgent habits have been brought with them into the church. They were not dead to self when they observed the ordinance of baptism. They were buried alive, and they have remained full of murmuring, full of faultfinding, hating the messages that come to them through the Lord's servants, because of the wickedness of their hearts. They are at enmity with God, and their children breathe in the same atmosphere. They may have good instruction in Sabbath school, they may listen to the most solemn appeals, but they care for none of these things. When \n\n\n                                     -36- \n\nin the house of worship, they have little sense that the Lord is giving them instruction through His messengers. Some children sit and read a book or a paper while the words of truth are being presented from the oracles of God. In their present spiritual deadness, the parents feel no special burden, and never will until God shall send His judgments upon them.",
