    "word": "Brother F., you have neglected duties until they are almost forgotten, but they are still binding upon you. If you continue to close the door of \n\n\n                                   -13- \n\nyour heart against Christ, if you will not open to Him, every opportunity, every privilege, that you have refused will be a swift witness against you in the day of judgment. The requirements of God are no less than they ever have been; and disobedience to them will be requited in proportion to the light which has been given. The Lord has a right to the service of every soul, and all who withhold their service from Him are committing robbery of God, and they must answer to this charge in the Judgment.",
