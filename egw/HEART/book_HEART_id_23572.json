With great solemnity he repeated the message to the Laodicean church, \"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.\" \"In my self-sufficiency this is just the way I felt,\" he said. \"'And knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.' I now see that this is my condition. My eyes are opened. My spirit has been hard and unjust. I thought myself righteous, by my heart is broken, and I see my need of the precious counsel of the One who has searched me through and through. Oh, how \n                                                                           10\ngracious and compassionate and loving are the words: 'I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.'\" Revelation 3:17, 18.",
