How can they grieve the heart of Christ (MS 125, 1901)?  {4BC 1178.10}  \n     4-7. An Experience Being Re-enacted.-- [Zechariah 3:4-7 quoted.] The one who was clothed with filthy garments represents those who have committed wrongs, but who have come into so sincere a position of repentance that the Lord, who forgives all sins that are repented of, was satisfied.
