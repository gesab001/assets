    "word": "I have endeavored to arouse our people to labor for the unworked portions of the great Missionary field, yet but few seem to respond to the appeals of the Spirit of God. We do not realize the extent to which Satanic agencies are at work in these large cities. The work of bringing the messages of present truth before the people is becoming more and more difficult. It is essential that new and varied talents unite in intelligent labor for the people. If the burden of these unworked cities rested upon the hearts of our people as it should, they would arouse to labor as they have not yet done for the souls that are perishing in sin. . .",
