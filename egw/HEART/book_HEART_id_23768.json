    "word": "Bro. and Sr. Barker have a work to do in setting their own hearts and house in order. They should cultivate harmonious action. The transforming influence of the Spirit of God can do a great work for you both, and will unite your hearts and efforts in the work of reform in your own family. All repining, murmuring, and a hasty irritability, should be done with. Its effects are to weaken you both, and to destroy the influence you must have if you succeed in training your children for Heaven. Satan now has the field. He has the control of the minds of your children. These poor children are his captives. They practice self-abuse. Their minds take a low turn. Their moral sensibilities seem paralyzed. They have practiced this vice, and gloried in their iniquities. Such boys are capable of poisoning an entire neighborhood or community, and their pernicious influence will endanger all who are brought in contact with them in school capacity. Your children are corrupt, body and mind.",
