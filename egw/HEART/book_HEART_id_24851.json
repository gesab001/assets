    "word": "Our Saviour has represented His first advent, and the treatment He received, by the parable of the vineyard. \"A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.\" Luke 20:9. The account is continued in Luke 20:10-17. God first sent His prophets to ancient Israel, but their message was not heeded, and as a last resort He sent His Son, that the hearts of the people might be reached and be turned unto God; but they killed His Son. This was the work of Satan by the hands of those that he has gathered under his banner. Christ was \"despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\" Isaiah 53:3. What was it that brought such sorrow? It was not on His own account, but for the sins of the people. He realized their condition, and this was the reason that He felt such sorrow as He wept over Jerusalem and uttered the lamentable words, \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not. Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.\" Luke 13:34.",
