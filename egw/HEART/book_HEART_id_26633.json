    "word": "How many dishonor God by hardness of heart. We live from day to day, dependent upon the mercy of God. We must seek continually for forgiveness, and yet how reluctant we are to forgive others! Should Christ deal with us in as heartless a manner as we deal with one another, there would be no hope for us. No provocation can be so grievous as to authorize us to harbor feelings of dislike, of resentment, and retaliation. How grievous to the Lord has been our continual transgression. Think how entirely dependent we are upon Him, the continual recipients of His beneficence and mercy, and yet doing continually those things that are not pleasing in His sight. But does He cast us off? No, He bears with our perversity, and is ever ready to forgive us when we see our mistakes and errors, when we repent and humble ourselves before Him. Should the Lord keep a reckoning with us, what a debt would appear against us! But we can say every day, \"Thy gentleness hath made me great.\" \n\n\n                               -76-",
