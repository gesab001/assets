    "word": "Has Christ been woven into your life experience? It is your privilege to be a partaker of the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust. You have too often been listening to the temptations of Satan, and he has had such influence over you that the grace of Christ has not been a controlling power in your life. The apostle exhorts, \"Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\" You must aim high. Let your language be, \"I study, I work for eternity.\" You have no time to lose. Both the understanding and the heart need to constantly maintain the most intimate and conscious connection with the pure, sacred springs from which they will derive their light and inspiration.",
