    "word": "These words describe true humility of mind; they reveal a heart touched by the love of Jesus. He who has the Spirit of Christ will have modesty of demeanor, and his words will reveal that the Holy Spirit is cherished. Christians will not be bold, rash, dictatorial, boastful, denunciatory, and revengeful, but will manifest an unassuming, gentle spirit, and will show that they discern and appreciate the virtues of others.",
