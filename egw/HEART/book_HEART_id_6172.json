    "word": "Self-Sufficiency \n\n     Some who contemplate becoming missionary workers may think themselves so far advanced that they do not need all this particular drill; but those who feel thus are the very ones who stand in the greatest need of thorough training. When they know much more in regard to the truth and the importance of the work, they will realize their ignorance and inefficiency. \n                                                                           78\nWhen they closely examine their own hearts, they will see themselves in such contrast to the pure character of Christ that they will cry out, \"Who is sufficient for these things?\" Then they will in deep humility strive daily to place themselves in close connection with Christ. While overcoming the selfish inclinations of the natural heart, they are placing their feet in the path where Christ leads the way. \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\" [Psalm 119:130]. But those who have a high estimate of their own ability and acquisitions, are so full of self-importance that there is no opportunity for the entrance of the word of God to instruct and enlighten them.",
