    "word": "The youth may have knowledge of the truth, and believe it, but not live it. They possess a dead faith. Their hearts are not reached so as to affect the conduct and character in the sight of God, and they are no nearer to doing his will than the unbeliever. Their hearts do not conform to the will of God. They are at enmity with God.",
