    "word": "God wants us to show an earnest desire to save those that are ready to perish. If there is one who has made mistakes, our hearts should go out to him. We should let him see that we have for him that love which was revealed in the life of Christ. We may think that a brother has done something very wrong. Perhaps he has. But do you think that you will make him see his wrong by shunning his society, by leaving him to himself, where the enemy can work upon his mind and his conscience? We should try to come just as close to him as we can. With all the soul-winning power that God has given us, we must draw him to Christ, remembering that we ourselves have made mistakes. We have all gone out of the way. We have all had our times of trouble, of blindness, of affliction.",
