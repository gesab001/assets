    "word": "I wish you would write me just how you feel. I received your other letter and was so glad for a letter written by your own hand. Write again. We can read it if it is not so nice. Be faithful, dear boy, in prayer, and I hope that Johnny, George, Sarah and Marion will give their young hearts to the Lord fully, be adopted into the fold of Christ, and be ever ready to listen to the voice of the true Shepherd. Be faithful in all things. Be careful not to offend in word or in act. Jesus loves you, my son and the children I have named. Let them be a good example. Do good where you are, and to those with whom you associate. Keep learning in the school of Christ.",
