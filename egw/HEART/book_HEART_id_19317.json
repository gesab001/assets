    "word": "\"Brethren sometimes associate together for years, and think they can trust those they know so well, just as they would trust members of their own family. There \n                                                                           504\nis a freedom and confidence in this association which could not exist among those not of the same faith. This is very pleasant while brotherly love continues; but let the 'accuser' of the brethren gain admittance to the heart of one of these men, controlling the mind and the imagination, and jealousies are created, suspicion and envy are harbored; and he who supposed himself secure in the love and friendship of his brother finds himself mistrusted, and his motives misjudged. The false brother forgets his own human frailties, forgets his obligation to think and speak no evil lest he dishonor God and wound Christ in the person of His saints; and every defect that can be thought of or imagined is commented upon unmercifully, and the character of a brother is represented as dark and questionable.",
