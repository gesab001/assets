    "word": "Those who have by their irreverence and flippant speeches, removed the solemn impressions of the Spirit of God from the minds and hearts of the people, and those who have sat by in silence consenting to this wrong, have a work to do for their own souls, and to make diligent effort in seeking to work in harmony with the Spirit of God in calling the people to repentance and humiliation before God. I was shown that unless this was done there would be a falling into a similar error. Character will be attacked. Those who are ready to censure, and talk, and hint, and misstate, will do this work. Another subject will be presented for them to feed upon. They have been headed off on one point, and they will seize another person and work diligently to mangle character.",
