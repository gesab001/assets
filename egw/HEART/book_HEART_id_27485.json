    "word": "After speaking on Sabbath, we had a social meeting. Brother Jennett, who has not been long in the faith, and has been halting more or less between two opinions, bore a most decided and excellent testimony. He exhorted all to pray for the Holy Spirit, which alone can melt the proud heart. He said that he felt his heart full of the love of God. These were wonderful words for him. He rejoiced in the truth, and thanked God for the third angel's message.",
