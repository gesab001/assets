    "word": "He who claims to be a teacher, a shepherd of the flock, a guide and an instructor, should show that his perverse heart has been changed by a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. By his kindness and tenderness he is to show what the truth can do for one who will practice it. As precious jewels, words of sympathy are to fall from his lips, strengthening and encouraging and blessing the needy. Those whose hearts are filled with the love of Christ will express this love in word and action.",
