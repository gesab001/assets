    "word": "All of Christ--None of Self. \n\n     We must have all of Christ and none of self; then the promises will be fully ours, and the heavenly inspiration will enter and take possession of the soul. The soul-temple will then be fully cleansed from its defilement. Pure and undefiled religion will then be found in the heart: this is the life of God in the soul, and it will be made manifest by good works.",
