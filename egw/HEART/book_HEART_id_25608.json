    "word": "It is a great grief for true hearted souls who love God and keep His commandments, to pass through the experience of seeing men and women apparently taking their position on the Lord's side, and then when some special requirement is presented, which calls for self-denial and self-sacrifice, as the tithing question, becoming offended, and walking no more with Christ, but away from Him. These give evidence that the seed of truth has fallen among thorns, and that the thorns have sprung up and choked it. If these men and women had been truly convicted of sin, if they had allowed truth to cleanse the soul-temple from defilement, the thorns would not have had so favorable a chance. They would have been unable to germinate.",
