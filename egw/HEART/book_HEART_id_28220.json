    "word": "Those who leave their work in the service of God for some others to do, freeing themselves from religious responsibility, will not experience the latter part of the assurance, \"For it is God which worketh in you.\" I wish to set this matter before every member of our churches. The religious life requires the harmonious action of mind and heart with the divine forces. No man can of himself work out his own salvation, and God cannot do this work for him without his cooperation. But when man works earnestly, God works with him, giving him power to become a son of God.",
