    "word": "The influence of the prayer of faith is as far-reaching as eternity. The Lord will bless all who will seek Him with the whole heart, and who with humble souls and earnest purpose strive to follow the example of Christ. To those who thus seek to become partakers of the divine nature, the words are spoken, \"Be not weary in well doing,\" \"always abounding in the work of the Lord.\" He who labors in faith and humility, holding fast to the promises of God, will prevail. The greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven will be given to the faithful, believing children of God. . . .",
