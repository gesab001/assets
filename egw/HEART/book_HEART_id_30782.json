    "word": "I am bidden to say to the sanitarium family, Let your social meetings, and all your religious exercises be characterized by a deep earnestness and a joy that expresses the love of God in the soul. Such meetings will be profitable to all; for they will bind heart to heart. Let there be earnest seasons of prayer; for prayer will give strength to the religious experiences. Confess Christ openly and bravely, and manifest at all times the meekness of Christ.",
