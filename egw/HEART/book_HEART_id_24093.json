    "word": "In the letter that I wrote to Bro. Bell at Battle Creek, I would say nothing to vindicate him; but I learn that he has left you, and I now speak freely to the church. Those who would pass judgment upon another's motives, or make public what has been spoken to them in confidence, show the evil that exists in their own hearts. In drawing out testimonies from students, and leading them to betray Bro. Bell's confidence, you have shown what you would do to Christ. You have wronged and insulted your Saviour in the person of his servant.",
