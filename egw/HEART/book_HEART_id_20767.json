    "word": "What a comfort it is to know that the Lord wants us in His family above. \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). We need to cherish and exercise faith. Our faith must work. We must have that faith that works by love and purifies the soul. The leaven has a vital energy, penetrating and absorbing all the elements into which it is introduced. So likewise, the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The Word of the Lord is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword. The Word is a power as we practice it. The great change that the truth makes is inward. It begins in the heart, and works outwardly. With the heart, man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. \"Burnt offerings and sacrifices thou wouldest not.\" The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. God is not pleased with pharisaical pretense.",
