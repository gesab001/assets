    "word": "I am happy to report I am in excellent health. I have proscribed all meat, all butter. None appears on my table. My head is clearer, my strength firmer, and my conscience more free, for I know I am following the light which God has given us. I write from fifteen to twenty pages each day. It is now eleven o'clock and I have written fourteen pages of manuscript for Volume four [Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 4] and seven pages of letters to different ones besides this. I feel continually grateful to God for His merciful kindness. I will not allow one feeling of ingratitude to be harbored. When I think how weak and feeble I was when I started on my eastern journey, and how the Lord sustained me and blessed me, and returned me back in safety, my heart is filled to overflowing with His great love.",
