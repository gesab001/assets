    "word": "To the overcomer is promised a crown of immortal glory and a life that measures with the life of God. The overcomer will have a whole heaven of bliss, with no tempting devil, no sorrow, sickness, pain, or death. I desire to know more about heaven, and I am determined by God's grace to be there. Let us all strive to obtain an abundant entrance into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, where we shall be surrounded with beautiful objects surpassing by far anything that we could imagine. \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart \n\n\n             -224- \n\nof man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\"",
