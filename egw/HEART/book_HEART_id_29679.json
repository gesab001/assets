    "word": "Brother Larson has not opened his lips. I do not know how he feels. I thought he appeared some affected, but he keeps so far back I cannot tell. Many seem to be getting the blessing of faith and pardon. I called Brother Olds' name and gave him a pointed testimony. He confessed Sabbath afternoon. This morning he talked in a very humble and broken way. Brother Binghouse said he was never so blessed in his life as he has been in the last few days. Brother Warren reveals the blessing of God in his face, for it looks as if the Sun of Righteousness was beaming upon him. He bore a testimony that he never felt the blessing of God to so great a degree \n                                                                           624\nin his heart before. Brother Fero has humbled his heart, and he says he is free in the Lord and is wonderfully blessed. Brother Watt talked again this morning and he says he is gaining a deep and rich experience in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. He seems to be altogether a different man, and many whose names I do not know are coming into the light. Oh, I hope and pray that this work may move forward in great power. We must have the blessing of God deep and rich and full. Brother Olsen stands well, firm and free, and boldly on the right side. What course D. L. Jones may take now, and what course Porter and Larson will take who have been so actively engaged in sowing unbelief and prejudice, I cannot imagine. I hope that they will be born again.",
