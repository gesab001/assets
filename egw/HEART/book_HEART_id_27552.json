    "word": "The Heart-searcher knows the cruel power of the enemy and the weakness of the human heart. He knows how untiringly the enemy seeks to gain control of children and youth, and how often he is aided in his efforts by the neglect of fathers and mothers. Oh, how many families there are where the children, their temporal needs abundantly supplied, are allowed to grow up without a knowledge of the Saviour. Their spiritual needs are neglected. God is not in the home. His place is filled by the enemy.",
