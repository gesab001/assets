    "word": "Ministers are but men; and God has said that one man's mind and judgment is not to control another man's mind. Let the graces of our Elder Brother be copied. With heart and spirit, and all the power that piety and art can bestow, do true, faithful work. Show thyself an example by working earnestly for the Master, drawing all men to Christ. Thy work is but to proclaim; God's work is to convert the barren hearts of men.",
