    "word": "May 14, 1892. The past night has been one of great tediousness. I was obliged to get up six times to change my position, for my back and limbs were full of pain.

But the Lord is good, and He draws near to me as I lift up my heart in prayer to Him, beseeching Him for grace and for restoration to health.",
