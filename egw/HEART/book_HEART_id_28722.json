    "word": "When you start out, the enemy may put into your minds some cheap, common, sensual thought; but lift your souls to Jesus Christ and think of His purity, and they will not long remain. Talk of His glory, think of His life; and when affliction comes to you, let it prove you to be God's workmen, working out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Then talk of His glory, and let your soul be full of the love of Jesus, and your hearts be uplifted to God every morning and noon and evening and if we fight the good fight of faith we shall come off victorious.--Ms. 3, 1889. (MR 900.15)",
