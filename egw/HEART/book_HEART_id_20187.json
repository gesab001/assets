    "word": "O how my heart is grieved as I see men who have had great opportunities seeking to place in a circumscribed sphere, someone, who, with encouragement, might develop to fill a position of great usefulness. The Lord makes use of vessels both large and small. Many whose lives are filled with activity and earnestness need from others counsel and encouragement, and words of approval. God looks with pleasure upon the improvement made by His children as they help and encourage one another.",
