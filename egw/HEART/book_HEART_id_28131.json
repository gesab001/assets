    "word": "Happiness is not dependent on the frivolities and dissipations of the world. When the door of the heart is opened to the love of Jesus, there are opened fountains of pure and never-ceasing joy in the soul. Jesus has said. \"These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full\" (John 15:11). We have a precious, loving Saviour, who wants us to find our happiness in Him, because the happiness He gives is not fluctuating but enduring. The religion of Jesus Christ never makes its possessor unhappy, never creates gloom or despondency. God calls on every soul to enter His way of peace \n\n\n                                     -290- \n\nand find rest in placing all their burdens upon Him.",
