    "word": "The Righteousness of Christ, Our Immediate Need--Many feel that their faults of character make it impossible for them to meet the standard that Christ has erected; but all such ones have to do is to humble themselves at every step under the mighty hand of God. Christ does not estimate the man by the amount of work he does, but by the spirit in which the work is performed. When He sees men lifting the burdens, trying to carry them in lowliness of mind, with distrust of self, and with reliance upon Him, He adds to their work His perfection and sufficiency, and it is accepted of the Father. We are accepted in the Beloved. The sinner's defects are covered by the perfection and fullness of the Lord our righteousness. Those who with sincere will, with contrite heart, are putting forth humble efforts to live up to the requirements of God, are looked upon by the Father with pitying, tender love. He regards such as obedient children, and the righteousness \n\n\n                                    -285- \n\nof Christ is imputed to them. . . . O, may the Lord imbue me with His Holy Spirit constantly that I may present the attractions of Christ so as to engross the whole mind of those for whom I labor! O, that my brethren might appreciate the promises of God in all their breadth and fullness! Then they might be saved from themselves, from self-confidence, criticism, unbelief, and pharisaism. Then self-exaltation would not be increasing, but decreasing; spiritual pride undone.",
