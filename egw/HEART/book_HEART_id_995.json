    "word": "Jesus said to winds and waves, to the troubled waters, \u201cPeace, be still.\u201d Oh, how many times have we in our experience been in a similar position as were these disciples. How many times has Christ revealed Himself to us and turned our sorrow into joy. Oh, powerful Redeemer, gracious and compassionate Saviour, able with Thine infinite power to calm all tempests, able to revive all hearts. He is our Redeemer. We may trust Him in the storm as well as the sunshine.\u2014Letter 5, 1876.",
