    "word": "MR No. 951 - Testimony to Battle Creek Sanitarium\n\n     The Lord's eye is over all His works and He will make a faithful record of all the deeds of the children of men. When the blessing of the Lord rests upon ministers, doctors, and the people, it will be after they have conscientiously followed the light and ceased their backslidings. When they put away their idols from among them and repent with sorrow of heart for their departure from the light God has given them, the Lord will be entreated in their behalf.",
