Some are to labor in one way, some in another. The Lord desired that the cities shall be worked by the united efforts of laborers of different capabilities. All are to look to Jesus for direction, not depending on man for wisdom, lest they be led astray. As laborers together with God, they should seek to be in harmony with one another. There should be frequent councils, and earnest whole-hearted co-operation. Yet all are to look to Jesus for wisdom, not depending upon men alone for direction. 9T 09.",
