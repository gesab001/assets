    "word": "Defects Can Be Overcome.--Let no one say, I cannot remedy my defects of character. If you come to this decision, you will certainly fail of obtaining everlasting life.

The real difficulty arises from the corruption of an unsanctified heart and an unwillingness to submit to the control of God.--COL 331 (1900).",
