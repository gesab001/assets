    "word": "Now in the establishment and broadening of the work in this country, means will be essential, that we may do a large work in a short time. And the only way we can do, is, in every movement, to keep the eye single to the glory of God, so that it may not be said of us, \"They began to build, and were not able to finish.\" In leading out to do a broader work, we need, at the very beginning, to put pride and worldly ambition entirely out of our hearts. Having before us the example of Christ, the greatest teacher the world ever knew, we need not make a mistake. \"He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\" We must study the Pattern, and inquire at every step, \"Is this the way of the Lord?\" We shall certainly make grave mistakes if we do not keep self-denial and self-sacrifice prominent before the people in every movement.",
