    "word": "You should feel the necessity of approaching your brethren not with harshness and severity but with kindness and courtesy. You cut them off from you by your abrupt ways and words. The ministers in your conference become disheartened and lose their courage to do that which they might do if you did your duty to them in giving them your confidence and love. By your manner of dealing you have separated the hearts of your brethren from you, so that your counsel has had little influence over them for good. This is not as the Lord would have it.",
