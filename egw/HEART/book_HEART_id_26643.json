    "word": "How dead to all human feeling must children be who fail to realize the claim of father and mother upon them. How heartless, how cold they must be who are unwilling to remove sorrow from the pathway of the old. What kind of hearts must they have when they refuse to supply the needs of father and mother, when they have no kindness, when they show that it is not a pleasure for them to seek to make their parents' last days their best days! How can a son or daughter leave a mother to be cared for by strangers? The obligation to care for the mother is the same whether she is a believer or an unbeliever, agreeable or disagreeable. Thank God, there are but few in the world who would utterly ignore the claim of a mother upon her children, but there are some who never seem to bestow a thought upon their parents unless it is for the sake of some temporal advantage. They do not care whether they are cared for or not. The conduct of such children marks them as thankless; and ingratitude to parents is sharper than a serpent's tooth. It embitters the very springs of their lives, and brings down their grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.",
