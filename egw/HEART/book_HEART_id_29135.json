    "word": "All who have engendered this spirit of suspicion, and have created this lack of confidence in God's servants, need to be converted. They need to put away fear and jealousy, and to cleanse their hearts from the evil seed of unbelief which has corrupted their thoughts and caused distress and forebodings. Some who have had abundant evidence of the good work that is being accomplished did not do what they could for its advancement, but took a course to hedge up the way. When we learn to define aright what sin is and what the righteousness of Christ is, we shall no longer justify such a course of action.",
