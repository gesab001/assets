    "word": "The blessing of the Lord has attended your husband's labors, and he will be missed. Our dear brother was loyal to God. It was his pleasure to cooperate with Jesus Christ, to cheerfully wear the dear Saviour's yoke, and cheerfully lift the burden of obedience, doing the commandments of God. For centuries the consolation of believers has been the declaration of Christ over the rent sepulcher of Joseph: \"I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.\" Let nought but gratitude fill your heart; for the life of Jesus becomes the sustaining cause of all who receive him as their personal Saviour. Christ was the spiritual life of your husband.",
