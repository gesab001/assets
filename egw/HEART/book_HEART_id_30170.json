Jones, \n     Pacific Press, Oakland, Cal. \n\nDear Brother,- \n     Some months ago I wrote to Elder Haskell in regard to the wants of the cause in Australia, the need of building meeting houses in our cities, that we might have a place in which to gather those who embrace the truth; I urged also the necessity of entering new fields and lifting the standard of truth where as yet no effort has been made. This letter Elder Haskell read to some of our brethren in California, and the Lord moved upon the hearts of two men to pledge $5000.00 each for the work in Australia. By the last mail but one, Brother Haskell wrote to me of these pledges, stating that one thousand dollars would be sent by the same mail if possible, or if not, it would come by the next. I read the glad news to a council of our brethren, and we were much encouraged; for fields for labor have been opening in cities and other localities that have never been entered.",
