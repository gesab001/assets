    "word": "When you begin to give your minds to the work of judging your brethren, you are doing the work God has not given you to do. You are not working with Christ. God did not place you upon the judgment seat to measure and pronounce sentence upon your brethren. Satan is an accuser of the brethren, and when he can set the leaven of disaffection to work in human hearts, he is exultant. When he can divide brethren he has a hellish jubilee. I think if our brethren could see as I have seen how much wrong is done in speaking evil of our brethren there would be an entire change in the way you treat one another. You do not understand yourselves; you misinterpret words and deeds and measure them from your own finite standpoint. Your feelings, your tongues, which are not sanctified, are employed in a service and work that is anything but holy and Christlike.",
