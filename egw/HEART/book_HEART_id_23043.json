    "word": "Pray in faith. \"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\" Prevailing prayer is the prayer of living faith; it takes God at his word, and claims his promises. Feeling has nothing to do with faith. When faith brings the blessing to your heart, and you rejoice in the blessing, then it is no more faith, but feeling. How strange it is that men will put confidence in the word of their fellow men, and yet find it so hard to exercise living faith in God! The promises are ample; why not accept them just as they read? \"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\"--Signs, No. 44, 1886.",
