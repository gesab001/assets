    "word": "God seeth not as man seeth. Man looks at the outward appearance, as did Lot. God looks at the heart. The fewer grand buildings that surround our institutions, the less vexation we shall experience. Irreligious and irreverent are many of those who own landed property. They have an influence upon other minds which molds their sentiments. Evil associations are always detrimental to piety and devotion, and principles that are approved by God may be undermined by unfavorable circumstances. God would have none of us like Lot, who chose his residence without reference to his associations. Lot went into Sodom rich; he left with nothing, led by an angel's hand, while messengers of wrath waited to pour forth the fiery blast which was to consume all the inhabitants of Sodom and blot out the entrancing beauty of that highly favored city and its suburbs, making bleak and bare and uninteresting a place which God had once made very beautiful.",
