    "word": "Stand back, brethren, do not lay responsibilities on Elder Daniels now! He is not ready for them, and will not be until he knows something for certain. Leave him to pray and search his heart until the darkness passeth away and the true light shineth. Then he will know what God would have him to be. Do you think, brethren in Fresno, or does Elder Daniels imagine, that it is a small offense to prove false to sacred obligations? Shall the man who perverts his abilities, and uses his influence as unwisely as Elder Daniels has done, be placed in a position of sacred, holy trust? God forbid! He has robbed God in not putting to the very best use all his blood bought powers. Shall he be guiltless who misuses and misapplies talents \n\n\n                      [13] \n\nlent him of God to be improved to the utmost? Surely that God who will judge the world in righteousness, and with a righteous impartiality, demands his own with usury. How can he say to Elder Daniels, \"Well done, good and faithful servant\"? Condemnation will be passed on everyone who has wasted his Lord's substance.",
