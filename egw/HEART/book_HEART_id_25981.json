    "word": "In regard to means, we should have a fund set apart for the care of those suffering from consumption. If a suitable building can be secured for a consumptives' home, the work carried on in it would, to a large degree, have to be sustained by gifts. I believe that a call for means with which to purchase a building for this purpose, and to sustain the work of the home, would be responded to. May the Lord give us hearts of flesh and of tenderness and love.--Letter 315, 1904, pp. 1,2. (To Brother Wilcox, November 22, 1904.) \n\n\n                                  -287-",
