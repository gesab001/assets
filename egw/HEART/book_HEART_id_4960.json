    "word": "As the sacrifice in our behalf was complete, so our restoration from the defilement of sin is to be complete. No act of wickedness will the law of God excuse; no unrighteousness can escape its condemnation. The ethics of the gospel acknowledge no standard but the perfection of the divine character. The life of Christ was a perfect fulfillment of every precept of the law. He said, \"I have kept my Father's commandments.\" John 15:10. His life is our example of obedience and service. God alone can renew the heart. \"It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\" But we are bidden, \"Work out your own salvation.\" Philippians 2:13, 12.",
