    "word": "Under the working of the Spirit, the disciples were made of one heart and one mind. But today different opinions are entertained in regard to the value of the work done. One estimates his work as of the most value. Another supposes his own work to be far more valuable than that of his brother. But men cannot judge one another's work. The Lord alone understands the heart. It is the motive which decides the value of the action. Let all cease to measure the work of other men by their own standard.",
