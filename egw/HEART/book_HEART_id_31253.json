    "word": "Do not talk of the faults of others. Take care of your own garden. See that your own heart is cleansed by the power of God. When trouble comes, instead of getting out of patience instead of fretting and worrying, go to the Lord, and tell Him all about it. Has He not said, \"Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you?\" Go right to the Lord, and in humility of mind, tell him about your trouble. Do not go to human friends; for they have all the burdens they can bear. Go to the One who gave his life for you. You have been bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are his. Do not walk in self-sufficiency, thinking that you are capable of guiding yourself aright. \"Learn of me,\" Christ says, \"For I am meek and lowly in heart.\"",
