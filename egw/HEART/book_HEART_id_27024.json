    "word": "Brother Buckner, bring the attractiveness of Christ into your Christian service. Let the soft beams of the Sun of Righteousness into your heart and you \n\n\n                                     -146- \n\nwill be more pleasant and cheerful. If you do this you will have a strong and blessed influence on all around you. The truth of Jesus Christ is not gloom and sadness. Do not forget, my brother, that we are in Christ's school to learn lessons of truthfulness and love. We are taught in this school to have faith in our Redeemer. We must attend carefully to our own soul's necessity, improving every privilege provided for us to learn the meekness and lowliness of Christ.",
