    "word": "I was instructed to tell Brother Caro and Sharp that propositions would come to them containing conditions that they were not to accept or endorse. I saw a paper unrolled before these brethren, and one of dignity arose and said, \"Put not your name to any writing that binds you to do or refrain from doing certain things in business lines. It is not God's plan that you should sign such agreements. This document is of man's production. That which will take place in the future you know not. God says, I will turn and overturn. For you to sign an agreement saying what you will do and what you will not do in the future is not in God's order. He who knows the end from the beginning understands what is in man's heart, and what are the dangers of the men to whom God has entrusted great responsibilities.",
