    "word": "But truth will bear away victory. Those who will maintain the truth, irrespective of consequences, will offend some whose hearts are not in harmony with the truth as it is in Jesus. These persons cherish theories of their own, which are not the truth. The truth does not harmonize with their sentiments; and rather than give up their own ideas, they walk away from those who obey the truth. But there are men who will receive the truth, and these will take the place made vacant by those who become offended and leave the truth.",
