    "word": "Make Home Pleasant\n\n     Fathers and mothers, let neatness and order prevail in the home. Make home a pleasant place for your children. Remember that each day you are to gain a more complete preparation for the home that Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him. Sow the seeds of truth in the hearts of your children. Give evidence that even though your skin is dark, your heart is white\u2014that it has been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.",
