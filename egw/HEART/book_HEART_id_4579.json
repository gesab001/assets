    "word": "Health Reform Progressive and Practical.--The Lord desires our ministers, physicians, and church members to be careful not to urge those who are ignorant of our faith to make sudden changes in diet, thus bringing men to a premature test. Hold up the principles of health reform, and let the Lord lead the honest in heart. They will hear and believe. Nor does the Lord require His messengers to present the beautiful truths of healthful living in a way that will prejudice minds. Let no one put stumbling blocks before the feet that are walking in the dark paths of ignorance. Even in praising a good thing, it is well \n                                                                           263\nnot to be too enthusiastic, lest you turn out of the way those who come to hear. Present the principles of temperance in their most attractive form.",
