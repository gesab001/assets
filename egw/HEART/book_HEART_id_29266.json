    "word": "Elder Goodrich is here from Maine, Eld. Underwood from Ohio, Sands Lane and his brother Otto Godsmark; Decker from Oregon; Corliss, U. Smith, Van Horn, Sanborn, Fargo, Rubert, Dr. Waggoner and wife, many, many I cannot think of now. We do not forget you but we pray for you. We long to see the power and spirit of God working upon the hearts of our ministers. We long to see that humility which we must have to do the work of God acceptably. Everything is done here that can be done to furnish good clean bedding and good wholesome food.",
