    "word": "We are both in the decline of life. Our time to work is limited at the longest, and we have not a day to waste in justifying ourselves in acts which are not in harmony with the spirit of Christ. Our influence should be felt in Battle Creek so long as we can remain without gathering burdens upon us and leaving others to go lightly loaded. If we would take the responsibilities of the work, there are too many who would be willing that we should bear them; and when we leave them, others would not know where to take hold. It is not our work to serve tables. God did not raise up my husband and give him a new lease of life for any such work. He would have us bear the testimony he gives us, not in self, but in the spirit of Christ; and with the softening influence of his grace upon our hearts we have a molding influence upon the cause of God at the great heart of the work. The testimonies of the Spirit of God are greatly needed here.",
