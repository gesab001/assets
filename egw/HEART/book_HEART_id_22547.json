    "word": "There are so many forward misses, and bold, forward women, who have a faculty of insinuating themselves into notice, putting themselves into the company of men, courting their attentions, inviting flirtations from married or unmarried men, that unless your face is set Christward, firm as steel, you will be drawn into Satan's net. It is time that we as Christians reach a higher standard. God forbid that any institution He has planted should become a means of decoying souls, a place where iniquity is taught. Let all learn in the school of Christ, meekness, purity, lowliness of heart; let them hang their helpless souls on Jesus. Live in the light shining from the oracles of God. Educate your minds and hearts to pure, elevated, noble thoughts. \"Be ye holy in all manner of conversation.\" Whatever influence you have, let it be directed to exalting Jesus. Unless you do \n                                                                           9\nthis you are a false guide-board, leading souls away from the Truth, Life, the Light of the world; and the more pleasing and attractive your manners, the greater the injury you do to souls.",
