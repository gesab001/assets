    "word": "This work was being accomplished for the hearers, and wrongs and sins were confessed. Their hearts began to be softened, self-righteousness was seen to be worthless. They cannot understand the great mystery of godliness. They cannot understand how our sins can be removed by the Substitute, and Christ's righteousness imputed to sinners deserving of wrath. The mind faints in its effort to define it, to comprehend it. But has not God said it? Has He not plainly stated in His Word that the sacrifice of Jesus Christ does expiate human guilt? \"Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\" Romans 3:24-26.",
