    "word": "We should act our part, take Christ as our personal Saviour, and, standing under the cross of Calvary, \"Look and live.\" God sets His children apart for Himself. And as they connect themselves with Him, they have power with God, and prevail. Of ourselves we can do nothing; but through the grace of His Holy Spirit, life and light are imparted, and the soul is filled with longing, earnest desire for God, for holiness. Then it is that Christ leads us to the throne of grace, and clothes us with His righteousness; for the Lord God of heaven loves us. We would be willfully blind and stubborn to doubt that His heart is toward us. While Jesus, our Intercessor, pleads for us in heaven, the Holy Spirit works in us, to will and to do of His good pleasure. All heaven is interested in the salvation of the soul. Then what reason have we to doubt that the Lord will and does help us?--Signs of the Times, Oct. 3, 1892.",
