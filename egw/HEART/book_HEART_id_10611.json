    "word": "The Lord loves man. He has given evidence of this love by giving His only begotten Son to die for man, that through His grace He might redeem him from hostility to God, and bring him back to his loyalty. If man will cooperate with God, the Lord will bring his will into connection with Himself, and will vitalize it by His own Spirit.... The gospel must be received in order to regenerate the heart, and the reception of truth will mean the surrender of mind and will to the will of divine power.",
