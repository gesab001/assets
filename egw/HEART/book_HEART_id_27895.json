    "word": "God's Goodness. In the lessons that Christ gave to His disciples to be given to our world, the grand things of His spiritual kingdom are illustrated by the principles of His temporal kingdom. He hath established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heaven by His discretion. He is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working. \"The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\" \"He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.\" His counsels stand forever, and the thoughts of His heart from generation to generation. \n\n\n                                    -323-",
