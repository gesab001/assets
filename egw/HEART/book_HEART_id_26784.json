    "word": "Had you, in heart and life, obeyed the truth, you would now have been a man of experience in religious things. If you had improved the privileges and opportunities that God has given, you might have been a help and strength to your brethren, and a pillar in the office. But you have lost an experience which God has made every provision that you might gain. You have had light, you have had convictions from the Spirit of God, but you have not yielded to them. You have not cooperated with God and labored in the lines of work given you in Christ's service.",
