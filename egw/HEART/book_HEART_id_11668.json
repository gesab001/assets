    "word": "THE PRAYER FOR FORGIVENESS MUST BE SHOWN TO BE SINCERE.\u2014\u201cCast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.\u201d Repentance as well as forgiveness is the gift of God through Christ. It is through the influence of the Holy Spirit that we are convinced of sin, and feel our need of pardon. None but the contrite are forgiven; but it is the grace of the Lord that makes the heart penitent. He is acquainted with all our weaknesses and infirmities, and He will help us. He will hear the prayer of faith; but the sincerity of prayer can be proved only by our efforts to bring ourselves into harmony with the great moral standard which will test every man\u2019s character. We need to open our hearts to the influence of the Spirit, and to experience its transforming power.\u2014(Review and Herald, June 24, 1884.)",
