    "word": "Israel was given just such a king as they had set their heart on. The Spirit of God came upon Saul, their chosen king, and he was a converted man. Samuel said to him, \"Let it be that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.\" 1 Samuel 10:7. And it is plainly stated, \"When he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart.\" Verse 9. Here we see what God is ready to do for every one of His workers. Had Saul obeyed the Lord in all things he would have been a blessing to Israel if they had hearkened unto him. But should the king throw off his allegiance to God, then woe be unto Israel! He would prove a curse instead of a blessing.",
