    "word": "A Workers' Fund \n\n     A fund should be raised for such workers as are no longer able to labor. We cannot be clear before God unless we make every reasonable effort in this matter, and that without delay. There are some among us who will not see the necessity of this move; but their opposition should have no influence with us. Those who purpose in their hearts to be right and to do right, should move steadily forward for the accomplishment of a good work, a work that God requires to be done.--\"Testimonies for the Church,\" Vol. VII, pages 290-294. \n\n\n                                                [431]",
