    "word": "I was pointed to the time when you came to Battle Creek. You designed to do your duty, but had not clear conceptions of duty. You felt an earnest desire as you entered upon your work to be faithful, but when your heart arose against health and dress reforms you were opposing that which God had shown was according to his will. You were blinded. You failed to discern any sacredness in the matter, and took a course unbecoming your position. You opposed the change of diet, and the reform dress; you ridiculed and made light of them. Because it was J. M. Aldrich who ventured to do this, others followed your example, which brought an issue upon the subject of dress reform prematurely. Your set, stubborn will would not yield to the convictions of your conscience. Your pride would be wounded. \n                                                                           8\nYour influence was on the wrong side. I wish you could see it just as it was shown me.",
