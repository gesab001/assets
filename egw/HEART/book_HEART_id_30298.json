    "word": "Look alone to Jesus as your righteousness and your sacrifice. As you are justified by faith, the deadly sting of the serpent will be healed. Then there will be no more of self, you will have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Open the door of your hearts, and \n                                                                           1453\nlet Jesus in. Some of you have become hard-hearted; you have resisted evidence, and have despised the messages of warning, of light and truth, which the Lord has sent to you by the Holy Spirit because he loves you and is loth to give you up. As a look to the brazen serpent brought life to the dying, so the look of faith to the Lamb of God will bring life to the soul dead in trespasses and sins. The men in responsible places need the converting power of God daily. If they would co-operate with God, looking to Christ every moment, believing in him as it is their privilege to do, their eyes would be opened, and their hearts would be made new.",
