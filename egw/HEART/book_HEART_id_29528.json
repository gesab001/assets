    "word": "The men of Nazareth refused the Prince of Life. The power of God which has stirred their hearts as He read and expounded to them the Scriptures, was resisted, and their passions were stirred as He spoke truths that revealed to them their real condition. The lips that had so recently acknowledged and blessed Him, now uttered curses, and with the fury of demons they laid hands on Him, and dragged Him from the synagogue, out of the city, and thought to thrust Him over the brow of the hill. But the angels of God protected Him, and hid Him from the sight of the infuriated throng, and He passed on His way unnoticed.",
