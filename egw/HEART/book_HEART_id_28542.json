    "word": "Those who are handling sacred things in the publishing institutions and in every branch of God's work are invited to enter the work prepared to put forth the highest powers of their mental and moral energies. They are continually to study, not the will of man, but the will of God. His grace must be revealed in all their work, of whatever kind and degree it may be. Every day the proud heart must be humbled before God, lest He humble it. The success of the work will be proportionate to the consecration, self-denial, and self-sacrifice which is blended with it.",
