    "word": "Sands, Virginia, Sabbath, November 8, 1890 \n\n     I arose early and after seeking the Lord in prayer I wrote many pages.

[THIS MAY BE A REFERENCE TO THE VISION OF MONDAY NIGHT, NOVEMBER 3, OR IT MAY MERELY REFER TO HER EXPERIENCE IN BEING GIVEN STRENGTH TO DELIVER HER MESSAGES ON TEMPERANCE AND OTHER SUBJECTS.] Hearts seemed to be touched. I urged them to ask greater blessings of the Lord and to believe that He would bless, and then not to go away and waver about it. The Lord would have us firm and importunate as was Elijah and the importunate widow who obtained their requests because they would not let go. . . .",
