    "word": "Those who have the truth in their hearts are always open hearted, helping where it is necessary. They lead out, and others imitate their example. If there are those who would have the benefits of the school, but who can not pay full price for their tuition, let the churches in our conferences show their liberality by helping them. This is an important subject, and calls, not for a narrow calculation, but for a thorough investigation. The counsel of the Lord is needed. The school should have a sufficient income to be able to furnish some things to students during the term of school, which it is essential for them to have in their work.",
