    "word": "\u201cYe are laborers together with God,\u201d the apostle Paul declares. We are a part of God\u2019s great plan, bound up with Christ in God. The greatness of our work is to be measured by the power of the grace of Christ to enable us to perform it. We are to be the means of concentrating the light of heaven upon souls; we should therefore pray earnestly that the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness may shine forth. By faith we are to present Christ as a personal Saviour; then Christ will prepare the mind and heart to receive the truth as it is in Jesus.",
