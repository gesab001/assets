    "word": "When the Spirit of God is grieved away, every appeal made through the Lord's servants is meaningless to them. They will misconstrue every word. They will laugh at and turn into ridicule the most solemn words of Scripture warnings, which, if they were not bewitched by satanic agencies, would make them tremble. Every appeal made to them is in vain. They will not hear reproof or counsel. They despise all the entreaties of the Spirit, and disobey the commandments of God which they once vindicated and exalted. Well may the words of the apostle come home to such souls, \"Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth?\" (Galatians 3:1). They follow the counsel of their own heart until truth is no more truth to them. Barabbas is chosen, Christ is rejected.",
