    "word": "Every saint who comes to God with a true heart, and sends his honest petitions to him in faith, will have his prayers answered. Your faith must not let go of the promises of God, if you do not see or feel the immediate answer to your prayers. Be not afraid to trust God. Rely upon his sure promise, \u201cAsk, and ye shall receive.\u201d [John 16:24.] God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from his saints that walk uprightly. Man is erring, and although his petitions are sent up from an honest heart, he does not always ask for the things that are good for himself, or that will glorify God. When this is so, our wise and good Father hears our prayers, and will answer, sometimes immediately; but he gives us the things that are for our best good and his own glory. God gives us blessings; if we could look into his plan, we would clearly see that he knows what is best for us, and that our prayers are answered. Nothing hurtful is given, but the blessing we need, in the place of something we asked for, that would not be good for us, but to our hurt.",
