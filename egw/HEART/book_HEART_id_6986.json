    "word": "1037. The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul for whom he gave his beloved Son. . . . Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your fears before God. . . . The Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. His heart of love is touched by our sorrows, and even by our utterance of them. . . . Nothing that in any way concerns our peace is too small for him to notice. There is no chapter in our experience too dark for him to read; there is no perplexity too difficult for him to unravel. No calamity can befall the least of his children, no anxiety harass the soul, no joy cheer, no sincere prayer escape the lips, of which our Heavenly Father is unobservant, or in which he takes no immediate interest. \"He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.\"--S. to C., p. 117.",
