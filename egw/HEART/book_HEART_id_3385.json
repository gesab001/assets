    "word": "The youth need sympathy, affection, and love, or they will become discouraged. A spirit of \"I care for nobody and nobody cares for me\" takes possession of them. They may profess to be followers of Christ; but they have a tempting devil on their track, and they are in danger of becoming disheartened and lukewarm, and of backsliding from God. Then some feel it a duty to blame them and to treat them coldly as if they were a great deal worse than they really are. Few, perhaps none, feel it their duty to make personal efforts to reform them and to remove the unhappy impressions that have been made upon them.",
