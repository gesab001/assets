    "word": "The atmosphere of the church is so frigid, its spirit is of such an order, that men and women cannot sustain or endure the example of primitive and heaven-born piety. The warmth of their first love is frozen up, and unless they are watered over by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, their candlestick will be removed out of its place, except they repent, and do their first works. The first works of the church were seen when the believers sought out friends, relatives, and acquaintances, and with hearts overflowing with love, told the story of what Jesus was to them, and what they were to Jesus. O that the Lord would awaken those who are in responsible positions, lest they undertake to do work, relying \n\n\n                       - 18 - \n\nupon their own smartness. The work that comes forth from their hands will lack the mould and superscription of Christ.",
