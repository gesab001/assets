    "word": "The men who guide and instruct those who are ignorant and out of the way, need much of the patience and love of Christ. Many times their patience will be tried; those for whom they work will seem to be dull of understanding; it will be hard to lead them to act on correct principles. The truth must be brought to bear upon them to soften and subdue their hearts. Those who try to help them must have ability to lead them on step by step, realizing that they are to beseech sinners, not drive them, to be reconciled to God.",
