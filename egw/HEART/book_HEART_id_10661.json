    "word": "With a sense that Jesus is by your side, you will have cheerfulness, hope, courage, and joy. . . . Never, never separate from Jesus. He never separates from us. By the cross of Calvary He has given evidence of His deep love for us. He does not leave us to fight the battle in our own finite strength. He says, \"I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.\" Hebrews 13:5. . . . Jesus does not cast us off, even when we grieve Him; He clings to us still. Let your heart be animated by the love of Jesus to ardent activity for His glory.",
