    "word": "The church has backslidden from God. It is of no avail for them to say, \"I accept of the Testimonies,\" as they have said the last years of their experience, and pay no heed to their teachings. Some even despise them in their hearts. The leading men in Battle Creek have not walked in the light God has given. The teachers of the people have erred. The Lord has witnessed their backsliding. They have not kept their garments white, nor retained the purity and simplicity of their first faith and first love in the truth. This people who profess to keep all the commandments of God, have inclined downward, bending under the influence of the world's attractions. As soon as they began to receive favor and friendship of the world, their connection with God was weakened; their strength began to diminish, faith and zeal began to expire, and dead formality to take their place. The branches have extended far and wide, yet they \n                                                                           8\nbear but little fruit. Where much is given, much will be required.",
