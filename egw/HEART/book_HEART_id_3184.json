    "word": "As the teacher awakens in the minds of his pupils a realization of the possibilities before them, as he causes them to grasp the truth that they may become useful, noble, trustworthy men and women, he sets in motion waves of influence that, even after he himself has gone to rest, will reach onward and ever onward, giving joy to the sorrowing and inspiring hope in the discouraged. As he lights in their minds and hearts the lamp of earnest endeavor, he is rewarded by seeing its bright rays diverge in every direction, illuminating not only the lives of the few who daily sit before him for instruction, but through them the lives of many others.",
