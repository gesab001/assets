    "word": "We ought to be the most happy people in the world, because He is all in all to us. He has told us He would be a counselor, guide, strength, support and a tender, sympathizing friend. He is everything we need, the first, last, and best in everything. We want to praise Him in the morning, at noon, and at night; ever having the door of our hearts open and inviting Jesus to come and there abide. \"If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him\" (John 14:23).",
