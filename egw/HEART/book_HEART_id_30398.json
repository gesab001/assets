    "word": "Christ says to you: \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" These words mean a great deal more than many suppose.

The very first step in the direction of withdrawing your neck from Christ's yoke was revealed in your divided position.",
