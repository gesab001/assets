    "word": "The Lord Jesus never attempts to prove his teachings or vindicate himself. He speaks as one having authority, as the Source from which all wisdom flows. His word is spoken out, and the Holy Spirit's work is to find a place for that word. He is the light of the world. His own ideas are light. He simply shines, and men are to be enlightened. His work upon human hearts is not to be interfered with by men. All men must keep their place, and let God work upon hearts and minds, and enlighten the understanding. He does not want men to walk in darkness. He has given ability and talents to men, in order that they may use them and improve them.",
