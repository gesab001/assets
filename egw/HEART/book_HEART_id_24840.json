    "word": "We have an enemy, a wily foe who presents to us that the yoke of Christ is galling. He will represent that we shall have to give up everything that would afford us pleasure, that in obeying God we must yield up our own will and submit to arbitrary laws. Satan is directly opposed to the transforming work that would fit us to be the children of God and to be partakers of His blessing. It is our duty to love God with all our heart and soul and spirit in return for what He has done for us. It is our privilege to live out the principles laid down in the Word of God. Should we do so, and carry out the teachings in our families, there would be a different order of things than we now see.",
