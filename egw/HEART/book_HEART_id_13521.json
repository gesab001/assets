    "word": "6-13 (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8). An Illustration of God's Methods.-- There are gifts that we rightly proportion to the character and necessities of the ones upon whom we bestow them.

That ointment was a symbol of the overflowing heart of the giver. It was an outward demonstration of a love fed by heavenly streams until it overflowed. And that ointment of Mary, which the disciples called waste, is repeating itself a thousand times in the susceptible hearts of others.",
