    "word": "God speaks to us through his providential workings, and through the influence of his Spirit upon the heart. In our circumstances and surroundings, in the changes daily taking place around us, we may find precious lessons if our hearts are but open to discern them. The psalmist, tracing the work of God's providence, says, \"The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.\" \"Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.\" [Psalm 33:5; 107:43.]",
