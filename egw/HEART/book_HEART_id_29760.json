    "word": "I am treated with respect and confidence and faith, after the trials and severe labors I have borne in Battle Creek, and the resistance and refusal to receive the message God has given me, by those who most needed it. I have a deep-seated conviction that my work is not to be in perpetual conflict, to brace and push for every inch gained. The men who ought to hold up my hands in the work have, some of them, been laboring to the best of their ingenuity to weaken my hands and discourage my heart, and wear out my strength and energies in beating against the walls of wicked prejudice and opposition. They do not see, and I feel sometimes that they never will.",
