Christ sent forth his disciples to go to all countries and people and tongues. He is not pleased when many who are well instructed in the truth remain together in one place; for they are in danger of imbibing a spirit of criticizing and faultfinding. He desires them to engage in his work in new fields. He desires them to educate people who know not the truth. As they open the word of life to others, the Lord will move upon hearts to receive the truth, and new churches will be raised up.",
