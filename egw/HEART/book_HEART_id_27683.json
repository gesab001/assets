    "word": "My heart is drawn out for you, my brother, because God has given you talents to be improved; but you will need to overcome the defects in your character in order to use your ability with success. You have not seen and understood that the inconsistencies in your character were great drawbacks to your usefulness, and that unless you war against these tendencies, which have thus far controlled you to a greater or less degree, they will surely stand in the way of your attaining the future life. There must be with you and with many others the right discipline of the mind. This is the way to true happiness, faith, and confidence in God.",
