    "word": "Have we any of us an opportunity of doing something for Christ, how eagerly should we seize it and with greatest earnestness do all we can to be the co-workers with him. The very trials that task our faith most severely, and make it seem that God has forsaken us, is to lead us more closely to Christ, that we may lay all our burdens at his feet and experience the peace he will give us in exchange. You need a new conversion, to be sanctified \n                                                                           32\nthrough the truth, to become in spirit like a little child, meek and humble, relying wholly upon Christ as your Redeemer. While you retain your self-sufficient spirit, you will be miserable, poor, blind and naked. Your pride and independence is closing your heart to the blessed influences of the Spirit of God and rendering your heart as unimpressible as the hard-beaten highway.",
