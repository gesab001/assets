    "word": "I praise the Lord. This morning I slept until four o'clock. There was not the usual awakening through the night. This is a great blessing to me, for which I am thankful. I have been carrying a heavy burden so long as I consider the spiritual condition of the people of God, moving so far below their privilege. I lie awake pleading with my heavenly Saviour to come to our help and raise up messengers that shall bear a message decidedly to the point. \"Thy word is truth\" (John 17:17). I long for physical strength and power that out of the abundance of the heart moved by the Holy Spirit the mouth may speak.",
