    "word": "\u201cThe Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.\u201d James 5:11. He waits with unwearied love to hear the confessions of the wayward and to accept their penitence. He watches for some return of gratitude from us, as the mother watches for the smile of recognition from her beloved child. He would have us understand how earnestly and tenderly His heart yearns over us. He invites us to take our trials to His sympathy, our sorrows to His love, our wounds to His healing, our weakness to His strength, our emptiness to His fullness. Never has one been disappointed who came unto Him. \u201cThey looked unto Him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.\u201d Psalm 34:5.",
