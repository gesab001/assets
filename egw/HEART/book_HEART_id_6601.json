    "word": "The prophet Isaiah, looking forward to the time of Satan's overthrow, exclaims: \u201cHow art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cast down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations.\u201d \u201cThou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into Heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.\u201d \u201cI will be like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?\u201d [Isaiah 14:12-17.]",
