    "word": "Now, Sister Butler, it is your solemn duty before God to learn the eloquence of silence; to have far less words, and to close your heart to these suspicious jealousies. If you do this the Lord will be your helper. The peace of Christ will pervade your soul. This unjust criticism is just as much a sin as any other fault, and it is offensive to God. I hope you will both place yourselves where you will think no evil. The grace of Christ must come into the soul, then it will be revealed in the character. Be careful, I beseech of you, be careful that you be not found on the enemy's side, doing the enemy's work, while you think you are doing God service.",
