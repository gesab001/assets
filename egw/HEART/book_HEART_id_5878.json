    "word": "God has repeatedly shown that persons should not be encouraged into the field without unmistakable evidence that he has called them. The Lord will not intrust the burden for his flock to unqualified individuals. Those whom God calls must be men of deep experience, tried and proved, men of sound judgment, men who will dare to reprove sin in the spirit of meekness, men who understand how to feed the flock. God knows the heart, and he knows whom to select.\u2014 Vol. 1, p. 209.",
