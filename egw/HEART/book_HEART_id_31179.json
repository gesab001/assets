    "word": "I wanted to talk this morning, and I want you to see and understand that our Lord is a just and righteous God. We do not want the constant worry and fretting and complaining, we do not want to encourage it at all. We want to just stand in a position that we can see the goodness of God. Then we will have a pleasant disposition, and your company will be that which is pleasant, and the angels of God will see that you are copying the example that they have presented before you. We want, every one of us, to have an amiable disposition, and unless you have a sanctified, amiable disposition, you will lose heaven entirely. So that the care, anxiety, instead of worrying all the time for fear you shall not have something good and nice to eat or some dresses to put on, - now it is the most foolish thing, because you want to stand in a correct position before God. There is a mighty work to be done for everyone of us. And we are to understand it, and we cannot afford to lose the lessons that are brought in. We must know what God wants to work out through us. There is a great deal of mischief done in the imagination of our own hearts and minds that we want our individual way. But God wants us to come into right relation to him. And if we will consent to learn, why then we shall see of the salvation of God.",
