    "word": "I long to be able to rest, but the burden continues to weigh heavily upon my soul, as night after night I am calling upon our medical missionary workers to seek the Lord while He may be found, and call upon Him while He is near. I am instructed to say that the teachers of our people need to have a work done for themselves. Their spirit needs to be brought under the control of God. Those who have a knowledge of the truth should live the truth. Our ministers and physicians need real conversion of soul, that they may be imbued with power from on high. They need to rend their hearts before God. A thorough work needs to be done in the hearts of the workers in every line of the cause of God. I call upon them to awake, while they still have opportunity to repent, and prepare to meet their God.",
