    "word": "If you feel that the responsibility in the harvest field is too great, there are other branches of labor before you. You can do a smaller work. And if you do that smaller work with fidelity, you are fitting for greater responsibilities and God will entrust to you larger work. Here are men who can take hold of the larger part of the work in bearing the burdens, in teaching the truth, while others are fitted for canvassing. I have thought how great a work might be done through canvassing, in reaching hearts and dropping the seed of truth. Almost anyone with an intelligent mind can make his labors acceptable, and if self is hid in Jesus Christ, he can spread the knowledge of the truth of God among his neighbors and into those large cities that have never yet been entered, for Christ will work with his efforts. It is because the lay members do not do the work they ought to do that they feel so weak.",
