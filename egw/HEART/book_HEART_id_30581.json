    "word": "The way in which the Jewish teachers explained the Scriptures, their endless repetition of maxims and fiction, called forth from Christ the words, \"This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.\" They performed in the temple courts their round of duties. They offered sacrifices typifying the great Sacrifice, saying by their ceremonies, \"Come, my Saviour,\" yet Christ, the One whom all these ceremonies represented, was among them, and they would not recognize or receive Him. The Saviour declared, \"In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\" Matthew 15:9.",
