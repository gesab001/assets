    "word": "Doctrines or Church Membership Do Not Take Place of Conversion.--All, high or low, if they are unconverted, are on one common platform. Men may turn from one doctrine to another. This is being done, and will be done. Papists may change from Catholicism to Protestantism; yet they may know nothing of the meaning of the words, \"A new heart also will I give you.\" Accepting new theories, and uniting with a church, do not bring new life to anyone, even though the church with which he unites may be established on the true foundation. Connection with a church does not take the place of conversion. \n                                                                           291\nTo subscribe the name to a church creed is not of the least value to anyone if the heart is not truly changed. . . .",
