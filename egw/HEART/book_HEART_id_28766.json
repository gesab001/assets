    "word": "When we search the Scriptures with humble heart, when we take right hold of the truth as it is in its simplicity lying open in the Bible, when we believe it to be verity and truth, the heart will warm, it will kindle with the love of God, and from our hearts we can say [\"Did not our heart] burn within us?\" We realize that again and again. When in the institutions where they have been studying the Scriptures, how the tears would flow, and what gladness would be in the heart! There was not a particle of enthusiasm, only just that which was received by the precious jewels of truth that were unfolded to the hearers. This is what we want. We want the Bible for our standard. \n\n\n                                      -174-",
