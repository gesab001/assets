    "word": "Dear children and youth, you need a new heart. Ask God for this. He says, \"A new heart also will I give you\" (Ezekiel 36:26). When you have asked according to His will, doubt not that you will receive; for whatever God has promised, He will fulfill. If you come with true contrition of soul, you need not feel that you are at all presumptuous in asking for what God has promised. Presumption is asking for things to gratify selfish inclination; for human enjoyment in earthly things. But when you ask for the spiritual blessings you so much need in order that you may perfect a character after Christ's likeness, the Lord assures you that you are asking according to a promise that will be verified.--Youth's Instructor, Aug. 23, 1894.",
