    "word": "Educate, educate, educate. Parents who receive the truth are to conform their habits and practices to the directions God has given. The Lord desires all to remember that the service of God is a pure and holy service, and that those who receive the truth must be purified in disposition, in temper, in heart, in conversation, in the dress, and in the home, so that the angels of God, unseen by them, shall come in to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation.",
