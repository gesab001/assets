    "word": "The truth received in the heart and carried out in the life will correct the erring. Let love, affection, tenderness abound in your heart. You possess fortitude, courage, firmness of purpose. You can, when you see the necessity, control your words. Study the effect of your words, whether their influence will be saving upon others. Never talk for the sake of talking, but for the edification of those who hear. Your heart has loved the truth and those who believed it. You are a lover of hospitality, and these excellent traits qualify you to exert an influence that will be saving upon others but for the lack named in this letter, which counteracts it all and greatly injures your usefulness.",
