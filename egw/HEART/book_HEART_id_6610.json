    "word": "IN EZEKIEL 9:4 AND REVELATION 7:2, 3, THE MARK OR SIGN IS SAID TO BE PLACED IN THE FOREHEADS OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD. BOTH THESE SCRIPTURES REFER TO A TIME WHEN UTTER DESTRUCTION IS COMING ON THE UNGODLY. THE SEAL IS PLACED UPON GOD'S PEOPLE AS A SAFEGUARD TO PRESERVE THEM FROM THE EVIL IMPENDING. BUT \u201cTHE FOREHEAD\u201d IS EVIDENTLY USED AS A FIGURE, TO DENOTE THE INTELLECT OR MIND, AS \u201cTHE HEART\u201d IS USED TO DENOTE THE DISPOSITION OR AFFECTIONS. TO MARK OR SEAL IN THE FOREHEAD IS THE SAME AS TO \u201cWRITE IN THE MIND.\u201d HEBREWS 10:16.",
