    "word": "Mediocre Articles.--Men of but small experience who have but little influence, can get up commonplace sermons. Some of the people read them, while others feel no interest to read them. There is \n                                                                           86\nnothing in the words, or arrangement of ideas, that melts and burns its way into the heart. Some have interest enough to read every sermon, however deficient in new ideas and interest. When individuals in process of time become acquainted with the men whose names appear at the head of their sermons, they see that these men are not all what they profess to be--that they are deficient in experience. They lose confidence in the paper, and when they read sermons from the pens of men whose names they are not acquainted with, they feel a distrust, because they have been deceived before, and although good matter may be contained in the sermons, they do not acknowledge it as food; therefore they lose much good instruction. . . .",
