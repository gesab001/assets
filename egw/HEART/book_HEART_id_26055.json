    "word": "James White Feels He Must Be \"Hid in Christ\"--Again we have had another precious season of prayer and God is moving upon our hearts and leading our minds, teaching us. Father says he will go forward in the name and strength of our dear Saviour. He will go to the camp meetings and will bear his testimony, exalting Jesus and the power of His grace. Oh! what hath the Lord wrought? Father feels now that he must hide behind Christ. He must exalt Jesus and humble himself. He wants to work in a different manner than he has hitherto done, walking in greater humility and working in God continually.--Letter 11, 1877, pp. 2, 3. (To Dear Children, August 31, 1877.)",
