    "word": "If the first commandments are loyally observed, the other six, which define the duty of man to his fellow-man, will be as faithfully observed. When God has his rightful place on the throne of the heart the duties assigned in the last six commandments will be performed as there directed. Love to God comprehends love for those who are formed in his own image. \"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother, whom he \n                                                                           53\nhath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen?\" Thus Christ taught that the last six commandments are like unto the first. The two commandments which he indicated are two great principles springing from one root. The first cannot be kept and the second broken, nor the second kept while the first is broken.",
