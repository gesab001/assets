    "word": "Our words and works are to be channels through which the principles of truth are conveyed to the world. Those who do not cultivate personal piety can not be lights in the world, but bodies of darkness. Those who allow themselves to be dictatorial, who accuse and judge their brethren, seeking with unsanctified heart and unholy temper to mend their wrongs, drive souls from God. Such believers are a source of weakness to the Lord's work, for they are not abiding in Christ.",
