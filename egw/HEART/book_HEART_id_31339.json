    "word": "The change of heart represented by the new birth can be brought about only through the effectual working of the Holy Spirit. Self love and pride resist the Spirit of God.

It is only through receiving divine light, only through the cooperation of heavenly intelligences, that we can discern the spiritual character of the kingdom of God. Only thus can we have a lively sense of the duties due to all with whom we are connected in labor, or with whom we are brought in contact. We are under contract to God. The express requirements of the Old Testament are in perfect agreement with the teaching of the New Testament.",
