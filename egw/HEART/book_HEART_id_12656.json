    "word": "He who had said to his people at the dedication of the temple, \"Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God,\" became himself the offender. In heart and life he denied his own words.  He mistook license for liberty.  He tried, but at what cost, to unite light with darkness, Christ with Belial, purity with impurity, good with evil.  Shall we give heed to the warning, and shun the first approach to those sins which overcame him who was called the wisest of men? -- Letter 8b, 1891.",
