    "word": "\"The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.\" [Romans 8:7.] In the new birth, the heart is renewed by divine grace, and brought into harmony with God as it is brought into subjection to his law. When this mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of alienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun. Then will \"the righteousness of the law\" \"be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" [Romans 8:4.]",
