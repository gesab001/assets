    "word": "Avoid Harshness Toward Erring Ones \n     You are in a position where you can do much good. As you fill your position as elder of the church, be true and kind to God in the person of the erring ones in the church. Bear in mind, my brother, that you should not fail to heed the admonition of the Spirit of God to bring into your heart all the kindness, all the tenderness, all the love of Christ. Do not cherish a cold, unsympathetic spirit. Let your words be carefully chosen. Speak and act so that you will have a great influence for good over the church members.",
