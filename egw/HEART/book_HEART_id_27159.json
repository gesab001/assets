    "word": "We have no time to lose in the work of temperance, in the restoration of the poor outcasts, the unhappy, homeless ones. The Lord has a work for men and women to do. If Christ is abiding in the heart, He will sanctify the soul temple. Our hearts will be earnest, and full of divine sympathy. Whatever we do we will do as if in the full view of the whole universe of heaven. Men and women, you may with perfect consistency wear the badge that declares you medical missionaries. This means temperance in all things, and by it you make a silent, personal appeal.--Ms 91, 1898. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 1, 1986. Entire Manuscript.",
