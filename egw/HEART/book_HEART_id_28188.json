    "word": "A true shepherd will care for the sheep and lambs of his flock. The love of Christ, filling his own heart, will flow through him to them. He will watch and guard them carefully. His tender love for his charge is well represented in a picture I have seen representing the true Shepherd. The Shepherd is leading the way, while the flock follow closely behind Him. Carried in His arms, and enfolded with His robe is a helpless lamb, while its mother walks trusting by His side. The prophet Isaiah says of the work of the true Shepherd, \"He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom\" [Isaiah 40:11].",
