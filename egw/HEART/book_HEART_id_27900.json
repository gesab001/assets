    "word": "But, my sister, cherish love, the precious plant of love. You have felt gentle and thoughtful toward the sick; not a wish or want but what it is supplied. The heart's affections long slumbering have been aroused; no service is thought a hardship or done with censure or faultfinding. But when health returns there has been a falling back in the same old cold, indifferent, loveless way. Now change this order of things. Let love flow forth freely and break down the barriers. The life may be lived day by day under the melting power of the Spirit of God. \n\n                                                                --",
