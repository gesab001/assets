    "word": "Christ says to His sons and daughters, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" But who gave you light? You did not have it in you naturally. God is the source of light; the truth has shone into our hearts, to be reflected to others. True love to God will produce love to man. This is what we need--love that is patient, self-sacrificing, persevering, intelligent, practical.",
