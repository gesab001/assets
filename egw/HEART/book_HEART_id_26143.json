    "word": "Let not those connected with the Master's service look to men of large abilities to do their work for them. God stands behind the one who does his best. Let every worker rely on His power, and He will impress the hearts of those for whom they labor. Great good may be accomplished by the sincere, humble worker who realizes that success does not depend on appearances, but on the One who has given him his commission.",
