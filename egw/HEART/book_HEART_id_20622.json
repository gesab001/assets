Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.\u201d When you make God your trust, when you call upon Him with your whole heart, He will be found of you. \u201cThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.\u201d\u2014Review and Herald, Oct. 30, 1894.",
