    "word": "If you have in this way restricted and repulsed the Holy Spirit of God, I entreat you to repent of it as quickly as possible. If any of the educators have not opened the door of their own hearts to the Spirit of God, but closed and padlocked it, I urge them to unlock the door, and pray with earnestness. \"Abide with me.\" When the Holy Spirit reveals his presence in your schoolrooms, tell your students, The Lord signifies that he has for us today a lesson of heavenly import, of more value than our lessons in ordinary lines, Let us listen; let us bow before God, and seek him with the whole heart.",
