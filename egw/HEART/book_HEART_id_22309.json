    "word": "It is after man has received light and evidence, after he has seen the contrast between truth and error, that the struggle against sin begins in his heart.

They will discern the specious sentiments of Satan, and will refuse to endorse actions that God condemns. But he who continues to depart from the laws of Christ's kingdom displays a spirit that is more and more decidedly at enmity against God.",
