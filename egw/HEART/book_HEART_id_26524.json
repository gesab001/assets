    "word": "[Matthew 18:15-18, quoted.] \n     Jesus is united to His people by a love far greater and more enduring, than ever bound human kindred hearts together; and this love, so deep, so unchanging, is a continual assurance, a guarantee of this faithfulness to you. O wondrous love that should lead the Son of God in order to secure us to Himself, and ensure our eternal salvation, to yield up His honor, His glory, His royal throne and royal court; and for our sakes to become poor, that we, through His poverty, might be made rich. \n\n\n                                    -277-",
