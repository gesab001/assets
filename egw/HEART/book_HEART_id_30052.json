    "word": "Now, my dear children, I have sketched but a tithe of what I know to be true in regard to these matters. I present them to you. I would that you would now surrender to God. I love you both too well to flatter you. Frank, you could have helped Hattie in many ways if you yourself had stood in the clear light; but you have been walking in darkness. When pride shall die, when self shall be crucified, then Jesus will come in and take possession of heart and soul. I want you to make sure work for eternity. You have no time to lose. Years have passed, and you are not ready to die, and without a decided change are not ready to live and glorify God. No longer seek to have your way, to follow your mind and judgment, but put your hand in the hand of Christ and say, Lead me, guide me.",
