    "word": "Dear household, precious is the blessing of God. Do not feel at rest or content without this watch. Wrestle and pray until victory shall come and you shall triumph in the God of your salvation. Our hearts shall be with you. Our prayers unite with yours for the salvation of God to come to your house, that you may each seek for a deep and living experience in the things of God. Know Him for yourselves, whom to know aright is light and peace and joy.",
