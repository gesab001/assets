    "word": "It is the heartfelt prayer of faith that is heard in heaven and answered on earth. God understands the needs of humanity. He knows what we desire before we ask Him. He sees the soul's conflict with doubt and temptation. He marks the sincerity of the suppliant. He will accept the humiliation and affliction of the soul. \"To this man will I look,\" He declares, \"even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.\"",
