    "word": "Those who have earthly possessions will have a work to do, a sacrifice to make. Their temptations and trials will come on account of their property. Satan and evil angels are zealously at work to encourage in them a selfish disposition, a love of the world. This can be overcome only by watchfulness and prayer. There is danger, danger on every hand, with those who have earthly possessions--danger of their loving them too well, danger of claiming as their own what God has only lent them to advance His work upon the earth. When the truth is presented in its clearness and is brought to bear upon the heart, some, while under the warming, quickening influence of the Spirit of God, get the sacrifice almost on the altar. But they do not consecrate all fully to God, and as the saving influence of the truth wears away they lose the spirit of sacrifice, the strong foe again obtains \n\n\n                                   -327- \n\ncontrol of the mind, the love of the world revives, and again they hug it to their bosoms and serve their treasure instead of God.",
