    "word": "Why, when Christ knew the plague spot in his heart, was Judas permitted to remain among the disciples? When Christ knew him to be dishonest and avaricious, why was the bag still entrusted to him? The Lord permits men to remain in positions of trust that their hearts may be tested and their true character shown. The propensity to do wrong will be tried, and the defects revealed. If an avaricious spirit is cherished, circumstances will reveal the inward corruption.",
