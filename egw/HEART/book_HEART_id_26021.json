    "word": "Meekness and lowliness of heart is a Christian virtue, but it is no virtue for a man to demerit himself, and entertain a worse opinion of himself than is profitable. The soul of man is of such value that nothing can compare with it. He should always remember, I have been bought with a price. The price paid for man's redemption marks the value God places upon him. The love of God, the value of Christ's life, is placed in the scales, and nothing, not even the whole world, can balance them.--Letter 159, 1899, pp. 1,2. (To Harmon Lindsay, October 11, 1899.)",
