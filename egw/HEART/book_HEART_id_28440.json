    "word": "A man who has Christ abiding in his heart will not treat even his cattle disrespectfully, because they are God's creatures. One with the softening, subduing influence of the grace of God in his heart will not beat, bruise, or kick his animals in a merciless manner. He will remember that the angels of God are taking cognizance of his harsh and unkind words and his ill-tempered actions. Heaven will never be peopled with such characters.",
