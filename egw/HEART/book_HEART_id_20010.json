    "word": "The real Christian is a servant of Christ. His work for Christ must be thoroughly well done. Nothing must come in to divert his mind from his work. Other matters can have proper attention, and yet be held subordinate, but Christ's service requires the whole man--the heart, the mind, the soul, the strength. He will not accept a divided heart. He expects us to do our best. And nothing faithfully done for Him is insignificant in His sight. . . .",
