    "word": "The hearts and minds of all the workers in Sydney needed to be purified, for the spirit evidenced by them grieved the Holy Spirit of God. Some were covetous, they desired promotion, they sought to be first; they were too ready to accuse their brethren of making mistakes, attributing the failure of the work to these mistakes.

He will keep them by His power, enabling them to do their appointed work acceptably.",
