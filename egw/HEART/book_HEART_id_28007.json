    "word": "Those who are successful in working for God must obtain wisdom from on high. Of himself man can do nothing aright. And when success crowns the efforts of a worker, he is in no case to glorify himself. Those who work for God must hide self in Christ. \"Learn of Me,\" said the great Teacher, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Even in the busiest activities of life we are to hold quiet communion with Jesus; for only thus can we gain the clear discernment that enables us to seize every advantage that God presents for the blessing of the world.",
