Dec. 10, 1905. \n\nDear Brother and Sister Burden:-- \n\n\n     I have received a letter from each of you. I was glad to hear the good news of $5,000 being raised, and the interest amounting to $300 being cut out. This is very favorable. I am so much pleased that Sister Burden is in the very place that will be beneficial to her healthwise. I am continually thankful to our heavenly Father that in His providence we have been favored to secure this beautiful location for a health resort. It answers perfectly to the representation that was given me, a main building and cottages so well fitted with windows. The surroundings are very attractive. Praise the Lord for His goodness and mercy expressed to us amidst the difficulties we have to meet. The Lord is our helper, our keeper and our constant guide. We may expect that everything will not move as encouragingly as we wish in our connection with the work of God, but we will praise the Lord with heart and soul and voice. I say to you, my brother and sister, Jesus will be to us a present help in every time and need. . .",
