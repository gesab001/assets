    "word": "In every family there should be, and will be, if Christ is abiding in the heart, affection and love for one another; not a spasmodic love expressed in fond caresses, but a love that is abiding. It is an abiding principle which distinguishes the grace of love, a principle high and elevated, sacred and holy, of altogether a different character than that love awakened by impulse, a passion that is fitful and that dies suddenly when tested and tried.",
