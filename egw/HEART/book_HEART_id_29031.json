    "word": "Yet we hear that the voice of the conference is the voice of God. Every time I have heard this, I have \n\n\n             -160- \n\nthought that it was almost blasphemy. The voice of the conference ought to be the voice of God, but it is not, because some in connection with it are not men of faith and prayer; they are not men of elevated principle. There is not a seeking of God with the whole heart; there is not a realization of the terrible responsibility that rests upon those in this institution to mold and fashion minds after the divine similitude.",
