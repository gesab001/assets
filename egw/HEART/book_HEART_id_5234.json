    "word": "The Hebrews were taught how to train their children so that they might avoid the idolatry and wickedness of the heathen nations: \"Therefore shall ye lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\"",
