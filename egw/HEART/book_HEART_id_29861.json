    "word": "Bushnell, January 18, 1891 \n\n     I spoke to a house packed with interested hearers. Many outsiders were present and seemed to be deeply moved as I spoke to the people. I presented the law and gospel in perfect harmony. I had great freedom. The influence of the Spirit of God impressed hearts. But how hard for the heart that has been filled with prejudice to reason candidly! I told the people that there was no power in law to save the transgressor of law, but here is where the necessity of a Redeemer comes in. [Quoted Acts 20:19-21, 30-39.]",
