    "word": "You remember how the mothers brought their children to Jesus, that He might bless them. At first there were only one or two mothers.

They were weary and dusty, but oh, so anxious to come into Christ's presence and receive His blessing. Christ had watched these mothers and their little ones all along the way. He heard the disciples forbidding them to come to Him, and He said, \"Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" And He took the children in His arms, close to His great heart of love, and blessed them.",
