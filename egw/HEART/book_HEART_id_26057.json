    "word": "Ellen White's Resolve--There is work enough to do, and let us hide in God and seek to obtain purity of heart, meekness, and lowliness of spirit, and to be refined and sanctified, fit for the Master's use here, and the heavenly home of the blest and holy hereafter. I will not live for self. I will not lose sight of the self-denying, self-sacrificing Redeemer. He pleased not Himself. I shall be glad to hear from you any time and will write as often as I can.--Letter 32, 1878, p. 5. (To Edson White, June 24, 1878.)",
