    "word": "In the day of final judgment, every lost soul will understand the nature of his own rejection of truth. The cross will be presented, and its real bearing will be seen by every mind that has been blinded by transgression. Before the vision of Calvary with its mysterious Victim, sinners will stand condemned. Every lying excuse will be swept away. Human apostasy will appear in its heinous character. Men will see what their choice has been. . . . When the thoughts of all hearts shall be revealed, both the loyal and the rebellious will unite in declaring, \"Just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? . . . for thy judgments are made manifest.\"",
