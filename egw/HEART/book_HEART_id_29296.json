[MORNING TALK \n                      AT MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., OCT. 18, 1888.] \n\n                                               -\n\n                              By Mrs. E. G. White. \n\n                                              -\n\n     I hope that at the beginning of this meeting our hearts may be impressed with the positive statement of our Saviour, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" We have a great and solemn truth committed to us for these last days, but a mere assent to and belief in this truth will not save us. The principles of the truth must be interwoven with our character and life. We should cherish every ray of light that falls upon our pathway, and live up to the requirements of God. We should grow in spirituality. We are losing a great deal of the blessing we might have at this meeting, because we do not take advance steps in the Christian life, as our duty is presented before us; and this will be an eternal loss.",
