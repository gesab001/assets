    "word": "With Singleness of Heart \n\n     Christ is calling all who claim to believe in Him to reveal by their own example of self-denial and temperance in all things, the virtues of His character. He asks them, by an example of obedience to the truth, to bind souls to Him. The Saviour's example of self-denial and self-sacrifice is to be kept before the patients in the most attractive light. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" The Saviour's sacrifice, His taking human nature, His rejection by the people whom He came to bless, His uncomplaining sufferings, and especially His daily life of self-denial, are to be kept constantly before their minds.",
