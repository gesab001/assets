    "word": "I found on reaching the mission two letters, one from yourself, and one from Brother ----- in reference to our coming to -----. My Brother, you well understand your position in reference to me and my work while in the conference at Minneapolis. There has been no change in my ideas and views of the condition of things among our ministering brethren. The testimony I bore in that conference is the same testimony I have borne before and since that conference convened. The Lord imparted His spirit to me in a special manner on that occasion, but I have not had one question in reference to my duty in bearing to you the message I did; but you did not recognize the voice of the true shepherd speaking through his servant. Again and again did I bear my testimony to those assembled, in a clear and forcible manner, but that testimony was not received. When I came to Battle Creek, I repeated the same testimony in the presence of Elder Butler, but there was not one who had the courage to stand \n                                                                           252\nby my side and help Elder Butler to see that he, as well as others, had taken wrong positions, and had misapprehended my words, and had false ideas in reference to my position and work. The prejudice of Elder Butler was greater after hearing the various reports from our ministering brethren at that meeting in Minneapolis. Elder Butler presented the matter before me in a letter stating that my attitude at that conference just about broke the hearts of some of our ministering brethren at that meeting.",
