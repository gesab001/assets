    "word": "Jesus did not despise their tears, but the sympathy which they expressed wakened a deeper chord of sympathy in His own heart for them. He forgot His own grief in contemplating the future fate of Jerusalem. Only a short time ago the people had cried out, \"His blood be on us and on our children.\" How blindly had they invoked the doom they were soon to realize! Many of the very women who were weeping about Jesus were to perish with their children in the siege of Jerusalem.--3SP 151 (1878).",
