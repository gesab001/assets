    "word": "All heaven is interested in the salvation of the human race; what are you doing for yourselves, brethren? While from the light of the cross of Calvary you obtain a view of the great love of God for man, do not build yourselves up in self-esteem; but in humility of soul stand before God as prisoners of hope. Why not be in earnest in your efforts for eternal life? Why not manifest a perseverance and an intensity of desire proportionate to the value of the object of which you are in pursuit? Instead of doing this, many now engage in the work of God at will, and let it alone at pleasure. They thus invite Satan to come in and take possession of their hearts.",
