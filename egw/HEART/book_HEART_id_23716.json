    "word": "20. \"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.\" Compare your words and works with these words of inspiration, and see if you can be pleased with the comparison. If you had let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly, if you had searched the Bible for truth as men seek for hidden treasure, you would have had a precious experience, and as you contemplated the living oracles, daily you would have discovered new beauty in the inspired utterances, and your thoughts and words would have been purified, even as precious metal is purified and refined from dross in the fire of the furnace.",
