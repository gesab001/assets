    "word": "The great responsibility bound up in the use of the gift of speech is plainly made known in the Word of God. \"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned\" (Matthew 12:37), Christ declared. And the psalmist asks, \"Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour\" (Psalm 15:1-3).",
