    "word": "Dear youth, be earnest, be persevering. \"Gird up the loins of your mind.\" Stand like Daniel, the faithful Hebrew, who purposed in his heart to be true to God. Do not disappoint your parents and friends. And there is Another to be remembered. Do not disappoint Him who so loved you that He gave His life to make it possible for you to be co-laborers with God.",
