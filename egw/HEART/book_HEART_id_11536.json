    "word": "IN PRAYER WE SENSE THE PRESENCE OF JESUS.\u2014If we keep the Lord ever before us, allowing our hearts to go out in thanksgiving and praise to Him, we shall have a continual freshness in our religious life. Our prayers will take the form of a conversation with God as we would talk with a friend. He will speak His mysteries to us personally. Often there will come to us a sweet joyful sense of the presence of Jesus.\u2014(Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 129.)",
