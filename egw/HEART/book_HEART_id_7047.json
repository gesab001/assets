    "word": "Christ came to break the yoke from off the necks of the oppressed, to strengthen the weak, to comfort those who mourn, to set at liberty those who are bound, and to bind up the broken-hearted. The servants of Christ are to take the work where he left it when he ascended, and carry it forward in his name. But it is Satan's constant aim to so shape circumstances that the workers will become disconnected from God, and labor in their own spirit and in their own strength.",
