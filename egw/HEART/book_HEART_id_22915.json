    "word": "Steadfastly True to Principle \n\n     Daniel, the Hebrew captive, was exposed in his youth to the allurements of the king's court; yet he remained true to the principles taught him by his fathers. He purposed in his heart that he would not eat of the luxuries of the king's table, or drink of his wines. This purpose was not formed without due reflection and earnest prayer, and when once his position was taken, he was not to be moved from it. Though surrounded by temptations to self-indulgence and dissipation, he would not consent to violate his conscience. He made God his strength; his mind was not enervated by habits of indulgence, which crush out true, godlike manhood; and he was prepared to attain both moral and intellectual greatness.",
