    "word": "There are sermons preached in order to excuse God and make it all right on his side that He should require this offering of Abraham. Now all these discourses imply a question whether God should require this of Abraham. God has a right to every one of us, and it is not for anyone to question whether it is right, whether God should take this course or that course with us. Those who have perfect confidence in the Lord God of heaven will never question any of His dealings with His children. He has important experiences to give His children and He gives them this experience in His own way. Now Abraham verily believed and made the sacrifice to all intents and purposes in his heart. And that very faith was counted to him for righteousness. He thought and taught Isaac that God was able to raise him up from the dead and could see the end from the beginning. This is the very faith that we should have, every one of us, in the Lord God of heaven. We have the history of Abraham, and the ground the Lord \n\n\n                                -120- \n\nbrought him over, in order to give us strength and courage and faith. The Lord wants every one of us to believe that He is the very best friend we have. Abraham trusted God at every step and his faith was perfect. . . .",
