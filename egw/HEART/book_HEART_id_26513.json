    "word": "As a people we have become weak and dwarfed in religious growth, because we have sought the strength of finite, erring men, when we might have had the strength of an unerring, infinite God. The displeasure of God is upon the churches in every conference, because they do not come to Jesus and learn of Him, seeking for that wisdom which He alone can give. Ministers who have labored zealously in the work have gone prematurely to the grave, because church members have clung to them, making them responsible for the work which God alone could do. They have not been able to do all that should have been done to teach the people the way of the Lord, to point them to Him who is man's sure Helper. Why do we not go to the mighty Helper, instead of to weak, erring man? Why do we place man where God should be? Let every church member closely examine his own heart, and see if he really has confidence in the promises of God. . . .",
