    "word": "Those who have put on Christ by baptism, \n                                                                           8\nand have by this act shown their separation from the world, and have covenanted to walk in newness of life, should not set up idols in their hearts. Those who have once rejoiced in the evidence of sins forgiven, who have tasted of a Saviour's love, and then persist in uniting with the foes of Christ, and reject the perfect righteousness Jesus offers them, and choose the ways that he has condemned, will be more severely judged than heathen who have never had the light and never known God or his laws. Those who refuse to follow the light God has given them, and choose the amusements, vanities, and follies, of the world, and refuse to conform their conduct to the just and holy requirements of God's law, the sin on their part is most aggravating in the sight of God. Their guilt and their wages will be proportionate to the light and the privileges they have had.",
