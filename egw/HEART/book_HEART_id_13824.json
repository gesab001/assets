    "word": "In this second epistle to the church, the apostle expressed his joy at the good work which had been wrought in them: \"Though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent\"--when tortured with fear that his words would be despised, and half regretting \n                                                                           177\nthat he had written so decidedly and severely. He continues: \"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of.\" That repentance which is produced by the influence of divine grace upon the heart, will lead to the confession and forsaking of sin. Such were the fruits which the apostle declares had been manifested by the Corinthian church: \"What carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal.\"",
