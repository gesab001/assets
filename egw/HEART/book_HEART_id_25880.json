    "word": "I found my affections so strongly entwined with these little ministers of kindness and mercy, that I was loathe to separate from them. If these little ones are not Christ's lambs, I do not know where we will find the lambs of Christ's fold. Oh, what may not be done with the little ones by instructing them early.
