    "word": "When you are in trouble and difficulty, and hardly know what to do, open your Bible to the fourteenth chapter of John, and read the promise that it contains. Read the promises to the children at family worship. Present these wonderful truths so that their young minds will comprehend. \"I will not leave you comfortless. \" Do you believe this as the word of God? Do you lay hold of God's promises and present them to the members of your family? When you do this, you will have peace and hope and rejoicing. You may be discouraged, you may be disheartened, but you have God's promise that He will not leave you comfortless. I believe this, for I have proved it.",
