    "word": "Now brethren, we do not want to act as some have done. I have heard of a man who was about to cross a bridge, and he asked, \"Is this bridge safe?\" One said, \"I have crossed several times, but it was not very safe; however, after all, I passed over without harm.\" He went quite near to the bridge, when another man approached, gesticulating earnestly and crying out, \"Don't go over that bridge; if you go on it there is danger there. It is unsafe.\" We are compelled to think the man understood the condition of the bridge, felt it was not safe to venture on it. Why did the second man stop him, and not the first? Because the second was thoroughly in earnest. He had the other's welfare at heart.",
