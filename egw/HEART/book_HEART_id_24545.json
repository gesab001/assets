    "word": "Those who thus practice the truth, will know that there is a love, stronger, deeper, more constraining than the natural love of a mother to her son,--it is the love of the Saviour to the saved, and their love to Him in return. Truth occupies the citadel of the soul, and should the Saviour search the temple, He would find no buyers and sellers to condemn; for God is enthroned in the heart. The Lord has promised, \"A new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. . . .And cause you to walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep My judgments. . . .And ye shall be My people, and I will be your God\" (Ezekiel 36:26-28).",
