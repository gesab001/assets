    "word": "As I try to speak to the people, I fear the effect of the ill-ventilated halls. At Ballarat, before speaking on the Sabbath, I was somewhat exhausted. On entering the hall I perceived that the air was foul. I made my way to the platform, but found that the action of my heart was feeble, and felt that I was about to sink. I called to May to come to me from the congregation. She helped me into an adjoining toilet room where, by using water freely on my head and face, I was revived so as to return to the hall. Meanwhile the doors and windows had been opened and the air was changed, so that I was able to speak to the people.",
