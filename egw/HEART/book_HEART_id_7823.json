I told them that I dared not venture unless the Lord should strengthen me for the task. They prayed for me, and the clouds were scattered, yet I did not obtain that strength I so much desired. I resolved to walk out by faith and go, clinging to the promise, \u2018My grace is sufficient for you.\u2019 God had been my helper hitherto, and why should I now doubt?

It will cause me to feel my dependence upon God, and to walk tremblingly before him.\u2019 On that journey our faith was tried, but we obtained the victory. My strength increased, and I could rejoice in God. All the strength the Lord had given me was needed to labor in New York.
