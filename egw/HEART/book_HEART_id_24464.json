    "word": "\"In a most remarkable manner, the Lord wrought upon the heart of Marcus Lichtenstein, and directed the course of this young man to Battle Creek, that he might there be brought under the influence of the truth, and be converted;.... His education in the Jewish religion would have qualified him to prepare publications. His knowledge of Hebrew would have been a help to the office in the preparation of publications through which access could be gained to a class that otherwise could not be reached. It was no inferior gift that God gave to the Office in Marcus.\" - Testimonies for the Church, Vol. III, page 206.",
