    "word": "Those who labor hardest to secure their own happiness are miserable. Those who forget self in their interest for others have reflected back upon their own hearts the light and blessings they dispense to them. . . . All that we have is given us on trust. Yet when He rewards us with His approval it is as though the merit were our own: \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" It is not the greatness of the work which we do, but the love and fidelity with which we do it, that wins the approval of the Saviour.",
