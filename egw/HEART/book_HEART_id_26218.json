I do not want those who have closed the door of their hearts to light to have any occasion to feel that they are right in criticizing you and Brother [E. J.] Waggoner and Brother [W. W.] Prescott. I have a great desire that you shall show Christlike wisdom in every movement.--Letter 35, 1895, p. 7. (To A. T. Jones, Nov. 21, 1895.)",
