    "word": "Brother Burden, say to the church that the Lord will manifest Himself to all who seek Him with humble hearts. The end of all things is at hand. Let your eyes be fixed upon Christ. As the called and chosen of God, we must represent truth in its purity. Our lives are to be such that the world will take knowledge of us that we have been with Christ, and that truth may seem to them more desirable than error.",
