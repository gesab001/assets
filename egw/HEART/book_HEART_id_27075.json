    "word": "Brother Haskell, read this instruction to the church at Nashville and at other places. Tell them that if they will read the Bible and walk in its counsels and directions, there will not be the difficulties to contend with that they have now. In our institutions and in our churches, there needs to be an entire change of action in dealing with those who are in fault. Let the sympathy and love of Christ come in, and the still, cold heart will be melted by His grace, and a heavenly atmosphere will pervade the church.",
