    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 30, 1892. I praise the Lord this morning for His goodness and mercy. In the night season He reveals Himself to me as full of tender compassion. He encourages me with His sympathy to trust in His love. I know that He does all things well, and that I must be patient and wait for His salvation. The Lord is good. His praise shall be in my heart and on my lips.",
