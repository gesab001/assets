    "word": "The lawyer who came to Christ with the question, \"Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" thought to catch Christ, but Jesus laid the burden back upon the lawyer. \"What is written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.\" Then said Christ, \"Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live\" (Luke 10:25-28). These words meet the individual cases of all. Are we willing to comply with the conditions? Will we obey God and keep His commandments? Will we be doers of the Word and not hearers only? God's law is as immutable and unchangeable as His character. Whatever men may say or do to make it void does not change its claims or release them from their obligation to obey.",
