Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat \n                                                                           30\nand drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of.\"",
