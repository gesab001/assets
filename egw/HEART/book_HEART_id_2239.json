    "word": "In the epistle to the Hebrews is pointed out the singlehearted purpose that should characterize the Christian's race for eternal life. . . . Envy, malice, evil thinking, evilspeaking, covetousness --these are weights that the Christian must lay aside if he would run successfully the race for immortality. Every habit or practice that leads into sin and brings dishonor upon Christ must be put away, whatever the sacrifice. . . . \"Know ye not,\" Paul asked, \"that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?\" However eagerly and earnestly the runners might strive, the prize could be awarded to but one. . . .",
