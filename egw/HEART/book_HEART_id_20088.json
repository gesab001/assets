    "word": "There are many who would serve Christ provided they could serve themselves also. But this cannot be. The Lord will not accept cowards in His army. There can be no dissembling. Christ's followers must stand ready to serve Him at all times and in every way that may be required. God will accept only true-hearted, level-headed, all-round men. \"He that is not with me is against me,\" Christ declared; \"and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad\" (Matthew 12:30).",
