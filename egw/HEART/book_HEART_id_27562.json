    "word": "I tell you in the name of the Lord God of Israel, while He has in great mercy and love tried to call men to repentance, the temper, the style of words, and the actions emphasize distinctly that old habits are retained. Former lusts and objects fill the heart. The tenor of action shows [that] the Lord Jesus is not molding and fashioning the character. There is want of Christlikeness. The stamp of the world is upon the man in precept and example. It cannot be said intelligently and truly that from them sounded the word of the Lord so that we need not to speak anything. The whole appearance of the man is bearing the worldly stamp. There is a vagueness, an undefined expression, a turning, an uncertainty. It cannot be said in answer full and clear, distinct and comprehensive, Ye turned away from your idols to God.",
