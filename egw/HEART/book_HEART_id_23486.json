When the trial has been fully made, there will come a blessed result. Those who have sought to do God's will, having laid out every talent to the best advantage, become wise in working for the kingdom of God. They learn lessons of the greatest consequence to them, and \n                                                                           22\nthey will feel the highest happiness of a rational mind. This is the result that will surely come if you fulfill the purpose of God. Peace and intelligence and grace will be given. It is the design of God that we should all glorify him, regarding his service as the chief end of our existence. The work that God calls you to do he will make a blessing to you. Your heart will be more tender, your thoughts more spiritual, your service more Christlike. \"If ye abide in me,\" Jesus said, \"and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\" In considering these things my spirit rejoices in God.",
