In the days of Christ, when he proclaimed his mission, all bare witness, and wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. But the unbelief whispered by Satan began to work, and they said, \"Is not this Joseph's son?\" When the Lord Jesus perceived their questioning unbelief, and saw that his gracious words were fading from their minds, he said unto them \n\n                          - 21 - \n\n\"Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.\" Then Christ stated facts to them, and said, \"Verily I say unto you, . . . many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; but unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.\"",
