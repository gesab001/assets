    "word": "The wonderful love of God, manifest in Christ, is the science and the song of all the heavenly universe. Should it not call forth from us gratitude and praise? . . . When the blessed light of the Sun of Righteousness shines into our hearts, and we rest in peace and joy in the Lord, then let us praise the Lord. . . . Let us praise Him not in words only but by the consecration to Him of all that we are and all that we have.",
