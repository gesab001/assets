    "word": "The Lord estimates every weight before He allows it to rest upon the heart of those who are laborers together with Him.  Jesus has borne sorrows and burdens, and He knows just what they are.  He has His eye upon every laborer. \"The Lord telleth the number of the stars,\" and yet \"He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.  The Lord invites you to roll your burden on Him for He carries you on His heart.",
