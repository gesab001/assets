Joseph gave his brother Benjamin more valuable presents than to his other brethren. As he sent them away he charged them, \"See that ye fall not out by the way.\" He was afraid that they might enter into a dispute, and charge upon one another the cause of their guilt in regard to their cruel treatment of himself. With joy they returned to their father, and told him, saying, \"Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not, And they told him all the words of Joseph. \n                                                                           168\nwhich he had said unto them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. And Israel said, It is enough. Joseph my son is yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.\"",
