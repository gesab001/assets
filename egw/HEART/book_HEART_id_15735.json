    "word": "Man's Great Need.--Christ gave His life to purchase redemption for the sinner. The world's Redeemer knew that indulgence of appetite was bringing physical debility and deadening the perceptive faculties so that sacred and eternal things could not be discerned. He knew that self-indulgence was perverting the moral powers, and that man's great need was conversion,--in heart and mind and soul, from the life of self-indulgence to one of self-denial and self-sacrifice.-- Medical Ministry, page 264.",
