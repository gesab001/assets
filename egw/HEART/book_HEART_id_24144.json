    "word": "You are pleasing yourself, passing away time in frivolity which should be spent with your family, teaching your children the ways and works of God. The hours that you spend in company that is doing you only harm, should be devoted to prayer and the study of God's word. You should feel that a responsibility is upon you, as head of your family, to bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. What account will you render to God for misspent time? What influence are you having over those who have not the fear of God before them? \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.\" May God anoint your eyes that you may see your peril. I feel deeply for you. My heart yearns over you. I long to see you coming up to the high standard that it is your privilege to attain. You can do good. Your influence, if exerted on the right side, will tell. Bro. Day, your footsteps are in the downward path. \"Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die.\"",
