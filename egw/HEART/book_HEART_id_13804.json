    "word": "Here the apostle has given the most successful manner of converting souls from ignorance and the darkness of error, to the light of truth.

If all who minister in word and doctrine would make it their first business to be pure in heart and life, and to connect themselves closely with Heaven, their teaching would have greater power to convict souls.",
