    "word": "Tramelan, Switzerland, December 25, 1886. There have been meetings this forenoon. Brother Erzberger spoke in the forenoon. The dedicatory discourse fell upon me. I spoke with much freedom in regard to the Temple of Solomon and the sacredness that should be observed by all in a home dedicated to God. They should remember it as a place where God meets with His people, and no angry feelings toward earth should exist in the hearts of the worshipers, for this would shut away the Spirit of God from them. This was a very solemn meeting. In the evening some little attention was given to the children of the Sabbath school. They had exercises and were entertained with recitations of scriptures. In the evening Elder Ings spoke to the people. Wrote several pages to Elder Corliss.",
