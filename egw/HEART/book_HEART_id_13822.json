    "word": "The Corinthians were departing widely from the simplicity of the faith and the harmony of the church. They continued to assemble for worship, but with hearts that were estranged from one another.

They came together to celebrate the sufferings and death of Christ, but turned the occasion into a period of feasting and selfish enjoyment.",
