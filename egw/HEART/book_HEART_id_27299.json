    "word": "God, who searches the heart, takes notice of its desires. He will forgive your past life of frivolity, your pretense, your deception, if you will now repent and seek His grace, that you may live unto Him and Him alone. \"The Lord looketh upon the heart.\" \"He remembereth that we are dust.\" \"I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their own thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto My words, nor to My law, but rejected it.\" This need not be your case, but it will be unless you turn square about.",
