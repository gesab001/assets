    "word": "39\n \n \nDependability\n \n\n     Ministers need a steady experience, not one that flames up on special occasions, then grows dim.--The ministers of Jesus Christ must teach, both in the church and to individuals, the fact that a profession of faith, even by Seventh-day Adventists, unless it proceeds from heartfelt piety, is powerless for good. Religious light is to shine forth from the church, and especially from the ministers, in clear, steady rays. It is not to flame up on special occasions, and then grow dim, and flicker, as if about to go out.--5T 531.",
