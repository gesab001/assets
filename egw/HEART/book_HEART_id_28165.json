    "word": "MR No. 1495 - Answering Christ's Prayer for Our Sanctification\n\n     (Written in May, 1900, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, to S.N. Haskell.) \n\n\n     The meeting held last Sabbath and Sunday at Hamilton, Newcastle, was especially encouraging. About thirty-five came from Maitland, and as many from Cooranbong. The meetings held on Sabbath were of deep interest. The presence of Christ was with His people. Many seemed to be hungering and thirsting for the bread of life and the water of salvation. There seemed to be none of that spirit of criticism and standing apart which weakens and discourages the church. If believers in the truth will be meek and lowly in heart, they will come close to Christ and close to one another in Christlike sympathy and love. This tender spirit will give confidence to the weak. Christlike fellowship means loyalty to Christ, in whom all are united.",
