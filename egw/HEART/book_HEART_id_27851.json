    "word": "Those who are self-seeking will not be blessed. But when men accept positions in the office, a place that God has appointed to be a great center of light and wisdom and purity, there is much need that they should often engage in earnest prayer; for there is much work to be done. They should not neglect spiritual and eternal things; for thus they would be separating themselves from the Source of all light and strength. If they undertake to do their work intelligently, realizing that it is God's work, the language of their hearts \n\n\n                                     -256- \n\nwill be, \"Lord, to whom shall we go but unto Thee? Thou hast the words of eternal life.\"",
