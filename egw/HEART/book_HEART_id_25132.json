    "word": "The Spirit is constantly showing to the soul glimpses of the things of God. . . . The Spirit's energy is working in the heart and leading the inclinations of the will to Jesus by living faith and complete dependence on Divine power to will and to do of His good pleasure. The Spirit taketh the things of God, just as fast as the soul resolves, and acts in accordance with the light revealed.--Letter 135, 1898.",
