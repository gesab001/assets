    "word": "Every unselfish action makes the character more Christlike. When self is crucified, a change takes place in the life. The heart responds to the touch of the heavenly angels. The wrong tendencies transmitted as a birthright and strengthened by education are dropped out of the life. The current of the thought is changed. A love, broad, deep, noble, Christlike, fills the heart and overflows to all Christ's children.",
