    "word": "At last the sorrow that burdened Nehemiah\u2019s heart could no longer be concealed. Sleepless nights devoted to earnest prayer, care-filled days, dark with the shadow of hope deferred, leave their trace upon his countenance. The keen eye of the monarch, accustomed jealously to guard his own safety, is accustomed to read countenances and to penetrate disguises. Seeing that some secret trouble is preying upon his servant, he suddenly inquires, \u201cWhy is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.\u201d",
