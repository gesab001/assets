    "word": "Those whom God has highly gifted carry a weight of responsibility which they must meet in the judgment. They are responsible for the improvement or the abuse of their talents. If the steward is not faithful, he will be challenged and condemned for corrupting his power and dishonoring his God. We are trading upon God's property. Are we presenting Christ in character? When we seek to reveal the character of Christ, accepting the gift of the Holy Spirit, God will work with us. We will be Christlike. No rebuffs, no harsh, stinging, condemnatory \n\n\n                                 -205- \n\nwords will come from our lips. We will not lock the door of our hearts against the Holy Spirit's entrance. When God works, we will not say, \"It is fanaticism.\" No guile will be found on our lips. We will be holy in all manner of conversation, serving God with singleness of purpose. Then we shall be prepared for a pleasant day of reckoning.",
