    "word": "A Pledge Made to God Is Binding and Sacred\nEveryone is to be his own assessor and is left to give as he purposes in his heart. But there are those who are guilty of the same sin as\n280\nAnanias and Sapphira, thinking that if they withhold a portion of what God claims in the tithing system the brethren will never know it. Thus thought the guilty couple whose example is given us as a warning. God in this case proves that He searches the heart. The motives and purposes of man cannot be hidden from Him. He has left a perpetual warning to Christians of all ages to beware of the sin to which the hearts of men are continually inclined.",
