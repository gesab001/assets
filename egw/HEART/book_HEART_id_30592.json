    "word": "The Lord will not accept a heartless service, a round of ceremonies that are really Christless. His children must be lively stones in God's building. If all would give themselves unreservedly to God, if they would cease to study and plan for their amusements, for excursions and pleasure loving associations, and would study the words, 'Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's,' they would never hunger and thirst for excitement or change. If it is for our true interest to be spiritual, if the salvation of our soul depends on being riveted on the eternal book, had we not better be engaged in seeking for that which will hold the whole building to the chief corner stone, that we may not be confused and confounded in our faith?",
