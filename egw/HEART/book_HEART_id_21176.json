    "word": "Varied Messages for Different Audiences--His [Jesus'] messages of mercy were varied to suit His audience. He knew \"how to speak a word in season to him that is weary\" (Isaiah 50:4); for grace was poured upon His lips, that He might convey to men in the most attractive way the treasures of truth. He had tact to meet the prejudiced minds, and surprise them with illustrations that won their attention. Through the imagination He reached the heart.--DA 254.",
