    "word": "82\nNo one can truly confess Christ before the world unless the mind and spirit of Christ live in him. It is impossible to communicate that which we have not.

If the heart is sanctified, submissive, and humble, the fruits will be seen outwardly and will be a most effectual confession of Christ.  3T 331, 33293",
