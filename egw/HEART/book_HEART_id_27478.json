    "word": "MR No. 1302 - A Vision Given in Oswego, New York\n\n     I saw some in Zion that were languishing; they were dormant and unbelieving. I asked the angel if Zion should languish. Said the angel, \"She is rising never to fall again. God has stretched out His hand the second time to recover the remnant of His people.\" I saw that some who meet together at [the conferences at] Oswego and vicinity were not right. They do not partake of the spirit of the lovely Jesus; they have not vital godliness, and unless they soon partake of the spirit of Jesus and have their hearts sanctified by the truth they profess to believe, they will be purged out of the camp of Israel.",
