    "word": "The workers at the Office should feel when they enter it that it is a sacred place where the work of God is being done in the publication of truth which will decide the destiny souls. This is not felt or realized as it should be. There is conversation in the type-setting department, which diverts the mind from the work. The Office is no place for visiting, for a courting spirit, or for amusement, or selfishness. All should feel that they are doing work for God. He who sifts all motives and reads all hearts is proving, and trying, and sifting, his people, especially those who have light and knowledge, and who are engaged in his sacred work. God is a searcher of hearts, and a trier of the reins, and will accept nothing less than entire devotion to the work, and consecration to himself. All should have a spirit in that \n                                                                           23\nOffice to take up their daily duties as if in the presence of God.

White's absence, there are some faithful ones; there are others who are eye-servants. Bro. Gage was one of these. Warren does not do in his absence as in his presence. Wilber does not do in his absence as in his presence. There are those in the Office who do not feel under that restraint in the absence of my husband that they do when he is present. This is the case with several, but not with all.",
