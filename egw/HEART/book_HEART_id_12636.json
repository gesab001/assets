    "word": "Jesus Knows Our Griefs and Pains \n\n     June 26, 1892.  I am glad when the daylight comes, for the nights are long and wearisome.  But when I cannot sleep, gratitude fills my heart as I think that One who never slumbers is watching over me for good. \n                                                                           138\nWhat a wonderful thought it is that Jesus knows all about the pains and griefs we bear.  In all our afflictions He was afflicted.  Some among our friends know nothing of human woe or physical pain.  They are never sick, and therefore they cannot enter fully into the feelings of those who are sick.  But Jesus is touched with the feeling of our infirmity.  He is the great medical missionary.  He has taken humanity upon Himself, and has placed Himself at the head of a new dispensation, in order that He may reconcile justice and compassion.  -- Ms 19, 1892.",
