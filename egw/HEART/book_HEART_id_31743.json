    "word": "All ye are Brethren. \n\n                                       Sanitarium, Cal., April 18, 1907. \n\nElder J. S. Washburn, Dear Brother:-- \n     I am sorry that you should make any excuse for withholding your sympathy from the workers in Madison. It is true that they have made some mistakes; but they have confessed their errors with brokenness of heart, and have done what they could to rectify their mistakes. After I had pointed out to them their wrong, and they had confessed it, we prayed together, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon them. Then I could say to them, The Lord has pardoned your transgression.",
