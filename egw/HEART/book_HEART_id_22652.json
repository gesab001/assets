    "word": "God calls upon his people to awake to their responsibilities. A flood of light is shining from the word of God, and there must be an awakening to neglected obligations. When these are met, by giving back to God his own in tithes and offerings, the way will be opened for the world to hear the message the Lord designs it shall hear. If God's people had the love of Christ in the heart, if every church member were thoroughly imbued with the spirit of self-sacrifice, if all manifested thorough earnestness, there would be no lack of funds for home and foreign missions; our resources would be multiplied; a thousand doors of usefulness would be opened, and we should be invited \n                                                                           7\nto enter. Had the purpose of God been carried out by his people in giving the message of mercy to the world, Christ would have come to the earth, and the saints would ere this have received their welcome into the city of God.",
