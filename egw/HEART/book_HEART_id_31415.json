    "word": "To Brother Melendy I wish to say: If you choose to be kind, courteous, and respectful to the man who has been appointed to come into the Huntsville School and stand at the head, there to use his capabilities in an effort to help the students to advance; if you choose to be a kind, brotherly companion to the head of the school, and unite with him heartily in the work of making improvements in every line of the school work, the Lord will be pleased. Through an unsanctified course, you would work in opposition to him and make it very hard for him. But I know you can unite with Brother Rogers, if you will wear the yoke of Christ and become a learner in the heavenly school. My heart\u2019s desire is that you should do this. It is the wisest course for you to pursue.",
