    "word": "Courtesy\n     It is a very nice work to win souls to Christ. It is the greatest work ever given to mortal man, to deal with human minds. If you find access to the hearts of men bearing almost every stamp of character, you must heed the injunction of the apostle to be courteous. Love will do that which argument will fail to accomplish. Love is power. The workers need to bring the love of Jesus into their labors. Those who are young are much more easily impressed than those who have reached mature age; and if young men and women understood their capabilities, if the grace of Christ ruled in their hearts, they might be a power for good in the hand of the Lord.",
