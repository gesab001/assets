    "word": "The history of Daniel is placed upon record for our benefit. He chose to take a course that would make him singular in the king's court. He did not conform to the habits of the courtiers in eating and drinking, but purposed in his heart that he would not eat of the king's meat nor drink of his wines. This was not a hastily formed, wavering purpose, but one that was intelligently formed and resolutely carried out. Daniel honored God; and the promise was fulfilled to him. \"Them that honor Me I will honor.\" 1 Samuel 2:30. The Lord gave him \"knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom,\" and he had \"understanding in all visions and dreams\" (Daniel 1:17); so that he was wiser than all in the king's courts, wiser than all the astrologers and magicians in the kingdom.",
