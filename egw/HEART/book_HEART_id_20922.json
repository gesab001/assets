    "word": "God is calling upon you to surrender to Him. Will you not come? Will you not give Him your heart's best and holiest affections? Will you not receive from Him gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich, and white raiment that you may be clothed? Will you not allow Him to anoint your eyes with His heavenly eyesalve, that you may see clearly?--Manuscript 114, June 14, 1903, \"Duties and Privileges of a Christian,\" a talk given at Calistoga, California.",
