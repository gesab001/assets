    "word": "In dealing with the erring, harsh measures should not be resorted to; milder means will effect far more. After the best means have been perseveringly tried without success, wait patiently and see if God will not move upon the heart of the erring. Discipline has been abused heretofore. Men whose own character is very defective have put themselves forward to discipline others, and thus all discipline has been brought into contempt. Passion, prejudice, and partiality, I am sorry to say, have had abundant room for exhibition, and proper discipline has been neglected.",
