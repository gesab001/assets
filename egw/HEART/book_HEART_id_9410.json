    "word": "Man Finds Happiness in Labor.--Adam had themes for contemplation in the works of God in Eden, which was heaven in miniature. God did not form man merely to contemplate His glorious works; therefore, He gave him hands for labor as well as a mind and heart for contemplation. If the happiness of man consisted in doing nothing, the Creator would not have given Adam his appointed work. Man was to find happiness in labor as well as in meditation.--RH, Feb 24, 1874. (1BC 1082.) \n\n\n                                                      603",
