    "word": "To Abraham no mental torture could be equal to that which he endured in obeying the command to sacrifice his son. ... With a breaking heart and unnerved hand, he takes the fire, while Isaac inquires, \"Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?\" (Genesis 22:7). But oh, Abraham cannot tell him now! Father and son build the altar, and the terrible moment comes for Abraham to make known to Isaac that which has agonized his soul during all that long journey--that Isaac himself is the victim. . . . The son submits to the sacrifice because he believes in the integrity of his father. But when everything is ready, when the faith of the father and the submission of the son are fully tested, the angel of God stays the uplifted hand of Abraham, and tells him that it is enough. \"Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me\" (verse 12).",
