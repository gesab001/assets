    "word": "I want a quiet and unwavering trust in the Most High. I have experienced His protecting care in a remarkable manner when following in the path of duty. I want to go down in the grave as a shock of corn fully ripe. I want no complaining in my heart; only gratitude should abide there. God's mercy and His lovingkindness are to be kept, not as a thing out of mind, but as something so precious as never to be forgotten. As eye-witnesses of His majesty we may exalt and praise His holy name. We are with Him in the holy mount.",
