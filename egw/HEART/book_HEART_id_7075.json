    "word": "If we look back over history, we shall find that those missionaries who have gone to labor among the savages did not feel that they had made one-half so great a sacrifice as many do now who go forth to labor in a field all prepared for them. Many show that they know little of the sufferings of Christ. They have not drank of the cup of his sufferings, nor been baptized with his baptism. The Spirit and power of God \n140\nhas not taken hold of their understanding; the refining fire has not softened and purified their hearts; and the saving message of truth that they are to carry to those in darkness is not shut up in their hearts as fire within their bones. Instead of cheerfully going without the camp to bear the reproach, some choose to linger around their homes, and thus fail to obtain a most precious experience in the things of God.",
