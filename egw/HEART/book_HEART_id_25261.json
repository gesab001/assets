    "word": "\"Preach the gospel\" is the word given of God. Preach the gospel, not in high-flown language, but in simplicity. This blessed gospel of our Lord is the only message that is unto eternal life. I have been shown that there are heathen in our own country who must be instructed as though they were little children. Our lamps must be constantly trimmed and burning. Schools must be established where the ignorant can be instructed in simple ways. The gospel must be preached by teachers who reveal their kindness of heart in loving deeds.",
