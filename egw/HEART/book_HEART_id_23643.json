    "word": "Those who work in the Southern field will need to have a sanctified judgment, in order to discriminate in applying help where it will do the greatest amount of good. They should help those who will be a help to others, as well as those who may not be able to carry on very decided missionary operations. I know that it will be impossible for workers to remain in this field in a barehanded condition, and do the work that is required to be done in the Southern States. I will be necessary that a fund shall be created, so that the workers may have means with which to help those who are in poverty and distress; and this practical ministry will open their hearts to respond to the truth. . . .",
