    "word": "Meeting Obdurate Hearts and Perverse Dispositions.--Our Redeemer had a broad comprehensive humanity. His heart was ever touched with the known helplessness of the little child that is subject to rough usage, for He loved children. The feeblest cry of human suffering never reached His ear in vain. And everyone who assumes the responsibility of instructing the youth will meet obdurate hearts, perverse dispositions, and his work is to cooperate with God in restoring the moral image of God in every child. Jesus, precious Jesus--a whole fountain of love was in His soul.--CEd 149, 1893. (FE 265.)",
