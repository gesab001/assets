    "word": "\"Are you not forgetful of the sufferings of your Lord? Are you not forgetful of the estimate He has placed upon man whom He has purchased with His own blood? You seem willing to wound and bruise the hearts of one another. Is this the pattern Jesus has given you? Where is His manner of dealing? Do you find yourselves sustained in having so little love and forbearance, so little patience for your brethren? Have you forgotten the words of Christ, 'A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another'? [John 13:34, 35.] [John 14:21, quoted.]",
