    "word": "At Greenville, Mich. \n\n     Jan. 29, 1867, we left Wright, and rode to Greenville, a distance of forty miles. It was a severely cold day, and we were glad to find a shelter from the cold and storm at Brother A. W. Maynard's. This dear family welcomed us to their hearts and to their home. We remained in this vicinity six weeks, laboring with the churches at Greenville and Orleans, and making Brother Maynard's hospitable home our headquarters.",
