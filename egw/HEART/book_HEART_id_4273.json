    "word": "NOW LET US REASON A MOMENT UPON THIS POINT. ALL THESE GIFTS WERE GIVEN FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS IN UNITY, KNOWLEDGE, AND SPIRIT. UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH FOR A TIME ENJOYED THAT UNITY: \"THE MULTITUDE OF THEM THAT BELIEVED WERE OF ONE HEART AND OF ONE SOUL.\" AND IT SEEMS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS STATE OF UNITY, THAT \"WITH GREAT POWER GAVE THE APOSTLES WITNESS OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE LORD JESUS: AND GREAT GRACE WAS UPON THEM ALL.\" ACTS 4:31-33. HOW DESIRABLE SUCH A STATE OF THINGS NOW! BUT APOSTASY WITH ITS DIVIDING AND BLIGHTING INFLUENCE MARRED THE BEAUTY OF THE FAIR CHURCH AND CLOTHED HER IN SACKCLOTH. DIVISION AND DISORDER HAVE BEEN THE RESULT. NEVER WAS THERE SO GREAT A DIVERSITY OF FAITH IN CHRISTENDOM AS AT THE PRESENT DAY. IF THE GIFTS WERE NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE UNITY OF THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH, HOW MUCH MORE SO TO RESTORE UNITY NOW! AND THAT IT IS THE PURPOSE OF GOD TO RESTORE THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH IN THE LAST DAYS, IS ABUNDANTLY EVIDENT FROM THE PROPHECIES. WE ARE ASSURED THAT THE WATCHMEN SHALL SEE EYE TO EYE, WHEN THE LORD SHALL BRING AGAIN ZION. ALSO, THAT IN THE TIME OF THE END THE WISE SHALL UNDERSTAND. WHEN THIS IS FULFILLED THERE WILL BE UNITY OF FAITH WITH ALL WHOM GOD ACCOUNTS WISE; FOR THOSE THAT DO IN REALITY UNDERSTAND ARIGHT, MUST NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND ALIKE. WHAT IS TO EFFECT THIS UNITY BUT THE GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE?",
