    "word": "The Majesty of Heaven took his position, not upon David's throne, but on the seat of a fisherman's swaying boat. And here the great Teacher taught his precious truths to the multitude, binding up those sacred lessons with illustrations drawn from the occupations of men, and the familiar objects of nature around them. This gave the stamp of reality to his instruction. The illustrations there presented to the listening multitude were to be repeated through all the ages. The truths thus represented were to be immortalized and imprinted on the hearts of millions who were to come.",
