    "word": "True refinement, and gentleness of manners, can never be found in a home where selfishness reigns. The truly refined always have brains and hearts, always have consideration for others. True refinement does not find satisfaction in the adornment and display of the body. True refinement and nobility of soul, will be seen in efforts to bless others, being useful to others, seeking to elevate others.",
