    "word": "Learning by Experience \n\n     Every one must be a learner, not a graduate; he must engage in the work with a humble heart, wholly dependent upon God. He may make mistakes, but errors in judgment will be corrected by education. Defeats may be turned to victories. As he advances, he can learn wisdom through failure, caution from imprudence. But learn, not let go. Keep the dear Saviour by your side; pray always; ask counsel of Jesus.",
