    "word": "Those who love Jesus will love those for whom Christ died. If many of the sinners that are around us had received the light which has blessed us, they would have rejoiced in the truth, and have been in advance of many that have had a long experience and great advantages. Take these lost sheep as your special burden, and watch for souls as they that must give an account. Draw not a glance to yourself, but cry with earnest, heartfelt interest, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" This is the Christian's message to the world. This is the effective argument. Encourage your heart to put forth earnest endeavors to induce perishing souls to fix their eyes upon Him who was uplifted upon the cross; and remember that as you do this, unseen angels are . . . impressing it upon the heart, and leading the soul to believe in Jesus. The sinner is enabled to see Jesus as He is--full of compassion, pity, and love--and he exclaims, \"Thy gentleness hath made me great\" (Psalm 18:35) (Review and Herald, June 30, 1896). \n                                                                           210",
