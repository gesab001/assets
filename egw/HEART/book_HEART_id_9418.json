    "word": "Christ the Greatest Friend.--Great importance is attached to our associations. We may form many that are pleasant and helpful, but none are so precious as that by which finite man is brought into connection with the infinite God. When thus united, the words of Christ abide in us. . . . The result will be a purified heart, a circumspect life, and a faultless character. But it is only by acquaintance and association with Christ that we can become like Him, the one Faultless Example.--ST, Sept 10, 1885. (ML 190.)",
