    "word": "Chap. 2 - The Beatitudes\n\n\"He opened His mouth, and taught them, \n saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: \n for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" \n Matthew 5:2, 3. \n\n\n     As something strange and new, these words fall upon the ears of the wondering multitude. Such teaching is contrary to all they have ever heard from priest or rabbi. They see in it nothing to flatter their pride or to feed their ambitious hopes. But there is about this new Teacher a power that holds them spellbound. The sweetness of divine love flows from His very presence as the fragrance from a flower. His words fall like \"rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.\" Psalm 72:6. All feel instinctively that here is One who reads the secrets of the soul, yet who comes near to them with tender compassion. Their hearts open to Him, and, as they listen, the Holy Spirit unfolds to them something of the meaning of that lesson which humanity in all ages so needs to learn.",
