    "word": "You may see that you are sinful and undone; but it is just on this account that you need a Saviour. If you have sins to confess, lose no time. These moments are golden. \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9).
