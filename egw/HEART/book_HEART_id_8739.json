    "word": "To the heart of Christ the very presence of trouble was a call for help. The poor, the sick, the desolate, the outcasts, the discouraged, the desponding, found in Him a compassionate Saviour, a Mighty Healer. \"A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He send forth judgment unto victory.\" Christ identifies His interests with those of suffering humanity, and He tells us that whatever we do to relieve a sufferer, we do for Him. . . .",
