    "word": "It is the absence of the grace of Christ in the heart that causes men to make wrong decisions. It leads those who have had light and rejected it to regard light as darkness. They call error truth and truth error, because they walk in the sparks of their own kindling. God declares that such shall lie down in sorrow. The reception of the Word of God in sincerity and simplicity will renew the mind and awaken it to understand clearly the Word of God. The blindness passes away, the darkness is removed, and the true light shines forth.--Ms. 23, 1899, pp. 3-6 (March 9, 1899). \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 31, 1983",
