    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     While the president of a Conference should faithfully perform the duties of his office, it is in his power, through the grace of Christ, to be a kindhearted man. He is not to lord it over God's heritage. But it is a sad fact that our brethren in the ministry are not all humble men. They want praise from the people; they enjoy the sense of authority which their position gives them; they like to dictate, to rule. They seem to feel that office, position, confers greatness; but it is character alone, true goodness, that is true greatness.",
