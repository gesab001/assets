    "word": "The grace of God has been viewed from the outer court. It is the Lord's purpose to rend away the veil. The revelation of His own glory in the form of humanity hid in Christ will bring heaven so near to men that the beauty adorning the inner temple will be seen in every agent in whose heart Christ abides. Hearts will be captivated not by the glory of the man, but by the inward adorning of an abiding Christ. It is the revelation of Christ in the man that captivates the hearts of men and women. They behold the beautiful character of Christ, revealed by good works.",
