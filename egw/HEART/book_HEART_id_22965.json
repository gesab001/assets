    "word": "Age does not make error truth. \n\n\n     \"It is most difficult to practice right principles after having been so long accustomed to the practices of the world, but reforms must be entered into with heart and soul and will. Errors may be hoary with age, but age does not make error truth, nor truth error. Altogether too long have the old customs and habits been followed. The Lord would now have every idea that is false put away from teachers and students.\"--Idem.",
