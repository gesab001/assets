    "word": "All who desire to enter the medical missionary work, and who are worthy, should be given an opportunity to learn. We could with profit drop much of the dispensary work that is done. Giving the common treatments to the sick will accomplish much more, and will give opportunity to those who administer these hygienic treatments to labor with earnestness for the spiritual recovery of their patients. Let the hearts of all who are working along these lines, be softened and subdued. Let the workers learn to consult the Great Physician in prayer much more than they have done. Pray, watch, wait, and believe.",
