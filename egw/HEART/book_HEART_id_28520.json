    "word": "We are to watch and pray, for there are many who are blind leaders of the blind. There are some in Battle Creek who once knew the truth that are now clouds without water, carried about by the winds of controversy. They should beware lest they become trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. The solemn warnings against backsliding presented in the Word of God ought to make us afraid, greatly afraid, for our own souls. The Lord \n\n\n                                     -426- \n\nhas been giving messages to His people, urging upon them the necessity of enthroning Christ in the heart, of dying to self, of obeying the Word of God. The solemn realities of eternity demand that we do this. Resistance to the truth is the sin that will be charged against those who reject these repeated appeals--those who choose their own way and lead other souls, step by step, in false paths.",
