    "word": "God's servants must go out free. They must know their whereabouts. There is power in Christ and his salvation to make them free men, and unless they are free, they cannot build up his church and gather in souls. Will God send a man out to rescue souls from the snare of Satan, when his own feet are entangled in the net? God's servants must not be wavering. If their feet are sliding, how can they say to those of a fearful heart, Be strong? God would have his servants hold up the feeble hands, and strengthen the wavering. Those who are not prepared to do this, had better first labor for themselves, and pray until they be endued with power from on high. \n                                                                           116",
