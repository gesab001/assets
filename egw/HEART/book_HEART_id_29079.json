    "word": "You may think that you would be unhappy if you should try to serve Christ; but I testify to you that you would be pleasantly disappointed. When you choose to obey the Lord, and become one with Him, you will realize that the light of His countenance is shining upon you, and that you will see Him as He is when He comes. He will be in all your thoughts, and your heart will be filled with joy. After instructing His disciples to keep His commandments, He declared, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.\" He takes no pleasure in seeing us miserable, but takes delight in seeing us joyful.",
