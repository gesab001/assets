    "word": "It is the Spirit itself that teaches and enlightens. The most powerful preaching of the Word, the reading of the Scriptures, will not be able to transform the character and save souls unless the Spirit works with and through the human agents. The planning and devising must not be of a character to draw attention to self. The Word is a power, a sword, in the hands of the human agent, but the Holy Spirit in its vital power is the efficiency to impress the mind. \"They shall be all taught of God.\" It is God that causes the light to shine into hearts. ... The reason why God can do so little for us is that we forget that living virtue in the Holy Spirit is to combine with the human agent.",
