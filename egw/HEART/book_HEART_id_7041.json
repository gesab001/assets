    "word": "Love and Forbearance among Brethren\n     Dear Brethren and Sisters: I am indeed thankful for this privilege of meeting with those who are laboring to spread the light of truth in the various countries of Europe. It is a grand, a noble work, and one which should call forth every energy of the being. As laborers for God, we need a more sacred nearness to him, and a closer fellowship with one another, that our prayers and efforts may not be hindered. We must not expect in our own strength to meet and press through the moral darkness that is in the world but we must perseveringly labor for that strength which is found alone in Jesus. He loves us, and those who labor in his spirit will realize his assistance in all their efforts. It is impossible, even with the strong arguments of truth, to reach the hearts of men, unless there is, united with these arguments, a divine power.",
