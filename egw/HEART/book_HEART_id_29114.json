    "word": "A follower of Jesus refrains from gathering up burdens and responsibilities that he is unable to bear--burdens that crush the life-forces, and that give no relief. Christ has not given us any such work to do. We must receive Him, believe in Him, and reveal His character, showing by our religious experience that we have been born of God. Then we shall have healthy heart-beats, born again, \"not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\" The power comes to us through receiving Jesus Christ. \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\"",
