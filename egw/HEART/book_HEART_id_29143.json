    "word": "When the heart is in right condition before God, we shall deny self. Did not God give Jesus, His only begotten Son--He who was equal with the Father in the making of man?

Let the wine alone, and everything of the kind. We need to adopt a simple diet if we would have a clear understanding of our duty. Let us remember that we are living in review before God, that we shall have tests to bear, and that our faith in God is to be so cultivated that we can reach up to heaven in full confidence for sanctification of body, soul, and spirit.",
