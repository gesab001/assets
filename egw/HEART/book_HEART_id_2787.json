    "word": "It was Christ that bade Elijah speak these words to the apostate king. Jehovah Immanuel had cause to be greatly displeased at Ahaziah's impiety. What had Christ not done to win the hearts of Israel and to inspire them with unwavering confidence in Himself? For ages He had visited His people with manifestations of the most condescending kindness and unexampled love. From the time of the patriarchs, He had shown how His \"delights were with the sons of men.\" Proverbs 8:31. He had been a very present help to all who sought Him in sincerity. \"In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His presence saved them: in His love and in His pity He redeemed them.\" Isaiah 63:9. Yet Israel had revolted from God and turned for help to the Lord's worst enemy.",
