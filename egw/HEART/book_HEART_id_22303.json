I want you to wash your robes of character, and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. I greatly desire that you shall be sanctified, body, soul, and spirit, through the truth. I lift before you a crucified and risen Saviour, whom we are to receive as our regenerator. I say to you, \"Look, and live.\" It is our privilege to enjoy the abiding presence of Christ in our hearts. He says, \"If a man love Me, he will keep My words; and My Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.\" John 14:23. This is the identification that we must have with Christ in this world, if we are identified as His saints in the mansions that He has gone to prepare for those that love Him. We must know Christ here if we ever see the King in His beauty. We are to show to the world the power that comes to those who live the life of Christ.",
