    "word": "Let us press forward unitedly to the help of the Lord, all of one heart and of one mind. Let us not depend on human wisdom. Let us not lean on man. Look beyond human beings to the One appointed by God to carry our griefs and sorrows, and to supply our necessities. Taking God at His word, move forward with steadfast, persevering faith. Christ's presence and His Word, \"Lo, I am with you alway,\" is our wisdom and righteousness. It is the living Presence that makes the living Word. The kingdom comes to us, not in word only, but in power. It is unwavering faith in Christ's presence that gives power.--Letter 21, 1902, pp. 4-7. (To A. G. Daniells and E. R. Palmer, February 16, 1902.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 4, 1982",
