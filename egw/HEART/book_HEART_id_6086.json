    "word": "Christianity will make a man a gentleman. Christ was courteous, even to his persecutors; and his true followers will manifest the same mild, self-sacrificing spirit. Look at Paul when brought before rulers. \n432\nHis speech before Agrippa is a model of dignified courtesy as well as persuasive eloquence. We should not encourage the formal politeness current with the world, which is destitute of the spirit of true courtesy, but the politeness that springs from real kindness of heart.",
