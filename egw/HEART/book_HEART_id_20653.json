    "word": "Judas Iscariot, after betraying his Lord, exclaimed, \u201cI have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood\u201d (Matthew 27:4). The confession was forced from his guilty soul by an awful sense of condemnation and a fearful looking for of judgment. The consequences that were to result to him filled him with terror, but there was no deep, heartbreaking grief in his soul that he had betrayed the spotless Son of God and denied the Holy One of Israel. . . . These all lamented the results of sin, but did not sorrow for the sin itself.",
