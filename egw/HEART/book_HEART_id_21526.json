    "word": "Open Your Hearts and Your Homes.--My husband and I, though called to arduous labor in the ministry, felt it our privilege to gather into our home children who needed care, and help them to form characters for heaven. We could not adopt infants, for this would have engrossed our time and attention and would have robbed the Lord of the service He required of us in bringing many sons and daughters to Him. But we felt that the Lord's instruction in Isaiah 58 was for us, and that His blessing would attend us in obedience to His word. All can do something for the needy little ones, by helping to place them in homes where they can be cared for.--Manuscript 35, 1896.",
