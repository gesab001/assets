    "word": "I have been shown that the sanitarium under its present management is not a safe place for youth. They have already and would receive impressions in their education that would have a demoralizing influence upon them. Sister G, as matron, does not have moral fortitude and spiritual discernment to pursue a steadfast, conscientious course for the right. She is swayed, \n\n\n                                    -133- \n\nmolded by the associations and influences surrounding her. Mothers have opened their hearts to me and with bitter weeping and anguish of heart have told me their sorrow. They told me they thought that if their children were in the Sanitarium it would be as an asylum--the matron would have a religious interest for these inexperienced ones, but in the place of this they quoted her example: She and her daughter did this and that, and permitted, or gave consent to, many things they had instructed their children were wrong, and now the conscience of these children seems unimpressible. They think now, \"Mother is altogether too particular, and exercises too much restraint. Why,\" say they, \"sport and fun and frolic were permitted there, and if it had been wrong I guess Mrs. G, who sings and takes an active part in worship, would not sanction it.\" This is only one of many varieties of complaints that reach us from different ones. Everything has been drifting in a wrong channel. Deficiencies of character, which God has reproved, have not been overcome, but have been cherished, notwithstanding the rebuke of God has been upon them.",
