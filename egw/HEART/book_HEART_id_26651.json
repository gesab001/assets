    "word": "Sister _____, never plead that you cannot get along with your mother. It is a shame to you to say this and make an excuse for breaking the fifth commandment. Your test has come, and you should confess in the name of Christ that you have sinned against your mother and against God. Thank God with your whole heart that your mother still lives, that you can confess to her that you have acted the part of an unnatural child, and from this moment seek to make restitution by your faithful loving-kindness and devotion. Let not her grave cover your unconfessed neglect of duties. Make everything right with your mother before it is everlastingly too late. Your wrong course must be abandoned, and you must choose the way of the Lord. \"Thy word,\" said one of God's chosen, \"have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee\" [Psalms 119:11].",
