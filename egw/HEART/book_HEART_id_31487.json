    "word": "\"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.\" Nearly all of the human family eat more than the system requires. This excess decays, and becomes a putrid mass. Catarrhal difficulties, kidney disease, headache, and heart troubles, are the result of immoderate eating. Even so-called health reform needs reforming upon this point. When men and women cease to indulge their appetites by eating too largely of food of a questionable quality, when they treat their stomach as respectfully as it deserves to be treated, when they relieve it of one-half to two-thirds of the laborious task they require it to perform, when nature is more respected than taste and perverted appetite, then there will be a change for the better in health and morals.",
