    "word": "There are those who, when wrongs have developed, would not say, I have sinned, but have tried to cover up and excuse the sin of the natural heart. But the heart must be changed, else it will ever be sending forth its bitter waters. He who with loathing of soul sees his defective character, which has so long dishonored Christ, and in contrition asks for forgiveness, will save his soul unto eternal life. Such a one will no longer excuse and vindicate actions that have brought reproach on the cause of God. Repentance is genuine when reformation takes place. He is truly repentant, and his heart will be filled with thankfulness \n                                                                           23\nthat he was not blinded to the very end, when it would have been too late for wrongs to be righted. He will discard the old pharisaical garment of self-righteousness, and will no longer try to patch it with new cloth.",
