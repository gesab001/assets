    "word": "This morning I sent you copies of the things I said to the people when in Rockhampton. I have a very deep interest in the church in that place. Why should I feel an interest in them? Because the Lord has an interest in them, an interest much greater than it is possible for me to have. I am praying that the Lord will lead and guide you. I have spoken to the ear, but the Lord alone can speak to the heart. The Lord says, \"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore, and repent.\" He would have every soul heed His counsel, which is given for their present and eternal good. Again He says: \"I know thy works.\" When these works are not in harmony with the truth, they are against the truth. \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear My voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame and am set down with my Father in His throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\"",
