    "word": "No worker is to consider it his duty to administer reproof, to point out existing evils, and stop with this. Such work does not accomplish any good, but only disheartens and discourages. Plain, sensible, intelligent discourses should be preached to the churches, that will show the need of seeking the Lord in prayer, and of opening the heart to the Light of life, and that will lead church-members to engage in humble work for God. To every man God has given a work; to each worker who engages in service for Him, He gives a part to act in communicating light and truth.",
