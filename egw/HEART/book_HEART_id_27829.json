    "word": "Wherever the intercourse between heaven and earth has been free and abundant, and God's gifts [have] been unappreciated, the long-forbearance and patience of God will finally be exhausted. Then the once blessed and once favored are abandoned and forsaken of God. It is a terrible thing to exhaust the divine patience. God today is as surely speaking by His servants as in past ages. He has His messengers today as in ancient times, but those souls who have not had divine enlightenment, [who] have had no deep and rich experience in the things of God, know not by experimental knowledge at what they stumble. They are infatuated; deluded by the enemy; rejecting offered mercy, when the Eternal Father is seeking to save them by the cross of Calvary. Oh, that hearts might be touched by the love of Jesus! \n\n\n                                   -221-",
