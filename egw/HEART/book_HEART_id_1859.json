    "word": "Speak of Christ\u2019s Love\nOften doctrinal subjects are presented with no special effect; for men expect others to press upon them their doctrines; but when the matchless love of Christ is dwelt upon, His grace impresses the heart. There are many who are sincerely seeking for light, who know not what they must do to be saved. Oh, tell them of the love of God, of the sacrifice made on Calvary's cross to save the perishing! Tell them to place their will on the side of God's will; and \u201cif any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.\u201d John 7:17.",
