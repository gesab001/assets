But let none deceive themselves with the belief that God will accept and bless them while they are willfully violating one of his requirements. The commission of a known sin silences the witnessing voice of the Spirit, and separates the soul from God. Jesus cannot abide in the heart that disregards the divine law. God will honor those only who honor him. \"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.\" \"Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth [transgresseth the law] hath not seen him, neither known him.\" [1 John 3:4, 6.] Though John in his epistles treats so fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to reveal the true character of that class who claim to be sanctified while living in transgression of the law of God: \"He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" [1 John 2:4.]",
