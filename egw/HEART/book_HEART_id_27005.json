    "word": "I have seen so much of what the world calls perfection that I greatly long to see a different kind. The worker whose heart is humble and contrite, who is divested of all pride, will give evidence that he is moved by a power from above. Let us rejoice in our victories. Let there be no moves to tear down. Too much of this has been done. Let us all encourage one another, rejoicing in the Lord.--Letter 102, 1902. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. September 5, 1985. Entire letter.",
