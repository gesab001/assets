    "word": "The Beloved Physician \n\n     Of the disciples after Christ's ascension we read, \"They went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.\" Mark 16:20. Luke is called the \"beloved physician.\" He labored in connection with Paul in Philippi, and when Paul left that place Luke stayed, doing double service as a physician and a gospel minister. He was indeed a medical missionary, and his medical skill opened the way for the gospel to reach many hearts.",
