    "word": "The whole world perished in the Flood. Only three were saved at the destruction of Sodom, but they had the warning.

Daniel had purposed in his heart not to partake of the \n\n\n                                     -92- \n\nportion allotted. Finally the test came. But when the leading men of the realm had conspired against Daniel he could not be turned away from God. He prayed as firmly as before, with the window opened towards Jerusalem, and he showed to his enemies that he was no coward because he had learned to depend upon God.
