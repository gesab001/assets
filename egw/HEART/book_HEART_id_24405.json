    "word": "A moral tonic needs to be given to every branch of the work in the Office. Too many words that yield no good fruit are spoken. It is very easy to pick flaws; but it is not so easy to restore, purify, ennoble, and elevate, by personal devoted labors, and a godly example. Satan is doing his utmost to seduce, and if he can control the human element as his agents, he will do it. He will use individuals who are in such blindness that they can not discern on which side they are working. Christ calls for every one who names the name of God to open the door of the heart, that he may be an abiding presence, restoring the moral image of God in man.           Mrs. Ellen G. White.",
