    "word": "\"Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves\" (2 Corinthians 13:5). Inquire into the character of your thoughts, tempers, purposes, words, and deeds. Compare your course of action in your daily life with the great mirror, the law of God, and see wherein your life, in words, in thoughts, in deeds, does not harmonize with God's moral standard of right. Are you satisfied that you are an example of gospel holiness? Do the visible points of righteousness indicate before your brethren and the world that you have the truth and the Spirit of Christ abiding in you, or not? If you have, you will be a bright and shining light. You need to give yourself a more careful, thorough, and impartial examination of your heart and life, praying with the sincerity of your soul for the Lord to discover to you your defects, that you may not be deceived with the deceitfulness of sin.",
