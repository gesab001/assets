    "word": "Learn of Christ, and the peace that passes all understanding will come into your hearts. In Him there is an unfailing supply of Grace. Daily eat of the bread of heaven, and daily drink of the water of life. Carefully and prayerfully study the Saviour's words, and you will grow strong in his strength. Make the Scriptures the man of your gospel. Worship God, not man. Christ is your hope and your crown of rejoicing: bring into the daily life His meekness and lowliness. This will make your experience of value. Thus you will gain a preparedness for service.",
