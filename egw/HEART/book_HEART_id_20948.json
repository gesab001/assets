    "word": "The man who consents to be deceived is the man in whose heart the truth is not abiding. To be occasionally a Christian, to be occasionally devout, is a great deception. It is living a lie. An occasional glance at the Word of God is not enough. An occasional petition to the throne of grace, a form of words, does not bring a supply of grace for the soul's need. In order for the truth of God to regulate the life, it must be implanted in the heart. It must be brought into the inmost life.",
