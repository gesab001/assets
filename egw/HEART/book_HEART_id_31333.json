    "word": "There was much said to me in reference to other departments of the work, which I will not at this time write. When I came to know where I was, I was sitting up in bed, weary, and my heart very, very sad. I arose and prayed, and tried to write. The knowledge, Brother ____, communicated to me at that time and since then in regard to your positions and feelings, has distressed me beyond measure. The positions and ideas also which are entertained by Elder ____ are of that character to lead you both to occupy incorrect positions, where it would be impossible for me to stand with you; and if you maintain these positions, I shall be compelled, not only to differ with you in some things, but to withstand your ideas and your influence. I was never more conscious of this than during the experience I have had here at this meeting. I have not the least hesitancy in saying that a spirit has been brought into this meeting, not of seeking to obtain light, but to stand barricading the way, lest a ray should come into the hearts and minds of the people, through some other channel than that which you had decided to be the proper one. \n                                                                           407",
