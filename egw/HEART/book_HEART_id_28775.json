    "word": "May God help us to look and live. May God strengthen our hearts to trust in Him. He is coming, brethren, in a little while. Here are sorrows and troubles. Here is one brother that has been suffering with rheumatism and with agony, sleepless nights. There is rest, brother; there is rest in a little while. We shall see Him as He is, and we shall be made like Him. Rest, rest in the kingdom of God. Go on a little longer; suffer a few days longer, and there is an eternity of happiness and bliss; that is what you want. The crown of righteousness is for the overcomer. Every one of you, think of this. In the morning think of it, now today I must look at that crown. I must run for it. I must run the race for it. And that crown is mine if I overcome. But if I do not overcome, and am overcome of Satan, I lose that crown; another gets it. Shall we not try to win the crown of everlasting life? If we lose heaven, we lose everything. If we gain heaven, we gain everything.",
