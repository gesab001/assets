    "word": "Our churches are in need of being purified from all selfishness. There is need of a deeper conviction and livelier faith. The love of God cannot be in the heart of anyone who does not cherish patience, kindness, and forbearance toward His brethren. The revelation of these attributes will be in Christ. Many who bustle about with great activity flatter themselves that they are Christians, but it is the manner of spirit that we manifest in the home and in the church that will tell the character of our work.",
