    "word": "We have not only lost much to our own souls, but as ministers [we] have neglected the most solemn part of our work in not dwelling upon the blood of Jesus Christ as the sinner's only hope for eternal life. Tell the story of Christ's leaving the heaven of bliss and the coming to our world, practicing self-denial and self-sacrifice, calling for all to come and learn of Him, for He is meek and lowly of heart, and promising that they should find rest to their souls if they would wear His yoke and lift His burden. Oh, how many will have to have their false props swept away--their self-congratulation, their self-esteem! Nothing will God accept of you but an indwelling Jesus; Christ alone, Christ all and in all.",
