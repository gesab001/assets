    "word": "God watches to see how His stewards fulfill their sacred trust, and when the cries of the widow and the fatherless come into His ears because of hunger and overwork, sickness and distress, it is written in the books of heaven that the Lord's stewards have embezzled His goods to gratify their \n\n\n                                     -50- \n\nselfish passions, and the needy have been left to cry unto God because of the conduct of hardhearted men, who are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Every man in this world is using God's money. Men would have been left to perish if Christ had not given His life for them. He is their Substitute, their Surety. He has given them a probation in which they may work out a perfect character by obedience to all God's commandments. Thus they show that they appreciate the great offering made, that through the Holy Spirit they might be converted and secure eternal riches by laying up their treasure in heaven, and not on earth.",
