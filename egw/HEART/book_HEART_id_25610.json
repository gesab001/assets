    "word": "Just as far as we give ourselves unselfishly to God, so far shall we be honored by God. Those who have been blundering along, making little advancement, may be saved as by fire. They have worked in wrong lines, but if they repent, God will forgive them. Those who have done their best to elevate, purify, and ennoble humanity, who have knit their hearts to the hearts of others, and the hearts of others to God, will hear the words, \"Well done good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" Their work is imperishable.--Ms 13, 1898, pp. 1, 2, 5, 6.
