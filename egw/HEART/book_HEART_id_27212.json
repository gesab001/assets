    "word": "Christ's habits and customs and practices were not after the standard of the world. What a lesson He gives to the Christian churches throughout the world not to exalt themselves above the Majesty of heaven, their Redeemer. What do men find in the example of Christ to justify their feeling of superiority, keeping themselves apart from their fellow men, hiding themselves from their own flesh, because they have obtained more of this world's goods than their neighbor. Because the world honors the wealthy and despises the poor, shall those who claim to follow Jesus do the same? Whose leading and example are such following? Certainly not the example of Him who said, \"He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,\" \"to preach the gospel to the poor.\" \n\n\n                                  -125-",
