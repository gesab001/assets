    "word": "The most impressive lesson you can give to those whom you educate, will be that of a Christlike character. Let there be perfect harmony; this is the greatest evidence that you can present of the power of the truth upon the heart. Work for your own souls until self is subdued, until Christ recognizes His image in you. This is the duty of every worker in the Lord's vineyard. Those who are now advancing the truth of God, are ranging themselves on the side of Christ, united in heart, mind and voice, speaking the same things in defence of the truth. The Lord weighs our actions and our motives, and He will give great power to those who are His own. Christ is not divided; Christ in one worker will acknowledge Christ in a brother worker. Those who are exacting, who are faultfinding, who think evil of others, are advancing the work of the enemy, tearing down that which God would have built up. All \n27\nthese discordant elements represent the powers of darkness, and show that Christ, the hope of glory, is not found within.",
