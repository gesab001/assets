    "word": "God help us to be Bible students. Until you can see the reason for it yourself and a \"thus saith the Lord\" in the Scriptures, don't trust any living man to interpret the Bible for you. And when you can see this, you know it for yourself, and know it to be the truth of God. You will say, \"I have read it, I have seen it, and my own heart takes hold upon it, and it is the truth God has spoken to me from His Word.\" Now this is what we are to be--individual Christians. We need to have an individual, personal experience. We need to be converted, as did the Jews. If you see a little light, you are not to stand back \n                                                                           78\nand say, \"I will wait until my brethren have seen it.\" If you do, you will go on in darkness.",
