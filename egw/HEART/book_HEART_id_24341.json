    "word": "The dress reform is something or nothing. If all the light that has been given in regard to dress reform is of no account we wish to understand it. But if God has indicated his approval of a modest, simple, healthful and convenient dress, let us choose this dress and cheerfully wear it. The dress question, with all its advantages, has been repeatedly set before our people at Battle Creek, from a health standpoint, and its advantages from a Christian stand have been fully set before him. But they have been slow of heart to believe, and to act up to their faith.",
