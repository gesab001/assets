    "word": "God will not hold him guiltless that does not set the Lord ever before him. He will walk contrary to those who walk contrary to him. He will visit \"the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him; and will show mercy unto thousands of them that love him and keep his commandments. The heart's inclinations are true when they remain under the restraint of the holy precepts of Jehovah. O that men would fear and tremble before the Lord God of hosts. He has made sufficiently plain his claims upon the human agent. The law speaks condemnation to those who are not doers of his precepts. God will accept no plea that man can offer to obtain acquittal. There is no power in law to save the transgressor of Law. But Christ, who gave himself as the world's sin bearer, becomes the Mediator for man, and the sin pardoner for all who come confessing their sins, and accepting him as their Saviour. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\" \"And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.\"",
