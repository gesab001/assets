    "word": "Christ sharply reproved the men of his time, because they had not learned from nature the spiritual lessons which they might have learned. All things animate and inanimate express to man the knowledge of God. The same divine mind which is working upon the things of nature is speaking to the minds and hearts of men, and creating an inexpressible craving for something they have not. The things of the world cannot satisfy their longing. To all these thirsting souls the divine message is addressed, \"The Spirit and the bride say, Come; and let him that heareth say, Come ; and let him that is athirst come; and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\"",
