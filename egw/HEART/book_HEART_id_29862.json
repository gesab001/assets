    "word": "Battle Creek, January 21, 1891 \n\n     I was afflicted this morning with acute pain in my hip and across my kidneys. It is the result, I think, of the chilliness I suffered in the cold bed last Sunday night. I was scarcely able to move or even breathe without severe pain. I am reminded that I am mortal. The illness which attacked me in Lansing, and which seemed so perilous, leads me to the conclusion that my life is not secure for a moment. It becomes me to hide in Jesus Christ, to be true to God, obeying His commandments from the heart, and notwithstanding my oft infirmities the Lord strengthens me in a most remarkable manner.",
