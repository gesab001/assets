    "word": "But whatever you may say to vindicate the truth in righteousness, be sure not to make a raid on the one who for many years has borne heavy burdens in connection with our medical missionary work. He has always personally treated me as respectfully as he would treat his mother. It is nothing he has done to me personally that has led me to speak as I have been compelled to. While it makes my heart ache, I must speak. God has given me a message to give to his people, that the sentiments contained in the book, \"Living Temple,\" are mingled with fallacies that beguile the reader. It is the specious errors in that book that makes it a dangerous production. I can not hold my peace, and let the flock of God be misled. But I beseech you not to let a drive be made against our brother; for this would not be right.",
