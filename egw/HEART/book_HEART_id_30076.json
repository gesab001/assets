    "word": "In regard to your own case, I have felt very sad, because the Lord has given you abundance of light, and you did not walk in it. It has seemed very mysterious to me that you should stand as you have done so long, without opening your heart to the messages God has sent to His people. You have lost much in so doing. But I am hopeful that the truth that is shining in precious beams of light will find entrance, to your heart. I have felt so sorry that you could not recognize the voice of Jesus, the true Shepherd, The Lord has wrought out the demonstration of his truth before your eyes, yet you did not see, and your heart was not submitted to the leadings of the Holy Spirit of God.",
