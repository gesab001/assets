Was he not the covering cherub in the Eden of God? And was he not cast out of heaven because, as it was said of him, \"thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness?\" Then, cannot he mingle some of his sophistry with truth so \n\n\n                                  -67- \n\nas to fascinate and captivate the human mind?

And for that very reason, God sent His Son into the world to stand here on the field of battle and present the great original truths; to take men from the bands of error; to rescue them; to reform them. Christ presented these principles of truth, arranged in the order of the gospel, that they might serve the very purpose for which they were given to man.",
