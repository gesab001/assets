    "word": "Jesus was the good shepherd to whom the porter openeth, who knows the sheep, calleth His own by name, and leadeth them out. He it is who is stronger than the thief and the robber, those who enter not in at the door, but climb up some other way. The Pharisees were not able to discern that this parable was spoken against them, the professed leaders of the people, pastors of the flock. Jesus presented Himself in contrast to them, and when they reasoned in their hearts as to what he could mean by the parable, He said, \"I  am the door [of the sheep]: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.\" . . . Christ presented Himself as the only one in whom were qualifications for making a good shepherd.",
