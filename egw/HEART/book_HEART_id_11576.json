    "word": "OUR NEED OF DAILY PRAYER.\u2014All who come to Christ today are to remember that His merit is the incense that mingles with the prayers of those who repent of their sins and receive pardon and mercy and grace. Our need of Christ\u2019s intercession is constant. Day by day, morning and evening, the humble heart needs to offer up prayers to which will be returned answers of grace and peace and joy. \u201cBy Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God \n156\ncontinually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name. But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifice God is well pleased\u201d(SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, 1078.)",
