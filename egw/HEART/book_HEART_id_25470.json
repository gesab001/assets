    "word": "I saw that you found rest by looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith. As soon as you looked to Him, you wondered that you had not seen before how mighty He is to save. Your drooping spirits revived, your waning strength was restored, your step recovered its elasticity; you felt ready for any emergency, ready to brave any danger. You went forward in your work trustfully, with a beaming countenance and a warm, joyous heart. You no longer spoke in despondent, complaining tones. You had full faith in God, and you gave expression to your faith in such words as these: \"God is our refuge and strength; a very present help in trouble.\" \"My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\"--Letter 79, 1902 (To Elder E. E. Franke, May 23, 1902.)",
