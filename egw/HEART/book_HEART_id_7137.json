    "word": "We were thankful for every token that this dear people were obtaining a sense of their true condition. But some who should have been personally interested, were looking on as though they had no interest at stake. The testimonies which the Lord gave them did not seem to be received. They did not break the bands which held them under condemnation of the Spirit of God. The Saviour was knocking at the door of their hearts, but they were unwilling then and there to remove the rubbish which barred his entrance. The Lord's time was not their time. Had they cleared the way, the Lord would have given them an experience of the highest value. But we know that souls have accepted the truth who have never felt the transforming power of the grace of Christ. We hope that this will not be the last invitation of the Spirit of God to them. We did all that we could for these dear souls. We did not cease to warn and entreat them, and we spent many hours in prayer for them while others were sleeping. If those who let that golden opportunity pass, had taken their position decidedly for the truth, determined to share with the church the warfare, the self-denial, and the reproach, and to share the final victory, there would have been a revival whose influence would have been far-reaching outside the church.",
