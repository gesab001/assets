    "word": "With the people of that age the value of things was determined by outward show. As religion had declined in power, it had increased in pomp. The educators of the time sought to command respect by display and ostentation. To all this the life of Jesus presented a marked contrast. His life demonstrated the worthlessness of those things that men regarded as life's greatest essentials. The schools of His time, with their magnifying of things small and their belittling of things great, He did not seek. His education was gained directly from Heaven-appointed sources; from useful work, from the study of the Scriptures and of nature, and from the experiences of life--God's lesson books, full of instruction to all who bring to them the willing hand, the seeing eye, and the understanding heart. \"The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him\" (Luke 2:40).",
