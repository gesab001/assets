    "word": "Dear Children: \n\n\n     I must write a few lines to you. We wish that we could step into your home and weep with you and kneel with you in prayer. Will each one of you seek the Lord and serve Him? You can be a great blessing to your mother by doing nothing that will make her heart sad. The Lord Jesus will  receive you if you will give your hearts to Him. Do all that is possible to relieve your mother from every care and burden.",
