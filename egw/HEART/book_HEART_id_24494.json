I will not imperil my soul by declaring I must have a certain revenue. I have purposed in my heart that I will not give Satan reason to triumph over me because I endanger my spiritual life and become the servant of sin. I will not cultivate or encourage selfishness and covetousness, for it is the ruin of the world.\" Satan was vanquished when he came to Christ, with his specious temptation, offering a vast reward for the tarnishing of the integrity of the Son of God. He now seeks through the avenue of the world to corrupt the integrity of those who would overcome through the grace of Christ; but let every professed follower of Jesus say, \"Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve\" (Matthew 4:10).
