    "word": "This is the instruction of the word. How has it been obeyed? Oh, if this had been brought into the character of all the workers, what a change would there be in our institution! How different now would be the mould upon the work of God in Battle Creek! The strange developments that have been revealed in the decisions of your councils would not have seen the light of day. Bitter jealousies would not have been thriving in the hearts of those who profess to be followers of Christ. Advice or decisions that would involve a brother in distress \n                                                                           1511\nor perplexity, or bind him in poverty, would be shunned as you would shun the leprosy. It is a fearful thing for a man to lose his own soul, yet every day men are taking steps that will result in the loss of their souls. The question came from the lips of Christ, \"What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" Solemn, fearfully solemn question! and yet how many are, like Esau, selling their souls for a mess of pottage. And for a man to lose his own soul means more even than this. His words, his example, his evil-spun theories lead others into perplexities and difficulties. He calls men away from Christ to rank under the black banner of the prince of darkness. He is, in short, a soul-slayer; he is doing his best to destroy the principles which God has commanded to live. How terrible the thought of destroying the souls of men whom Christ came to our world to save. The result of our lives day by day should be to heal, not bruise; to save, not destroy.",
