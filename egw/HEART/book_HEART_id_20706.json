    "word": "Gabriel Sent to Explain the Vision of Daniel 8\n     Shortly before the fall of Babylon, when Daniel was meditating on these prophecies [of Isaiah and Jeremiah] and seeking God for an understanding of the times, a series of visions was given him concerning the rise and fall of kingdoms. With the first vision, as recorded in the seventh chapter of the book of Daniel, an interpretation was given; yet not all was made clear to the prophet. \u201cMy cogitations much troubled me,\u201d he wrote of his experience at the time, \u201cand my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.\u201d Daniel 7:28.",
