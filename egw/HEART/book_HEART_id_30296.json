Jesus said, If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven Jesus not only tells Nicodemus that he must have a new heart in order to see the kingdom of heaven, but tells him how to obtain a new heart. He reads the inquiring mind of a true seeker after truth, and presents before him the representation of himself: \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\" Good news, good news, ring throughout the world: \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" This lesson is of the greatest importance to every soul that lives, for the terms of salvation are here laid out in distinct lines; if one had no other text in the Bible, this alone would be a guide for the soul.",
