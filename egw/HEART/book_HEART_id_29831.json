    "word": "You write that you have said that you would have not controversy with Sr. White. Better, far better, have had this controversy openly than under cover, for this controversy has been and there has not been harmony between us since the Minneapolis meeting. You have been exceedingly stubborn, and this stubbornness has been as described in the word of God \"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Behold, to obey is better than to sacrifice, and to hearken \n                                                                           847\nthan the fat of rams.\" This stubbornness, my dear brother, can be brought under control only by your falling upon the Rock and being broken. It is a terrible snare to you. It makes you unwilling to confess your wrongs, and every wrong passed over without humble confession will relieve [leave] you and Elder Butler and every soul who pursues the same course in blindness of mind and hardness of heart. The spirit of God is grieved and Satan triumphs. It is not because we do not have evidence, but that your own will rises against God's will, and it is God who has a controversy with you. He will remove the candlestick out of its place except you repent.",
