    "word": "\"Let us diligently cultivate the pure principles of the gospel of Christ,--the religion, not of self-esteem, but of love, meekness, and lowliness of heart. Then we shall love our brethren, and esteem them better than ourselves. Our minds will not dwell on scandal and flying reports. But 'whatsoever things are true, whatsoever \n                                                                           36\nthings are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise,' we shall 'think on these things.'\" [\"GOSPEL WORKERS,\" PP. 445-447.]",
