    "word": "But our peculiar faith should not be discussed with patients. Their minds should not be unnecessarily excited upon subjects wherein we differ, unless they themselves desire it, and then great caution should be observed, not to agitate the mind by urging upon them our peculiar faith. The Health Institute is not the place to be forward to enter into discussion upon points of our faith wherein we differ with the religious world generally. They have prayer-meetings at the Institute, where all may take part if they choose, and there is an abundance to dwell upon in regard to Bible religion, without objectionable points of difference. The silent influence will do more than open controversy. In exhortation in the prayer-meetings, some Sabbath-keepers have felt they must bring in the Sabbath, and the third angel's message, or they could \n                                                                           11\nnot have freedom. This is characteristic of narrow minds. Patients not acquainted with our faith know not what is meant by third angel's message. The introduction of these terms without a clear explanation of them only does harm. We must meet the people where they are, and yet we need not sacrifice one principle of the truth. The prayer-meeting will prove a blessing to patients, helpers, and physicians. Brief and interesting seasons of prayer and social worship will increase the confidence of patients in their physicians and helpers. The helpers should not be deprived of these meetings by work, unless positively necessary. They need them, and should enjoy them. By thus establishing regular meetings, the patients gain confidence in the Institute, and feel more at home. And thus the way is prepared for the seed of truth to take root in some hearts. These meetings especially interest some who profess to be Christians, and make a favorable impression upon those who do not. Mutual confidence is increased for one another, and prejudice is weakened, and in many cases entirely removed. Then there is an anxiety to attend the Sabbath meeting. There, in the house of God, is the place to speak our denominational sentiments, dwelling with clearness upon essential points of present truth, and with the spirit of Christ, in \n                                                                           12\nlove and tenderness, urge home upon all hearts the necessity of obedience to all the requirements of God, and let the truth convict hearts.",
