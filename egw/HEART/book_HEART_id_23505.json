    "word": "God's instrumentalities should seek to follow in the foot-steps of the divine Healer. Those who come to the Sanitarium should be taught how to take care of the body, remembering the words, \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's\" Yes; we are God's property, and the path of obedience to Nature's laws is the direct path to heaven. He who is converted from errors in eating, drinking, and dressing, is being prepared to hear and receive the truth into a good and willing heart. Many, by practising the laws of Nature and by receiving the renovating grace of God into the soul, obtain a new lease of physical and spiritual life. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Let Wisdom's voice be heard; for her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace.",
