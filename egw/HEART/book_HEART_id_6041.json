    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     Christ is pleased with his followers when they show that, though human, they are partakers of the divine nature. They are not statues, but living men and women, whose warm hearts, invigorated by the dews of divine grace, open and expand as the beams of the Sun of Righteousness fall upon them. The light which is shed upon them they reflect upon others in works luminous with the love of Christ. There are some professed Christians who are like icebergs; they seem to freeze up the cheerfulness of all who are connected with them. Their influence upon the cause of Christ is always deleterious.",
