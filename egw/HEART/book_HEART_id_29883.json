    "word": "What we want is the spirit of Jesus. When we have this, we shall love one another. Here are the credentials that we are to bear: \"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love \n                                                                           904\none to another. We need to pray more; and when we have Christ abiding in the soul, his spirit in me will harmonize with his spirit in you; and he who controls our minds, controls also the heavenly intelligences, and they co-operate with us. Then in every council you will have the presence of One mighty in counsel. Jesus will be there. There will be no contention, no strife, no stirring up of the worst passions of the heart. What we want is to find refuge in Jesus. What we want is to be converted: And O, how I have longed for the converting power of God to go through our assemblies!  {1888 903.10}  \n     I fear that some will never be converted. Not because God is not willing to convert them; but because they have eyes, and yet see not; ears have they, but they hear not; they have understanding, and yet understand not. They are too proud to acknowledge their errors, and in contrition of heart seek God in repentance. Now shall we put away this impenitent spirit? Shall we fall on the Rock and be broken? Jesus is soon coming in the clouds of heaven. What is he doing now?--He is testing a people here upon the earth, to see if they can live in harmony, without revolt, in heaven.",
