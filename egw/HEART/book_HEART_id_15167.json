    "word": "\"I related the vision given me for the church, and those who had acted a part in casting her off confessed to her heartily. It was an affecting time. Many wept aloud. The desponding were encouraged and strengthened. The work of God is going forward. The Lord wrought for the church, and we left them rejoicing, and journeyed to Amsterdam, where we found Bro. B. waiting to take us to his house. We were kindly received by the family, although they had not yet embraced our faith. We had a meeting with them. My husband hung up his chart and talked from it one hour and a half. Then Bro. B. talked very affectingly, expressing his deep interest for his family. Said he, 'Wife and children, I am going to the kingdom. Will you go with me? If you do not, I shall not remain behind; I shall go if I go alone. If you will not go, it will do you no good to have me lost with you. I shall go, if I go alone. This is the truth; I must save my soul by obeying the truth.' He plead with his family from a full heart. They were deeply affected. They will attend the conference at West Milton, and may the Lord give Bro. B. his family to go with him is our prayer. The brethren are very anxious we should come to Saratoga Springs to publish the paper. We shall abide by the decision of the church generally.\"",
