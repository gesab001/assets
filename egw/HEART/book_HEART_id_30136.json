    "word": "Wellington, N. Z., Monday, April 24 \n\n     I have passed many sleepless hours during the night. The good news from America kept me awake. Oh how my heart rejoices in the fact that the Lord is working in behalf of His people. In the information in the long letter from Elder Olsen, that the Lord by His Holy Spirit was working upon the hearts of those who have been in a large measure convinced of their true condition before God, yet have not humbled their hearts before to confess! The Spirit of the Lord moved them to the point at this conference. Elder Morrison, who has been so long president of the Iowa Conference, made a full confession. Madison Miller, who has been under the same deceiving power of the enemy, made his confession, and thus the Lord is indeed showing Himself merciful and of tender compassion to His children who have not received the light He has given them, but have been walking and working in darkness.",
