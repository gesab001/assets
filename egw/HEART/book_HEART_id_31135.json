Campbell \n     Battle Creek, Mich. \n\nDear Brother: \n\n\n     We have received and read the interesting letters from you and Brother Amadon. We feel deeply grieved at the course that Frank Belden has pursued. That my nephew should urge his unsanctified opinions in such a persistent manner causes me much sorrow of heart. This is a repetition of the way in which he conducted himself when he had plans of his own to carry at the Review and Herald office. His actions reveal the spirit that controls him. I feel sorry for him beyond anything that I can express, and I ask you to pity him and to pray for him. His mother was my sister, and a sincere, devoted Christian.",
