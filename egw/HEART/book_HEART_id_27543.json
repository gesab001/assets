If Christ is indeed formed within, the hope of glory, the soul will be filled with Christlike joy. As true believers we shall sit together with Christ in heavenly places.

The proof that we are not of the world will be the manifestation of Christ's glory--His character--in the life-practice. When He dwells in the heart, we shall manifest that tenderness, that love, that fervency of spirit, which reveals His character formed within. Many will acknowledge that Christ's followers can with truthfulness say, \"Thy gentleness hath made me great.\"",
