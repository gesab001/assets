    "word": "Adam and eve dared to transgress the Lord\u2019s requirements, and the terrible result of their sin should be a warning to us not to follow their example of disobedience. Christ prayed for His disciples in these words: \u201cSanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth\u201d (John 17:17). There is no genuine sanctification except through obedience to the truth. Those who love God with all the heart will love all His commandments also. The sanctified heart is in harmony with the precepts of God\u2019s law; for they are holy, just, and good.",
