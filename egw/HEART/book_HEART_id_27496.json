    "word": "Let all our assemblies be stirred by the old heart-searching truths of the gospel. These truths will bring conviction to souls. Say to those assembled, \"'When the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?' Be warned, be entreated to arise from lethargy, and remove this self-complacent spirit.\" When true faith is exercised, the Spirit of God will mold and fashion the soul that it may become a pure and holy place, a dwelling place for God. When Christ is \"formed within, the hope of glory,\" a new life is imparted.",
