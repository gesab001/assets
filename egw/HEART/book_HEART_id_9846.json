    "word": "Jesus loves the young. . . . He bids them learn of him meekness and lowliness of heart. This precious grace is rarely seen in the youth of the present day, even in those who profess to be Christians. Their own ways seem right in their eyes. In accepting the name of Christ they do not accept His character or submit to wear His yoke; therefore they know nothing of the joy and peace to be found in His service.",
