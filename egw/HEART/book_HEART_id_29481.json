    "word": "Michigan needs in all her churches men to labor, not in their own finite wisdom, but with divine enlightenment. I have much trembling of heart for Michigan. It is in a sad condition. As I saw that you and Elder Fargo did not comprehend the truth for this time, that that which was light from heaven was resisted, I had no hope that the committee associated with Elder Van Horn would be any help to him, but they would be only a burden. He could not feel free to act without consulting the committee; and they were not walking in the light and advancing with the work, and so would be no help, no light, no strength, to him. If there are grave duties neglected, those who have stood directly in his way will be guilty before God of neglecting the work of the Master. \n                                                     (Signed) Ellen G. White",
