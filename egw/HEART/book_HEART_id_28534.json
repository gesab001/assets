    "word": "I spoke from Isaiah 58 to a room packed with interested listeners. The Lord's presence was in the congregation. We knew that His Holy Spirit was impressing the hearts of those present. As soon as I had ceased speaking, a woman of commanding appearance arose and bore a testimony from a full heart. She thanked the Lord, she said, that she was present to hear that discourse, for it had decided her to keep the Sabbath of the Lord. Although trials and difficulties were before her, she would trust in the Lord, for He would be her fortress, her support, and she would make known the light of truth to others. Testimonies followed in quick succession.",
