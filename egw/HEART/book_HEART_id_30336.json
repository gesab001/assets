    "word": "Man may become a fellow laborer with God in carrying out the great work of redemption. God allows each man his own sphere of action while he has given his word as the guide of life, he has also given the Holy Spirit as a sufficient power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress his own character on the human agent, and, through him, upon all who shall come within the sphere of his influence. The human agent is urged to co-operate with God, to work out his mercy, his goodness, and his love, thus impressing other minds. Every man is to become an instrumentality through which the Holy Spirit can work. He can become this only by yielding all his capabilities to the control of the Spirit. God gave his Spirit upon the day of Pentecost, and through its working upon receptive hearts he could impress all with whom the believers come in contact. \n                                                                           1509",
