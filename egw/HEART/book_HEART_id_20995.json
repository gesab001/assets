    "word": "What tongue can tell, what pen can trace and unfold, the mighty moral results of looking with earnest believing hearts unto Jesus, our Helper? \"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord\" (2 Corinthians 3:18). What a grand victory! Beholding, you become a changed man. Consider this: We behold, and catch the bright beams in the face of Jesus Christ. We receive as much as we can bear. Let us not stop to quarrel over circumstances, but keep Christ in view. Through the transforming power of the Holy Ghost we become assimilated to the image of the blessed Object we behold.",
