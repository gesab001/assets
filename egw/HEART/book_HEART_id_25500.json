    "word": "MR No. 397 - Sing with the Spirit and Understanding\n\n     These are the fruits that Christ would have from His vineyards, and from His saints who assemble to worship Him from year to year. Obedience to God's commandments makes our souls precious in His sight. The church is very dear to the heart of God. He would have His people sing with the heart and with the understanding also: \"Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.\" \"Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein.\" The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel.",
