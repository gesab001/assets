    "word": "Example of Daniel and His Associates. \n\n     Daniel and his companions had a conscience void of offense toward God. But this is not preserved without a struggle. What a test was brought on the three associates of Daniel, when they were required  to worship the great image set up by king Nebuchadnezzar in the plain of Dura. Their principles forbade them to pay homage to the idol; for it was a rival of the God of Heaven. They knew that they owed to God every faculty they possessed; and while their hearts were full of generous sympathy toward all men, they had a lofty aspiration to prove themselves entirely loyal to their God.  To meet the appeals of the king and his counselors that they should comply with the royal edict, they had a store of arguments set forth most eloquently. The demand \n\n\n                     -56 \n\nappeared contemptible to them. With Daniel as their companion, they had prayed and fasted, that they might understand the dream which God gave the king. The Lord had heard their cries, and he had given to Daniel wisdom to interpret the dream. Thus their own lives and the lives of the astrologers and soothsayers had been saved. Now the very men who had escaped death through the mercy of God to his servants, were led by envy and jealousy to secure the decree in regard to the worshiping of the golden image.",
