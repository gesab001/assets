    "word": "Words to the Faithful \n\n     There are those connected with the office whose hearts are bound up with the work. They see many things that are not as they should be, \n                                                                           51\nbut know not what course to pursue to correct the evils. They are pained to see many who profess the truth go astray. To all these the Lord sends reproofs and warnings; the straight and narrow way that leads to life, and the glorious reward, are pointed out, and the perfect standard of Christian character is held up before them. Although some are so estranged from God that they do not recognize His voice. though a strange infatuation leads them in their perversity of heart to strive against the manifestations of the Spirit of God, let not those who are striving earnestly to do the work and will of God become discouraged. Let each work earnestly, prayerfully, holding his torch in his hand, shedding light upon willing and unwilling eyes. Having their orders from heaven, they are to be true and faithful, in all things representing the compassion of Christ.",
