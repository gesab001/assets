    "word": "God says, \"I hate robbery for burnt offering\" [Isaiah 61:8]. The Lord will work for those who are pure in heart. \"The pure in heart . . . shall see God\" [Matthew 5:8], and they will see in Him no corrupting principles. When all selfishness and covetousness is cleansed from the church and from our institutions, we shall see the Lord in His ways and in His works, and great good will be done. His righteousness will go before us. It is Christ our righteousness who leads the way for our feet in the path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in.",
