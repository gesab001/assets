    "word": "When as sons and daughters of God, we stand in our place, doing our appointed work, we shall be clearing the King's highway. Those whose eyes are anointed with the heavenly eyesalve will read lessons in the life of Christ that will mean more to them than they ever before conceived of. They will recognize a standard of piety that would put to shame their present ideas, their want of faith, and their practice, so unlike that of Christ. If the right training is given in our colleges, the youth coming forth \n\n\n                                     -462- \n\nfrom them will have a mind to work, and new light will shine upon the mind and heart of the workers.",
