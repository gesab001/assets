    "word": "None who deal with the youth should be iron-hearted, but affectionate, tender, pitiful, courteous, winning, and compassionate; yet they should know that reproof must be given, and that even rebuke must be spoken to cut off some evildoing. Encourage the youth to glorify God by giving expression to their gratitude to the Lord for all His mercies. Let their thanks be spoken often in the heart and with the voice, and let self-denial and self-sacrifice be shown, if those who claim to be Christ's disciples will have eternal life. \"I will raise him up at the last day,\" Christ says, \"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.\" \"He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him.\"",
