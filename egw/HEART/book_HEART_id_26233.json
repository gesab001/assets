    "word": "MR No. 871 - Ellen White's Heavy Burdens in 1906\n\n     I am now carrying a very heavy burden for those who are lost in the mysteries of false science. I have had physical suffering of the heart; therefore I could not quickly answer the questions that you [Dr. David Paulson] and Elder Sadler have presented to me. A severe cold has been upon me ever since the Loma Linda meeting. I assure you it is not because I do not respect you, Brethren Paulson and Sadler, that I do not answer your questions now. Pray for me, and I will pray for you; and as soon as I can I will clear up, if possible, the misunderstandings regarding the work God has given me to do. Certainly a very great work is before us. I must now watch and pray and wait.--Letter 172, 1906, p. 3. (To Dr. David Paulson and Elder W. S. Sadler, June 14, 1906.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 20, 1981",
