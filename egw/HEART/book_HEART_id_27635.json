    "word": "God will not be trifled with. There needs to be a complete renovation in the Health Retreat, a working from Christlike principles; then the cloud resting upon that institution will be rolled back. Never, never will the Lord vindicate the work that has been going on for some time in the institution at St. Helena, where there is no distinction made between the precious and the vile. \"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you\" [Ephesians 4:29-32].",
