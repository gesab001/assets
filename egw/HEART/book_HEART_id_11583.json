    "word": "Unless the teacher realizes the need of prayer and humbles his heart before God, he will lose the very essence of education. He should know how to pray and what language to use in prayer. \u201cI am the vine,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cye are the branches: he that abideth in Me, and I in \n163\nhim, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing.\u201d John 15:5. The teacher should let the fruit of faith be manifest in his prayers. He should learn how to come to the Lord and plead with Him until he receives the assurance that his petitions are heard.\u2014(Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 231.)",
