    "word": "There is no excuse for indulging a love-sick sentimentalism. No excuse for this trifling, flirting of married men with young girls, or married men with widows. Let men professing Godliness heed the Apostle's admonition, \"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak evil against you as evil doers, they may by your good works which they behold, glorify God in the day of their visitation.\" Will you, then, disregard the plainest directions given in the Word of God in regard to your words, your deportment, and your character? Will you excuse levity, and even licentious acts, as though you had done no moral wrong? Will you pass all this off, by saying it was thoughtlessness on your part? Is it not the duty of Christians to think soberly? If Jesus is enthroned in the heart, will the thoughts be running riot? . . .",
