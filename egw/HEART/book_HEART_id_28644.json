    "word": "Norwich, Connecticut, Thursday, November 27, 1890 \n\n     November 27 we were among strangers in a place we had never visited before. We had both become so thoroughly chilled that it was very difficult to get the blood to the surface in good circulation. We walked out, Sara and I, about one mile, and the air was sharp but bracing. I came to the breakfast table at nine o'clock. Oh, how hungry I was! I ate very heartily. Dinner was at three o'clock and I was again hungry for dinner. It was Thanksgiving Day. I tried to sleep some but I could sleep only a few moments. Brother Miles talked that night to the few assembled. The people are very much scattered and cannot readily assemble at the meetinghouse.--Ms. 49, 1890, p. 2 (Diary 16, p. 346).",
