    "word": "The grace of Christ, if received into his heart, would have converted him from his selfishness, working wonderful changes in him, as in John and Peter. I mention Judas, because this was an extreme case. But as he did not receive the words of Christ and improve, there arose in his heart an opposition to the light. He treasured his defects, and held them as if he considered them a precious treasure. The defects poisoned the whole man, in principle, in spirit, in life, in character, until he sold his Lord for a trifling sum of money. This history has a warning for us.",
