    "word": "I am better today, but still weak and suffering. I fear that it was not wise of me to attend the meetings held the week after the camp closed. They were very taxing, but the Lord sustained me and brought me home in safety. How long I shall be in this feeble state I cannot tell. I seem to have inward fever, with stricture across the lungs and a pain in the heart. The weather today is quite warm, but not as hot as on Friday.",
