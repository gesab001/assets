    "word": "My brother, may the Lord God sanctify you wholly, body, soul, and spirit, because you are a diligent student in the school of Christ. As you educate yourself, you are prepared to educate others. True religion is simply to follow Christ. A religion expressing selfishness is worthless; for the sinful heart is the real citadel. Until the heart is surrendered unconditionally, the blessing of God cannot flow into the soul; the sunshine of His righteousness does not illuminate the chambers of the mind or the soul temple, and a new life does not begin.",
