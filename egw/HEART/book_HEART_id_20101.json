    "word": "If Satan had been suffered to have his way, there would have been no hope for Peter. He would have made complete shipwreck of faith. Had Peter earnestly and in humility looked for divine help, had he been searching his own heart in secret, he would not have been sifted when tried. Satan cannot overcome the humble learner of Christ, he who walks prayerfully before the Lord. \"When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard\" for him against the enemy (Isaiah 59:19). Christ interposes Himself as a shelter, a retreat, and the wicked one cannot overcome Him.--Manuscript 109, Sept. 8, 1898, \"Peter's Fall and Restoration.\"",
