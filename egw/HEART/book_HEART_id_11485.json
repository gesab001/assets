    "word": "As the high priest sprinkled the warm blood upon the mercy-seat while the fragrant cloud of incense ascended before God, so, while we confess our sins and plead the efficacy of Christ\u2019s atoning blood, our prayers are to ascend to heaven, fragrant with the merits of our Saviour\u2019s character. Notwithstanding our unworthiness, we are to remember that there is One who can take away sin, and who is willing and anxious to save the sinner. With His own blood He paid the penalty for all wrongdoers. Every sin acknowledged before God with a contrite heart, He will remove. \u201cThough your \n67\nsins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\u201d(Review and Herald, September 29, 1896.)",
