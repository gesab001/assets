    "word": "Many writers and speakers fail here. After eating heartily, they give themselves to sedentary occupations, reading, study, or writing, allowing no time for physical exercise.

They can not write or speak with the force and intensity necessary in order to reach the heart; their efforts are tame and fruitless.",
