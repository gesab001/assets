    "word": "But let no one imagine that we would discourage education or put a low estimate upon the value of mental culture and discipline. God would have us students as long as we remain in this world, ever learning and bearing responsibility. . . . But no one should set himself as a critic to measure the usefulness and influence of his brother who has had few advantages in obtaining book knowledge. He may be rich in a rarer wisdom. He may have a practical education in the knowledge of the truth. Says the psalmist, \"The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple\" (Psalm 119:130). . . . The wisdom spoken of by the psalmist is that which is attained when the truth is opened to the mind and applied to the heart by the Spirit of God, when its principles are wrought into the character by a life of practical godliness. . . .",
