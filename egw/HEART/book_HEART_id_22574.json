    "word": "IT WAS MY PRIVILEGE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MY MOTHER DURING THE YEARS THAT SHE CARRIED ON HER HEART A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR SANITARIUMS AT NASHVILLE, GRAYSVILLE, ATLANTA, AND HUNTSVILLE. AND I HAVE WITNESSED HER JOY AND REJOICING AS THESE INSTITUTIONS BEGAN THEIR NOBLE WORK. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DELAYS, DISAPPOINTMENTS, AND SORROWS CONNECTED WITH THEIR EARLY EXPERIENCES, HAS NOT SURPRISED HER. OF THEIR ULTIMATE SUCCESS SHE IS CONFIDENT. THEREFORE TO ME IT HAS BEEN A PLEASANT DUTY TO UNITE WITH BRO. C. C. CRISLER IN SEARCHING HER WRITINGS TO FIND SOME OF HER MANY UTTERANCES REGARDING THE NECESSITY, THE CHARACTER, AND THE VALUE OF A WELL-EQUIPPED SANITARIUM AT NASHVILLE, TENN.",
