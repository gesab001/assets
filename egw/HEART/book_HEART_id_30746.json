    "word": "God speaks through the men who understand the guiding of the Holy Spirit. When thousands come out to attend our meetings, they desire to get the greatest benefit possible, and it is poor policy to place as speakers men who are not fully adapted to meet the needs of the situation. The word should be spoken by men who have felt the deep moving of the Spirit upon (334) their hearts, and who feel the burden of the message that God has given them for the people. The old soldiers of the cross are not to be passed by.",
