    "word": "This day, June 3, 1902, I am instructed by the Lord to say that our great need now is to know that we are wearing Christ's yoke. His service brings rest to the soul. Are we, in the fullest sense of the word, heeding the invitation, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" [Matthew 11:29-30]. By accepting this invitation, you commit your soul to God as unto a faithful Creator.",
