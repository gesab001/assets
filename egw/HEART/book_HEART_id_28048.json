    "word": "To His disciples the Saviour promised the Holy Spirit, that He might recall His lessons to their minds. These would come to them as a new revelation, if they would remain humble and contrite in spirit. \"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones [Isaiah 57:15]. Christ told His disciples that He had many things to say to them, \n\n\n                                     -179- \n\nbut they could not bear them yet. He left them in possession of truth, the value of which they had but a faint appreciation. After His resurrection, unrecognized by His disciples, He opened to them the Scriptures relating to Himself. When He revealed Himself to them in the breaking of bread, they said, Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked with us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?\" [Luke 24:32]. It was the truth, all full of riches, and precious, far more precious than the gold of Ophir, but their understanding had not been keen and unobstructed so that they could take it in and assimilate it to their spiritual needs.",
