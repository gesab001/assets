    "word": "The sadness of my heart is beyond expression because I must show directly to all the medical missionaries that they are not fulfilling their calling. The Lord has been speaking to Dr. Kellogg through His word, but he would not understand that word. He would not change his course of action, and for the last thirty years especially, my message has been given to him, which message he has in strongest assertions professed to believe. But when the plain reproofs came to him through the messenger God has chosen, just prior to the time of the conference at South Lancaster, he decidedly stated that I was no longer his friend because I stated the facts as they had been presented to me by the Lord. But he had set his mind upon a course of action that the Lord would not sustain him in pursuing. His mistakes were presented before him; likewise the dangers growing out of these mistakes. Our ministers were tempted. They must be on guard, and not in any way be seduced from the straight line of the work God had given them to do, but stand firm like men. Be strong, yea, be strong. Then the Doctor became set and determined, and for a time he had been losing the balance of his mind. He went to Europe and we urged him to come to Australia; to throw off care for a time and have nothing to do to weary and depress his mind. But although he received the message sent him, he did not accept the invitation. At that time his financial outlook was anything but favorable.",
