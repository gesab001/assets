    "word": "Need of a Change of Heart--Sometimes men and women decide in favor of the truth because of the weight of evidence presented, without being converted. The minister's work is not done until he has urged upon his hearers the necessity of a change of heart. In every discourse fervent appeals should be made to the people to forsake their sins and turn to Christ.--GW 159.",
