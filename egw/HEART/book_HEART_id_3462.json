    "word": "Chap. 22 - The Book Committee\n\n     Selection of the Book Committee.--Great care should be exercised in selecting the members of the book committee. The men who are to pass judgment on the books offered for publication should be few and well chosen. Only such as have an experimental knowledge of authorship are qualified to act in this capacity. Only those should be chosen whose hearts are under the control of the Spirit of God. They should be men of prayer, men who do not exalt self, but who love and fear God, and respect their brethren. Only such as, in distrust of self, are led by divine wisdom, are competent to fill this important position.--Testimonies, Vol. 7, p. 160.",
