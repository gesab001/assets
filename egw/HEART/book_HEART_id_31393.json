    "word": "A few faithful laborers have made beginnings here and there. And among our brethren and sisters in the more favored fields of America, there are warm hearts beating in sympathy with the hearts of those who, with integrity and faithfulness, have bravely borne a burden of labor for the colored people, laying a foundation that will be as enduring as eternity. The Lord has been working with and for the tried laborers in the South. Many are preparing to put their shoulders to the wheel, to help advance the work. The cloud of darkness and despondency is rolling back, and the sunshine of God\u2019s favor is shining upon the workers. The Lord is gracious. He will not leave the work in the South in its present condition. The people living in this great field will yet have the privilege of hearing the last message of mercy, warning them to prepare for the great day of God which is right upon us. Now, just now, is our time to proclaim the third angel\u2019s message to the millions living in the Southern States, who know not that the Saviour\u2019s coming is near at hand.",
