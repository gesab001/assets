    "word": "The psalmist prayed, \"Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.\" The Lord heard him, for how full of assurance are the words, \"How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!\" \"More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.\" (Psalm 119:18, 103; 19:10.). And as the Lord heard and answered David, so He will hear and answer us, making our hearts full of gladness and rejoicing.",
