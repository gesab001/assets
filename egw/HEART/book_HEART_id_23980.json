    "word": "\"It is a wonderful place in which to work for the sick, and in which to begin our work for Redlands and Riverside. We must make decided efforts to secure helpers who will do most faithful medical missionary work. If Christ will bless the treatment given and let His healing power be felt, a great work will be accomplished. We shall need to secure competent physicians and nurses,--men and women who are true and faithful, and who can be relied on; men and women who live in constant dependence upon the great Healer; men and women who humble their hearts before God and believe His Word, keeping their eyes fixed on their Leader and Counselor--the Lord Jesus Christ.",
