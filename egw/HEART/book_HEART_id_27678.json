    "word": "The position of Christians will be to keep God's glory in view in this matter. They will not urge their views with a persistency that shows pride and self-will. The spirit of truth and righteousness in the heart will not lead to a course directly contrary to the wishes of God-fearing parents. You should both say, even if your affections do go out to each other, \"We will not bring \n\n\n                                  -309- \n\nunhappiness upon our parents in order to please ourselves. We will never venture another step in this direction, unless these barriers are removed and we have the free consent of our parents.\" This is the way all such engagements should be regarded.",
