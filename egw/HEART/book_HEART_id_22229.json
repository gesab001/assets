    "word": "Study the Cross. \n\n     The cross of Calvary means everything to perishing souls. Through the suffering and death of the Son of Man, the salvation of man was made possible. Through the agency of the Holy Spirit God designs that his image shall be restored in humanity, that a new and living principle of life shall be introduced into the minds that have become defiled by sin. The love of God is fully able to restore, rebuild, encourage, and strengthen every believing soul who will accept the truth as it is in Jesus. But in order that this \n\n\n                    - 42 - \n\nmay be accomplished, men must yoke up with Christ. The cross of Christ must be studied. It must rivet the attention and hold the affections. The blood which there was shed for sins, will purify and cleanse mind and heart from every species of selfishness.",
