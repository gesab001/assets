    "word": "God's people, rescued from the fire by Jesus Christ have a sense of their sin, and feel humbled and ashamed. God sees and recognizes their repentance and notes their sorrow for sin which they cannot remove or cancel themselves; but as they pray, their prayers are heard, and this is the reason that Satan stands by to resist Christ. Because Christ hears their prayers, He maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. He regenerates the sinner, and pardon is written off against his name. This stirs Satan up to resistance. He steps in between the repenting, believing soul and Christ. He seeks to cast his hellish shadow before that soul, to dampen faith, and to make of none effect the words of God. But Christ says, \"Get thee behind me, Satan, let my light and my righteousness shine into this heart.\"",
