    "word": "This morning I was able to rise at four o'clock and dress without disturbing any member of the family. After taking my cold bath, I sat down to write to you. I am able to continue my writing from early morning until evening. Then I put away my work. I am often surprised that my mind is so clear for the work of preparing articles. I am very thankful to my heavenly Father for this clearness of mind and that He gives me such precious thoughts. His Word is full of comfort and hope. Light, precious light, is sown for the righteous, and truth for the upright in heart.",
