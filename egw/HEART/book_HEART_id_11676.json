    "word": "SABBATH SCHOOL TEACHERS PRAY FOR YOUR CLASS MEMBERS.\u2014As workers for God we want more of Jesus and less of self. We should have more of a burden for souls, and should pray daily that strength and wisdom may be given us for the Sabbath. Teachers, meet with your classes. Pray with them, and teach them how to pray. Let the heart be softened, and the petitions short and simple, but earnest.\u2014(Counsels on Sabbath School Work, 125.)",
