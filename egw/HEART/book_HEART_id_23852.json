    "word": "No frown on Christ's countenance spurned the humble suppliant from his presence. The priests and rulers sought to discourage the suffering and needy ones, saying that he healed the sick by the power of the devil. But his way could not be hedged up. He was determined not to fail or become discouraged. Suffering privation himself, he traversed the country that was his scene of labor, scattering his blessings, and seeking to reach obdurate hearts.",
