    "word": "Personal Labour. \n\n     The Lord's servants must not only preach the Word from the pulpit, but must come into personal contact with the people. When a discourse is given precious seed is sown. But if personal effort is not made to cultivate the soil, the seed does not take root. Unless the heart is softened and subdued by the Spirit of God, much of the discourse is lost. Observe who \n\n\n                        - 42 - \n\nin the congregation seem to be interested, and speak to them after the service. A few words spoken in private will often do more good than the whole discourse has done. Inquire how the subjects presented appear to the hearers, whether the truth is clear to their minds. By kindness and courtesy show that you have a real interest in them and a care for their souls. Many have been led to believe that as a people we do not believe in conversion. When we appeal to them to come to Christ many hearts will be softened, and prejudice will be swept away.",
