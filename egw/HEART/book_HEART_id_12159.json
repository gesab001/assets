    "word": "Success Gained in Selling Experience.--He [God] has given His people an opportunity to take to their friends and neighbors and to strangers a book containing the precious lessons of Christ. As those who have never tried to sell books have thought of going out with this book, a dread has come into their hearts. But the Lord has led and guided them as His little children. He has taught old and young, men and women, how to give the light of truth to those who know it not.",
