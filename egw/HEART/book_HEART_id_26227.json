    "word": "We rode twelve miles over the broad prairie. It was keen cold. We became thoroughly chilled, for we had not even a laprobe or buffalo robe to cover our feet and limbs. When we arrived on the ground [at Richland, Kansas] we found a small board tent made for us, furnished with bed, table, and stove, and having floor with carpet on it. We were made very comfortable. We felt thankful in our hearts to our dear friends for this thoughtful care and tenderness of us. A crock was brought with a very fine chrysanthemum in full bloom. We rested and slept well that night.--Ms. 5, 1878, pp. 1, 2. (Diary entry.)",
