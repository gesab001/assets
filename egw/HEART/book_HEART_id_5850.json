    "word": "In view of these grave responsibilities, the question will arise, \u201cWho is sufficient for these things?\u201d [2 Corinthians 2:16.] The heart of the laborer will almost faint as he considers the various arduous duties devolving upon him; but the words of Christ strengthen the soul with the comforting assurance, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d [Matthew 28:20.] The difficulties and dangers that threaten the safety of those he loves, should make him cautious and circumspect in his manner of dealing with them, and watchful of them as one who must give an account. He should judiciously employ his influence in winning souls to Christ, and impressing the truth upon inquiring minds. He should take care that the world, by its delusive attractions, does not lead them away from God, and steel their hearts against the influence of his grace.",
