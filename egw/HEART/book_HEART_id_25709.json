    "word": "The great ignorance on Bible subjects makes it very essential that house-to-house labor be done. An increase of the knowledge of God among the people and the heartfelt, humble prayers that they send to heaven, are of more value than public discourses. This is a work that is precious in the sight of God and in the estimation of the people. The good example set in words and deeds will tell to the glory of God.--Letter 160, 1901, p. 6. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, November 3, 1901.)",
