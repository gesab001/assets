    "word": "The necessity of the Holy Spirit's working should be realized by all. Unless this Spirit is accepted and cherished as the representative of Christ, whose work it is to renew and sanctify the entire being, the momentous truths that have been entrusted to human beings will lose their power on the mind. It is not enough for us to have a knowledge of the truth. We are to walk and work in love, conforming our will to the will of God. Of those who do this the Lord declares, \"I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts\" (Hebrews 8:10). God is the mighty, all-powerful agency in this work of transformation. By His Holy Spirit He writes His law in the heart.",
