    "word": "Abraham\u2019s great act of faith stands like a pillar of light, illuminating the pathway of God\u2019s servants in all succeeding ages. Abraham did not seek to excuse himself from doing the will of God. During that three days\u2019 journey he had sufficient time to reason, and to doubt God, if he was disposed to doubt. . . .

He did not stay to reason with his aching heart. He knew that God is just and righteous in all His requirements, and he obeyed the command to the very letter. . . .",
