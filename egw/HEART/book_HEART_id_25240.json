    "word": "I received and read with deep interest Brother Amadon's letter. I sincerely thank you for writing so fully in regard to our old hands. I thank you any time that you can write; I shall be glad to hear from you. I am sorry, so sorry for Katy. Oh that God may touch the heart of Fred, for he will need a Saviour by and by.
