    "word": "A Change Must Come  \n\n     The Lord would bring His people into a position where they will not touch or taste the flesh of dead animals.

Distrust, disobedience and alienation from God's will and way will place the sinner in a position where the Lord cannot give him His divine favor. \n\n\n                        -2-",
