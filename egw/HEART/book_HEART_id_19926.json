    "word": "In this representation the Lord desired to teach the lesson that He requires in His people purity of character, holiness of life. He desires to see revealed in them toward each other the attributes of mercy and loving kindness and longsuffering, that His people may demonstrate that \"the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul\" (Psalm 19:7). The Lord is ready to manifest Himself to us if our hearts are seeking and serving Him. It is ever His desire to impart the richest blessings to those who serve Him with a pure heart. Christ will be our teacher if we will open our hearts to His instruction and obey His voice. . . .",
