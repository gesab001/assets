    "word": "16: Relationships With Others\n \n\nCommunity\n \n\n     We must not build a wall between ourselves and the world.--Our greatest necessity is a pure, clean heart and an understanding mind. All kinds of malicious falsehoods were circulated against Christ, and they will be circulated against God's commandment-keeping people. How shall we prove these to be false? Shall it be by building up a wall between us and the world? Christ's prayer answers this point: \"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\" While our work is aggressive, it must be conducted on Bible principles. All our enterprises are to be carried forward with Christlike simplicity, patience, forbearance, and love for God and for Christ. Our work is to convince, not to condemn. The human beings around us possess like infirmities with ourselves.--2MR 195.",
