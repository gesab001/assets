    "word": "\"Every one who has to do with educating the younger class of students should consider that these children are affected by, and feel the impression of the atmosphere, whether it be pleasant or unpleasant. If the teacher is connected with God, if he has Christ abiding in his heart, the spirit that is cherished by him is felt by the children. When a teacher manifests impatience or fretfulness toward a child, the fault may not be in the child one half as much as in the teacher, who needs himself to be disciplined and trained, and deserves a heavier punishment than he puts upon the child, for he is old enough to know better.\"-- P.C.",
