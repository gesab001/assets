    "word": "There is not in either conference persons of the right talent to supply all the teachers for a school. New elements must be brought in; they must be supplied by those who know from experience what talents are needed to conduct a school profitably. Pride and ambition, selfish ideas and principles, will not meet the approval of God. All these things must be overcome through the grace of Christ. It is very much in fashion at this time for our brethren to work away from Christ, and do many things in their own finite wisdom. They are not humble in heart; they do not learn in the school of Christ the very lessons they need to learn. They incur peril to their own souls in stubbornly desiring to have their own way; they involve the churches in their conferences in the peril and guilt of fighting against God.",
