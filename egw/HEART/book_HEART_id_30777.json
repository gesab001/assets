    "word": "Those who have a part in the work and cause of God should be careful that they strike no discordant notes. There are some who have been laboring in the S. Calif. Conference who need to lay off the armor for a while until they learn Christ's method of working. They need to be converted; for they give the impression to others that they consider all the other workers out of harmony with them. Thus the seeds of dissension and strife are sown. When these workers take upon them the yoke of Christ, and learn of Him who is meek and lowly in heart, they will return to God in acceptable service the talents He has lent them, and in doing this they will find rest unto their souls. They will hunger and thirst after righteousness, and their desire will be satisfied in a new and living experience. They will become daily students of the word of God; and guided by the light shining from that word, they will follow on to know the Lord, whose going forth is prepared as the morning.",
