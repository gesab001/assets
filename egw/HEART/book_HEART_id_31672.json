    "word": "Words of Encouragement. \n\n     To Brother W. O. Palmer I would say: Be not discouraged. When your fellow workers manifest the spirit of the enemy by saying and doing things that hurt, keep silent; for this is your strength. When you are misjudged and tantalized, remember that you are not the only one who is wounded. Christ, in the person of his saints, receives the insults that are intended for us. Look to Jesus; behold his hands and his feet pierced for your sake; say within your heart, He was wounded for my transgressions. He was bruised for my iniquities, the chastisement of my peace was upon him, and with his stripes I am healed.",
