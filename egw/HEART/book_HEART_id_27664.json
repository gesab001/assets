    "word": "MR No. 1346 - Counsel to Physicians and Medical Students\n\n The Necessity of Delegating Responsibility and Training Assistants \n\n\n     The truth, God's truth, must be cherished in the heart, and held in the strength of God, or the powers of Satan will wrench it from you. You need to be self-reliant and yet teachable, then you can have strength to be faithful to duty. To trust to your own resources, your own wisdom or strength, is folly. You will be brought to confusion if you do this. You can walk securely only when you follow the counsel of God.",
