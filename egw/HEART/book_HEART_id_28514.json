    "word": "The Lord calls upon every member of the church to be on guard. The Voice said, Be on guard. The Lord Jesus has warned us in His Word of what shall be. Will anyone say of this warning, This does not agree with our ideas, and pay no attention to the warning? The Lord has lifted the danger signal that all may hear and take heed to the warnings. The great danger is in exalting man. Human beings cannot bear exaltation. Jesus invites us, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\"--Letter 280a, 1904. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nMay 9, 1991. Entire Letter.",
