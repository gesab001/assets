    "word": "These teachers, if they are really men of God, receive their words from God. Their manner of address may be faulty, and need much improvement; yet if God breathes through them, words of inspiration, the power is not of man, but of God. The \n45\nGiver should have the glory and the heart's affections, while the minister should be esteemed, loved, and respected for his work's sake, because he is God's servant to bear the message of mercy to sinners. The Son of God is often eclipsed by the man standing between him and the people. The man is praised, petted, and exalted, and the people get scarcely a glimpse of Jesus, who, by the precious beams of light reflected from him, should eclipse everything besides.",
