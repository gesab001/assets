    "word": "By reason of the waste in the body, the blood must be constantly renewed by food. So with our spiritual life. The Word must be daily received, believed, and acted upon. Christ must dwell in us, energizing the whole being, renewing the lifeblood of the soul. His example is to be our guide. In our dealing with one another, we must reveal His sympathy. There must be a real working out of Christ's grace in our hearts. Then we can say with the apostle, \"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\" Christ's life abiding in the soul is the cause of joy and the pledge of our glory.--Review and Herald, Oct. 1, 1901.",
