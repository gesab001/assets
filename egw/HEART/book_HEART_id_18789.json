    "word": "Many who profess to be Christians do not more than half believe the Word of God. They do not study it earnestly, but waste precious time in reading \n58\nnovels and story-books. A mere intellectual understanding of the Word of God will not be sufficient to influence the habits of the life, for the life is regulated by the condition of the heart. When Sabbath-school teachers have taught the lessons of external revelation, their work is but just begun, and they should not cease their labor until they have evidence that the precepts of heaven are not only accepted by the understanding of the pupil, but written upon the heart.\u2014S.S.W., April, 1892.",
