    "word": "I have been writing out some things for those who are fearful and trembling, and will send you a copy. I have not slept since half-past one o'clock, for the burden of your soul and of other souls has been upon me. I want you not only to receive but to practice the truth. In the world, when men's hearts are set on doing mischief, their minds are fruitful in resources for accomplishing their evil work. Would it not be altogether pleasing to the Lord if you would begin to put faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, accepting His invitation, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, (the yoke of restraint and obedience) and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light\"?",
