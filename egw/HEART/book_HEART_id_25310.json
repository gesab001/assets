    "word": "I ask you to consider, Have we indeed the last message of mercy to be given to the world? If we have the truth, we have a great and important work before us. We should keep a close connection with God, for it is through His power alone we can reach hearts and minds with a truth which requires self-denial and the lifting of the cross to obey it. The work must go to regions beyond. The world is to be warned, the message of truth must be heard and will be heeded by some, and be to them a savor of life unto life, while to others it is a savor of death unto death.",
