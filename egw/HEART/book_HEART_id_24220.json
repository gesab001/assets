    "word": "The spiritual condition of the Health Institute is not likely to improve under the superintendence of Bro. G_____, for he himself lacks the true spirituality that should lead him to follow closely the directions of the Lord. It is easier for Bro. G_____ to say, Do this, or that, than for him to say, Come let us do this or that, and take hold of the work heartily himself, thereby encouraging all those connected with the institution to do their duty. In some matters he tries to redeem the failures of others, and improves upon their example, but he fails to see his own defects and correct them.",
