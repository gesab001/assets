    "word": "Let every root of bitterness be weeded out of the heart. Let most thorough work be done with self. Let the men who are in office keep their hearts under the control of the Holy Spirit. Let them not treat men as though they were hardly a sack of oats; men who have minds with whom God has been and is working. Let them be careful of their actions. They cannot with God's approval pull down, uproot, and transplant men who understand what it means to be taught and moved by the Spirit of God.",
