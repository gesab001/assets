    "word": "Great responsibility comes to those who have been baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Strive to understand the meaning of the words, \"Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\" In the new life upon which you have entered, you are pledged to represent the life of Christ. Having put on the new man, \"which is renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created him,\" \"put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful\" [verses 12-15].",
