    "word": "The psalmist asks, \"Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.\" When anyone comes to you with a tale about your neighbor, you should refuse to hear it. You should say to him, \"Have you spoken of this matter to the individual concerned?\" ... Tell him he should obey the Bible rule, and go first to his brother, and tell him his fault privately, and in love. If the directions of God were carried out, the floodgates of gossip would be closed.",
