    "word": "Chap. 3 - A Tool for Evangelism\n\n     Speech for Witnessing--God has given us the gift of speech that we may recite to others His dealing with us, that His love and compassion may touch other hearts, and that praise may arise from other souls also to Him who has called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. The Lord has said, \"Ye are My witnesses\" (Isaiah 43:10). But all who are called to be witnesses for Christ must learn of Him, that they may be efficient witnesses. As children of the heavenly King, they should educate themselves to bear testimony in a clear, distinct voice, and in such a manner that no one may receive the impression that they are reluctant to tell of the mercies of the Lord.--CT 243.",
