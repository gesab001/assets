    "word": "\u201cBut some love this world so well that they will not, even for the immortal inheritance, sacrifice their treasure here. They harden their hearts, and will not do their part as God has prospered them. They are fully tested; the world lives in their hearts, and the truth dies out. They lose the crowns laid up in Heaven for them, and God raises up others who come up and fill their places, and take their crowns. Men are raised up who consider it a privilege to sacrifice something for Jesus, who sacrificed so much for them. I was shown individuals who, although they have heard the solemn truths for these last days, and the coming of Christ is brought nigh them by the fulfillment of prophecy, have no thoughts of loosening their grasp of this world. They have no idea of sacrificing their treasure here.",
