    "word": "The thought that children have ministered to the comfort of their parents is a thought of satisfaction all through the life, and will especially bring them joy when they themselves are in need of sympathy and love.  Those whose hearts are filled with love will regard the privilege of smoothing the passage to the grave for their parents an inestimable privilege.  They will rejoice that they had a part in bringing comfort and peace to the last days of their loved parents.  To do otherwise than this, to deny to the helpless aged ones the kindly ministrations of sons and daughters, would fill the soul with remorse, the days with regret, if our hearts were not hardened and cold as a stone.",
