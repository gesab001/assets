    "word": "Before him every face turns pale, and upon those whom God has rejected, falls the blackness of despair. The righteous cry with trembling, \"Who shall be able to stand?\" The song of the angels ceases, and there is a period of awful silence. Then the voice of Jesus is heard, saying, \"My grace is sufficient for you.\" The faces of the righteous are lighted up, and joy fills every heart. And the angels strike a note higher, and sing again, as they draw still nearer to the earth.",
