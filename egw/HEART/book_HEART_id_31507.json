    "word": "We need young, strong workers, such as Brother Hickox and his wife. The Lord will use both of them if they will walk humbly with God. The time they have spent doing little has not been so spent because the Lord refused to use them, but because of the Pharisaism manifested by the men who need the converting power of Christ, the light of the world, to shine into their confused human minds, teaching them that they are not gods, and that they must leave God to deal with his workmen. There is only one true method by which any man can work. He must learn of Him who is meek and lowly in heart. We must go more earnestly and humbly, with more contrition of soul, and ask of God wisdom, as he has appointed. \n\n\n                                 -67- \n\nFor the same reasons that Brother Hickox is not received and supported by his brethren in his work, other ministers might be regarded as unfit for labor. I want to put this matter before you in the light in which it has been placed before me. The Lord has high claims upon Brother and Sister Hickox. They have much to learn, as have all who are connected with the great work of the Master; but I entreat the men who should be helpers of those who in an emergency need help, not to prove hindrances and stumbling blocks in their way.",
