    "word": "Brother Harris, the methods by which you design to raise means for the advancement of the cause of God, as set forth in your statement, do not bear the divine credentials, and therefore should not be accepted by the people. If you persist in carrying out your ideas, your work will have to be met by the message that God has given me. It is not by any such methods as you have adopted that God makes known \n                                                                           26\nHis will to His children. These sleight-of-hand methods are the devices of the enemy to work on human hearts and lead them from God into deception and confusion.",
