    "word": "You have given the heavenly intelligences no chance to co-operate with you; for you suppose yourselves to be wise in judgment and in making decisions. Your supreme love for self is an over-mastering power. You know not by practice what genuine love for your neighbor means. But Christ says, \"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and ye offend in one point, he is guilty of all.\" It is, as you may know by Adam's transgression, not the greatness of the act that constitutes it a sin, but the fact that you are at variance with God's expressed will in the least particular. This shows that sin reigns in your heart. You still have communion with the enemy, and you cherish his attributes. The heart is divided. There has been a virtual denial of the Holy Spirit of God and a rebellion against his law.",
