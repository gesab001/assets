    "word": "Christ, in opening to the minds of the Samaritans the word of life, sowed many seeds of truth, and showed the people how they too could sow seeds of truth in the minds of others. How much good might be accomplished, if all who know the truth would labor for sinners,--for those who need so much to know and understand Bible truth, and who would respond to it as readily as the Samaritans responded to the words of Christ! How little do we enter into sympathy with God on the point that should be the strongest bond of union between us and Him,--compassion for depraved, guilty, suffering souls, dead in trespasses and sins! If men shared the sympathies of Christ, they would have constant sorrow of heart over the condition of many needy fields, so destitute of workers.",
