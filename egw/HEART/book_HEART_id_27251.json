    "word": "Oh, how interestedly is the universe of heaven watching to see how many faithful servants are bearing the sins of the people on their hearts and afflicting their souls; how many are colaborers with Jesus Christ to become repairers of the breach which the ungodly had made, and restorers of the paths which others have sought to obliterate. The path of faith and righteousness must be restored. Our salvation is not built upon works of \n\n\n                                      -224- \n\nrighteousness which we have done, but upon God's mercy and love. We may put all the works of our own righteousness together, but they will be found to be as sliding sand. We cannot rest upon them.",
