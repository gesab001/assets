    "word": "But Satan comes to us with worldly honor, wealth, and the pleasures of life. These temptations are varied to meet people of every rank and degree, tempting them away from God to serve themselves more than their Creator. \u201cAll these things will I give thee,\u201d said Satan to Christ. \u201cAll these things will I give thee,\u201d says Satan to us. \u201cAll this money, this land, all this power, this honor, and these riches, will I give thee,\u201d and we are charmed, deceived, and treacherously allured on to our ruin. If we give ourselves up to worldliness of heart and of life, Satan is satisfied.",
