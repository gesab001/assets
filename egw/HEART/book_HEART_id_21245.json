    "word": "Care is always to be taken not to strain the vocal organs. They are to be kept as smooth as possible. When you are speaking before a congregation, let the abdominal muscles have the hardest part of the work to do. The light given me for you is that you are to do more public speaking, and that you are to be sure, when speaking, to exercise the abdominal muscles. Your brain has been overstrained. Take heed to the things I write you, and you will see that my words are true. As you engage in the work the Lord points out for you, \n                                                                           201\nthe Spirit of God will impress minds through the words you speak. The spoken word will make a deeper impression on hearts than the printed word.--Lt 92, 1910.",
