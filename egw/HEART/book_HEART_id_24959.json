    "word": "Waists, Tight Bands Around.--Some women think it necessary to girdle and lace their waist as though it were not made small enough. That is why we see the difficulty of such short breathing. . . . Do not for Christ's sake crowd your heart; it is the machine of the whole body. It is the habitation God has given us. David said, \"I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\"  Do parents consider that they are laying the foundation for an early death?  I am sorry to see those broad shoulders and small waists. It is wrong not to let the human machinery do its work.--Ms 9, 1893.",
