    "word": "Do not think that you show love for one another by allowing that which God condemns. Do not let sin strengthen in the church. God requires His servants to exercise faithful watchcare. But be sure to manifest Christ's love. Go to the erring one, and pray with him. Draw him to Jesus. Press together, heart bound to heart in the love of Christ. Then will be seen in the church the mighty power of God. Then many souls will be brought to the truth. There is to be a decided work done of purification of leading men who need to be true as steel to principle. God would not justify any man to place himself as dictator [over] what others must do when [he] himself needs the converting grace of Christ, else he will place many souls in false paths.",
