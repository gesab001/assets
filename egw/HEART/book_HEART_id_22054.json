    "word": "THE WEEK OF PRAYER IS NOW NEAR AT HAND, AND WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO EXPECT A GRACIOUS OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. MANY ARE HUNGERING AND THIRSTING AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND THE PROMISE OF THE LORD IS THAT THEY SHALL BE FILLED. NEVER WERE WE MORE NEEDY OF GOD'S BLESSING THAN NOW, AND NEVER WAS GOD MORE WILLING TO BESTOW HIS BLESSING. AS MINISTERS WE SHOULD PROPERLY LEAD OUT IN THE WORK. MAY THIS BE SO INDEED AT THIS TIME. THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS AWAITING OUR DEMAND AND RECEPTION. JUST AS SURELY AS WE SEEK THE LORD WITH ALL THE HEART, SO SURELY HE WILL BE FOUND OF US.",
