    "word": "But I said, \"Brother Foster, you have the Bible. Search its pages with a prayerful heart; your Redeemer has promised that the Holy Spirit shall lead you into all truth. You have an Instructor that is full of wisdom, one who never errs. I charge you before God to cease worrying, receive the precious rays of light that come to you, feast upon the truth as it in Jesus, walk in the light while you have the light, and more light will shine upon you from the Source of all light. Do not suffer your mind to dwell upon the differences you think you discern. If our leading Brethren are so unwise as to allow their conflicting views to appear in the paper published to go to the world; if they present these differences before the large gatherings that assemble to worship God in the tabernacle or else where, they are doing the very things the Lord Jesus told them not to do, and going directly contrary to the light given them through the testimonies.\" \n\n\n                                                          151.",
