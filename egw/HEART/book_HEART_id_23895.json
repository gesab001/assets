    "word": "The evils of fashionable society have a tendency to corrupt, but every true follower of Christ, every one who has \"this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as He is pure,\" so that not a taint of defilement will be found in his thoughts, or upon his lips, in his heart, or in his character. There must be a coming up to a higher, holier standard. A decided warfare should be waged against the evils, not only in the world, but also among those who claim to believe the truth for this time. These evils, if not put away, will result in spiritual death. The Lord bids us, \"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good \n\n\n                   -14- \n\nworks, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" There must be a waking up; concentrated effort must be put forth, that will tell powerfully against every form of evil.",
