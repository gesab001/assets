    "word": "God has shown me that He gave His people a bitter cup to drink, to purify and cleanse them. . . . This bitter cup can be sweetened by patience, endurance, and prayer, and . . . it will have its designed effect upon the hearts of those who thus receive it, and God will be honored and glorified. It is no small thing to be a Christian and to be owned and approved of God.",
