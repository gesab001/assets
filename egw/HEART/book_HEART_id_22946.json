    "word": "I have been troubled over these things, and years ago took the position that if I had any duty to pray for the sick, I would come before the Lord with a petition of this kind: \"Lord we can not read the heart of this sick one; but thou knowest whether it is for the good of his soul, and for the glory of thy name to raise him to health. In thy great goodness, compassionate this case, and let healthy action take place in the system. The work must be entirely thine own. We have done all that human skill can do; now, Lord, we lay this case at thy feet; work thou as only God can work; and if it be for thy glory, arrest the progress of disease and heal this sufferer.\"",
