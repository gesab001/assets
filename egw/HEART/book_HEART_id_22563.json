    "word": "The work of God for this time is not to be supported by the results of wild speculation. God would have our energies drawn out, not in a speculative experience that will lead souls on to Satan's ground, but in honest, hard work that produces beneficial results, and in earnestly seeking Him to know His will. Here we shall find certainty, and not guesswork. Those who seek the Lord with all the heart, will obtain a knowledge of their duty, and the assurance that the prayers of God's faithful people are honored in heaven.",
