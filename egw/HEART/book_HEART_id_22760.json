    "word": "In the renewed heart there will be a fixed principle to obey the will of God because there is a love for what is just, and good, and holy. There will not be a hesitating, a conferring with the taste, or studying of convenience, or moving in a certain course because others have done so. Every one should live for themselves. The minds of all who are renewed by grace will be an open medium, continually receiving light, grace, and truth, from above, and transmitting it to others. Their works are fruitful and have their fruit unto holiness, and the end is everlasting life.",
