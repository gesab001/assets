    "word": "The love of Jesus in the heart will always be revealed in tender compassion for the souls of those for whom Christ paid so dear a price. \"Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. . . . And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight\" (1 John 3:18-22). There is no such thing as a loveless Christian. . . .",
