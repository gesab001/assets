    "word": "The Lord wishes you to learn how to use the gospel net. Many need to learn this art. In order for you to be successful in your work, the meshes of your net--the application of the Scriptures--must be close, and the meaning easily discerned. Then make the most of drawing in the net. Come right to the point. Make your illustrations self-evident. However great a man's knowledge, it is of no avail unless he is able to communicate it to others. \n                                                                           254\nLet the pathos of your voice, its deep feeling, make its impression on hearts. Urge your students to surrender themselves to God.",
