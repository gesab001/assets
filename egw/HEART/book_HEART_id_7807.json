    "word": "\u201cThose who have experienced the cleansing efficacy of the blood of Christ upon their hearts will be like their Master, pure, peaceable, and lowly of heart. No matter how bold and earnest one may be in his claims of spiritual soundness and perfection of character, if he lacks Christian grace and humility the dregs of sin are still in his nature, and, unless \n212\nthey are purged from him, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. The truly holy, who walk with God like Enoch of old, will not be boastful of their purity, but be courteous, humble, unselfish, free from spiritual pride and exaltation. Those who know most of God, and keep their eye fixed on the Author and Finisher of their faith, will see nothing good or great in themselves. They will feel, after doing all in their power to be faithful, that they are yet unprofitable servants.",
