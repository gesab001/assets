    "word": "Some are stony-ground hearers. They readily receive anything new and exciting. \n                                                                           141\nThe word of truth they receive with joy. And with ardor and zeal they talk earnestly in reference to their faith and hope, and may even administer reproof to those of long experience for some apparent deficiency or for their lack of enthusiasm. But when they are tested and proved by the heat of trial and temptation, when the pruning-knife of God is applied, that they may bring forth fruit unto perfection, their zeal dies, their voice is silent. No longer do they boast in the strength and power of truth. This class are controlled by feelings. They have not depth and stability of character. Principle does not reach down deep, underlying the springs of action. They have in word exalted the truth, but are not doers of that word. The seed of truth has not rooted down below the surface. The heart has not been renewed by the transforming influence of the Spirit of God. And when the truth calls for working men and women, when sacrifices have to be made for the truth's sake, they are somewhere else; and when trials and persecution come; they fall away because they have no deepness of earth. The truth, plain, pointed, and close, is brought to bear upon the heart, and reveals the deformity of character. Some will not bear this test, but frequently close their eyes to their imperfections, although their consciences tell them \n                                                                           142\nthat the words spoken by the messengers of God, which bears so closely upon their Christian characters, are truth; yet they will not listen to the voice. They are offended because of the word, and yield the truth rather than to submit to be sanctified through the truth. They flatter themselves that they may get to Heaven an easier way.",
