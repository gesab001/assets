    "word": "Dear brethren, we need now to carefully consider every plan. We need now to humble our hearts before God. We need now not to wait in a careless attitude, but in an attentive, reverent attitude. \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\" [Acts 9:6]. \"Speak, Lord; for Thy servant heareth\" [1 Samuel 3:9]. We are living in the most critical period of this earth's history. We are fully conscious of the great need of workers; but, my brethren, greatly as we need efficient helpers, we must not be careless and allow the work to be cumbered with driftwood. We must draw nigh to God every day, every hour.",
