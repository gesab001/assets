    "word": "Jesus was the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, and yet in His human life He was patient, kind, courteous, benevolent, full of love for little children, and full of pity and compassion for the tempted, the tried, and the oppressed. Of Himself He said, \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set a liberty them that are bruised,....\" (Luke 4:18, 19).",
