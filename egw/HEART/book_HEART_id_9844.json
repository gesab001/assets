    "word": "\"Long-suffering\" is patience with offence; long endurance. If you are long-suffering, you will not impart to others your supposed knowledge of your brother's mistakes and errors. You will seek to help and save him, because he has been purchased with the blood of Christ. \"Tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.\" \"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\" To be long-suffering is not to be gloomy and sad, sour and hardhearted; it is to be exactly the opposite.",
