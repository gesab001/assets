    "word": "I am getting to be very tired of moving. It worries me out, settling and unsettling, gathering up Manuscripts and scattering them, to be gathered up again. If I should look to my poor, finite self, I should soon become discouraged; but in looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of my faith, I take courage, and press forward with His name on my lips to the mark for the prize of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus. If we at times feel our infirmities encompassing us, and a discouragement comes upon us, we must look away from self unto Jesus, and pray for spiritual eyesight. We need it now, in order to understand His word. A flood of light is poured into the chambers of the mind and the soul temple that we may understand the scriptures. There is truth, precious, sacred truth. \"The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding to the simple.\" All who are simple (meek and lowly in heart) will humble self, and seek counsel of the Lord in His Holy word. Feeling is nothing reliable, but the word is solid rock. We can safely study our Bibles, and the Holy Spirit will impress our minds and heart.",
