    "word": "Let all in the sanitarium, whether high or low, take heed that not one soul with whom they are connected shall suffer from their peculiar selfish, egotistical notions. Be broad, noble, and Christlike; and this comprehends all goodness and faithfulness. Let it be impressed upon every soul that the moral tone in every department of the sanitarium must be elevated. Time must be given to personal religious culture. All must learn their lessons in the school of Christ, learn to wear His yoke and to bear His burdens, not burdens of their own making. \"Learn of Me,\" says Jesus, \"for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" Let those in command learn how to train others by first training themselves to do justice and to love mercy. Do not excuse anything in yourselves that you would condemn in another. Never, never, seek to make the workers under you feel the hand of oppression.",
