    "word": "The announcement which had been made by the disciples in the name of the Lord was in every particular correct, and the events to which it pointed were even then taking place. \u201cThe time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at hand,\u201d had been their message. At the expiration of \u201cthe time\u201d\u2014the sixty-nine weeks of Daniel 9, which were to \n347\nextend to the Messiah, \u201cthe Anointed One\u201d\u2014Christ had received the anointing of the Spirit, after his baptism by John in Jordan. And the \u201ckingdom of God\u201d which they had declared to be at hand, was established by the death of Christ. This kingdom was not, as they had been taught to believe, an earthly empire. Nor was it that future, immortal kingdom which shall be set up when \u201cthe kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High;\u201d that everlasting kingdom, in which \u201call dominions shall serve and obey him.\u201d [Daniel 7:27.] As used in the Bible, the expression \u201ckingdom of God\u201d is employed to designate both the kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory. The kingdom of grace is brought to view by Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews. After pointing to Christ, the compassionate intercessor who is \u201ctouched with the feeling of our infirmities,\u201d the apostle says, \u201cLet us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace.\u201d [Hebrews 4:16.] The throne of grace represents the kingdom of grace; for the existence of a throne implies the existence of a kingdom. In many of his parables, Christ uses the expression, \u201cthe kingdom of Heaven,\u201d to designate the work of divine grace upon the hearts of men.",
