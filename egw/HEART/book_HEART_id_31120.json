    "word": "It is those who are in positions of trust, those who have great light, large opportunities, who are not forming characters and carrying into their life practice principles that will stand the test of trial. These need to be rebuked sharply for their influence over the young. The impetuous temper must be eradicated. When provoked do not pour out a torrent of words and commit sin; but talk with your Lord about it. Say to your soul, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" If the God-given responsibilities of saving souls ready to perish, were understood, old habits, traditionary sentiments that clog and hinder reformatory action would be cut away from the heart and life, and a transformation would take place in character. Advice, reproof, and counsel should be given patiently, taking the bitterness of the self-mingling spirit out of it. The language should not be exaggerated, but should be gentle and humble, The stern, harsh spirit that humiliates and crushes the wrong-doer will seldom work a reformation. \"Thy gentleness hath made me great.\" It sets before the wrong-doer his sins, and helps him to recover himself from the snares of Satan.",
