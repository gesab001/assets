    "word": "If all had been doers of the Word, a great work would have been done for the Master, zealously, faithfully, untiringly. Light has been given me that if the Lord's people do not strive more earnestly to make the truth of the Word of God more widely known, the Lord will raise up other instruments, who, in the spirit of John the Baptist, will do His work. Darkness has covered the earth, and gross darkness the people. But the Holy Spirit can speak and will speak to the hearts and minds of men. Those God chooses are taught of Him.",
