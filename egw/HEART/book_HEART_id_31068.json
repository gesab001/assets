    "word": "Do that which presents itself in its time, demanding the first attention. Do not pass by the first duty to do the second. One duty accomplished prepares the way for the next. Readiness to engage in the second known duty brings the Lord's blessing. And the second duty is more easily done if the first has been faithfully performed. The burden is off the soul. The heart is filled with the peace and gladness of Christ. \n\n                                               -",
