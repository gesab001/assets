    "word": "\"A prudent wife is from the Lord.\" Proverbs 19:14. \"The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her. . . .\" \"She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her,\" saying, \"Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.\" Proverbs 31:11, 12, 26-29. He who gains such a wife \"findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord.\" \n                                                                           257",
