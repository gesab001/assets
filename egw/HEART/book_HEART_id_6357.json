    "word": "When Jesus said of the widow, She \"hath cast in more than they all,\" [Luke 21:3] His words were true, not only of the motives of the giver, but of the results of the gift. The \"two mites, which make a farthing,\" [Mark 12:42.]  have brought to God's treasury an amount of money far greater than the contributions of the rich Jews. Like a stream small at its beginning, but widening and deepening as it flows toward the ocean, the influence of that little gift has widened and deepened as it has flowed through the ages. The example of self-sacrifice shown by the poor widow has acted and reacted upon thousands of hearts in every land and in every age. It has brought to the treasury of God gifts from the high and the low, the rich and the poor. It has helped to sustain missions, to establish hospitals, to feed the hungry, and to preach the gospel to the poor. Multitudes have been blessed through her unselfish deed. And in like manner every gift bestowed, every act performed, with a sincere desire for God's glory, is linked with the purposes of Omnipotence. Its results for good no man can measure. \n                                                                           468",
