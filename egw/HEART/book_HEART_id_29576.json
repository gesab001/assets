    "word": "We may all gain a deep and rich experience here if we will seek for it with all our hearts, humbling ourselves under the mighty hand of God, and letting God--not we ourselves--do the lifting of us up. Christ in the heart is the death blow to all our self-love. Selfishness and covetousness--which is idolatry--lead a man to wish to be his own Savior and to trust proudly in his own human, finite capability and merits for salvation. They will fail him every day if he does this, and be to him eternal loss hereafter. He will be like the blind leading the blind; both will fall into the ditch.",
