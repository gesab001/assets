    "word": "I was shown at a certain time when the Spirit of the Lord was working upon those connected with the Institution, some confessions were made. They seemed to be assembled in a meeting of worship. Elder R_____ was standing upon his feet, and the Spirit of God was deeply moving upon his heart to confess his way out of darkness into the light. But he only spoke in general terms. He in no wise cleared his soul from the stains of wrong on his part in connection with Sr. H_____. He trembled for a while under the promptings of the Spirit of God, but refused to humiliate his soul before God in lifting the cross.--Letter 33, 1888, pp. 4-6. (To M. J. Church, March 21, 1888.)",
