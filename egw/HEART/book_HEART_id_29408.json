    "word": "I know from the light that God has been pleased to give me that those who have long held responsible position are inclined to feel that they have a right to exercise more authority than their positions justify them to. God will sanction no tyranny, no sharp dictation; for this naturally repels souls and they are unfavorably affected by the manifestation of this disagreeable spirit which stirs up the worst passion of the human heart. If men in responsible office do not show partiality but exercise the patience and kindness of Jesus they will find this course more effective than the preaching of sermons, the exercise of power, or the presentation of strong argument. The silent influence of Christian character will fall upon men as the sunbeams of heaven. May God help you to do right because it is right.",
