    "word": "Reverence God and His purchased possession. Be careful of your manners, because you are Christ's representative. Guard your words carefully, and labor earnestly for the conviction and conversion of sinners. Keep the heart uplifted to God in prayer. When unkind, untrue words are spoken to you, do not lose control of yourself. Remember that \"a soft answer turneth away wrath\" (Proverbs 15:1), and that he that rules his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city.",
