    "word": "These will go through the world doing but very little good, boisterous and obtrusive, pushing themselves to the front, and thus, by their want of wisdom, demerit the truth, and misrepresent in every way the religion of Jesus Christ. They, in the place of bringing souls to Christ, disgust them and turn them away from the truth. They are lost because of the want of Christian grace to lead them to take a course of meekness and lowliness, as did Christ. \"But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.\" \n\n\n                                      -3-",
