    "word": "The scenery through which we passed was altogether too majestic, too awfully grand, to give anything like a description that can compare to the scenery as it really is. The battlements of rocks--the time-worn rocky walls that have stood since the Flood, washed with the mountain torrents-- stand out smooth as if polished, while rocks diverse from these in shape are seen in regular layers as if art had fashioned them. Here on this ride, from three o'clock until past six, we viewed the most interesting, grand scenery that our eyes ever looked upon. The rocks ascend higher and still higher from the earth and growing from these rocks are beautiful, dark-colored pines intermingled with the lighter and most beautiful living green of the maple and beech. These rocks are covered to the very summit with their garment of rich foliage which nature has furnished. In the heart of these mountains of rocks are tunnels, one after another, many of them close together.",
