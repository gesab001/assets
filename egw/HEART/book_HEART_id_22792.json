    "word": "As we engage in the work of distributing our publications, we can, from warm and throbbing hearts, speak of a Saviour's love. God alone has the power to forgive sins. If we do not deliver this message to the unconverted, our neglect may prove their ruin. Blessed, soul-saving, Bible truths are to be published in our papers. The Lord calls upon all of us to seek to save perishing souls.",
