    "word": "We have a great work to do. Not to tell them that there is no law. No law to govern heavenly and human intelligences? Whoever picks that up is in Satan's army and you cannot afford to be there. I beseech you to seek the Lord with all your heart that you may find Him to be precious to your soul. Jesus died that you might have salvation, that you might go on, not linking hands with the world, not that you might know more and more of the world, but that you might know God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.",
