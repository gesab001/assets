Not long hence, a call will be made for a settlement of \n                                                                           100\naccounts, and you will be asked, \"How much owest thou unto my Lord?\" If you have refused to deal honestly with God, I beseech you to think of your deficiency, and if possible to make restitution.

Now, while mercy's sweet voice is still heard, while it is not yet too late for wrongs to be righted, while it is called today, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.--R. & H. Supplement, Dec. 1, 1896.",
