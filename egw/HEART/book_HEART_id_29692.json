    "word": "I do not expect to be at your General Conference. I would rather run the other way. I wish Dr. Waggoner could be teacher in the ministerial institute, and think that is his place, but could you see the pitiful condition of things here! I hoped to do something, but to my great sorrow I seem to be in a helpless condition. My brethren, who thought they were doing God service in discouraging my heart, in obstructing my way, in opposing themselves to all that I was in the fear of God trying to do, could they look upon me, would see something of their work. They made my work fifty-fold harder than it would otherwise have been. I wonder if these earnest, zealous men who were engaged in sowing questionings and doubts and resistance, and stubbornness in rejecting the counsel of God against themselves have thought of these words? \"Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty\" (Judges 5:23).",
