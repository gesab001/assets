    "word": "This is the unity that Christ prayed should be seen among His disciples. This is the heartfelt prayer that should come from human lips and voice. Every true laborer will work in harmony with this prayer. How can we be in unity with the Father and with the Son when in our efforts to advance the work, we do not reveal that oneness in sentiment and practice that testifies that we are God's witnesses, when we have not love for one another? Is it not time that His sign should be given to the world? Is it not time that we showed, by our love for one another, that the love of God is abiding in our hearts? Bible truth, believed and practiced, reveals the oneness that exists between the Father and the Son. This manifestation of unity separates all selfishness from the character, and is an evidence that God loves the followers of Christ as He loves His Son.",
