    "word": "Let your heart be examined. Do justice to yourself. What are you doing with the light and privileges that God has given you? Are the youth degrading the dignity of the mind as well as of the body? With eternity in view, with God before your eyes, will you let Satan take possession of your thoughts and your affections? I call upon you, my brother, to have regard for your own well-being for time and for eternity. You must choose for yourself. It is life or death with you. Just as long as you are intemperate you will be unable to appreciate eternal things. The principle you adopt becomes a living, molding influence; it will enter and will dwell in the depths of your nature.",
