    "word": "You need to realize the necessity of home religion, and earnest activity for the glory of God. Let the sanctification of the truth come into your home life. Let there be nothing common in your words and actions. May the softening, subduing, and sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit impart to you meekness and gentleness, and may the presence of the Spirit close the door of the heart to the great apostate who is determined, if possible, to gain control. If you could but see as the Lord sees, you would discern how persistently the enemy of souls is seeking to attain the ascendancy. . . .",
