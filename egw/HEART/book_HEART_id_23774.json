    "word": "We must become men and women of God's opportunity, for great responsibilities and possibilities are within the reach of all who have enlisted under Christ's banner for life service. It is the design of God that we should all glorify him by using every capability as his, regarding his service as the chief end of our existence. He desires us to work to the utmost of our knowledge and power to carry out the purpose for which he has \n\n\n                        -2- \n\ngiven us life. A decided work is to be done just now to accomplish God's plan. Just now every stroke should tell for the Master in the work of selling \"Christ's Object Lessons.\" God desires his people to be vitalized for work as they have never been before, both for their own good and for the upbuilding of his cause. The work that he calls them to do he will make a blessing to them. Their hearts will be more tender, their thoughts more spiritual, their service more Christlike; for ministering angels will be round about them. Those who do not feel the necessity of doing this work promptly, thoroughly, and earnestly, but who express unbelief and criticism, will lose the peace and joy that come from carrying out the purposes of God.",
