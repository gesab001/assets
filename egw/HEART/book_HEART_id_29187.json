    "word": "There are many who dishonor Christ by their unsanctified \n\n                               -70- \n\nlives. But there are men who have lived with their eyes fixed on the Saviour. There are faithful ones, who have served the Lord with uprightness of heart. Their lives have borne witness to the truth of the words, \"The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold; yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.\"",
