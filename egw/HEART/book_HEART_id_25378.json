    "word": "A large number will not go without the camp, bearing the reproach, as did Jesus their Master, and yet by their attitude, by their inconsistent conduct, they actually weaken the efforts of those who are bearing the heavy burdens. They know nothing of what it means to be meek and lowly of heart. They know nothing of what it means to be self-denying, of what it means to be a partaker with those who go forth to labor in the cause of God.--Letter 31, 1894, pp. 7-9. (To Walter Harper, September 23, 1894.)",
