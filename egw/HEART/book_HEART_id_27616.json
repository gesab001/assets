    "word": "St. Helena, Feb. 3, 1902. I thank the Lord I am in my own home. I am still suffering with throat and lungs and heart difficulty. I have an urgent invitation to occupy rooms in the house I built and sold to the sanitarium on the hillside. The rooms I occupied as my own are now to be used by me if I will accept them and take treatment at the sanitarium. But this is not an easy thing to do. Here are my workers in the office I have built to accommodate them. Should I leave, the work could not be carried on successfully. I appreciate the favor so kindly presented to me. I shall make every effort that I think in my weak condition I can bear. I have decided to remain in my own home, if I can do \n\n\n                                  -212- \n\nso, until I am strong enough to ride in my carriage to the sanitarium and take treatment, which I cannot possibly do just now.",
