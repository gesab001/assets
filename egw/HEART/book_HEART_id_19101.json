    "word": "Give Not Glory to Man \n\n     Paul, when speaking to the Corinthians, says, \"We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.\" This is what Christ taught His disciples: \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" Paul would impress upon the minds of the ministers and people the reason why the gospel was committed to weak and erring men--that man might not receive the honor due to God only, but that God might receive all the glory. The ambassador is not to congratulate himself and take to himself the honor of success, or even to divide the honor with God, as if by his own power he had accomplished the work. Elaborate reasoning or argumentative demonstrations of doctrines seldom impress upon the hearer the sense of his need and his peril. Simple, brief statements, from a heart made soft and sympathetic by the love of Christ, will be as the grain of mustard seed, to which Christ Himself likened His utterances of divine truth. He throws into the soul the vital energy of His Spirit, to make the seed of truth germinate and bear fruit.",
