    "word": "I bear to you the testimony of the Lord. All will hear his voice who are willing to be corrected; but those who have been deceived by the enemy are not willing now to come to the light, lest their deeds shall be reproved. Many of you cannot discern the work and presence of God. You know not that it is he. The Lord is still gracious, willing to pardon all who turn to him with penitence and faith. Said the Lord,--Many know not at what they stumble. They heed not the voice of God, but follow the sight of their own eyes, and the understanding of their own hearts. Unbelief and skepticism have taken the place of faith. They have forsaken me.",
