    "word": "The work of reformation here brought to view by John, the purging of heart and mind and soul, is one that is needed by many who today profess to have the faith of Christ. Wrong practices that have been indulged in need to be put away; the crooked paths need to be made straight, and the rough places smooth. The mountains and hills of self-esteem and pride need to be brought low. There is need of bringing forth \"fruits meet for repentance\" (Matthew 3:8). When this work is done in the experience of God's believing people, \"all flesh shall see the salvation of God\" (Luke 3:6). . . .",
