    "word": "He who manifests the spirit of tenderness, forbearance, and love will find that the same spirit will be reflected upon him. . . . If Christ indeed is formed within, the hope of glory, there will be union and love in the home. Christ abiding in the heart of the wife will be at agreement with Christ abiding in the heart of the husband. They will be striving together for the mansions Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him. . . . Tender affection should ever be cherished between husband and wife, parents and children, brothers and sisters. . . . It is the duty of everyone in the family to be pleasant, to speak kindly.",
