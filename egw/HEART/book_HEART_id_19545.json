    "word": "The blessed Redeemer has set us an example in living out the precepts of the law. He says to His followers, \"Freely ye have received, freely give.\" We are to have an open heart to receive the rich treasures of heaven, and our hearts are to be opened to let those rich treasures out to others. Oh, we need to abide in Christ, then we will be a constant channel through which God will communicate to our brethren and to the world His own gracious Spirit. . . .",
