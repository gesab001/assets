    "word": "I have felt that it was not essential to go back to the beginning of the work in order to maintain its importance. I have felt, if there was not the evidence now, if the Holy Spirit is not controlling the testimonies now, I would not care to go back. If the divine credentials do not attend the testimonies now, then it is time my work stopped. What we want is the freshness of the presence of the Spirit of God testifying through us. What I want to see is the testimony of the Spirit of God working upon human minds. I believe God speaks to human hearts.",
