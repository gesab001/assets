    "word": "Chap. 15 - Simplicity\n\n     Most Simple Language--Christ always used the most simple language, yet His words were received by deep, unprejudiced thinkers; for they were words that tested their wisdom. Spiritual things should always be presented in simple language, even though learned men are being addressed; for such are generally ignorant regarding spiritual things. The simplest language is the most eloquent. Educated and uneducated need to be addressed in the plainest, simplest manner, so that the truth may be comprehended, and find lodgment in the heart. So Christ addressed the vast crowds that thronged about Him; and all, learned and unlearned, were able to comprehend His lessons.--RH May 18, 1897.",
