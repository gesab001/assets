    "word": "Those engaged in the cause of reform must in no wise be dissemblers, so that it will be difficult to discern upon which side they are, there must be no underhand working, no secret devising, for this is the way in which Satan works; but those who follow Christ must be resolute and unflinching. On the other hand they must guard against the tendency of becoming obstinate through a degenerate exercise of firmness. There will ever be need of the reformers learning in the school of Christ meekness and lowliness of heart. They should ever hide self, be gentle and amiable as a child of sweet spirit, although their work shows no weakness, but is firm and abiding, because it is wrought in Christ. \n                                                                           971",
