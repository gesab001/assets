    "word": "My sister, let your heart ever repose in confidence in God. The Lord will be to you a present help in every time of need. He does not need to work through other minds to lead His chosen ones. He is desirous of communicating through those who seek Him with all their heart. While we put our entire trust in our Redeemer we are perfectly safe. We have a large work to do, and we are to have respect unto the recompense of reward. And more than this, we are to use every God-given faculty that others through our influence and Christlike example may have the same respect that we have.",
