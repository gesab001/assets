    "word": "Who Complain. \n\n     Those who withhold from God his own make these complaints: The Lord asks them to prove him by bringing their tithe into his storehouse, and to see whether he will not pour them out a blessing. But they cherish rebellion in their hearts, and complain of God, and at the same time they rob him, and embezzle his goods. When their sin is presented to them, they say, \"I have had adversity: my crops have been poor; but the wicked are prospered. It does not pay to keep the ordinance of the Lord.\" But God does not want any to walk mournfully before him. Those who thus complain of God have brought their adversity on themselves. They have robbed God, and his cause has been hindered because the money which should have flowed into his treasury was used for selfish purposes.",
