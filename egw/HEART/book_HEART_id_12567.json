    "word": "All who are followers of Christ will share in this experience. As they partake of His love they will enter into His travail for the saving of the lost. They share in the sufferings of Christ, and they will share also in the glory that shall be revealed. One with Him in His work, drinking with Him the cup of sorrow, they are partakers also of His joy. . . . The Lord has special grace for the mourner, and its power is to melt hearts, to win souls.--Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 11-13.",
