    "word": "True love for God will always manifest itself. It cannot be hidden. Those who keep God's commandments in truth will reveal the same love that Christ revealed for His Father and for His fellow men. He in whose heart Christ abides will reveal Christ in the character, in his work in behalf of those of the household of faith, and in behalf of those who need to be brought to a knowledge of the truth. He is ever to show by good works the fruit of his faith, revealing Christ by loving words and deeds of mercy. . . .",
