    "word": "Brother Reaser will have many difficulties to overcome; for he has misjudged the way in which the work of soul-winning should be done. He will need now, more than ever before, faithful, sympathizing friends,--those who will help him to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God. He will be ennobled to do this if he will allow his heart to be worked by the Holy Spirit of God. And we are to watch, not only this soul, but other souls that may have been in the wrong way, and help them to place their feet (590) in the right way. With the help of his brethren, Brother Reaser may learn his lesson and find the path that Jesus traveled, and become a representative of Him.",
