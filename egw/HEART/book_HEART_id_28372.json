    "word": "I see and feel that although Brother Van Horn is an excellent man he lacks the qualifications for a successful laborer. He is slow and dull. He is, I think, affected with heart difficulty. At any rate, there should be a man to connect with him who is energetic and thorough in financial ability. He does not discern good opportunities and seize them, making the most of the situation. I tell you there is a serious lack. If anything is accomplished here in Oregon in the future, some man must come here who is quick to see and understand the wants of the cause.",
