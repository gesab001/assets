    "word": "God's servants are not to be treated as the servants of the Conference, to be bound and released at their pleasure. God is dishonored, and it is time you called a halt. The men who live out Christ is lessons in practical life are his co-workers. The man who acts upon worldly principles is serving another master. The two classes do not blend into one another imperceptibly like the colors of a rainbow; Christ's likeness and Satanic attributes stand out as distinct as midnight in contrast with midday.

Where is seen the practice of the self-denial and self-sacrifice of Christ? What example has been given at the very heart of the work at Battle Creek?
