    "word": "It is unsafe to trust to feelings or impressions; these are unreliable guides. God\u2019s law is the only correct standard of holiness. It is by this law that character is to be judged. If an inquirer after salvation were to ask, \u201cWhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d the modern teachers of sanctification would answer, \u201cOnly believe that Jesus saves you.\u201d But when Christ was asked this question He said, \u201cWhat is written in the law? how readest thou?\u201d And when the questioner replied, \u201cThou shalt love the \n79\nLord thy God with all thy heart, ... and thy neighbour as thyself,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cThou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.\u201d Luke 10:26-28.",
