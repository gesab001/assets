Wessels in Cape Town, South Africa.) \n     I received your letter and feel very thankful that you have again taken your position under the bloodstained banner of Prince Emmanuel. May the Lord instruct you at every step. You will be tempted, you will be tried, but walk softly before God. Put your entire trust in the Lord. Serve Him with heart and soul, and believe that He pardons your transgressions and forgives your sins. He says in His word. \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me\" [Isaiah 27:5]. The Lord is soon to come in the clouds of heaven. Then the trials and tribulations of this life will be over.",
