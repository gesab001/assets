    "word": "Elmshaven, St. Helena Sanitarium, California, September 21, 1907 \n\n\n     This is Sabbath morning, and I thank the Lord that I have slept more than usual. I generally have many wakeful hours. I feel great sorrow at times. My heart aches as I consider [that] the day of the Lord is coming as a thief in the night to all who are not watching and praying and working also. Luke 17:20-37. I read this. I can take it in a little, and my heart \n\n\n                                   -134- \n\nis pained to see the great necessity that those who have the light shall walk in the footsteps of Jesus, and work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. I am so sorrowful that men placed in positions of responsibility do not understand their own defects of character, yet carry with them an officiousness that blinds their own judgment as to the work to be done for this time of peril.",
