    "word": "I want to tell you that God does not want us to go with a sad, morose countenance, gloomy and despondent. He does not want us to do any such thing. He wants us to look at the bright beams of the Sun of righteousness, and catch these bright beams that they may shine in all the chambers of the mind, that they may shine in the soul-temple, and therefore you can bring forth from the treasure-house of the heart the precious things of God, for out of it are the issues of life. . . .",
