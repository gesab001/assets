    "word": "We are all subject to trials and difficulties and earth-born sorrows, but the grace of Christ has been given to us that we may endure temptation and not fall under the trial of our faith. If you think you see selfishness and avariciousness in your husband, it should drive you to your Saviour. If your husband deals unjustly with you, according to your idea, remember that you have not his sin to answer for but can well afford to pity and pray for him. If you think you have a correct idea of his wrong, you are the one to feel deeply for his soul instead of thinking you should have sympathy and commiseration. You are not the one who needs the most sympathy, and if you had more of the milk of human kindness in your heart, you would pursue an entirely different course. \n\n\n                                 -89-",
