    "word": "The furnace fires are not to . . . [destroy], but to refine, ennoble, sanctify. Without these trials we would not feel so much our need of God and His help. We would become proud and self-sufficient. In these trials I see evidence that the Lord's eye is upon you, and that He means to draw your heart to Himself. It is not the whole, but the wounded, who need a physician; those who are pressed almost beyond the point of endurance, who need a Helper. Turn unto the stronghold. Learn the precious lesson, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30).",
