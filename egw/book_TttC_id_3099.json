    "word": "Brother B, your life has been almost a failure. You had talents of influence, but you have not improved them to the best account. You have failed in your family; you have let things go at loose ends there, and the same deficiencies are felt in the church. The Lord has given you light in regard to your neglect of duty in your family and the course which you should pursue to redeem the past. Your deficiencies were pointed out, but you did not feel the sinfulness of bringing children into the world to come up without proper training. You have excused their errors, their sins, and their wayward, reckless course, and have flattered yourself that they would come out right by and by.",
