    "word": "While looking in the Bible for a verse for Willie to commit to memory to repeat in the Sabbath school, this scripture arrested my attention: \"The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knoweth them that trust in Him.\" I could but weep over these words, they seemed so appropriate.

The Lord was to him a stronghold in time of trouble and sustained him by His free Spirit while he bore a decided testimony against the wild fanaticism there.",
