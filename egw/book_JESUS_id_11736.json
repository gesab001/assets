God's People in the Minority.--Under the symbols of a great red dragon, a leopardlike beast, and a beast with lamblike horns, the earthly governments which would especially engage in trampling upon God's law and persecuting His people, were presented to John. The war is carried on till the close of time. The people of God, symbolized by a holy woman and her children, were represented as greatly in the minority. In the last days only a remnant still existed. Of these John speaks as they \"which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ\" (ST Nov. 1, 1899).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 972}
