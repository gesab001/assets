{"word": "Jesus met Satan with the words, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\" (Matthew 4:4). In every temptation the weapon of His warfare was the Word of God. Satan demanded of Christ a miracle as a sign of His divinity. But that which is greater than all miracles, a firm reliance upon a \"Thus saith the Lord\" was a sign that could not be controverted. So long as Christ held to this position, the tempter could gain no advantage.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 228}
