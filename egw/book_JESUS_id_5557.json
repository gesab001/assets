{"word": "The Lord is waiting to bestow rich blessing upon us if we will only comply with the conditions. We cannot glorify him while we cherish doubt. We must believe that he will do just what he has said he would. Remember that we have a living Saviour. If you do not feel light-hearted and joyous, do not dishonor God by talking of your feelings. Talk of the promises, talk of Jesus\\92 willingness to bless; and before you are aware of it, the cloud will lift, light \n438\nwill come into the soul, and you will find peace and rest in Jesus. Cherish love. \\93Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another.\\94 [Romans 12:10.] Form a habit of speaking words of cheerful hope and courage, words of love and appreciation, that will bind hearts together. \\93If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.\\94 [1 John 1:7.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 437}
