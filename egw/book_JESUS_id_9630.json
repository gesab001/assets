{"word": "The Lord keeps truth fresh, placing it in new settings.--How do you know but that the Lord is giving fresh evidences of his truth, placing it in a new setting, that the way of the Lord may be prepared? What plans have you been laying that new light may be infused through the ranks of God's people? What evidence have you that God has not sent light to His children? All self-sufficiency, egotism, and pride of opinion must be put away. We must come to the feet of Jesus, and learn of Him who is meek and lowly of heart.--1SM 414.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 28}
