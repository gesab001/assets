    "word": "The prosperity of the cause of God depends much upon the ministers who labor in the gospel field. Those who teach the truth should be devotional, self-sacrificing, godly men who understand their business and go about doing good because they know that God has called them to the work, men who feel the worth of souls and will bear burdens and responsibilities. A thorough workman is known by the perfection of his work.",
