{"word": "God created the world in six days and rested upon the seventh. He sanctified and blessed the seventh day and made it His sacred memorial. \"Wherefore,\" He declares, \"the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.\" Exodus 31:16. Those who do this, keeping all of God's commandments, may claim the promises contained in Isaiah 58:11-14. The instruction given in this chapter is full and decided. Those who refrain from labor on the Sabbath may claim divine comfort and consolation. Shall we not believe God? Shall we not call holy the day which He calls holy? Man should not be ashamed to acknowledge as sacred that which God calls sacred. He should not be ashamed to do that which God has commanded. Obedience will bring him a knowledge of what constitutes true sanctification.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 215}
