    "word": "You, my sister, will prove a trial to God's people unless you are willing to learn, willing to be counseled. You must not continue to feel that you know it all. You have much yet to learn before you can be perfect before God. The sweetest and best lesson to be learned will be that of humility. \"Learn of Me,\" says the humble Nazarene; \"for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" This lesson of meekness, forbearance, patience, and love you have yet to learn and practice.

You can help such as need help; but you must lay down your measuring tape, \n                                                                           439\nfor that is not for you to use. One who is unerring in judgment, who understands the weakness of our fallen, corrupt natures, holds the standard Himself. He weighs in the balances of the sanctuary, and His just measure we shall all accept.",
