    "word": "20 (ch. 8:5-13, 6, 7; see EGW on ch. 9:14). The Everlasting Covenant of Mercy.--Let those who are oppressed under a sense of sin remember that there is hope for them. The salvation of the human race has ever been the object of the councils of heaven. The covenant of mercy was made before the foundation of the world. It has existed from all eternity, and is called the everlasting covenant. So surely as there never was a time when God was not, so surely there never was a moment when it was not the delight of the eternal mind to manifest His grace to humanity (ST June 12, 1901).",
