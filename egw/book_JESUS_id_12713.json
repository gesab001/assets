If John was sent of God, and taught according to his Spirit, how could the practices of Jesus be right? The followers of the Saviour, being unable to answer these questions, brought the matter to their Master. \"And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and \n                                                                           191\nlikewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 190}
