{"word": "Do not be content with a superficial piety, but, young friends, grow in grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Are you making advancement? Is the plant of grace waxing into a tree, or withering away? Present yourselves humbly and often at the throne of grace, and tell Jesus your every want, and do not think anything is too small for Him to notice. The Lord loves to have you seek Him, and tell Him your trials, as a child would talk with his parent. When you pray, believe Jesus hears you, and will do the things you ask of Him. Show that you have perfect trust in Jesus, and ever seek to do those things that you know will please Him, and you will have peace in Christ. \n                                                                           318", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 317}
