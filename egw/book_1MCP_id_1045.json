{"word": "Indiscriminate Pleasure Dwarfs the Mind.--As hurried eating of temporal food is detrimental to physical health, so the greedy swallowing of everything bearing the semblance of pleasure dwarfs the mind, causing it to refuse the spiritual food which is presented. The mind is educated to crave pleasure as the inebriate craves the glass of liquor. It seems impossible to resist the temptation. Sober thinking is distasteful because the presentation is not satisfying. There is nothing pleasing in the idea of reading and studying the words of eternal life.--Lt 117, 1901.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 316}
