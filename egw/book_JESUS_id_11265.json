{"word": "I want to say to you, Do not extort money from anyone because of words spoken against you or yours. You harm yourself by so doing. If we are looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith, we shall be able to pray, \"Lord, forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.\" Jesus did not appeal to the law for redress when He was unjustly accused. When He was reviled, He reviled not again; when He was threatened, He did not retaliate.--Letter 38, 1891.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 302}
