    "word": "Chap. 53 - Extremes in Health Reform\n\n     At the time of the yearly conference at Adams Center, New York, October 25, 1868, I was shown that the brethren in----- were in great perplexity and distress because of the course pursued by B and C. Those who have the cause of God at heart cannot but feel jealous for its prosperity. I was shown that these men were not reliable. They were extremists and would run the health reform into the ground. They were not pursuing a course which would tend to correct or reform those who were intemperate in their diet; but their influence would disgust believers and unbelievers, and would drive them further from reform, instead of bringing them nearer to it.",
