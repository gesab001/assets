{"word": "Financial responsibilities in our schools should not be laid on ministers.--Too often ministers have been brought in to carry responsibilities which they were in no way fitted to bear. Lay these responsibilities upon men who have business tact, men who can give themselves to business, who can visit the schools and keep an account of the financial condition, and who can also give instruction regarding the keeping of the accounts. The work of the school should be inspected several times each year. Let the ministers act as counselors, but lay not on them the financial responsibilities.--6T 216.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 240}
