    "word": "Falsehood and deception of every cast is sin against the God of truth and verity. The word of God is plain upon these points. Ye shall not \"deal falsely, neither lie one to another.\" \"All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\" God is a God of sincerity and truth. The word of God is a book of truth. Jesus is a faithful and true witness. The church is the witness and ground of the truth. All the precepts of the Most High are true and righteous altogether. How, then, must prevarication and any exaggeration or deception appear in His sight? For the falsehood he uttered because he coveted the gifts which the prophet refused, the servant of Elisha was struck with leprosy, which ended only with death.",
