When we have this great inducement before us, cannot we \"run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith\"? Hebrews 12:1, 2. He has pointed out the way for us and marked it all along by His own footsteps. It is the path that He traveled, and we may, with Him, experience the self-denial and the suffering, and walk in this pathway imprinted by His own blood.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 48}
