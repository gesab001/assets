{"word": "16 (Philippians 2:5-8). Jesus the Friend of Sinners.--Jesus came to the world not as an angel of light; we could not have endured His glory if He had come thus. One angel at the tomb of Christ was of such exceeding brightness that the Roman guard fell powerless to the ground. As the angel came \n                                                                           927\nfrom the heavens, he parted the darkness from his track, and the sentinels could not endure his glory; they fell as dead men to the earth. Suppose that Jesus had come in the glory of an angel, His brightness would have extinguished the feeble life of mortal men.", "paragraph": 8, "bookcode": "7BC", "page": 926}
