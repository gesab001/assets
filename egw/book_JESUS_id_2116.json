{"word": "Chap. 51 - Lifting Debts on Church Buildings\n\n     I rejoice with you in the prospect of clearing the church buildings from debt. How much might have been saved if extra efforts had been made every year to do this. There is no necessity for our meetinghouses to continue year after year in debt. If every member of the church will do his duty, practicing self-denial and self-sacrifice, for the Lord Jesus, whose purchased possession he is, that His church may be free from debt, he will do honor to God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CS", "page": 259}
