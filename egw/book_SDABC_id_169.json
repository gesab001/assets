Pursuit of Israel Closed Egyptians' Probation.--When the whole army,--\"all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen,\"-- were in the very bed of the sea, the Lord said unto Moses, \"Stretch out thy rod over the sea.\" Israel had passed over on dry land, but they heard the shouting of he armies in pursuit. As Moses stretched out his rod over the sea, the embanked waters that had stood as a great wall, rolled on in their natural course. Of all the men of Egypt in that vast army, not one escaped. All perished in their determination to have their own way and to refuse God's way. That occasion was the end of their probation (MS 35, 1906).",
