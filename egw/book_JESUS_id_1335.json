{"word": "Cite Personal Experience \n\n     Those who have put on Christ will relate their experience, tracing step by step the leadings of the Holy Spirit,-- their hungering and thirsting for the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent, the result of their searching of the Scriptures, their prayers, their soul-agony, and the words of Christ to them, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee.\" It is unnatural for any to keep these things secret, and those who are filled with the love of Christ will not do so. In proportion as the Lord has made them the depositaries of sacred truth will be their desire that others shall receive the same blessing. And as they make known the rich treasures of God's grace, more and still more of the grace of Christ will be imparted to them.--Christ's Object Lessons, p. 125.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 124}
