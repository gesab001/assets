Our heavenly Father sent the light of health reform to guard against the evils resulting from a debased appetite, that those who love purity and holiness may know how to use with discretion the good things He has provided for them, and that by exercising temperance in daily life, they may be sanctified through the truth. --Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, page 52.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 141}
