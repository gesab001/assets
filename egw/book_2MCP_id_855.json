{"word": "Harmony of Varied Dispositions--Harmony and union existing among men of varied dispositions is the strongest witness that can be borne that God has sent His \n\n620 \n\nSon into the world to save sinners. It is our privilege to bear this witness. But in order to do this, we must place ourselves under Christ's command. Our characters must be molded in harmony with His character, our wills must be surrendered to His will. Then we shall work together without a thought of collision.--8T 242, 243 (1904).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 619}
