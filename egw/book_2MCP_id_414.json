{"word": "Morning after morning I spoke to the patients about faith and urged them to believe the words of God. Yet this poor man seemed unable to admit that he had faith. I talked with him alone. I presented the truth to him in every way possible, then I asked him if he could not believe that Christ was his individual Saviour and would help him. Our Saviour has said to all who are weary and heavy laden, \"Take My yoke upon you.\" Do not wear a yoke of your own framing. \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:28, 29).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 493}
