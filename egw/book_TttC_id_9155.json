These words of Inspiration present before believers in present truth the work that should now be done in the education of our children and youth. When the truth for these last days came to the world in the proclamation of the first, second, and third angel's messages, we were shown that in the education of our children a different order of things must be brought in; but it has taken much time to understand what changes should be made.",
