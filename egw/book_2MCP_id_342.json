{"word": "Faith Can Be Invincible.--Do not worry. By looking at appearances and complaining when difficulty and pressure come, you reveal a sickly, enfeebled faith. By your words and your works show that your faith is invincible. The Lord is rich in resources. He owns the world. Look to Him who has light, and power, and efficiency. He will bless everyone who is seeking to communicate light and love.--7T 212 (1902).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 471}
