{"word": "Chapter 23 \n\n     26. Youth's Most Precious Offering.--Then, children, come to Jesus. Give to God the most precious offering that it is possible for you to make; give Him your heart. He speaks to you saying, \"My son, my daughter, give me thine heart. Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow; for I will cleanse you with my own blood. I will make you members of my family--children of the heavenly King. Take my forgiveness, my peace which I freely give you. I will clothe you with my own righteousness,--the wedding garment,--and make you fit for the marriage supper of the Lamb. When clothed in my righteousness, through prayer, through watchfulness, through diligent study of my Word, you will be able to reach a high standard. You will understand the truth, and your character will be molded by a divine influence; for this is the will of God, even your sanctification\" (YI June 30, 1892).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3BC", "page": 1162}
