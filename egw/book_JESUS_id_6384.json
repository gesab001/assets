{"word": "Sunday forenoon we had another meeting of the brethren and sisters, and in the evening I spoke in the Town Hall. This, the largest audience room in the place, was crowded, and many were obliged to stand. Those who were best acquainted with the hall estimated that there were twelve hundred present. I have seldom seen a more intelligent, noble-looking company. The \\93Union Temperance Prize Choir\\94 volunteered to come and sing. This choir, which was composed of about fifty voices, did justice to the English love of music by singing seven pieces, three at the opening, two at the close, and two after the benediction. The subject of the evening was the love of God; and as I reflected that not until the last great day would I again meet all there assembled, I tried to present the precious things of God in such a way as to draw their minds from earth to heaven. But I could only warn and entreat, and hold up Jesus as the center of attraction, and a heaven of \n163\nbliss as the eternal reward of the overcomer.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 162}
