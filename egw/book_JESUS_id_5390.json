{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     The thought that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, not because of any merit on our part, but as a free gift from God, is a precious thought. The enemy of God and man is not willing that this truth should be clearly presented; for he knows that if the people receive it fully, his power will be broken. If he can control minds so that doubt and unbelief and darkness shall compose the experience of those who claim to be the children of God, he can overcome them with temptation. That simple faith that takes God at his word should be encouraged. God's people must have that faith which will lay hold of divine power; \\93for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.\\94 [Ephesians 2:8.] Those who believe that God for Christ's sake has forgiven their sins should not, through temptation, fail to press on to fight the good fight of faith. Their faith should grow stronger until their Christian life, as well as their words, shall declare, \\93The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin.\\94", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 103}
