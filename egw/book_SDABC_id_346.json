    "word": "In Exchange for His Soul.--For a Babylonish robe and a paltry treasure of gold and silver, Achan consented to sell himself to evil, to bring upon his soul the curse of God, to forfeit his title to a rich possession in Canaan, and lose all prospect of the future, immortal inheritance in the earth made new. A fearful price indeed \n                                                                           998\nhe paid for his ill-gotten gains! (ST May 5, 1881).",
