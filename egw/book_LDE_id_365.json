{"word": "One day we took a long drive through various parts of Takoma Park. A large part of the township is a natural forest. The houses are not small and crowded closely together, but are roomy and comfortable. They are surrounded by thrifty, second-growth pines, oaks, maples and other beautiful trees. The owners of these homes are mostly business men, many of them clerks in the government offices in Washington. They go to the city daily, returning in the evening to their quiet homes.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 104}
