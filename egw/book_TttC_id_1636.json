    "word": "A member of that church in conversation about Sister More's leaving as she did, has since said in substance: \"No one feels like taking the responsibility of such cases now. Brother White always took the charge of them.\" Yes, he did. He would take them to his own house till every chair and bed was full, then he would go to his brethren and have them take those whom he could not. If they needed means, he would give to them and invite others to follow his example. There must be men in Battle Creek to do as he has done, or the curse of God will follow that church. Not one man only, there are fifty there who can do, more or less, as he has done.",
