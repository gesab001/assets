{"word": "The soul-saving message, the third angel's message, is the message to be given to the world. The commandments of God and the faith of Jesus are both important, immensely important, and must be given with equal force and power. The first part of the message has been dwelt upon mostly, the last part casually. The faith of Jesus is not comprehended. We must talk it, we must live it, we must pray it, and educate the people to bring this part of the message into their home life. \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus\" (Philippians 2:5).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 184}
