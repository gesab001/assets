{"word": "Then as a little child, come to God, presenting yourself as suppliant at His feet; for we need not ascend into the heavens to bring Jesus down; nor into the earth to bring Him up; for He is ever near us. He says, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me\" (Revelation 3:20). How willing is Christ to take possession of the soul temple if we will let Him! He is represented as waiting and knocking at the door of the heart. Then why does He not enter? It is because the love of sin has closed the door of the heart. As soon as we consent to give sin up, to acknowledge our guilt, the barrier is removed between the soul and the Saviour.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 325}
