{"word": "Each morning consecrate yourselves and your children to God for that day. Make no calculation for months or years; these are not yours. One brief day is given you. As if it were your last on earth, work during its hours for the Master. Lay all your plans before God, to be carried out or given up, as His providence shall indicate. Accept His plans instead of your own, even though their acceptance requires the abandonment of cherished projects. Thus the life will be molded more and more after the divine example; \\93and the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.\\94 Philippians 4:7.\\97(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, 44.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 166}
