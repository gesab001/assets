{"word": "There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared for the ransomed of the Lord.

On those peaceful plains, beside those living streams, God's people, so long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a home.--GC 675 (1911).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 288}
