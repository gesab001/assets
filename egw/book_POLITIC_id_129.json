{"word": "Let Politics Alone \n\n     I was surprised as I saw men who claim to believe the truth for this time all excited in regard to matters-- which relate to the Lord Jesus and eternal interests? No; but they seemed to be wonderfully excited in regard to the currency. Some ministers were distinguishing themselves by weaving these subjects into their discourses. They were excitably involving themselves, taking sides in regard to these questions that the Lord did not lay upon them the burden to engage in.

They knew not whether they were defending principles that originated in the councils of heaven or in the councils of Satan.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TM", "page": 332}
