{"word": "The great error of the Romish Church is found in the fact that the Bible is interpreted in the light of the opinions of the \"fathers.\" Their opinions are regarded as infallible, and the dignitaries of the church assume that it is their prerogative to make others believe as they do, and to use force to compel the conscience. Those who do not agree with them are pronounced heretics. But the word of God is not thus to be interpreted. It is to stand on its own eternal merits, to be read as the word of God, to be obeyed as the voice of God, which declares his will to the people. The will and voice of finite man are not to be interpreted as the voice of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 195}
