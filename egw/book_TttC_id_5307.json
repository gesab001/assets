    "word": "Chap. 17 - Jeremiah Reproves Israel\n\n     The Lord gave Jeremiah a message of reproof to bear to his people, charging them with the continual rejection of God's counsel: \"I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto Me. I have sent also unto you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers.\"",
