The people of God have accomplished their work; they have received the latter rain, or the refreshing from the presence of the Lord, and they are prepared for the trying hour before them. Angels are hurrying to and fro in Heaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that his work is done, that the seal of God [SEE APPENDIX, NOTE 9.] has been placed upon his people. Then Jesus ceases his intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts his hands, and with a loud voice says, \"It is done;\" and all the angelic host lay off their crowns as he makes the solemn announcement: \"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\" [Revelation 22:11] Every case has been decided for life \n                                                                           432\nor death. Christ has made the atonement for his people, and blotted out their sins. The number of his subjects is made up; \"the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,\" is about to be given to the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to reign as King of kings and Lord of lords.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "4SP", "page": 431}
