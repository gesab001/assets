{"word": "The terrible earthquake that has visited San Francisco [THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE OF APRIL 18-19, 1906, LEFT 503 DEAD AND RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED $350 MILLION IN PROPERTY DAMAGE.] will be followed by other manifestations of the power of God. His law has been transgressed. Cities have become polluted with sin. Study the history of Nineveh. God sent a special message by Jonah to that wicked city. . . . Many such messages as his would be given in our age, if the wicked cities would repent as did Nineveh.--Ms 61a, June 3, 1906.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 114}
