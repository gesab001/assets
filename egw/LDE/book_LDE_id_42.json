{"word": "An Experience With a False Prophet \n\n     Last night a young man, a stranger to us all, but professing to be a brother from Victoria [Australia], called upon us and asked to see Sister White. It was evening and I declined seeing him. We invited him to remain with us during the night, however, and to take breakfast. After our usual morning worship, as we were about to go to our various employments, this young man arose and with a commanding gesture requested us to sit down. He said, \"Have you any hymnbooks? We will sing a hymn, then I have a message to give you.\" I said, \"If you have a message, give it without delay, for we are very much pressed to get off the American mail and have no time to lose.\" He then began to read something he had written, which stated among other things that the judgment has now begun upon the living. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 21}
