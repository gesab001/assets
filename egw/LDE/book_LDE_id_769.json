{"word": "Kings, Legislators, \n                           Councils, Hear the Message \n\n\n     It does not seem possible to us now that any should have to stand alone, but if God has ever spoken by me, the time will come when we shall be brought before councils and before thousands for His name's sake, and each one will have to give the reason of his faith. Then will come the severest criticism upon every position that has been taken for the truth. We need, then, to study the Word of God, that we may know why we believe the doctrines we advocate.--RH Dec. 18, 1888.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 209}
