{"word": "God Will Set Everything in Order \n\n     There is no need to doubt, to be fearful that the work will not succeed. God is at the head of the work, and He will set everything in order.

Let us have faith that God is going to carry the noble ship which bears the people of God safely into port.--2SM 390 (1892).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 52}
