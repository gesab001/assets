{"word": "Berrien Springs, Michigan \n\n     I hear that there is some thought of locating the school at Berrien Springs in the southwest of Michigan. I am much pleased with the description of this place. . . . In such a place as Berrien Springs the school can be made an object lesson, and I hope that no one will interpose to prevent the carrying forward of this work.--4MR 407 (July 12, 1901).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 102}
