{"word": "Love One Another \n\n     Christianity is the revealing of the tenderest affection for one another. . . . Christ is to receive supreme love from the beings He has created. And He requires also that man shall cherish a sacred regard for his fellow beings. Every soul saved will be saved through love, which begins with God. True conversion is a change from selfishness to sanctified affection for God and for one another.--1SM 114, 115 (1901).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 191}
