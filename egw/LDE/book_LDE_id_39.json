{"word": "False Prophets \n\n      As one of the signs of Jerusalem's destruction, Christ had said, \"Many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many\" [Matthew 24:11]. False prophets did rise, deceiving the people and leading great numbers into the desert. Magicians and sorcerers, claiming miraculous power, drew the people after them into the mountain solitudes. But this prophecy was spoken also for the last days. This sign is given as a sign of the second advent.--DA 631 (1898).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 20}
