{"word": "In the great conflict between faith and unbelief the whole Christian world will be involved. All will take sides. Some apparently may not engage in the conflict on either side.

All such are numbered with the enemies of Christ.--RH Feb. 7, 1893.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 215}
