It is away from the cities, and there is an abundance of land for agricultural purposes, and room so that houses will not need to be built one close to another. There is plenty of ground where students may be educated in the cultivation of the soil.--RH Jan. 28, 1902.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 102}
