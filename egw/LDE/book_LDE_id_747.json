{"word": "God Will Employ \n                        Agencies That Will Surprise Us \n\n\n     Let me tell you that the Lord will work in this last work in a manner very much out of the common order of things, and in a way that will be contrary to any human planning. There will be those among us who will always want to control the work of God, to dictate even what movements shall be made when the work goes forward under the direction of the angel who joins the third angel in the message to be given to the world. God will use ways and means by which it will be seen that He is taking the reins in His own hands. The workers will be surprised by the simple means that He will use to bring about and perfect His work of righteousness.--TM 300 (1885).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 203}
