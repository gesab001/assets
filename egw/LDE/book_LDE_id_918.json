{"word": "After John's description in Revelation 16 of that miracle-working power which was to gather the world to the last great conflict, the symbols are dropped and the trumpet voice once more gives a certain sound: \"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame\" [Revelation 16:15]. After the transgression of Adam and Eve they were naked, for the garment of light and security had departed from them.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 249}
