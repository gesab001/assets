{"word": "A terrible conflict is before us. We are nearing the battle of the great day of God Almighty. That which has been held in control is to be let loose. The angel of mercy is folding her wings, preparing to step down from the throne and leave the world to the control of Satan. The principalities and powers of earth are in bitter revolt against the God of heaven. They are filled with hatred against those who serve Him, and soon, very soon, will be fought the last great battle between good and evil. The earth is to be the battle field--the scene of the final contest and the final victory. Here, where for so long Satan has led men against God, rebellion is to be forever suppressed.--RH May 13, 1902.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 250}
