{"word": "Motive Gives Character to Actions \n\n     In the day of judgment some will plead this good deed and that as a reason why they should receive consideration. They will say, \"I set up young men in business. I gave money to found hospitals. I relieved the necessities of widows, and took the poor into my home.\" Yes, but your motives were so defiled by selfishness that the deed was not acceptable in the sight of the Lord. In all that you did, self was brought prominently to view.--Ms 53, 1906.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 219}
