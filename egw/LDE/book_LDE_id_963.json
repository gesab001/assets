{"word": "The Righteous Have No \n                          Concealed Wrongs to Reveal \n\n\n     In the time of trouble, if the people of God had unconfessed sins to appear before them while tortured with fear and anguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut off their faith, and they could not have confidence to plead with God for deliverance. But while they have a deep sense of their unworthiness, they have no concealed wrongs to reveal. Their sins have gone beforehand to judgment, and have been blotted out; and they cannot bring them to remembrance.--GC 620 (1911).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 263}
