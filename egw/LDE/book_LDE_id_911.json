{"word": "God's Law Appears in the Sky \n\n     There appears against the sky a hand holding two tables of stone folded together. Says the prophet, \"The heavens shall declare His righteousness: for God is judge Himself\" (Psalm 50:6). That holy law, God's righteousness, that amid thunder and flame was proclaimed from Sinai as the guide of life, is now revealed to men as the rule of judgment. The hand opens the tables, and there are seen the precepts of the Decalogue, traced as with a pen of fire. The words are so plain that all can read them. Memory is aroused, the darkness of superstition and heresy is swept from every mind, and God's ten words, brief, comprehensive, and authoritative, are presented to the view of all the inhabitants of the earth.--GC 639 (1911).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 247}
