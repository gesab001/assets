{"word": "Judgments Come When \n                             God Removes His Protection \n\n\n     I was shown that the judgments of God would not come directly out from the Lord upon them, but in this way: They place themselves beyond His protection. He warns, corrects, reproves, and points out the only path of safety; then, if those who have been the objects of His special care will follow their own course, independent of the Spirit of God, after repeated warnings, if they choose their own way, then He does not commission His angels to prevent Satan's decided attacks upon them.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 242}
