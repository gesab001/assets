{"word": "The Angels Sing, Christ Has Conquered! \n\n     In that day the redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and the Son. The angels, touching their golden harps, will welcome the King and His trophies of victory--those who have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph will peal forth, filling all heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly courts, accompanied by His redeemed ones, the witnesses that His mission of suffering and sacrifice has not been in vain.--9T 285, 286 (1909).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 281}
