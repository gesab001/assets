{"word": "What were the conditions chosen by the infinite Father for His Son? A secluded home in the Galilean hills; a household sustained by honest, self-respecting labor; a life of simplicity; daily conflict with difficulty and hardship; self-sacrifice, economy, and patient, gladsome service; the hour of study at His mother's side, with the open scroll of Scripture; the quiet of dawn or twilight in the green valley; the holy ministries of nature; the study of creation and providence; \n                                                                           95\nand the soul's communion with God--these were the conditions and opportunities of the early life of Jesus.--MH 365, 366 (1905).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 94}
