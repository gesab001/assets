    "word": "Our Duty to the Household of Faith \n\n               New Sabbathkeepers \n\n\n     There are two classes of poor whom we have always within our borders--those who ruin themselves by their own independent course of action and continue in their transgression, and those who for the truth's sake have been brought into straitened circumstances. We are to love our neighbor as ourselves, and then toward both these classes we shall do the right thing under the guidance and counsel of sound wisdom.",
