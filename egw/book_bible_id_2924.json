{"word": "GOD RESPONDED TO DAVID\\92S PRAYER FOR FORGIVENESS.\\97One of the most earnest prayers recorded in the Word of God is that of David when he plead, \\93Create in me a clean heart, O God.\\94 God\\92s response to such a prayer is, A new heart will I give you. This is a work that no finite man can do. Men and women are to begin at the beginning, seeking God most earnestly for a true Christian experience. They are to feel the creative power of the Holy Spirit. They are to receive the new heart, that is kept soft and tender by the grace of heaven. The selfish spirit is to be cleansed from the soul. They are to labor earnestly and with humility of heart, each one looking to Jesus for guidance and encouragement. Then the building, fitly framed together, will grow into a holy temple in the Lord.\\97(SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, 1165.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 141}
