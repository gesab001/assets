{"word": "The Scriptural method of ministerial training combines study in school with personal spiritual growth.--Those especially who have the ministry in view, should feel the importance of the Scriptural method of ministerial training. They should enter heartily into the work, and while they study in the schools, they should learn of the great Teacher the meekness and humility of Christ. A covenant-keeping God has promised that in answer to prayer His Spirit shall be poured out upon these learners in the school of Christ, that they may become ministers of righteousness.--GW 81.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 45}
