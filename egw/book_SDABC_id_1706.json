    "word": "(Matthew 28:5, 6; Luke 24:5, 6; 2:19; John 10:17, 18; Acts 13:32, 33.) When the voice of the angel was heard saying, \"Thy Father calls thee,\" He who had said, \"I lay down my life, that I might take it again,\" \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up,\" came forth from the grave to life that was in Himself. Deity did not die. Humanity died, but Christ now proclaims over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" In His divinity Christ possessed the power to break the bonds of death. He declares that He had life in Himself to quicken whom He will.",
