{"word": "Ministers should teach members how to work.--When Jesus ascended to heaven, He committed His work on earth to those who had received the light of the gospel. They were to carry the work forward to completion. He has provided no other agency for the promulgation of His truth. \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" \"And, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" This solemn commission reaches us in this age. God leaves with His church the responsibility of receiving or rejecting it. Many seem to rest perfectly easy, as if heavenly messengers were to come to this earth, to proclaim with an audible voice the message of warning; but while angels have their work to do, we are to do ours in opening the Bible truth to those who are in darkness. Is your interest selfishly shut up in your own family, to your church? God pity your narrowness! You should have that undying zeal, that far-reaching love, which encircles the world. Those who are not called to go to foreign countries have a work to do in their own borders, to keep up the interest in their churches by well-directed effort, that they may be spiritual and self-sacrificing, and by their means and earnest prayers may aid those who enter new and difficult fields.--RH Oct. 12, 1886.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 156}
