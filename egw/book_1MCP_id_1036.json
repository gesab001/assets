{"word": "This test should be decisive. Amusements that have a tendency to weaken the love for sacred things and lessen our joy in the service of God are not to be sought by Christians. The music and dancing in joyful praise to God at the removal of the ark had not the faintest resemblance to the dissipation of modern dancing.

The other is a device of Satan to cause men to forget God and to dishonor Him.--PP 707 (1890).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 314}
