{"word": "Having received the faith of the gospel, . . . the believer is to add to his character virtue, and thus cleanse the heart and prepare the mind for the reception of the knowledge of God. This knowledge is the foundation of all true education and of all true service. It is the only real safeguard against temptation; and it is this alone that can make one like God in character. Through the knowledge of God and of His Son, Jesus Christ, are given to the believer \"all things that pertain unto life and godliness.\" No good gift is withheld from him who sincerely desires to obtain the righteousness of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 314}
