    "word": "The success of a minister depends much upon his deportment out of the desk. When he ceases preaching and leaves the desk, his work is not finished; it is only commenced. He must then carry out what he has preached. He should not move heedlessly, but set a watch over himself, lest something that he may do and say be taken advantage of by the enemy, and a reproach be brought upon the cause of Christ. Ministers cannot be too guarded, especially before the young. They should use no lightness of speech, jesting or joking, \n                                                                           381\nbut should remember that they are in Christ's stead, that they must illustrate by example the life of Christ. \"For we are laborers together with God.\" \"We then, as workers together with Him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.\"",
