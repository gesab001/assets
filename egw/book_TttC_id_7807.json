    "word": "\"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Do not put your light under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that it may give light to all that are in the house. \"Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price,\" even the precious blood of the Son of God. We have no right to live to ourselves. Every minister should be a consecrated missionary; every layman a worker, using his talents of influence and means in his Lord's service; for active benevolence is a vital principle of Christianity. It is the exercise of this principle that is to bring sheaves to the Lord of the harvest, while a want of it hinders the work of God and bars the way for the salvation of souls. \n                                                                           382",
