    "word": "Some are not willing to do self-denying work. They show real impatience when urged to take some responsibility. \"What need is there,\" say they, of an increase of knowledge and experience? This explains it all. They feel that they are \"rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,\" while heaven pronounces them poor, miserable, blind, and naked. To these the True Witness says: \"I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.\" Your very self-complacency shows you to be in need of everything. You are spiritually sick and need Jesus as your physician. \n                                                                           266",
