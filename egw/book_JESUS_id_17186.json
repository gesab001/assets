{"word": "I have a work to do and in the grace of Christ I shall do it. My only anxiety is for those who are so much more easily inclined to believe a lie than to believe the truth. What shall I do for them? What can I do to save them that they shall not make a lie, neither love the lie after it is made? All I can do is to present Jesus, the precious Saviour, before them as their pattern. If they love Jesus they will be pure, harmless, undefiled. They will surround themselves with the atmosphere of faith rather than of doubt and skepticism and unbelief. They will talk of Jesus, of heaven, of the Christian's duties, the Christian's warfare and how to successfully resist the powers of Satan. They will not be like vultures preying upon that which they suppose to be the defects of others.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 141}
