{"word": "Love will reach the hearts of even apparently hopeless youth.--The Lord is not glorified when the children are neglected and passed by. They are to be educated, disciplined, and patiently instructed. They require more than casual notice, more than a word of encouragement. They need painstaking, prayerful, careful labor. The heart that is filled with love and sympathy will reach the hearts of the youth who are apparently careless and hopeless.--CSW 77.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 275}
