    "word": "Unbelief is finding an entrance in our churches, in our sanitariums, and in our publishing houses. There are some who have committed the error of turning away from the source of their strength to follow devices and plans of men,--plans that are not after the order of the Lord; and because of this, they are weak when they should be strong. This is the reason that God has not wrought more mightily for His people. Had He done more for us, human beings would have taken to themselves the glory that should be given to God.",
