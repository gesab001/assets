    "word": "At one time I felt as if I could no longer bear the burden of this work. I thought that if men would continue to do as they have done, I would let matters drift and let those who have so much confidence in their own plans go on as they chose to go. I\n36\nintended merely to pray that the Lord would have mercy upon the ignorant and those who are out of the way. But I dared not lay down the burden, for in the visions of the night the Lord asked me the question: \u201cWill you do that which many would be only too pleased to see you doing? Will you keep silent? Will your voice no longer be heard presenting clearly and distinctly the needs of this long-neglected field? If so, you yourself will share the reproach that rests on the ministers and people who have not done for the Southern field the work the Lord has given them to do, who have passed by on the other side those who are their neighbors, treating them with indifference and cruel neglect.\u201d",
