    "word": "The youth of our cities breathe in the tainted, polluted atmosphere of crime.... They are educated in crime by reading the stories which fill the popular publications of the day. Having no regard for the right because it is right, as they read stories of theft, murder, and every other species of crime, they are led to devise plans by which they could improve upon the criminals' methods, and escape detection. Thus these foul publications assist in perfecting the education of the youth in the way that leads to perdition.",
