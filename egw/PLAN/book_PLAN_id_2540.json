    "word": "\"Arise, And Build\" \n\n     In order to bring into existence a strong training center at the denominational headquarters, the brethren found it necessary to plan for the raising of a fund of $100,000. \"God's word to His workers in Washington is, 'Arise, and build,'\" wrote Mrs. White in one of her published appeals in behalf of this fund; \"and His word to His people in all the conferences is, 'Strengthen the hands of the builders.' The work in Washington is to advance in straight lines, without delay or hindrance. Let it not be kept back for lack of means.\" [REVIEW AND HERALD, JULY 14, 1904.]",
