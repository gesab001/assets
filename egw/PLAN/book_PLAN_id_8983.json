    "word": "We feel deeply the great need of workers--men and women who realize the necessities of the people who know not the truth, in towns and villages and cities all about Battle Creek. There is wise personal labor to be bestowed gratuitously. Why is there not more burning zeal to plant the truth in our own communities, our own borders, and lift up the standard of God's memorial in all our cities in America? We need men of thought, men who have religious experience, men who know how to labor. Battle Creek is over-crowded through the several institutions in this city that call in many people as workers. And many come to advantage themselves, but they do not go into these adjacent towns as laborers to seek and save perishing souls. Is not truth, present truth, to be proclaimed nigh and far off? Oh, that God would work among the people in Battle Creek!",
