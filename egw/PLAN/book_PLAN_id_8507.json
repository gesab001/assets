    "word": "The minds of our brethren and sisters take too narrow and low a range. They do not keep before the mind's eye the divine plan, but are fixing their eyes upon worldly models. God calls you to look up, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God, and then work to prepare the minds and characters of your students according to Christ's character. If you lower the standard to obtain numbers, and make this a cause of rejoicing, you show great blindness. You should never consider that numbers are an evidence of success, for then Satan indeed is in the ascendancy. He can boast of very large numbers.",
