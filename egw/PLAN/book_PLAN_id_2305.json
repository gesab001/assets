    "word": "When one labors alone continually, he is apt to think that his way is above criticism, and he feels no particular desire to have any one labor with him. But it is Christ's plan that some one should stand right by his side, so that the work shall not be moulded entirely by one man's mind, and so that his defects of character shall not be regarded as virtues by himself or by those who hear him.",
