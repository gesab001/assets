    "word": "Christ's prayer for His disciples, \"For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth\" [John 17:19] has been left on record for us. You need to realize that you have much to learn, that you need a higher, holier sanctification of soul, body, and spirit before you can be a leader. There is great need for you to walk in humility of mind. Do not lay plans in accordance with your own wisdom. Thus you will imperil the cause and hinder its advancement.",
