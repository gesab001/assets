    "word": "Last night on the steamer, although I was peaceful and free from pain, I could not sleep until toward morning. I am now writing in the Ladies Saloon while the passengers are taking their tea. I have not been able to write during the convention. I was made very comfortable at the home of Brother and Sister Lacey. I had all that I could do, though, in walking to and from the cars, in attending the early morning meetings, giving morning talks, and in speaking on Sabbaths and Sundays. I am glad to have visited Hobart and Bismarck. We are now planning to keep the work alive in Tasmania, and we are looking about for laborers to send to this place.",
