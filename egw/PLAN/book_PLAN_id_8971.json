    "word": "I am perplexed to know what to do or to say to our people at the great heart of the work. The Lord presents to me their strange wrong course. There are ambitious projects entered into. Councils are held and plans laid, while the councils are not meeting the mind of the One mighty in counsel. The mold and superscription of God are not upon some of the workers in the office of publication as they should be. They know not what spirit they are of. The day, the evil day, is stealing upon them as a thief, and will surprise them by doing in darkness a work which they will not hesitate erelong to do boldly and decidedly. While many of those who claim to believe the truth are asleep spiritually, Satan is sowing his tares, working in darkness, subverting minds. The light which the Lord gave in warning is to be given to the world, that they should not be left in darkness. Our own workers managed so that the warnings in the books Great Controversy and Patriarchs and Prophets did not come to the people. Why? Because Satan devised and planned the whole matter that the living, stirring issues should be smothered until he had preoccupied the field. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. God sees their blindness.",
