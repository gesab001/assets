    "word": "No one man is to pick the work up in his hands and be so tenacious for his own ways of doing the work that no one can work with him, and he can work with no one unless that one follows the same manner of labor he has trained himself to follow. We cannot all labor in the same armor. Elder B is peculiar in this respect. He is shortening his days because he lifts the burdens all himself. He thinks no one can make a success unless his plans and ideas of carrying forward the work are exactly after his own order. He is not well balanced in this respect, and the work that ought to be more widespread and nearly self-sustaining is retarded and circumscribed; but it will be difficult to correct this state of things without having an almost fatal influence on Elder B. He believes his ideas and ways the only right way. \n\n104 \n\nIs it so? No, no.--Lt 49, 1876.",
