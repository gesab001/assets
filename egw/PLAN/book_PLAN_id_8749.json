    "word": "After the fall of Adam and Eve, the race was plunged into hopeless misery, and it was then that this great plan of redemption was advanced. It was then [that] the Son of God consented to leave His Father's throne, lay aside His royal crown, clothe Himself with humanity, take upon Himself the nature of man, and become a man among men. He became a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities. Then shall we not say with John, \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God!\"",
