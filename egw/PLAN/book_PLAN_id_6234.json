    "word": "There is great need that some one should also stand at the side of Brother -----, in order to share the responsibility that he carries, so that if he should fail, another could go forward with the work without a disagreeable break. If he were relieved of some of his burdens, he would last longer. He should not have such great cares and heavy burdens to carry, and should not be obliged \n\n\n                      - 67 - \n\nto work when he needs rest. The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. Jesus said this, and we see that the world works on a different plan in these matters. Weighty responsibilities connected with the business of the world, are not placed wholly upon one man. In large business enterprises, responsible men choose others to share their burdens, and lift their responsibilities, so that in case one should fail, there is some one ready to step into his place. Some one should feel a burden over these matters, and a decided change should take place in the manner of our work. \n                          Mrs. E. G. White.",
