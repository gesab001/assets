WHITE THAT HER MIND HAS BEEN VISITED BY HEAVENLY ILLUMINATIONS, WHICH HAVE QUALIFIED HER TO PRESENT THE FACTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST IN CONNECTION WITH THE GREAT PLAN OF HUMAN REDEMPTION IN A CLEAR LIGHT. ONE THING IN PARTICULAR WILL IMPRESS THE READER, THAT THE WRITER OF THESE LITTLE BOOKS PRESENTS MANY BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS WHICH ARE NOT EXPRESSED IN OTHER WRITINGS OF THE KIND.

It could only be acceptable with God as a figure, representing the perfect Offering which the blood of beasts prefigured.",
