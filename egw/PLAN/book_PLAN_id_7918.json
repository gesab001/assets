    "word": "Here is a precious promise--the purposes and plans of God are to be opened to His disciples. What is a disciple? A learner, ever learning. Coming events of a solemn character are opening before us, and God would not have any one of us think that in these last days there is no more that we need to know. This is a continual snare of Satan. He [God] would not have us meet coming events without that special preparation which is essential to guide us through every difficulty. He would not have all stumbling their way along in ignorance, making self-conceit, self-esteem, self-confidence, take the place of true knowledge.",
