    "word": "Some parents think that they can let their little ones have their own way in their babyhood, and then when they get older they will reason with them; but this is a mistake. Begin in the baby life to teach obedience, but never let them hear a cross word from your lips. Avoid everything that will be rasping to your children, but require obedience in your home school. Force circumstances to be your agents in resisting the devil, and he will flee from you. In the greatest difficulties, do not let yourselves be mastered. Be determined to be a conqueror, and not to be conquered. Every morning lay your plans before the Lord, and ask Him to give you wisdom; and when you have done this, do not act out the promptings of Satan and in your speech reveal that Christ is not abiding in your heart by faith.",
