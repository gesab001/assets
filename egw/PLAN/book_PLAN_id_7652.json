    "word": "Daily, in the words we speak, in the plans we form, in the acts we perform, we are making impressions for good or for evil upon those with whom we come in contact. In all we do and say we should testify for Christ. There is a great work to be done in a short time, and those who have obtained a knowledge of present truth are called to be laborers in the cause. Said Christ to His disciples, \"as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick. . . .Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\"",
