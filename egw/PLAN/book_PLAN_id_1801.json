    "word": "We cannot be ready to meet the Lord by waking when the cry is heard, \"Behold, the Bridegroom!\" and then gathering up our empty lamps to have them replenished. . . . In the parable the wise virgins had oil in their vessels with their lamps. Their light burned with undimmed flame through the night of watching. . . . So the followers of Christ are to shed light into the darkness of the world. Through the Holy Spirit, God's word is a light as it becomes a transforming power in the life of the receiver. By implanting in their hearts the principles of His word, the Holy Spirit develops in men the attributes of God. The light of His glory--His character--is to shine forth in His followers.",
