    "word": "The members of this church need to study the Bible. Feed on the Word of God, and you will find that it is indeed the bread of life. Christ declared, \"Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life\" (John 6:54). In explanation He said, \"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (verse 63).",
