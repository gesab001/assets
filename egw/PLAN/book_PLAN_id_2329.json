    "word": "The statement which is sometimes made, that we must all come down upon a level, is not Bible teaching. While the Christian should cherish humility and meekness, he is, in learning these lessons, coming in connection with Christ, coming up to a higher plane of action. The Lord would have the subjects of his kingdom represent the character of their sovereign. The religion of Christ never degrades the receiver; never makes him careless in his dress, neglectful of his manners and habits, or rough and uncourteous in speech. It elevates the receiver, refines his taste, sanctifies his judgment, purifies the thoughts, and makes the actions holy; it prepares him to become a member of the great family above.",
