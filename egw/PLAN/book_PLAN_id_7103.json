GREAT POWER IS TO ATTEND IT IN ITS CLOSING WORK. \"While the work of salvation is closing, trouble will be coming on the earth, and the nations will be angry, yet held in check so as not to prevent the work of the third angel. At that time the 'latter rain,' or refreshing from the presence of the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud voice of the third angel.\"-- \"Early Writings,\" p. 86.",
