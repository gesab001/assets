    "word": "Love for Christ leads to obedience. Those who disregard the word of Christ have not Christ's wisdom, or his peace, or his light. Whatever their qualifications, however firmly they may trust in their own wisdom, their plans will result in foolishness, while they themselves will become inflated with ideas of their own greatness. They do not obey Christ; they have not his love in their hearts; and therefore they have not the mind of Christ. Their human nature refuses to be conformed to his will and way.",
