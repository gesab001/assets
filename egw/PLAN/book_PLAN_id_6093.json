To every man God gives \n                                                                           102\ntalents, which are to be improved according to His several ability. Supposing the talent is small, God has a place for it; and that one talent, if used, will do the very work God designed that it should do. The talents of the humble cottager are needed in house-to-house labor and can accomplish more in this work than brilliant gifts. And he who uses aright his one talent will be as verily rewarded as he who uses aright five talents. It is for working according to the ability given that God rewards His servants.--Letter 41, 1899.",
