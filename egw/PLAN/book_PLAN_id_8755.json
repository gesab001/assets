    "word": "Well, what shall we do? Shall we study and become conversant with the Bible? Or shall we have our minds occupied with things of minor importance, and with things of this world's business? Shall we not study to know whereof we believe? The time is just before us when you will have to stand before the kings, to be criticized by the learned men, and to give a reason of the hope that is within you. When asked for the reason of your hope, it will not do to say as some do, We keep the Sabbath because our father did. Do you know why you keep the Sabbath of the Lord your God? And if so, can you tell why you keep it? If so, you can plant your feet on the foundation, and be able to understand every principle of your faith so as to give an intelligent reason for the hope that is within you, with meekness and with fear.",
