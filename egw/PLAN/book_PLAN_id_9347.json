    "word": "We shall have to labor under difficulties, but because of this, let not our zeal flag. The Bible does not acknowledge a believer who is idle, however high his profession may be. There will be employment in heaven. The redeemed state is not one of idle repose. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God, but it is a rest found in loving service. Some among the redeemed will have laid hold of Christ in the last hours of life, and in heaven instruction will be given to these ones, who when they died, did not understand perfectly the plan of salvation. Christ will lead the redeemed ones beside the (84) river of life, and will open to them that which while on this earth they could not understand. \n\n\"He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.",
