    "word": "The word of God is to be the guide book, the counsellor, the teacher in the highest class of education. The Bible teaches the whole will of God concerning the plan of salvation, and if men are ignorant, it is because they \n\n\n                                      -16- \n\ndo not choose to be wise. God says of the supposed great men of our world, They must become fools in order to be wise. The sentiments of infidel authors are not needed to perfect an education. In the past our schools have mingled with that essential for education, the writing of men who advance error, the sophistries of men who trample under foot God's memorial. The Book that reveals the plan of salvation has been made secondary. But how is the honest inquirer after truth to find the way to heaven. Only by the Word of God, from which, even in his ignorance, he will learn the truth and be saved from destructive errors.--Ms 12b, 1896, pp. 4, 5, 15. (\"Higher Education,\" March 17, 1896.)",
