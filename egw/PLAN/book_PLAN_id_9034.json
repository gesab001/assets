    "word": "Those who present before the world apparent differences while they make no effort to see eye to eye by coming together as brethren to search the Scriptures with the spirit of a little child, are not working in the lines in which Christ worked, and his Holy Spirit will not endorse their work. There are peculiar temperaments that are easily thrown off the track, and when they get under the controlling power of temptation, they require to be helped. This is the case of Bro. Foster, who has been a reader of the Review for some years. He saw the articles by Elder Jones on the formation of the image, and was greatly blessed in reading them. Then came Elder Smith's article opposed to Elder Jones. This brought him into trial just before the week of prayer. I had a long talk with him, for he came to me to tell his feelings, poor man. Through the Lord's Spirit, I spoke words to comfort him. He made some statement in reference to the meeting at Minneapolis, and I had to explain a little of that matter, just as the Lord had presented it to me. I do not want these burdens repeated that were forced upon me in Minneapolis and Battle Creek. Some may take explanations in the right way, because the Spirit of the Lord is abiding with them, but to other minds everything is perverted by the enemy. \n                                                                           1144",
