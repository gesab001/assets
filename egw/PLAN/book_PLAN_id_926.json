    "word": "Chap. 16 - Regularity and System\n\n     The directions given by the Holy Spirit through the apostle Paul in regard to gifts, present a principle that applies also to tithing: \"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.\" Parents and children are here included. Not only the rich, but the poor, are addressed. \"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart [through the candid consideration of God's prescribed plan], so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\" The gifts are to be made in consideration of the great goodness of God to us.",
