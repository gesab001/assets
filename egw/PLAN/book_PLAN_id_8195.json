    "word": "I understand that Brother Baker will send you a copy of that which I sent him. I gave directions to have a copy sent to you, and you must have it ere this.

Do much more work after the meeting. Follow up the interest then rather than before. The spoken truth will have much greater influence than papers containing articles in vindication of the truth. But both combined will have greater force. \n\n\n                                    -341-",
