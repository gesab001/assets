    "word": "The school faculty held private consultations to consider what was best to be done. There was a voice in these councils that tried to counter-work the plans introduced to keep discipline and order. By this sympathizing voice indiscreet words were dropped to the students in reference to the matters under consideration in the council. This was and will be oft repeated, a betrayal of sacred trust. These things were caught up by the students. They thought that such a teacher was all right; that she was a clever teacher. She would have sympathy for the wrongdoer. Thus the hands of these carrying a heavy load were not strengthened, but weakened. The efforts made to repress evil were looked upon as harsh and uncharitable. \"Young folks must have their jolly times\" was repeated, with other insipid speeches. A word dropped here and a word there left its baleful impression, and the wrongdoers knew that there were those in the school who did not think that their course of deception and falsehood was a great sin. But to continually take up the cause of the wrongdoer, making of no account his departure from righteousness and truth and steadfast integrity, is a grievous sin against God.",
