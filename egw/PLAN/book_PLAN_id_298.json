    "word": "The sayings of Christ are to be valued, not merely in accordance with the measure of the understanding of those who hear; they are to be considered in the important bearing that Christ Himself attaches to them. He took the old truths, of which He Himself was the originator, and placed them before His hearers in heaven\u2019s own light. How different was their representation. What a flood of meaning and brightness and spirituality was brought in by their explanation.",
