They will stand before the throne, accepted in the Beloved. All their sins have been blotted out, \n70\nall their transgressions borne away. Now they can look upon the undimmed glory of the throne of God. They have been partakers with Christ in His sufferings, they have been workers together with Him in the plan of redemption, and they are partakers with Him in the joy of seeing souls saved in the kingdom of God, there to praise God through all eternity.\u20149T 285.",
