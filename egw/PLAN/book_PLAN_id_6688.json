I was restless during the first part of the night, and at ten o'clock stepped into my office room, to relieve myself of the strain of trying to sleep and being unable to. I saw your letter in the place where the letters that come for me at night are always put, read it. That started me on a train of thought. I \n                                                                           9\nwas planning about the Sanitarium in Takoma Park. But I thought, what good would it do if I should write out my plans. I have written and said that the Sanitarium should not be left until the last, but should be erected at once. I have said that it should not be a large expensive building, and that it should stand at a sufficient distance from the school buildings. I have said that the building should be of moderate size.",
