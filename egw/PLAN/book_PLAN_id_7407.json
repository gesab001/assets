    "word": "But God does not expect those to whom He has given a special work to take on the depraved, the lowest specimens of humanity, using up the treasury money in this work and teach them only a few jots and tittles in spiritual lines. Let the light of the truth of God flash into the mind. While you can show that you are willing and grateful to receive any ideas in regard to the methods and plans of this work which will be a help and a blessing to our own people, your influence should be exerted in every way possible to let the light of truth shine into their minds.",
