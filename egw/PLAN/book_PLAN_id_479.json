    "word": "61\n \n     The Back Pullers--There are always a few who think, when their brethren are pulling forward, that it is their duty to pull back.  They object to everything that is proposed, and make war on every plan that they have not themselves originated.  Here is an opportunity for persons to develop inordinate self-confidence.  They have never learned in the school of Christ the precious and all-important lesson of becoming meek and lowly.  There is nothing harder for those who possess a strong will than to give up their own way, and submit to the judgment of others.--Gospel Workers, pp. 446, 447.",
