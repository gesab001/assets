    "word": "The Quality of Students to Be Trained for the Ministry--In our schools we want to educate workers, for God wants workers. There are many who think that if there is a man who cannot make a success at anything else he would make a minister, but we do not want such men. We want men who can think, plan, and devise. Do you think a minister who is employed in visiting needs no ability and tact? If there was ever a place where there should be thinking and acting done, it is in the upbuilding of the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, we want useful persons, and those who have made a success in other things.",
