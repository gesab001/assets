    "word": "Once, when the Sanhedrim council was planning the most effectual way of bringing about the condemnation and death of Jesus, his authoritative voice was heard in protest, \"Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?\" This brought a sharp rebuff from the chief priest, \"Art thou also of Galilee?
