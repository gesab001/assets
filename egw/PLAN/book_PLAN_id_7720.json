    "word": "MR No. 596 - Encouragement for the Sick\n\n     This sickness, I am convinced, is a part of God's plan, and He always knows what is best. I have had a rich experience during this long illness. I have become better acquainted with the Saviour, and have had so many tokens of His presence and light and love that I was really privileged in being sick and suffering, to feel myself the object of His special administration and tender care. The Lord Jesus was never more precious to me than now.--Letter 45, 1892, p. 2. (To A. T. Robinson, November 7, 1892.)",
