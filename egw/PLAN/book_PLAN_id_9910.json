    "word": "The Lord has entrusted His garden to skilled tenders whose work it is to care for His beautiful plants. Tender care must be given to the delicate plants. The useless off-shoots must be taken away. The bruised parts must be carefully bound up. So those who are weak in the faith must have fostering care. We are to bind to our strong purposes the weaklings in the Lord's garden, giving them support.",
