    "word": "You are inclined to exalt yourself, to cherish a spirit of censoriousness. You show contempt for those who are chosen of God and precious, because they differ with you in some things.

Do you realize the danger of despising Christ in the person of His saints? God is light, and when He gives instruction to human beings that does not please them, shall they regard with scorn and contempt the messenger who, as a faithful steward, has had to courage to speak to them the truth? Will you, my brother, become the enemy of the Lord's messenger, and say many things that are untrue of the one who has told you the truth?",
