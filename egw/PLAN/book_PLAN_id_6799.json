    "word": "Every false way is a deception, and if sustained will in the end bring destruction. Thus the Lord permits those who maintain false plans to be destroyed. At the very time when praise and adulation is heard, sudden destruction comes. There are those who, notwithstanding they know of the reproof received by others, because of unfaithfulness, turn away from admonition. These are doubly guilty. They knew the Lord's will, and did it not. Their punishment will be proportionate to their guilt. They would not take heed to the word of the Lord.
