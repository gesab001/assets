    "word": "The Fresno church was presented to me as in a very distracted condition, while you represented it to me as in harmony. This shows your lack of spiritual discernment. Most earnest work needs to be done in the Fresno church, that things may be set in order. The Lord arranges His plans in heaven with the design that men shall be laborers together with Him in their appointed places, and reflect upon others the light given them of God. The work of God is not to be planned and executed with rashness, with unsanctified hearts and minds, and in a loose, slipshod manner. God is our chief magistrate, and He guides and rules the churches in every land.",
