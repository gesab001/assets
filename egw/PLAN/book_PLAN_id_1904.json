    "word": "In our work heretofore there has been too much of a disposition to put the light under a bushel, or under a bed, rather than on a candlestick, where it might give light to all that are in the house. Let no especial effort be made to exalt the men, but seek to magnify the work. Bring your minds up to appreciate its greatness. Let not your own narrow plans \n308\nand limited ideas be allowed to shape your methods of working in God's cause.",
