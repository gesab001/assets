    "word": "No Reference to Opponents' Claims--The Holy Spirit will apply the word that is spoken in love to the soul. But let it be understood that no good is accomplished when the voice or the pen expresses that which is harsh, or even expresses the truth in a harsh manner. Let the region of human passion be passed by, lest the truth be misapprehended, misinterpreted, and misconstrued. The truth will have quickening power that is spoken under the full influence of the grace of Christ. God's plan is first to reach the heart. Speak the truth and let Him carry forward the reformatory power and principle; but \n                                                                           241\nlet us not work according to our own individual impulse.",
