    "word": "I have been shown that the enemy of God and man is constantly at work to invent plans and enterprises to absorb means so the work which is greatly in need of it may be hindered and crippled. These enterprises which will be less efficient for good than others will result in constant perplexity by calling for additional means and ability which might be employed in other directions with far greater success. The Lord would have us look matters squarely in the face and consider the beauties, the demands, and liabilities of every new work or enterprise in which we engage. We are to contemplate with well balanced minds the conditions of success. Everything we undertake now in this period so fraught with solemn importance must be undertaken under the guidance of divine wisdom. It is essential that the work be begun with the union and co-operation which it demands. If there has been a mistake made at the outset, a following on in the same course of error will lead more and more from the path of safety and success. To follow on in a doubtful path will only retard the advanced movements that should be made in the earnest work of saving souls. If the enemy can engage means and ability in a matter of less importance to crowd out larger and more vital interests he counts his work a success.",
