    "word": "I felt a heavy burden this morning when I read over a letter that I found in my room, in which a plan was outlined for having medical students take some work at Loma Linda, but to get the finishing touches of their education from some worldly institution. God forbid that such a plan should be followed. I must state that the light I have received is that we are to stand as a distinct, commandment-keeping people. The Sabbath is a great distinguishing line, and its observance will separate us from the world. As God's peculiar people we should not feel that we must acknowledge our dependence upon men who are transgressing God's law to give us influence in the world. It is God that gives us influence. He is our exceeding great reward. He will give us advantages that are far beyond all the advantages we might receive from worldlings, by uniting with those who do not recognize the law of God.",
