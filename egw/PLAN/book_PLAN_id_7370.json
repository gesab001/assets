    "word": "Tuesday morning I rose at half past three o'clock and again wrote a little in my diary. Worked some in the orchard, tying up the trees. A tuft of grass is put between the stake and the tree so that the tree shall not be marred. At five, Willie and I walked down to our garden, which is some distance from the house, and planted peas. We worked until seven a.m. and were prepared for our morning family prayer and for breakfast. I felt too weary to do more out of doors. We planned about many things that must be done to our ground.--Ms 62, 1896, pp. 1, 2. (Diary, Feb. 9 to 27, 1896, Sunnyside, Cooranbong.)",
