    "word": "My brother Olsen, can you still be so blinded as to unite in the least degree with those who undertake to rule other minds as has been done in Battle Creek?

This has been done in a most decided manner. Should the plans originated by such minds be carried into effect, evangelical religion, the Christianity of the Bible, would, so far as their influence goes, become extinct.",
