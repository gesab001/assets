    "word": "More aggressive work must be done. Plants must be made in the cities. Now is the time to give the third angel's message. But this cannot be done in church buildings. Camp meetings must be held, not one mammoth camp meeting, but several camp meetings in different places. The holding of camp meetings is one of the most successful ways of working for the Lord. These meetings should continue two or three weeks, and during this time earnest work should be done for believers and unbelievers. The work done at these meetings should never be of a cheap, low grade. Men of the best spiritual gifts should attend, men who can give the messages for this time, and properly bring out the features of our faith which make us what we are-- Seventh-day Adventists.",
