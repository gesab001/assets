    "word": "2 - The Work in the South\n\nSource: PH151 pg. 61\n1902\n     It is time that every city in the South that can be entered should be worked. The people, both white and black, are to hear the testing message for this time. Our people were directed to Nashville because in many respects it was a favorable place for the publishing work and other important lines. Our workers find it easier to labor there for the uplifting of the colored race than in many other cities of the South. Prejudice against the introduction of plans for the education of the colored people is not so pronounced in Nashville as it is in other places.",
