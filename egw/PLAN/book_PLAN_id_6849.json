    "word": "Shall everything pass under the control of men who we know have not a living connection with God? He who says, \"I know thy works,\" hears all their suggestions, listens to all their plans. The institutions of God's own creating, which he established upon principles of justice and equity, they are seeking to make a means of oppression, forcing the Lord's workers to accept terms which they themselves, were the situation reversed, would not accept.",
