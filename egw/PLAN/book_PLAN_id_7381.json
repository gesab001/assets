    "word": "These people did not have to do with their color. They are not accountable for the fact that they are not white; and how foolish it is for human beings that are dependent for every breath they draw, to feel that we should have nothing to do with the colored people! We have a duty to perform toward them, and in the fear of God we are endeavoring to discharge this duty by providing in every possible way for them to hear the third angel's message and to fit themselves for proclaiming the truth to their own race. The Lord is working with us as we plan for the advancement of this portion of the Lord's vineyard. . . .",
