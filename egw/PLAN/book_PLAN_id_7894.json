    "word": "Prescott Seen Obeying Divine Counsel to Engage in Public Evangelism (To W. W. Prescott and A. G. Daniells)--I thank God that public meetings have been held in the Battle Creek Tabernacle, and that the trumpet has been given a certain sound. This is the very line of work that in the visions of the night I saw Elder Prescott engaged in--and in the manner described by Elder Daniells in his recent letter. I saw that as our brother would use his voice in proclaiming the message of present truth he would be exercising his talents to the glory of God and a deep impression would be made upon the minds of the people. The mind and the voice of the speaker, combined, will make right impressions on large assemblies. This is in harmony with the Lord's plan. The presentation of important subjects before large gatherings will result in the development of the talent of personal influence.--Letter 28, 1910, p. 2 (Feb. 22, 1910).",
