    "word": "To every man, God has assigned a place in His great plan. By truth or falsehood, by folly or wisdom, each is fulfilling a purpose, bringing about certain results. And each, according as he chooses obedience or disobedience, is deciding his own eternal destiny. To every one is given freedom to act, and upon every one rests the responsibility for his own actions. But our words and actions must pass the test of God's high standard, or we shall be bound up with the wicked, to receive an eternal retribution.--Ms 36, 1896, pp. 2-4. (\"Obedience the Condition of Success,\" Dec. 9, 1896.) \n\nReleased Feb. 12, 1965.",
