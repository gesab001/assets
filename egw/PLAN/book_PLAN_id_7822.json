    "word": "There should be a sanitarium near Melbourne, if there were those to manage such an institution who could carry it forward solidly. Brother [A. W.] Semmens has had an experience in medical missionary work, and he can carry the work forward in Adelaide, if he seeks counsel of God. There certainly should be a sanitarium near Adelaide. I shall encourage this, for it is God's plan. By means of such an institution hundreds would become enlightened in regard to present truth. We need to give all the publicity we possibly can to the work God desires to have done. The seeds of truth are to be sown beside all waters. Let the Lord's work go forward. Let the medical missionary and the educational work go forward. I am sure that this is our great lack--earnest, devoted, intelligent, capable workers. --Letter 203, 1905, pp. 2,3. (To Dr. D. H. Kress and wife, July 18, 1905.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. February 1, 1980",
