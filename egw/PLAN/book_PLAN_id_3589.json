    "word": "The board of directors should ever act as under the divine eye, and with a continual sense that they are only finite men and are liable to make mistakes in judgment and in decisions and plans unless they are closely connected with God. As they are only weak and erring men themselves they should feel kindness and pity for others who may err. . . . There should be the cultivation of universal kindness with every worker. Seek counsel of God first, for this is necessary in order for you to properly counsel together.--Lt 34, 1886.",
