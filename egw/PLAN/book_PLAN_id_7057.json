    "word": "Bro. Aldrich trusted to his own wisdom and judgment. He lost sight of the simplicity of the work as well as its exalted, holy character. He spread himself like a green bay-tree, but God withered his branches, and brought to naught his plans. God made the wisdom of Bro. Aldrich foolishness. He has not managed with economy and prudence. His management has increased the embarrassment of the Institute without relieving it. If Bro. Aldrich would possess a humble heart, ready to admit his errors, and confess his wrongs, he could then see clearer light. If he does not do this, darkness will envelop him, and he will be left to his own imperfect judgment. No error is a trifle, unworthy of notice or comment, be it found to exist in Bro. Aldrich, Bro. Gage, Bro. Amadon, or any of the working hands. The smallest entrance should not be allowed to the foe; for when once he is in the fort, his work of deception and injury commences.",
