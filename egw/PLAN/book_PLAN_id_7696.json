    "word": "Mr. Mosely came [the] evening after the Sabbath. He is a gardener and furnished us the trees. He has a sample orchard at Orumbro twenty miles from here, and he will do his best to give us good fruit trees for this will be a sample of what he can furnish for others. Every hand is busy today. The plow goes into the ground and one follows the furrow to dig the holes and plant our trees of every variety. We have three acres cleared. The school planted \n\n\n                                    -147- \n\n300 trees yesterday. This is only a quarter of what they have on hand to plant.",
