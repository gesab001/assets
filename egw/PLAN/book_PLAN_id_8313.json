    "word": "If you can connect with the Doctors Kress, this will be of great benefit both to you and to them. The Lord would have you labor together in unity, even though your ideas and plans are not exactly alike. Men and women of different dispositions must unite in labor, working without contention or strife. Both you and Doctor Kress should stand in a conciliatory position. Remember that no one is free from mistakes. May the Lord help you, my dear friends.",
