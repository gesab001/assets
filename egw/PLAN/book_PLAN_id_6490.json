    "word": "Again and again testimonies of reproof have been given to the church to correct the spirit of speculation. Now I say to you, my brother, the Lord did not guide your mind when you were led to take up the work you are now doing. My testimony to you and to those who are united with you in your plans and speculations, is that you are pursuing a course which, if continued, will lead men and women away from obedience to God's commandments. You and those associated with you need to learn to distinguish between the interposition of Providence and the workings of a deceived mind.",
