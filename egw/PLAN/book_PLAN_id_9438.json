Nov. 10, '07. \n\nDear Brother and Sister Haskell;- \n     We feel that you are needed in the Southern California field at this time. W. C. White thinks that you may be planning to labor for a time in Nashville. But I feel that your labors are very essential right here at Loma Linda and I hope that you will not delay coming longer than seems necessary. If ever such help as you can give was needed, it is now.",
