Aug. \n                                                     5, 1902 \n\nDr. J. H. Kellogg \n\nDear Brother,- \n\n\n     I received your excellent letter a short time ago. You were not at home when you wrote, but were traveling from place to place, and therefore I did not answer immediately. After I received your letter, my heart was much oppressed. For several nights I could not sleep past one o'clock, but walked the room, praying. The fourth night I said, \"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? I am willing to do anything that it is duty for me to do.\" I was instructed, \"I have a message for you to bear to Dr. Kellogg.\" I thought, \"It will do no good. He does not accept the messages that I bear him, unless these harmonize with his plans and devisings.\" Yet I must give the message given to me for you.",
