    "word": "God has put into operation every conceivable plan that the value of the human soul should be appreciated. He would lead all to see what souls are worth. Christ died to save every man. He desires that every effort shall be made to save perishing souls. He sends out evangelists and missionaries, and causes religious periodicals to be circulated. The press is brought in to help to reach souls in darkness. Those who are on this ground must not put on their citizen's dress, but the wedding garment. They have been married to Christ, and the robe of His righteousness is to clothe them. The church is the bride of Christ, and her members are to yoke up with their Leader. God warns us not to defile our garments.--Letter 123a, 1898. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. October 30, 1986. Entire Letter.",
