    "word": "While one class pervert the doctrine of justification by faith, and neglect to comply with the conditions laid down in the Word of God, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments,\" there is fully as great an error on the part of those who claim to believe and obey the commandments of God, who place themselves in opposition to the precious rays of light (new to them) reflected from the cross of Calvary. They do not see the wondrous things in the law of God. To all who are doers of the word, with every injunction to obedience, there is a promise the most positive underlying the command. And we have lost very much in that we have not opened the eyes of our understanding to discern the wondrous things in the law of God. On the one hand the religionist generally has divorced the law and the gospel, while we have on the other hand almost done the same from another standpoint. We have not held up before the people the righteousness of Christ and the full significance of His great plan of redemption. We have left out Christ and His matchless love, and brought in the theories and reasonings, preached arguments.",
