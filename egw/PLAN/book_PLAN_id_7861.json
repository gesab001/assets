    "word": "The Sanitarium--Where Shall It Be Located?--I am much burdened and perplexed. Matters have been presented to me which I wish to comprehend fully, that I may not make any mistake. Again and again the question arises, Where shall we locate our sanitarium? We who cannot read the future may make plans for the present which appear altogether consistent, the very plans in our human judgment which should be made. But with our finite judgment we cannot discern the future perplexities involved in our selection of a location for a sanitarium. Candid, prayerful consideration must be given to this subject, and great caution must be exercised in regard to it.",
