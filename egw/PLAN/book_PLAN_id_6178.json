    "word": "When the plan of redemption was laid, it was decided that Christ should not appear in accordance with His divine character; for He could not then associate with the distressed and the suffering. He must come as a poor man. He could have appeared in accordance with His exalted station in the heavenly courts; but no, He must reach to the very lowest depths of human suffering and poverty, that His voice might be heard by the burdened and disappointed.--Signs of the Times, June 24, 1897.",
