    "word": "The people need to be educated. This cannot be done if all the preacher's powers are given to sermonizing or to brain work and writing; for this unfits for the real work at the right time, and it has to be neglected for want of strength. The vitality, both physical and mental, has been \n\n\n                                    -183- \n\nexpended needlessly, and the work has not been done with efficiency to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. The mere hearing of sermons Sabbath after Sabbath or the reading of the Bible through and through, or the explanation of it verse by verse will not benefit us or those who hear us unless we bring these precious truths into our own individual experience. In short, my brother, you must take time to be a Christian, not tax brain and nerve to such an extent that you cannot be Christlike under difficulties. It is only by living a life in harmony with that of the Saviour that we meet the requirement of God to be not only hearers but doers of the Word.",
