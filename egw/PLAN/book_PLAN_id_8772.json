    "word": "All work in business lines should be done on scriptural lines. The tact that the Lord has given us should be used not to defraud but to encourage holiness unto the Lord. Of one whom the Lord chose to do a certain work, He said, \"I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship\" [Exodus 31:3-5]. Here we have assurance that from God comes the talent of wisdom to do the work He has appointed. Read verses 6-11. There was no need for any man to be \n\n\n                 -133- \n\nexalted in this matter. It was the Holy One of Israel who had commissioned these men to do this work, and who had given them wisdom to accomplish it after His own plan.",
