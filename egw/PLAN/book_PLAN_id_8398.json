    "word": "Ministry means not only the study of books and preaching; it means service. Especially are ministers to engage in useful, profitable manual labor, that all their faculties may be kept in a healthy condition. As they open the Word to others, God will bless them in this line of work; but it is a mistake to read and study all the time, not using the physical organs. It is a neglect of thorough service to God. They cannot be all-around men. There is a necessity of ministers using their powers of ingenuity, that they may not be unskillful in the Word, and may show their ingenuity in devising and planning in business lines. These faculties should be used in the service of God to win souls to the truth. Real planning and devising are required to bring the sinner out of darkness into the light of truth.",
