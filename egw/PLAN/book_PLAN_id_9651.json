    "word": "When men plan and scheme to get the advantage of one another in business dealing, it is because they have cast the word of God behind them. It pains my heart even to trace these words. The word of God does not restrict man's diligence in business transactions that are according to righteousness. But it bears plain witness against underhand dealing. Upon this point it is clear and decided, and no one need err in understanding it. The word of God is a light put into man's hand. God tells him to be guided by its precepts. Thus only can he become an heir of God and a joint heir with Jesus Christ. In obeying the word, man is acquiring immortal treasures, which will never pass away. The peace of God is worth everything to the receiver.",
