    "word": "Iowa City, Iowa, March 14, 1860\n     My Dear Willie: We have not forgotten you, my dear boy. When we see other little children around, we long to get our little Willie in our arms again, and press his little soft \n62\ncheek, and receive his kiss. In about five weeks we shall be at home again, and then, Willie, we will work in the garden, and tend the flowers and plant the seeds. You must be a good, sweet, little boy, and love to obey Jenny and Lucinda. Give up your will, and when you wish to do anything very much, inquire, Is it not selfish? You must learn to yield your will and your way. It will be a hard lesson for my little boy to learn, but it will in the end be worth more to him than gold. [BY THE BLESSING OF GOD AND HIS MOTHER'S INSTRUCTIONS, WILLIE HAS OVERCOME THE IMPATIENT SPIRIT WHICH HE SOMETIMES MANIFESTED WHEN QUITE YOUNG, AND HE NOW POSSESSES A MOST AFFECTIONATE, AMIABLE, AND OBEDIENT DISPOSITION. A.P.P.] Learn, my dear Willie, to be patient, to wait others' time and convenience; then you will not get impatient and irritable. The Lord loves those little children who try to do right, and he has promised that they shall be in his kingdom. But wicked children God does not love. He will not take them to the beautiful City, for he only admits the good, obedient, and patient children there. One fretful, disobedient child, would spoil all the harmony of heaven. When you feel tempted to speak impatient and fretful, remember the Lord sees you, and will not love you if you do wrong. When you do right\n63\nand overcome wrong feelings, the Lord smiles upon you.",
