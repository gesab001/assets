    "word": "Criticism of Others Weakens Own Work.--The plans and methods of God's workers are to be thoroughly sifted from worldly policy. Their work is to be carried forward with Christlike simplicity. Remember that he who takes the position of a criticizer greatly weakens his own hands. God has not made it the duty of men or of women to find fault with their fellow workers.--Review and Herald, Sept. 2, 1902.",
