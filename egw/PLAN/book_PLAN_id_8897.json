    "word": "Piety must be practiced in the home. Interested personal efforts must be made for those around you. Seek the Lord in private prayer. Ask Christ to do for you what you need to have done. He has been tempted in all points like as we are, and He knows how to succor those that are tempted. God calls upon you to leave the atmosphere of unbelief in which you have been dwelling, and place yourselves in an atmosphere of faith and confidence. Do your best. Do not seek wisdom from finite men, who may be bewildered by the temptations of Satan, who may plant the seeds of doubt rather than the seeds of faith. Go to Jesus, \"who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\" Has not His invitation reached your ears and touched your heart? He says, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\"",
