I was pointed back to the days of the apostles, and saw that God laid the plan by the descent of His Holy Spirit, and that by the gift of prophecy He counseled His people in regard to a system of benevolence.

I saw that this was not merely to sympathize with them by comforting words in their affliction, but to aid them, if needy, with our substance.
