    "word": "Many of these trifling, frivolous ones make a profession of religion, and this hollow form of godliness has been so long tolerated that it has pervaded our institution and extended even to our churches. The standard of piety is lowered to the dust. The new life from Christ must be implanted in the heart. God calls for the highest development of the principles of godliness, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Rich clusters of fruit will be borne by the branches that are grafted into Christ the parent stem. Whenever this fruit is manifested the truth will possess power; its progress and growth will be extended. . . .",
