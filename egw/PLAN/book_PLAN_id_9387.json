    "word": "Yesterday I had a long visit as I rode out with Brother and Sister Howell. Brother Howell is very desirous of knowing how to plan for the educational work with which he is connected, so that no mistakes may be made. I tell him that the Lord will lead all who are willing to be led. The Bible is our safe guide book. Said Christ, \"He that will come after me, let him take up his cross and follow Me.\" (311) We cannot mark out a practice line to be followed unconditionally. Circumstances and emergencies will arise for which the Lord must give special instruction. But if we begin to work, depending upon the Lord, watching, praying, and walking in harmony with the light He sends us, we shall not be left to walk in darkness.",
