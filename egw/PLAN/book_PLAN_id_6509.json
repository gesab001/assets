    "word": "The Madison school should have a small sanitarium of its own, [THE SMALL SANITARIUM HERE CALLED FOR, HAS SINCE BEEN ESTABLISHED.] that the students may have opportunity to learn how to give the simple treatments. This is the plan that we have been directed to follow. And if the brethren connected with the medical work in Nashville could have seen their way clear to locate the sanitarium on the school farm near enough the school for there to be co-operation between the two institutions and far enough from it to prevent one from interfering with the work of the other, I should have been glad. I have thought much of these things in connection with the Nashville Sanitarium, and of the advantages to be gained if the school and the sanitarium could be near enough together to blend their work. But I have received no positive instruction \n                                                                           24\nregarding the exact location of the Nashville Sanitarium, and in this particular case I can not speak in decided terms. I dare not take the responsibility of saying anything to change the present arrangements.",
