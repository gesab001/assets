    "word": "Yesterday I had a two-hour conversation with Dr. T. S. Evans and his wife, who are working at the Sanitarium here. I think that the interview was a profitable one. They spoke of a plan that they have in mind--to have a banquet at the Sanitarium, and to invite the prominent residents of St. Helena, lawyers, bankers, and ministers. They hope that thus they can do something to remove the impression that seems to be held by some in St. Helena--that this institution is a place where only imbeciles and decrepit people are cared for. Brother Fulton, manager of the San Francisco Vegetarian Cafe, will come up to take charge of the preparation of the banquet.",
