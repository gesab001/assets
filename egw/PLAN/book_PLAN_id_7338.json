    "word": "We may learn a lesson from the work of the farmer in cultivating the field. He must cooperate with God. His part is to prepare the ground, and plant the seed, at the right time and in the right way. God gives the seed life. He sends the sunshine and the showers, and the seed springs up. . . . If the farmer fails to do his part . . . the sun may shine, the dew and the showers may fall upon the soil, but there will be no harvest.",
