    "word": "Is it not a strange thing that there are so few among Seventh-day Adventists who feel a burden to labor for the Jewish people? The slumbering faculties of the Jews are to be aroused. The Old Testament Scriptures blending with the New in an explanation of God's purpose, will be to them the dawning of a new creation, or as the resurrection of the soul. Faith will be awakened as Christ is seen portrayed in the pages of the Old Testament. As the doors of the Old Testament are unlocked by the key of the New, and it is seen how clearly the New Testament explains the Old, Christ will be recognized as the Saviour of the world. Many of the Jewish people will \n\n\n                                   -327- \n\nreceive Christ as their Redeemer. To them the words will be fulfilled, \"To as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\" They will be changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. Being made partakers of the divine nature, the image of divinity will be stamped on the soul. If they will continue to learn of Christ, they will attain to the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ.",
