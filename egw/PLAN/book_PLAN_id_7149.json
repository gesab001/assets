    "word": "The plan for the circulation of \"Object Lessons\" is not of human devising; it is God's plan. He signified that this book should be a gift to our schools. Thus far it has done its work, and God has set His approval on the self-sacrificing efforts of His people. Shall we mar His plan?--No, no! Until the Lord shall come, and our present system of school work shall be ended by our entering the higher school, \"Christ's Object Lessons\" is to stand as a gift to our educational institutions.",
