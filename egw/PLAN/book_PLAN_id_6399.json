    "word": "O, how much I desire to see the one who has been looked upon as the leader of our medical work, saved, if possible! He is one that must be born again. He must be reconverted in speech and in spirit, and pass through a transformation that will enable him to discern between light and darkness. At the present time, if his ministering brethren differ with him in judgment, and work contrary to his plans, he often has no use for them. Thus it has been for years, and message after message has the Lord sent in warning, but the one to whom they have been sent has refused to hear. And even when these ministers are doing the very work that God has assigned them, still by his words and representations he has often placed them before others as men who are not true. Thus \n                                                                           55\ndifferences of opinion, cherished and dwelt upon, are implanted in the minds of many.",
