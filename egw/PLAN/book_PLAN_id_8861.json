    "word": "You have made persistent efforts to try to center everything in Battle Creek, after clear light had been given that this should not be done. For years messages have been coming to you, distinctly pointing out the fact that plants should be made in many \n\n\n                            -119- \n\nplaces, and that so much should not be gathered into Battle Creek. I was surprised that you took so little heed to messages regarding this that the Lord has repeatedly sent you. You were professedly believing the Testimonies, and yet walking and working contrary to them, following your own impulses, turning from the plain. Thus saith the Lord, to carry out your own plans and devisings. You have had little use for those whom you thought would obstruct your way. You would not harmonize with them and refused to recognize in them any virtue or righteousness.",
