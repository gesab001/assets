    "word": "May the Lord place this matter before you as it is. God works, not as men plan, nor as men wish, but \"in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform.\" Why treat God's ways as worthless, because they do not coincide with our private ideas? God has appointed channels of light, but these are not necessarily through the minds of any particular man or set of men. When all shall take their appointed places in God's work, and not allow others to mold them at will, then one great advance will have been made toward letting the light shine upon the world.",
