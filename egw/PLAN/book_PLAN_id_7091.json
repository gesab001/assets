    "word": "You have no time to lose. You are unready for the coming of your Lord. You need to soften and humble your heart, and let the self-sufficient spirit that you possess die.

Like the enemy of souls, you are the accusers of your brethren. You are the greatest enemy to yourself that you have.",
