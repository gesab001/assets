    "word": "God indicated that you could be educated to act a part in his cause; but it was necessary that your mind should be trained and disciplined to work in harmony with the plan of God. You could gain the required experience if you would; you had the privilege presented before you of denying your inclination, as your Saviour had given you an example in his life. But you have not placed yourself in a position to learn all that you could and all that it was important for you to learn in order to make a correct worker in the cause of God. There were some things to reform in yourself before the Lord could use you effectually as his instrument.",
