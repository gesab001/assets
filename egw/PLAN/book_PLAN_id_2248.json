    "word": "Our Instructor addressed the leaders in the health food work at Battle Creek, telling them that they must make straight paths for their feet. Should the plans for health food stores and hygienic restaurants be carried out just as they have been outlined, many souls would fall into snares and pitfalls. There are those who view in a favorable light the establishment of health food stores and restaurants. But they should understand that like some other lines of work, this line may become altogether too absorbing. There may be brought into it too much business and too little principle. Thus the work which, if rightly handled, might be a blessing, would become a curse.",
