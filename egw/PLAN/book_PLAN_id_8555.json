    "word": "We are glad to be able to report that we have made a trial of our land, and we can testify to the fact that false witness has been borne of it. Though it was very late last year when our vegetables were planted, and though we had no rain except a few showers from March to October, yet the yield of squashes, melons, peas, beans, cucumbers, carrots, and tomatoes has been excellent. Our orchards also are doing very well. The coming season we hope the crops will do much better. Quite a space of land has been cleared, and the vegetables will be planted earlier. Our second crop of peas is now up, and the potatoes we have planted are up and doing well. We are all convinced that this is the place where we should locate.",
