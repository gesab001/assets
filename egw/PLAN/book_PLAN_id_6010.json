    "word": "The laws of Christ's kingdom are so simple, so compact, and yet so complete, that any man-made additions will create confusion. And the more simple our plans or work in God's service, the more we shall accomplish. By studying how they can adopt the plans of worldly policy in their work for God, men disarrange God's plans of humility and simplicity, which He desires shall be followed in advancing His kingdom.--Manuscript 53, June 30, 1901, untitled manuscript.",
