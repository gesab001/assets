    "word": "There is one thing I wish you to do, you and Brother and Sister Burden and Brother and Sister Starr. Search out what is written in the Scriptures and in the Testimonies on the subject of unity, and read it often. You will be tried by the ways of your fellow workers. Never forget that God's plan is that there shall be unity in diversity. The breath of the higher life is to be breathed into our life-work. This will bind us to one another and to God. The love of Christ needs to come into our experience. Then we shall love one another as Christ has loved us. I feel an intense desire to see the people of God united by the strong bonds of love and unity.--Letter 81, 1903. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nSeptember 13, 1990. Entire Letter.",
