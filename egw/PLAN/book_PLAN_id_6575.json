Light is all around them; yet they do not appropriate it to themselves. Parents do not see the necessity of informing themselves, obtaining knowledge, and putting that knowledge to a practical use in their married life. If they followed out the exhortation of the apostle, and lived upon the plan of addition, they would not be unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Many do not understand the work of sanctification. It is a progressive work. It is not attained to in an hour or a day, and then maintained without any special effort on their part. They seem to think they have attained to it when they have only learned the first lessons in addition.",
