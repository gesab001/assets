The \n\n\n                                   -155- \n\nmost beautiful peaches I have ever looked upon and most delicious to the taste, many of them weighing one half-pound each, have been produced on the land. From the first crop many of the peaches were picked off, for we feared that it would hurt the trees to let them bear so early. This last season our peach trees were so loaded with fruit that we had to prop up the branches. We have had all the vegetables we wanted for our own use, and have supplied the family of W.C.W. and Brother James, our farm manager. The orchard at the school bore well, and the fruit was of a good flavor.",
