    "word": "We had that day a desire to see the sick ones and bear to them fruit cherries which were picked one week before in Healdsburg from the trees of my own planting on the farm now owned by Brother Leininger.

We see that he is quite low, but he trusts in the Lord and has only to tell how good the Lord has been to them. This is a glad note. If sounded more, it would be better for everyone.",
