    "word": "You have felt sick at heart because you did not love the work in B----- C-----. You have looked back towards O-----and your heart is there, and your body should be where your heart is, God has been testing and proving you; how have you borne the test? You needed to be planed and polished, to have the rough and jagged points of your character removed that you might become refined for the Kingdom of Heaven. How hard it is for human nature to deny inclination, to leave flattering worldly inducements and, through love of their Saviour and their fellow men, to deny their own pleasure in order to engage more directly in the service of God.",
