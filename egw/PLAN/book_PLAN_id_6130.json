    "word": "As the plan of redemption begins and ends with a gift, so it is to be carried forward. The same spirit of sacrifice which purchased salvation for us will dwell in the hearts of all who become partakers of the heavenly gift. Says the apostle Peter: \"As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God\" (1 Peter 4:10). Said Jesus to His disciples as He sent them forth, \"Freely ye have received, freely give\" (Matthew 10:8). In him who is fully in sympathy with Christ, there can be nothing selfish or exclusive. He who drinks of the living water will find that it is \"in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" The Spirit of Christ within him is like a spring welling up in the desert, flowing to refresh all, and making those who are ready to perish eager to drink of the water of life.",
