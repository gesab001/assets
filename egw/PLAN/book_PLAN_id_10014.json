    "word": "When men engage in labor for the souls of others, they are not to be made amenable to the will of their fellow laborers. God is well able to direct the course of action of those who work for Him. But when his laborers, instead of calling upon him, seek first, and regard as of first importance, the counsel and advice of human minds, he is dishonored. The method of sending one minister to another minister to learn his duty is a plan of working that should not be encouraged. Greater evils will result from such a course than finite and erring man can foresee.",
