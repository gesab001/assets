    "word": "Who Determines Minutiae and Details? \n     The minutiae and detail of how they are to work is not to be laid down by human minds. When we decide that Jesus Christ will not do as He has said He will do, \"Lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the world,\" when we decide that God has not power or has not time to notice His workmen, then it might be more consistent to plan out every detail of the work. But we would encourage faith in those who give themselves to the work of God. We would inspire them to believe that God is not unmindful of their labors and trials. He values His human agents and appoints divine agencies to work with them. \"Ye are laborers together with God.\"",
