    "word": "From time to time the Lord has made known His manner of working. . . . And when a crisis has come, He has revealed Himself, and has interposed the working of Satan's plans. He has often permitted matters with nations, with families, and with individuals to come to a crisis, that His interference might become marked. Then He has let the fact be known that there is a God in Israel who would sustain and vindicate His people.",
