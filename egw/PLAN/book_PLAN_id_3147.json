    "word": "Let every weak, tempest-tossed soul find anchorage in Jesus Christ and not become so self-centered that he can think only of his little disappointments and the interruption of his plans and hopes. Is not the subject of the plan of salvation all-absorbing? If the infinite God justifies me, \u201cwho is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died\u201d (verse 34). He has in His dying for man revealed how much He loves man\u2014enough to die for Him! The law condemns the sinner and drives him to Christ. It is God that justifies and pardons.",
