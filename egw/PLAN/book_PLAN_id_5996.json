    "word": "It is God's plan that in His church heavenly influences shall be reinforced and stimulated by the cooperation of the members with Him. His people are to increase in strength and efficiency, knowing that the atmosphere which surrounds the souls of righteous believers is the same as the atmosphere in the heaven of purity and light and love. Through Christian fellowship they are to form their characters, assimilating them to the character of Christ. According to their faith will be their Christlike meekness and lowliness. As God's people seek to fulfill this plan, they are answering the prayer of Christ, \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\"--Manuscript 27a, April 19, 1900, \"God's Purpose for His People.\"",
