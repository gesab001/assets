    "word": "God has given us His Word to be our guide. Christ has said, \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me\" (John 5:39). He prayed for His disciples, \"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth\" (John 17:17). Paul says, \"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth\" (Acts 26:9). But this belief did not make his course right. When Paul received the gospel of Jesus Christ, it made him a new creature. He was transformed; the truth planted in his soul gave him such faith and courage as a follower of Christ that no opposition could move him, no suffering daunt him.",
