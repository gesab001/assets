    "word": "In the past, Dr. Kellogg has said: \"I have often wished that these sanitarium buildings were not half so large as they are. If we were not \n\n\n                                     -47- \n\nsituated as we are, with all these buildings, we would move away from Battle Creek to some other place where we should have an altogether different climate.\" This was a sensible view to take. But to build an enormous sanitarium in Battle Creek is just as much out of harmony with the Lord's will and with all that has been said and done in regard to this matter, as light is different from darkness. In the place of making a mammoth plant in one place, this institution should have made smaller plants in different places and in many cities.",
