    "word": "The greatest praise men can bring to God to exalt His sovereignty is to make themselves consecrated channels through which He can work. The Lord's work is to be done, and He called upon the members of His firm to act their part as obedient servants. If they have been fitted for service by the grace they have received, they are laborers together with God, but if they have not received this grace, they will be only hindrances. Through all the ages men have worked contrary to God, as did Balaam, because they have brought selfishness and covetousness into the work, leaving God out of their hearts and plans. The angelic agencies are represented as eager and longing to bring divine resources to human agencies for the conversion of souls that the Lord may be glorified. But there are many men and women who are not daily converted to God. They weave self and their own plans into the sacred work, and they are hindrances. God could bless consecrated human instrumentalities who are willing to let the divine influences use them to encircle the world, yet heaven waits while men get in the way of His work with their own plans and methods. God says, Take up the stumbling blocks; make room for me to work; prepare the way of the Lord and make his paths straight. \n                                              Ellen G. White",
