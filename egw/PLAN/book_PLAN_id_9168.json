    "word": "I received a letter from Brother Irwin stating that Dr. Kellogg has at last taken his position against Sister White, because she does not sustain him in the work he has carried to such extremes. John Wessels went to America and took his position fully with Dr. Kellogg. He has made statements in regard to our work and our surroundings in Cooranbong which have no foundation in truth. He has proved himself untrustworthy and thus the matter stands. It seems to be Minneapolis acted over again in Battle Creek. John Wessels carried the news that W.C. W. and A.G. Daniells had plans all devised that Elder Daniells should be president of the General Conference and W.C.W. secretary, also president of the Foreign Mission Board. There is not one thread of truth in these statements. Such a plan has never been so much as thought of. \n                                                                           1707",
