    "word": "God's servants are to resist sternly any deviation from righteous principles. Nehemiah took his stand decidedly against the first encroachment of man's rights. He had his own brother officers to meet, but he separated himself from them, and rebuked their plans to obtain control of everything. He stood as a reprover, frowning down their course, which was contrary to the Bible standard of righteousness. When urged to confederate with them, in their course of injustice, he gave a decided testimony, \"So did not I, because of the fear of God.\" \n                                              E. G. White \n     (July 2, '96.)",
