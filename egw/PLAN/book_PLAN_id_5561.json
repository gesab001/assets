Scene after scene is presented in symbols before me, and I find no rest until I begin to write out the matter. At the center of the work matters are being shaped so that every other institution is following in the same course. And the General Conference is itself becoming corrupted with wrong sentiments and principles. [SEE APPENDIX.] In the working of plans, the same principles are manifest that have controlled matters at Battle Creek for quite a length of time.",
