    "word": "God desires His people both to labor for those around them and to sustain the workers who are sent into new fields. Those who are living in comfortable homes, surrounded by kind friends, are not to tell the self-sacrificing workers who go into new fields, that they must make their work self-sustaining. Brother and sisters, remember that the missionaries whom you send to far-away lands often labor among enemies who constantly plan to hinder them in their work. Would it not be much better for the workers in the home field to sustain themselves, rather than to ask the brethren sent to mission fields where the truth is unknown to sustain themselves in spite of unfavorable surroundings?",
