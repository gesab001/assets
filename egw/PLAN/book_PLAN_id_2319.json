    "word": "At Dover we went on board a small steamer which took us across the English Channel. The weather was fine, and the channel was unusually smooth; but the waves that would have had no effect on the Cephalonia, tossed this little steamer about, and caused considerable sea-sickness. Our company suffered but little. At Calais we were to take a night train for Basle. Bro. Kellogg and William thought best to secure a berth for me in the sleeping car; but we were traveling with second-class tickets, and the only sleeping car on this train was a first-class coach. To exchange my ticket for first-class, and pay the additional expense for a berth in the sleeper, would cost eleven dollars. This, of course, we could not afford to pay. Fortunately, however, we secured to ourselves a compartment in a car that went through to Basle without change, and by a skillful arrangement of our satchels, bundles, and blankets converted our compartment into a sleeping car, and secured a degree of rest. The railroad builders of Europe have not planned, as have those in \n169\nAmerica, to prevent the comfort of travelers; and if you can secure plenty of room, you can make yourself quite comfortable for the night in these coaches that at first seem so strange and inconvenient. We could have slept quite well had it not been for the caretaking officials, who would throw open the door at many of the stations, and rattle off some information which we did not understand.",
