    "word": "Now, Edith, we do not want you to leave Battle Creek. . . . Do not be the least bit discouraged. Lighten up on your studies and take things easier. Be of good courage and do not let anything trouble you. You must write me fully in regard to yourself and your purposes; but we will see you in the course of two weeks. We feel a deep interest that you should succeed in your plans in regard to education. . . . If it is the will of God for you to remain in Battle Creek, He will preserve you. And if it is best for you to take things more moderately, and build up physically as well as mentally, God will bless and make your efforts successful.",
