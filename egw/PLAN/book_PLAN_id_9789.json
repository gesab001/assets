    "word": "4 - Our Attitude Toward the Work and Workers in the Southern Field\n\nSource: SpM pg. 278\n1902\n     The entering of Nashville by our workers was providential. When I visited this place, I was instructed that it was to become a center for the Southern work. Graysville and Huntsville are so near by that the institutions there can be helping hands to sustain the institutions in Nashville. Some of our brethren desired to begin the publishing work elsewhere, within their own borders; but this was not God\u2019s plan. There are to be memorials for God erected in cities. His work is not to be done in a corner, or simply at one or two points, like Graysville and Huntsville, but in many places and in a variety of ways.",
