    "word": "There have been presented before me scenes that often occurred in the Review and Herald office when Frank Belden had some plan \n\n120. \n\nthat he desired to carry out. He would determinedly stand up and with a loud voice continue to talk until he had fully presented his ambitious plans before his brethren; and I am sorry to say that very often these plans were adopted. He did more than any other one man in the office to bring in wrong sentiments and carry out his own plans. These plans, when afterward brought to bear upon himself, he did not find so agreeable. I feel sad when I think of the record he must meet of impetuous action and the surrender of those principles that his uncle James White and I have ever striven to maintain. Frank Belden has excellent talent, and had he walked humbly with his God, the Lord would have used him to His name's glory.",
