    "word": "The intoxicating craze for these investments originates with Satan. Thus he seeks to absorb the revenue which should be used to good advantage in God's work. We are safe only as our souls are sanctified by the truth. If the truth is planted in the heart by the Holy Spirit, God will make the discernment clear as to what is right and what is wrong. We have no confidence in a man who will preach to the congregation today, proclaiming solemn truth, and then yield tomorrow to the temptation of Satan to engage in land and mine speculations. The ungodly are lynx-eyed. They see that his conduct is wholly inconsistent with his teaching, and while their words are smooth and flattering, they despise him in their hearts. God wants His messengers to keep clear of everything of this character.",
