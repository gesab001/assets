    "word": "The cautions which God has given are to be regarded. Christ has said concerning His disciples, \"All ye are brethren.\" Every one is to give an account of himself to God. . . . Do not lay down any specified rules or prescribe any details as to how God's agents shall do their work. . . . The Teacher said, \"While you are so earnest to call to mind the details, the time that is of so great value has been consumed, . . . and the minds of the workers have been called to dwell upon non-essentials which should have been left for workers in the field to plan for themselves. . . . Many things that are too important to be set aside have been lightly dwelt upon, and many things that are of little consequence have been largely dwelt upon, when there is no reason why men should dictate concerning the matters they have laid out in detail.\"--Letter 53, 1894",
