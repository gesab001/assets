    "word": "During my stay in southern California, I was enabled to visit places that in the past have been presented to me by the Lord as suitable for the establishment of sanitariums and a school. For years I have been given special light that we are not to establish large centers for our work in the cities. The turmoil and confusion that fills these cities, the conditions brought about by the labor unions and the strikes, would prove a great hindrance to our work. Men are seeking to bring those engaged in the different trades under certain unions. This is not God's planning, but the planning of a power that we should in no case acknowledge. God's word is fulfilling; the wicked are binding themselves in bundles ready to be burned.",
