    "word": "Christ says, \"First cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\" The one who neglects to follow the directions of Christ, who accuses his brother without first going to him and talking the matter over with him, in the spirit of the Saviour, has a beam in his eye. He pays no attention to the remedy that Christ has given for the cure of dissension and strife. He does not go to the one he has condemned, telling him kindly what appears to be against his character. An explanation might clear away the difficulty, but he does not give the one he condemns an opportunity to make the explanation.",
