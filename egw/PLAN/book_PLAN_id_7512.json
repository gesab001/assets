    "word": "Relation of Ellen White to Administrators, Institutions, etc. \n     In regard to the Sanitarium, Brother Merrit Kellogg drew up the plan for the building. I was instructed by the Lord that the Sanitarium should not be a mammoth building, because there are other places where Sanitariums must be established. All these buildings must be erected in the most economical manner, that the most possible good may be done. In all our designs the expenditure of means must be carefully considered. We must be careful how we spend the money so essential to sustain the work in new fields, to commence and advance the work in places where the truth has never yet been represented. The question came up as to whether we should build the Sanitarium of brick or of wood. I said, \"Brethren, build it of wood. If you hear the patients discussing the matter, saying that wooden buildings are not safe on account of fire, tell them that wooden buildings are more healthful than brick buildings.\" I related the experience I had while living in brick and stone buildings in Rochester, N.Y., and in Preston, Melbourne.",
