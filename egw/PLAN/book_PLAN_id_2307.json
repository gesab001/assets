    "word": "The temptations of Satan are manifold; but those to which our attention is called in the text are unbelief and impatience. \u201cKnowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.\u201d Impatience, then, is the result of a lack of faith. \u201cBut let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.\u201d If we do not maintain the grace of patience, we shall never reach a state of perfection. Some of us have a nervous temperament, and are naturally as quick as a flash to think and to act; but let no one think that he cannot learn to become patient. Patience is a plant that will make rapid growth if carefully cultivated. By becoming thoroughly acquainted with ourselves, and then combining with the grace of God a firm determination on our part, we may be conquerors, and become perfect in all things, wanting in nothing.",
