    "word": "When the large food factory was erected in Los Angeles, the question was asked by One who knows the end from the beginning, \u201cWho will furnish the facilities necessary for the running of the business in this large building? Where is the talent necessary to operate such a plant? Where is the talent necessary to carry forward spiritual lines of work as they would have to be carried forward in order to produce the best results? There is danger that if this work is carried on as planned, workers, young and old, would be called in who would not \n66\nmaintain their spirituality. With the present clouded perception of righteousness, the way is open for injustice and selfishness to be shown, and this would provoke the wrath of God.\u201d",
