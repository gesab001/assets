    "word": "Dear Bro. I was shown that you make too many high and large calculations that you can never carry out. If you should attempt to follow your own plans you would make a total failure and would be driven to discouragement. You are not free from temptations and you feel very uneasy, because you cannot be doing some great work. Your mind is constantly upon the reach to engage in some work which you will certainly fail of accomplishing.",
