    "word": "Satan Is Allowed to Control.--Because men and women do not obey God, but choose their own way and follow their own perverted imagination, Satan is permitted to set up his hellish banner in their families and make his power felt through babes, children, and youth. His voice and will are expressed in the unsubdued wills and warped characters of the children, and through them he exerts a controlling power and carries out his plans. God is dishonored by the exhibition of perverse tempers, which exclude reverence for Him, and induce obedience \n                                                                           473\nto Satan's suggestions. The sin committed by parents in thus permitting Satan to bear sway is beyond conception.",
