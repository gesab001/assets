    "word": "Because of the stubbornness of Pharaoh, it was decided that the voice of God, in words of command, must demand that the Israelites be set free from their life of slavery. Pharaoh refused, and the Lord punished the kingdom because the earthly ruler would not let God\u2019s people go to become a kingdom under divine rulership. Pharaoh\u2019s refusal brought many plagues upon Egypt, until the stubborn king was impelled to concede to God\u2019s plan. And then he again hardened his heart in rebellion against God and sent his immense army to bring the Israelites back to continual service for the Egyptian ruler.",
