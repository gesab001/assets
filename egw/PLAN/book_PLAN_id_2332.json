    "word": "Great labor has been bestowed also on the paths up the mountain sides. There is nothing like them to be seen in America. They are made just wide enough for two mules to pass each other; not a foot of ground is wasted. On the upper side is a wall supporting the vineyard terrace, on the other, one that incloses the vine plantings. The paths are graveled hard, so that the rain may not wash them out, and they mount by regular zigzags to lessen the steepness of the ascent. Except the streams and mountains themselves, these \n224\nroads and mountain paths are, no doubt, more ancient than anything else which we look upon.",
