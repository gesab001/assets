    "word": "How startling is the proverb, \"As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined.\" This is to be applied to the training of our children. Parents, will you remember that the education of your children from their earliest years is committed to you as a sacred trust? These young trees are to be tenderly trained, that they may be transplanted to the garden of the Lord. Home education is not by any means to be neglected. Those who neglect it neglect a religious duty. \n\n\n                                    (Signed) Mrs. E. G. White \n\n(Copied July 30, 1897) \n\n\n                                 -95-",
