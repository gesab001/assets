    "word": "Waste of Time to Combat Sophistries.--I am instructed that we are not to enter into any controversy over the spiritualistic representations that are fast coming in from every quarter. Further than this, I am to give those in charge of our papers instruction not to publish in the columns of the Review and Herald, the Signs of the Times, or any other papers published by Seventh-day Adventists, articles attempting to explain these sophistries. We are in danger whenever we discuss the sophistries of the enemy. The publication of articles dealing with these sophistries is a snare for souls. Let these theories alone, and warn all not to read them. Your explanations will amount to nothing. \n\n\n                                                         225 \n\nLet the theories alone. Do not try to show the inconsistency or fallacy of them. Let them alone.",
