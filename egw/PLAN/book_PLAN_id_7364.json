    "word": "We had an invitation to take dinner with a merchant's wife. He does not keep the Sabbath. She is fully with us in the faith. Her name is Akman. They have a large, commodious house but built on the same plan as all houses are here, of logs. After the logs have settled they then board them up on the outside and have a very respectable-looking building. We were taken first into a room where we laid off our outer garments; then she gave me her arm and waiting upon me, taking me into a large dining hall which was very nicely and thoroughly furnished. Here I was seated on a sofa, and the next thing in order was the dinner.",
