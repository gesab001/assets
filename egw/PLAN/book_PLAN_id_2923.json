    "word": "God's Great Laws.--There are great laws that govern the world of nature, and spiritual things are controlled by principles equally certain. The means for an end must be employed if the desired results are to be attained. God has appointed to every man his work according to his ability. It is by education and practice that persons are to be qualified to meet any emergency which may arise, and wise planning is needed to place each one in his proper sphere that he may obtain an experience that will fit him to bear responsibility.--9T 221, 222 (1909). \n\n416",
