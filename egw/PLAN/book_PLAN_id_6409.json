    "word": "My brethren and sisters, when a camp-meeting is held, take pains to become acquainted with those who attend the meeting. Take a personal interest in their souls' salvation. If in no other way, you can give the truth to the people by handing them papers and pamphlets. And not only during the camp-meeting, but afterward in the neighborhood where you live, seek to gain access to souls. Get acquainted with your neighbors. O, how \n                                                                           4\nmany have never opened their lips to inquire of neighbors and friends if they would be willing to hear something of the truths for the time in which we are living! My brethren and sisters, study your plans. Grasp every opportunity of speaking to your neighbors and associates, or of reading something to them from books that contain present truth. Show that you regard as of first importance the salvation of the souls for whom Christ has made so great a sacrifice.",
