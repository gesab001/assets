    "word": "The natural traits of the human heart are always warring against the Spirit. The old man, not dead, will revive and have power to do mischief that will sink souls in ruin. Man has been building up the things he once destroyed. He has permitted himself to increase and Christ to decrease. He exalts his planning and devising as very wise, and Christ is left out of his counsel.",
