    "word": "\"The men who are placed in positions of responsibility are not to betray sacred trusts. I have a message for you to those who are serving self, but they will pass it by as though they heard it not. They will close their eyes, lest they see and be converted. They have been planning and contriving in their own human wisdom, and they do not seek God earnestly. But imbued and stimulated by the Spirit of God, you are to bear the message given you, without worrying or calculating the result.",
