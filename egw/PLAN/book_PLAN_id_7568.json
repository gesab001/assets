    "word": "I HAVE SUPPOSED THAT THIS SCHOOL QUESTION WAS THE SAME. THE IDEAL PLAN IS THAT THE MOTHER SHOULD BE THE TEACHER--AN INTELLIGENT TEACHER SUCH AN ONE AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED THIS MORNING. BUT I HAVE FELT THAT IT WAS A GREAT MISFORTUNE TO OUR CAUSE FROM MAINE TO CALIFORNIA, AND FROM MANITOBA TO FLORIDA, THAT OUR PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE THAT STATEMENT THAT THE CHILD SHOULD HAVE NO TEACHER BUT THE PARENT UNTIL IT IS EIGHT OR TEN YEARS OLD, AS A DEFINITE FORBIDDING OF THOSE CHILDREN TO HAVE SCHOOL PRIVILEGES. IF I UNDERSTAND IT, THAT IS REALLY THE QUESTION BEFORE US THIS MORNING.",
