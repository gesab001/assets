    "word": "We are to love our brethren as Christ has loved us. We are to be patient and kind, and yet there is something lacking--we must love. Christ tells us that we must forgive the erring even seventy times seven. . . . When there is much forgiven, the heart loves much. Love is a tender plant. It needs to be constantly cultured or it will wither and die.",
