Shall we not then feel excused from making further efforts for  them?\u201d By no means. Even if they shut the door in your face, do not hasten  away in indignation, and make no further effort to save them. Ask God in  faith to give you access to those very souls. Cease not your efforts; but  study and plan until you find some other means of reaching them. If you do  not succeed by personal visits, try sending them the silent messenger of  truth. There is so much pride of opinion in the human heart that our  publications often gain admittance where the living messenger cannot.",
