    "word": "God desires you to unite with your brethren in your work. If you do not do this, Satan will surely ensnare you. You will fall through the carrying out of your own plans and ideas. Success will not attend your efforts. You will reveal a spirit uncontrolled by God. If you continue to strive to be a distinct whole, refusing to cooperate with your brethren, working away from the directions God has given, you will bring ruin upon yourself. The sin will lie at your own door.",
