    "word": "Thursday, October 21, we held a meeting in the hall in the afternoon. Some could attend at that time who were not able to come in the evening. After I had spoken with freedom for about one hour we called Mr. Gilley, who was at liberty. He favored us with his company, conducting us to an interesting ancient castle and giving us an explanation of many things that attracted our attention on the way. Here it was our work to climb up many granite steps, then a more gradual ascent higher and higher until we reached the remains of the old castle. It had in its day covered a large space of ground, but the stones were estimated of so high value they were removed and used for the material for other buildings.",
