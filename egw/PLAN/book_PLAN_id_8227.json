    "word": "Here is our subject matter. \"Let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ\" [verses 10, 11]. Shall one draw apart from his brother for no other reason, only his own misconceived opinions? Would he not much better go apart for himself and think soundly what he is doing in estranging himself from his brethren? This is a much more inconsistent thing to persist in handling, for if he begins in self-confidence to build after certain notions of his own plans and his own desires, without reference to his brethren, he will bring in material and lay on the foundation a mass of suppositions of his own, which is only rubbish.",
