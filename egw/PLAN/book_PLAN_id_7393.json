    "word": "[At the General Conference session of 1903 held in Oakland, California, Ellen White spoke on Friday morning, April 3, on \"Our Duty to Leave Battle Creek.\" The sanitarium had burned on February 18, 1902, and was being rebuilt. The Review and Herald plant had been destroyed by fire on December 30, the same year--just three months before the General Conference session. It was a time when important decisions were being made. In her address she reviewed some of the high points of the history of the two institutions and pointed out some of the places where there had been a departure from following God's will. She then mentioned the difficulties which the labor unions would bring to our institutional work, and urged an away-from-the-city location for such work. An endeavor has been made in the excerpts which follow to catch the significant points of the broad presentation she made to the Conference as a setting for the reference to the labor unions near the close of the address.]",
