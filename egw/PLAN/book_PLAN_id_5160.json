    "word": "When the managers of a school find that it is not meeting running expenses, and debts are heaping up, they should act like levelheaded businessmen and change their methods and plans. When one year has proved that the financial management has been wrong, let wisdom's voice be heard. Let there be a decided reformation. Teachers may manifest a Christlike excellence in serious, solid thinking and planning to improve the state of things. They should enter heartily into the plans of the managers and share their burdens.",
