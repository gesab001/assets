    "word": "Now Brother S, let me speak to you in regard to Sister Harris. She has been a woman who has seen much sorrow, and I know that God \n\n\n                                   -385- \n\nhas worked for her. He has shown her favors and she has had a genuine experience in the things of God; and the suspicions expressed by yourself and others in reference to her some time ago, makes me feel very sad, because I do not think she deserves them. . . . You think she may not think everything her brethren in South Lancaster do is above criticism, and [her] not entering soul and spirit into every suggestion and plan has drawn upon her criticism and suspicion. I have great confidence in her for this, although she has made no complaints to me. Yet the words and the attitude of yourself, as well as others, toward her was, to say the least, not cordial. If there is a woman that loves and fears God, in South Lancaster, it is Sister Harris. If there is a woman I would fear to slight, or offend, because it would grieve the Spirit of God, it is Sister Harris. And those who would speak against her in any way to affect your feelings toward her, had better be on their knees before God, and get all that feeling out of their hearts, and not draw [away] from her, but come close to her, and show her sympathy and love. This changeable mood toward those who have been real pillars in the truth, I cannot see as bearing the divine stamp.--Letter 20, 1887, pp. 4,5. (To Brother S, January 14, 1887.)",
