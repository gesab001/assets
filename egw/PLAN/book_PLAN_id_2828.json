    "word": "Power of the Cross \n\n     Jesus Christ laid hold on humanity, that with His human arm He might encircle the race, while with His divine arm He grasped the throne of the Infinite. He planted His cross midway between earth and heaven, and said, \"I, if I be lifted up \n                                                                           138\nfrom the earth, will draw all men unto Me.\" The cross was to be the center of attraction.",
