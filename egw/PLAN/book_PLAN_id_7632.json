    "word": "If the curtain could be rolled back, and we could see how perseveringly Satan works to gain possession of the minds and souls of men, there would be less trifling, less pride, less human inventions, less self-sufficiency, and every soul would walk humbly and tremblingly before God. Especially would this be the case with those who voyage upon the great deep. Although there have been many things transpiring upon the Pitcairn that were offensive to God, and although Satan worked upon the imagination of human agents to cause them to pursue such a course that God would be compelled to give them up, yet the missionary vessel has been preserved upon the great deep. The working of Satan and the counter-working of God is the explanation of many things that \n\n\n                                    -200- \n\ntranspired upon the ship that were unexplainable to the minds of those on board.",
