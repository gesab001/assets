    "word": "Plans to Buy a Horse and Carriage: \n     I shall not go to any place to visit only for my own good to have a change. I shall have to rest more and I shall not go to any place if I can get along without it. I am now seeking to get a carriage, and if this horse is not so that we can drive him, I shall get one at once that we can drive. I shall ride every day after dinner. My health demands it.--Letter 21, 1876, p. 1. (To James White, May 5, 1876.)",
