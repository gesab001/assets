    "word": "\"Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor\" (1 Corinthians 3:8). God, and not man, is the judge of man's work, and He will apportion to each his just reward. It is not given to any human being to judge between the different servants of God. The Lord alone is the judge and rewarder of every good work.",
