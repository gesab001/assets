    "word": "I have been shown that home religion is the great need in every family. The home circle should be the center of the purest and most elevated affections. There peace, harmony, affection, and happiness should be cultivated every day. There the precious plant of love should be carefully cherished, that it may not die. Every plant that Satan has planted--jealousy, anger, envy, evil surmising, evil speaking, impatience, fretfulness, prejudice, vanity, covetousness, and selfishness--should be rooted up without delay. There is constant peril for the soul who nurtures these evil qualities, for they will bear a burden of evil fruit, whereby many will be defiled. These poisonous plants defile the soul and crowd out the precious flower of love.",
