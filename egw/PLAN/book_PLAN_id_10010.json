    "word": "When the question of our establishing a printing plant in the Southern states was being considered, I was shown that the very existence of the large educational institutions for colored people in Nashville made it a favorable place for the opening of our work; for in these schools lay opportunities for building up the cause of present truth. In failing to manifest an interest in the work of the colored schools, and to become acquainted with the work they were doing, an advantage was lost that might have been used to remove much prejudice. A judicious effort to open up to the teachers in these large institutions the principles and plans of our educational work, would have been productive of much good. Young men of firm principles should be selected to attend these schools, and watch for opportunities to drop the seeds of truth into the hearts of the teachers. And our missionaries could learn much in these institutions.",
