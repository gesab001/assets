    "word": "The holy principles that God has given are represented as the sacred fire, but common fire has been used in place of the sacred. Plans contrary to truth and righteousness are introduced in a subtle manner on the plea that this must be done, and that must be done, \"because it is for the advancement of the cause of God.\" But it is the devising of men that leads to oppression, injustice, and wickedness. The cause of God is \n\n\n                     - 17 - \n\nfree from every taint of injustice. It can gain no advantage by robbing the members of the family of God of their individuality or their rights. All such practises are abhorrent to God. He inspires no such practises as have been entered into by your councils in regard to the publication of books.",
