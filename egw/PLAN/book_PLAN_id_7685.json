    "word": "Today Mr. Moseley comes to bring oranges and lemon trees for us to set out. As soon as this work is done, we shall begin to plant vegetables. We have to get our groceries from Sydney, nearly a hundred miles away, or from Newcastle, twenty-two miles. But we hope soon to raise our own fruit and vegetables. Willie cannot be here, so I am here in his place, where I can oversee matters, and plan and consult with the workmen. I am called out from my routine of writing, yet I arise at half past one, at two, and three o'clock, and for a week have done considerable writing.--Letter 42, 1895, pp. 1-4. (To J. H. Kellogg, August 28, 1895.) \n\nReleased September 26, 1977.",
