    "word": "One of the divine plans for growth is impartation. The Christian is to gain strength by strengthening others. \u201cHe that watereth shall be watered also himself\u201d (Proverbs 11:25). This is not merely a promise; it is a divine law, a law by which God designs that the streams of benevolence, like the \n218\nwaters of the great deep, shall be kept in constant circulation, continually flowing back to their source. In the fulfilling of this law is the secret of spiritual growth. . . .",
