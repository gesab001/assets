    "word": "To Those in Council at Battle Creek, Michigan. \n\n                                 \"Elmshaven\", Sanitarium, Cal. \n                                       April 16, 1903. \n\nDear Brethren:-- \n     The members of the Medical Missionary and Benevolent Association, and the responsible men of the General Conference, are now to act in concert in regard to the work to be carried on. All must now awake and seek the Lord, lest the powers of the enemy shall obtain the victory. There are much greater depths of spiritual truth to be reached by experience. Christ will lead us to higher and still higher planes, where spiritual perception and spiritual action shall enter into unquestionable discoveries, and where the sacred truths of the gospel shall be understood in all their bearings.",
