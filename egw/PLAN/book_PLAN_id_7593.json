    "word": "Many youth should not be brought together in Battle Creek. Let no plans be laid for enlarging the work at Battle Creek. But the question remains, What shall be done for those who are there? It is certainly our plain duty to do our best to guard the young men and young women who are serving those who know not the Lord. Knowing that those who are trying to obey God will be brought into close connection with those who know not the truth, let faithful pastors and teachers work zealously to save the souls both of helpers and of patients.--Ms 112, 1903, pp. 1, 2. (\"The Work to be Done in Battle Creek,\" August 22, 1903.)",
