    "word": "This is a question that demands consideration by every parent, every teacher, every student\u2014by every human being, young or old.

Let the youth be taught to take eternity into their reckoning. Let them be taught to choose the principles and seek the possessions that are enduring\u2014to lay up for themselves that \u201ctreasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth\u201d (Luke 12:33). . . .",
