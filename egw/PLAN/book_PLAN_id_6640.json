    "word": "Bible cannot be taught in state schools. \n\n\n     \"If morality and religion are to live in a school, it must be through a knowledge of God's Word. Some may urge that if religious teaching is to be made prominent, our schools will become unpopular, that those who are not of our faith will not patronize the College. Very well, then, let them go to other colleges where they will find a system of education that suits their taste. Our school was established not merely to teach the sciences, but for the purpose of giving instruction in the great principles of God's Word, and in the practical duties of everyday life. This is the education so much needed at the present time. If a worldly influence is to bear sway in our school, then sell it out to worldlings, and let them take the entire control, and those who have invested their means in that institution will establish another school to be conducted, not upon the plan of popular schools, nor according to the desires of principal and teachers, but upon the plan which God has specified. . . . In the system of instruction used in the common schools, the most essential part of education is neglected; viz., the religion of the Bible. Education not only affects to a great degree the life of the students in this world, but its influence extends to eternity.\"--Test. 31, pp. 21, 24.",
