    "word": "Unwarranted Excuses \n\n     When Jesus went away, He left to every man his work, and \"nothing to do\" is an unwarrantable excuse. \"Nothing to do\" is the reason of trial among the brethren; for Satan will fill the minds of idlers with his own plans, and set them to work. . . . \"Nothing to do\" brings evil testimony against the brethren, and dissension into the church of Christ. Jesus says, \"He that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\"--Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.",
