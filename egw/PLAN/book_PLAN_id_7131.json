    "word": "This is the very work that Christ did. He traveled from place to place, and labored for souls. And who was he?--The One equal with the Father. The Lord Jesus has set us an example. As you engage in school work in these needy communities, do not let any man come in to discourage you by saying, \"Why do you spend your time in this way? Why not do a larger and more important work in a broader field?\" Some, it is true, must plan to look forward to the time when they will do a large work in response to general calls; but who will attend to the highways? Who will go into the hedges? There are those that Christ will move upon, and they will see the necessity of entering neglected portions of the vineyard. They will delight to open the Scriptures to those that are in darkness and do not understand the truth. This is the very work that is to be done. Let \n\n\n                    -5- \n\nevery one of us stand in our lot and in our place. And if there are those whom the Lord moves upon to give themselves to the neglected portions of the vineyard, let no man seek to turn them away from their appointed work. If those who know the truth, conceal from others the great light that has shined into their own hearts, they are held accountable for neglecting their duty.",
