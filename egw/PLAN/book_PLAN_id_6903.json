    "word": "Nearly five years ago, when we were searching for a site on which to locate a training-school near-Nashville, we visited this plantation that was afterward secured; and I remember that when we first saw the place, we planned to go over it in carriages, some in one direction, and some in another, and we looked to God to impress our minds as to whether this were the place He wished us to choose for a training-center. For a time, the prospect looked forbidding; nevertheless, the plantation was secured, and the work was begun. The Lord would have the influence of this school widely extended by means of the establishment of small mission schools in needy settlements in the hills, where consecrated teachers may open the Scriptures to hungry souls, and let the light of life shine forth to those that are in darkness.",
