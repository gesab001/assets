    "word": "\"And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one\" [verse 22]. Think of the possibilities contained in these words. Christ never requires of us more than we can accomplish with the power that He will freely give us. As we go from place to place, shall we not go clothed with the garments of His righteousness? He bids us cherish His pitying tenderness, His \n\n\n                  -264- \n\nlove, that every difference, every barrier that separates soul from soul, may be broken down. Let every one plant his feet on the platform of eternal truth, and then ask God to fill his heart with the love which dwelt in the heart of Christ. We cannot afford to place stumbling blocks in the way of anyone. We cannot afford to have placed to our account by the great Judge of all, any occasion of stumbling, over which someone has fallen.",
