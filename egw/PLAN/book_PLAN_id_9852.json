    "word": "Those who have been in the habit of telling everything they see and hear need to be converted on this point. If those connected with the home see any change made, they are not required to think that the Lord has made them daily bulletins. Do not think it your duty to carry everything you see and hear to others. They will take it to their homes, and comment upon it, and then pass the dish to someone else. If, after consultation with the other teachers, the matron makes some changes in the home plans, these changes are told by those who feel it no harm to pour forth everything that they think they know. Children that are educated to relate everything they see, which takes place at the table and in the classes, will forfeit the confidence of their teachers, by communicating to others their parcel of nonsense. \n\n\n                                  -77-",
