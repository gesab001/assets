    "word": "Essential Qualifications for Management \n\n     Our health institutions are of value in the Lord's estimation only when He is allowed to preside in their management.

God cannot endorse any institution unless it teaches the living principles of His law and brings its own actions into strict conformity to these precepts. Upon those institutions that are not maintained according to His law He pronounces the sentence, \"Unaccepted; weighed in the balances of the sanctuary and found wanting.\"",
