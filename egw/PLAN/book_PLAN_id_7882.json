    "word": "God Desires Mental Improvement in His Workers--God desires His workers to gain daily a better understanding of how to reason logically from cause to effect, arriving at wise, safe conclusions. He desires them to add to their strength of memory. We cannot afford to make mistakes that are the result of our cherishing erroneous ideas. As little children we are to sit at the feet of Christ, learning of Him how to work successfully. We are to ask God for a sound judgment, and for light to impart to others. There is need of knowledge that is the fruit of experience. We should not allow a day to pass without gaining an increase of knowledge in temporal and spiritual things. We are to plant no stakes that we are not willing to take up and plant farther on, nearer the heights we hope to ascend. The highest education is to be found in training the mind to advance day to day.--Letter 164, 1903, p. 4. (To Those in Charge of the Wahroonga Sanitarium, July 29, 1903.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. October 1, 1980",
