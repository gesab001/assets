    "word": "A Time For Prayer--Be sure to pray and counsel together before laying your plans, and then, in the Spirit of Christ, push the work unitedly.  If one of your number decides that he cannot cooperate with his brethren, and has no desire to work because of differences of opinion, the course to be pursued is without a question.  Humble yourselves before God and resort to prayer, for you cannot and must not attempt to work at variance.",
