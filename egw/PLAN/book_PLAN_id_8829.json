    "word": "I have so great an interest to see Dr. Kellogg following on to know the Lord, that I shall try to do my utmost to remove every shadow that might cause him to walk in strange paths. I shall listen to every word that he has to say to me. If he speaks right words, I shall thank my heavenly Father. If he speaks words, the truth concerning which I know much better than he himself, I shall never try to please him by calling darkness light and light darkness; for by so doing I should be imperilling his soul. If I speak at all, I shall always try to speak the truth, --that which is based on a \"Thus saith the Lord\". Whatever interpretation may be placed upon my words, or whether they are received or rejected, I shall not refrain from speaking, unless I am instructed by the Lord to remain silent. When certain things come to pass I must speak in order to prevent wrong plans from being carried any further. And I must speak not only to Dr. Kellogg, but also to other men in positions of responsibility who are unacquainted with the facts and with the result of a disregard of the messages that God has given.",
