    "word": "The Lord values his children. He would have them happy, not suffering. The system must have nourishment. Your food need not be measured; you have an observing mind, study the foods you can best assimilate. But that which is of the greatest importance is regularity and simplicity in your diet. Do not have a starvation diet, but do not take a variety at one meal. Get the very best things, if they cost you more, and eat not more than two or three articles at a meal. Two is better. Then there will not be so much quarrelling going on in your stomach. Some have tried to keep a precise measurement of the food \n\n\n                                    - 21 - \n\nthey eat. This keeps the mind upon themselves, and is fully as bad as eating too much. You must try to govern your eating. It will be a difficult matter for you to follow this plan when you go to other places as you have to do. But eat a plain food. Do not drop out the third meal but eat light food. This will call the blood from the brain. Many who eat the third meal would be better without it, but there are cases where three light meals are better than two full meals.",
