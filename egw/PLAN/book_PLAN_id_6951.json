Other Branches. \n\n     Manual Training.--This education, in felling trees, tilling the soil, erecting buildings, as well as in literature, is the education our youth should each seek to obtain. Further on, a printing-press should be connected with our school, in order to educate in this line. Tent-making also should be learned. There are also many things which the lady students may be engaged in. There is cooking, dressmaking, and gardening to be done. Strawberries should be planted, plants and flowers cultivated. This the lady students may be called out of doors to do. Thus they may be educated to useful labor. Bookbinding also, and a variety of trades, should be taken up. These will not only be putting into exercise brain, bone, and muscle, but will also be gaining knowledge. The greatest curse of our world in this, our day, is idleness. It leads to amusements merely to please and gratify self. The students have had a superabundance of this way of passing their time: they are now to have a different education, that they may be prepared to go forth from the school with an all-round education. \n\n\n                      -26-",
