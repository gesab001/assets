    "word": "The Lord gave you your work, not to be done in a rush, but in a calm, considered manner. The Lord never compels hurried, complicated movements. But you have gathered to yourself responsibilities that the Lord, the merciful Father, did not place upon you. Duties He has never ordained, chase each other wildly. Never are His servants to leave one given duty marred or incomplete in order to seize hold of another. He who labors in the calmness of the fear of God does not do work in a haphazard manner, for fear something will hinder an anticipated plan, if he does not rush it through.",
