    "word": "\"The men who will give themselves to the great work of teaching the truth are not the men who will be bribed with wealth or frightened by poverty. But God would have His delegated servants constantly improving. In order for the work to be carried with efficiency, the Lord sent forth His disciples forward two and two. . . . No one man's ideas, one man's plans, are to have a controlling power in carrying forward the work. . . . One is not to stand apart from the other, and argue his own ways and plans; for he may have an education in a certain direction, and possess certain traits of character, which will be detrimental to the interests of the work if allowed to become the controlling power. \n                                                                           303",
