    "word": "I regret that these men have been so dependent on Dr. Kellogg. I am sorry that, as a wise general, he has not trained them to be self-reliant, and has not refused to do their thinking and brain work, that they might have obtained an experience which today would be more valuable to them than gold. God does not demand of Dr. Kellogg such taxing service, even in the most important enterprises. He has been successful in his plans, because he would not be defeated. If the  brethren connected with him had faced stubborn difficulties and seen them give way before them because their courage would not be daunted, nor their energy wearied, they might have thus obtained an experience that would be of value to them through all time and  through eternity. There is no need that there should be so many helpless souls who will sink before difficulties. \n\n\n                           -22-",
