    "word": "Delegate Responsibility \n     Satan is very active, and with cunning plans he is seeking to deceive a leader that ought to be a faithful steward of means and of souls. Let this man cease accumulating so many burdens that the Lord has not placed upon him--burdens that will hinder him from studying the plan of God concerning him. Let him not continue to follow his own plans and load himself with many burdens that the Lord has not appointed him to bear.",
