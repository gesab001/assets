    "word": "You mention the school. I pray the Lord that he will stand at the head of the school as principal, and that all may work under His divine guidance. If the Lord's will is done, students will not be encouraged to remain in the school for years. This is the devising of man, not the plan of God. Those who come to this school, if they put their minds into studying the Book of all books, will, through prayer and close, deep research, obtain in a much shorter period of time a knowledge of Bible education. They will learn of Jesus in the school of Christ. The years of study of those books which should not be made study books, unfits students for the work to be done in this important period of this earth's history. One young man, after five years' study, has come from the school unfitted to teach or preach. He has to unlearn and unload a mass of rubbish which will disqualify him for efficiency in any line of the work to be done for this time.",
