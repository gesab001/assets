    "word": "Plans have been drawn up by a competent architect for a two-story addition in the form of an L, which will provide more kitchen room, a helpers' dining-room, eleven more bedrooms for patients, an operating room, physicians' offices, and complete, roomy bath rooms. I am in harmony with the plans for this addition. The treatment-rooms are practically outside the present main building, and yet are connected with it. They are to be provided with every facility for giving thorough treatment.",
