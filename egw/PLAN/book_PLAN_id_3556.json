    "word": "Pacific Press and Foreign Publications.--I approve of the efforts that have been made to establish our German and Scandinavian publishing work at College View. [AFTER THE REVIEW AND HERALD PLANT BURNED, IN 1902, THE PRINTING OF FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS WAS MOVED TO THE COLLEGE PRESS, COLLEGE VIEW, NEBRASKA, AND LATER THE WORK WAS CARRIED ON UNDER THE NAME INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING ASSOCIATION. THIS ASSOCIATION WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING ASSOCIATION IN 1915, BUT THE BUILDING IT OCCUPIES WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE IN 1916, AND A FACTORY WAS BUILT AT BROOKFIELD, ILLINOIS. THERE THE WORK CONTINUED UNTIL IT WAS TRANSFERRED IN 1959 TO THE HOME OFFICE OF THE PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING ASSOCIATION AT MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA.--SDAEN 983.] I hope that plans will be devised for the encouragement and strengthening of this work.",
