    "word": "Now the question for us to decide is, Shall we have connection with Christ and the Father? Shall we accept the help needed? Shall we enter the blood-stained path that our Saviour trod? Heaven has been opened before us. Christ has been accepted by the Father, and if we will comply we can be accepted also. The plan of salvation has been laid for the human race and they need not be discouraged. Help has been laid on one that is mighty to save. The gates of heaven are ajar to the children of men, to the weakest ones, the ones that need a Saviour the most. When our Saviour ate with the publicans the Pharisees complained and would make capital of this. Christ's reply was, \"I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\" Matthew 9:13.",
