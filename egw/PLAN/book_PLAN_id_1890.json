    "word": "All should be taught to do what they can for the Master; to render to him according as he has prospered them.

His resources are infinite, and he employs them all in accomplishing his will. And when he sees a faithful performance of duty in the payment of the tithe, he often, in his wise providence, opens ways whereby it shall increase.",
