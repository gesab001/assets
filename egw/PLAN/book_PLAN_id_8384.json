    "word": "Now, this very work has been going on at the Health Retreat, and shall a few carry the heavy load and all else be spectators? Shall there be none who will feel an interest in every part of God's plans and His instrumentalities, because there have been men and women who by their want of devotion and piety have imperiled the cause and work of God--men and women who have been so circumstanced that they have developed character and revealed that all was not gold but dross and tin? Shall not this be the time when all who are in connection with God shall come to the front and show their colors? Shall it be seen that men and women step back and show no interest, no zeal, no earnest effort, when help is needed? When the car drags heavily, then is the time for everyone to push, put shoulders to the wheels, and not stand back giving orders, or accusing the ones who are trying to push the load, or criticizing everything they do, because it is not done in their way and after their ideas.",
