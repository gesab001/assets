    "word": "Consider the incident which Christ presented before Nicodemus in referring to the uplifted serpent. The Lord Jesus had protected the children of Israel from the venomous serpents in the wilderness, but this part of their history they did not know. Angels from heaven had accompanied them, and in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, Christ had been their protection through all their journeyings. But they became selfish and discontented, and in order that they might not forget his great care over them, the Lord Jesus gave them a bitter lesson. He permitted them to be bitten by the fiery serpents, but in his great mercy he did not leave them to perish. Moses was bidden to make and lift the brazen serpent on the pole, and make the proclamation that whosoever should look upon it should live. And all who looked did live. They recovered health at once. Suppose ye that this life-giving message, the invitation to look upon the representation of Christ, was given in whispered tones? Suppose ye that there were meetings for discussion as to how the symbol of the brazen \n\n\n                       -49- \n\nserpent could have any efficacy? Some hesitated, desiring a scientific explanation, but no light was given. They must accept the words given by Christ to Moses. It was proclaimed with the trumpet, and by the leading men of every tribe throughout the encampment. The word obeyed, would bring life and healing.",
