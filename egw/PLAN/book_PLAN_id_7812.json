    "word": "MR No. 740 - Ellen White's Helpers, Marian Davis and Fannie Bolton\n\n     Marian Davis and Plans for Publishing the Conflict Series.--We are pressing with all our might the Volume 4 [The Great Controversy] to its completion. The printers are driving us fast, and I believe we shall have hard work to keep up with them. I have next the Volume 1 [Patriarchs and Prophets] to get out, then to revise Volumes 2 and 3 [The Desire of Ages]. If the dear Lord will help me, I shall be able to do this work. Marian has a heavy load upon her. She seems to stand it well as yet, but at times the pressure comes quite severe on her, poor child. She works real hard.--Letter 25, 1888, p 4. (To S. N. Haskell and William Ings and wife, February 13, 1888.)",
