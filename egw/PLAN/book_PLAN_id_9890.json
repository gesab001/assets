    "word": "The Great Teacher came from heaven to plant in this world trees of light. He calls on nature to reflect to human minds the light that floods the threshold of heaven, that men and women may obey his word. And nature does the bidding of the Creator. To the heart softened by the grace of God, the sun, the moon, the stars, the lofty trees, the flowers of the field, utter their words of counsel and advice. The sowing of the seed carries the mind to spiritual seed-sowing. The tree stands forth declaring that a good tree can not bear evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bear good fruit. \"Ye shall know them by their fruits.\" Even the tares have a lesson to teach. They are of Satan's sowing, and if left unchecked, spoil the wheat by their rank growth.",
