    "word": "\"I dare not advise you in such large plans as you propose. You need to make the Lord your wisdom in these matters. I do not feel that you should plan for such large outlay of means unless you have some certainty that you can meet your obligations. I would caution you against gathering a large load of indebtedness. There is the food factory to be completed and set in operation. I call your attention to this enterprise, that you may not lay more plans than you will carry out.",
