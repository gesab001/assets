    "word": "Men whom the Lord calls to important positions in His work are to cultivate a humble dependence upon Him. They are not to seek to embrace too much authority, for God has not called them to a work of ruling, but to plan and counsel with their fellow-laborers. Every worker alike is to hold himself amenable to the requirements and instructions of God.",
