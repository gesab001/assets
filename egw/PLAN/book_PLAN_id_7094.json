    "word": "When our brethren in Battle Creek began to value the labors of Bro. Bell as a teacher, some gave free expression of their appreciation of his qualifications, because they knew he had not been properly respected. \n                                                                           6\nThese things had a tendency to give Bro. Bell confidence in his own ability, until he cherished exalted views of himself. Finally, Bro. Bell could hardly endure to have his course questioned, or suggestions made of plans which he did not originate, or which differed from his ideas. The opinions of brethren and sisters of long experience were not respected by Bro. Bell, but set aside as unworthy of attention. Bro. Bell became exacting, and was extremely sensitive over little things; especially if any disrespect was shown of his authority on the part of his pupils.",
