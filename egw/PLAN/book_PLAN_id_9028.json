    "word": "The rainbow above the throne is the bow of promise, testifying to the whole world that God will never forget his people in their struggle against evil. Let Jesus be our theme. Let us by pen and voice present, not only the commandments of God, but the faith of Jesus. This will promote real heart-piety as nothing else can. While we present the fact to men that they are subjects of a divine moral government, their reason will declare to them that this is truth, that they owe allegiance to Jehovah, and that this life is our time of probation. In this life we are placed under the discipline and government of God to form characters and acquire habits for the higher life. All the scenes in which we must act a part, are to be carefully studied; for they are a part of our education, a part of God's great plan. We should bring solid timbers into our character building: for we are working both for this life and the eternal life. And as we near the close of this earth's history, we either rapidly advance in Christian growth, or we rapidly retrograde toward the world.",
