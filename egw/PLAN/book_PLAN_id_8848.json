    "word": "I copy out of my diary the following words, written November 28, 1902: \"Oh how sad it is that man will allow himself to be so wrought upon by the enemy that he will dare venture to exalt his finite judgment in opposition to  God's plans and purposes! Once \n\n\n                                -74- \n\nthe Doctor would present his plans to me, to ascertain if I had any counsel to give, but not a word of counsel has he asked of me, to find out whether his plans are in accordance with the light God has given me.",
