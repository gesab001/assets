    "word": "(MS-105-'09) Mrs. E. G. White: \"We want none of that kind of higher education, that will put us in a position where the credit must be given, not to the Lord God of Israel, but to the God of Ekron. The Lord designs that we shall stand as a distinct, sanctified and holy people, so connected with Him that He can work with us. Let our physicians realize that they are to depend wholly upon the true God. I felt a heavy burden this morning, when I read over the letter that I found in my room, in which a plan was outlined for having medical students take some work at Loma Linda, but to get the finishing touches of their education from some worldly institution. God forbid that such a plan should be followed. I must state that the light I have received is, that we are to stand as a distinct, commandment-keeping people. The Sabbath is the great distinguishing line, and its observance will separate us from the world. As God's peculiar people, we should not feel that we must acknowledge our dependence upon men who are transgressing God's law, to give us influence in the world. It is God that gives us influence. He is our exceeding great reward. He will give us advantages that are far beyond all the advantages that we might receive from worldlings by uniting with those who do not recognize the Law of God.\"",
