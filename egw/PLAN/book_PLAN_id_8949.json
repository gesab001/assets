Larson\n\n                                              L-18d-1890 \n                                           March 6, 1890. \n\nDear Brother Larson,--- \n     Since our conversation I have felt urged by the Spirit of the Lord to write to you. I had hoped that I should not be compelled to give any personal testimony in this meeting, but that the Lord would require me only to dwell upon general principles. In the interview with you, I sought to say nothing that would agitate or stir up your mind, and I had hoped that the words addressed to those assembled in the ministers' meeting would have a different result than they have had. I now see that your call upon me, was to utter complaint against me. You say, \"While I shall accept your explanation that you intended nothing against me, the manner in which you spoke to me, and the response you made, when I explained to you why I was smiling, i.e. that if the illustration fits you, take it' seems to have left the impression that I had done something that I ought not to have done, and this made it necessary that you should give me a public rebuke, and in a rather keen manner upon the minds of those who were present.\"",
