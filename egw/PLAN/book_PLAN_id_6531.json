    "word": "Perils of this Time. \n\n     Satan is busily laying his plans for the last mighty conflict, when all will take sides. After the gospel has been proclaimed in the world for nearly two thousand years, Satan still presents to men and women the same scene that he presented to Christ. In a wonderful manner he causes the kingdoms of the world in their glory to pass before them. These he promises to all who will fall down and worship him. He claims to be the Prince of heaven, he presents before men entrancing views of the kingdom of God, and claims that these are views of his kingdom. Thus he works to bring men under his dominion.",
