    "word": "PH153 - Special Testimony on Canvassing for Christ's Object Lessons\n\n\n     There are in the divine providence, particular periods when we must rise in response to the call of God and make use of our means, our time, our intellect, our whole being, body, soul, and spirit, in fulfilling his requirements to the utmost of our ability. The present is such a time as this. The cause of God is at stake. His institutions are in peril, and because of the terrible burden of debt under which they are struggling, the work is hindered on every side. Just now, in our great necessity, God has made a way through difficulty, and invites us to co-operate with him in accomplishing this purpose. It is his plan that the book, \"Christ's Object Lessons,\" be given for the relief of our schools, and he calls upon all who love the truth, to do their part in placing this book before the world. In this he is testing his people and his institutions, to see if they will work together and be of one mind in self-denial and self-sacrifice.",
