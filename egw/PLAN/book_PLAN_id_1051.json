    "word": "That education alone which brings the student into close relation with the Great Teacher is true education. The youth are to be taught to look to Christ as their guide. They are to be taught lessons of forbearance and trust, of true goodness and kindness of heart, of perseverance and steadfastness. Their characters are to answer to the words of David: \"That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as cornerstones, polished after the similitude of a palace.\" Psalm 144:12.",
