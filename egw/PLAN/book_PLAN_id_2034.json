    "word": "A thousand years before, the psalmist had magnified God's favor to Israel in making her holy house his dwelling-place: \u201cIn Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling-place in Zion.\u201d [Psalm 76:2.] He \u201cchose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved. And he built his sanctuary like high palaces.\u201d [Psalm 78:68, 69.] The first temple had been erected during the most prosperous period of Israel's history. Vast stores of treasure for this purpose had been collected by King David, and the plans for its construction were made by divine inspiration. [1 Chronicles 28:12, 19.] Solomon, the wisest of Israel's monarchs, had completed the work. This temple was the most magnificent building which the world ever saw. Yet the Lord had declared by the prophet Haggai, concerning the second temple, \u201cThe glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former.\u201d \u201cI will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d [Haggai 2:9,7.]",
