    "word": "Says Christ, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" John 16:12. \n     \"'Ye cannot bear them now.' What tenderness \n       Breathes in this language! Well does it express \n       Thy principle of teaching. 'Here and there \n       A little,' is the plan Thou dost pursue; \n       Waiting until our feeble sight can bear \n       The truths which love unfolds before our view. \n       The gentleness of Christ! Lord, should not we \n       In teaching others strive to act like Thee? \n       Patient, not hasty, toward those who learn \n       But slowly in Thy school; who seem to need \n       Line upon line before they can discern \n       The hallowed lessons we so plainly read.\"",
