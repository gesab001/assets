    "word": "The position taken by the workers in Nashville in regard to the planning of the work there is approved by God. The Lord is not in the unfavorable propositions which have been presented. God's purposes are contrary to the supposition of men. I have been watching with intense interest the movements made in the South. The rebuke of God is upon these who in the past have brought forward propositions that have caused the work in the South to be greatly hindered, so that it is far behind where it should be. This work would have been far in advance if the men in sacred office had been controlled by the Holy Spirit.",
