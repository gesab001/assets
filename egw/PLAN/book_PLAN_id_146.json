    "word": "\"The Redemption of the Purchased Possession.\"-- God's original purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled as it is made the eternal abode of the redeemed. \"The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.\" The time has come to which holy men have looked with longing since the flaming sword barred the first pair from Eden--the time for \"the redemption of the purchased possession.\" The earth originally given to man as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty foe, has been brought back by the great plan of redemption.",
