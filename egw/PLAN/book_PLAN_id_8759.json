    "word": "The Lord wants every father and mother to work for their own household. He wants the converting power of God to be in your own families. He does not want you to let Satan plant his hellish banner right in your family, and you bow to that banner. He wants you to take your place as fathers and mothers. He wants you to teach your children concerning the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment and walk humbly with God.",
