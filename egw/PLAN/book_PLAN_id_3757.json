FOR OTHER SUGGESTIONS SEE EVANGELISM, PP. 184-199, 217-278.--COMPILERS.]\n\n                     INTRODUCTION \n                                               -\n \n     AS IN THE YEAR 1933 THE GENERAL CONFERENCE LEADERSHIP MADE PLANS FOR STRONG EVANGELISTIC EMPHASIS AND EFFORT THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA, IT WAS REALIZED THAT IF LARGE OBJECTIVES WERE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED, THE MINISTERS WHO STOOD BEFORE THE PEOPLE MUST TURN FROM SUBJECTS OF MINOR IMPORTANCE TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE THIRD ANGEL'S MESSAGE IN ITS BROAD AND GRIPPING PHASES. AT THE REQUEST OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE A SIXTEEN-PAGE PAMPHLET ENTITLED \"PREACH THE WORD,\" CONTAINING ELLEN G. WHITE COUNSELS, WAS PUBLISHED. GREAT GOOD WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE MANY THOUSANDS OF COPIES DISTRIBUTED, CHARGING THE MINISTRY ANEW WITH THE SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY OF PROCLAIMING THE LAST JUDGMENT-HOUR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD. THOSE PORTIONS NOT IN OTHER E. G. WHITE BOOKS ARE INCLUDED IN PERMANENT FORM HERE. THE STATEMENTS PRINTED DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXHAUSTIVE COMPILATION OF WHAT ELLEN WHITE HAS WRITTEN ON THIS SUBJECT. ADDITIONAL COUNSEL MAY BE FOUND IN THE BOOKS EVANGELISM, GOSPEL WORKERS, TESTIMONIES TO MINISTERS, AND CHRISTIAN SERVICE.",
