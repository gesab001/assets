They failed to make the Christians yield, and they agreed to another plan. I saw them lower their banner, and they approached that firm Christian company, and made  propositions to them. At first their propositions were utterly refused. Then I saw the Christian company consulting together. Some said  that they would lower the banner, accept the propositions, and save their lives, and at last they could gain strength to raise their banner among those heathen idolaters. But some would not yield to this plan, but firmly chose to die holding their banner, rather than lower it. Then I saw many of that Christian company lower the banner, and unite with the heathen; while the firm and steadfast seized the banner, and bore it high again. I saw individuals  continually leaving the company of those bearing the pure banner, and joining the idolaters, and they united together under the black banner, to persecute those bearing the white banner, and many were slain; yet the white banner was held high, and individuals were raised up to rally around it.",
