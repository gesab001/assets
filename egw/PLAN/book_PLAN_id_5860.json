    "word": "Disobedience has closed the door to a vast amount of knowledge that might have been gained from the Word of God. Understanding means obedience to God\u2019s commandments. Had men and women been obedient, they would have understood the plan of God\u2019s government. The heavenly world would have opened its chambers of grace and glory for exploration. Human beings would have been altogether different from what they are now, in form, in speech, in song; for by exploring the mines of truth, they would have been ennobled. The mystery of redemption, the incarnation of Christ, His atoning sacrifice, would not be, as they are now, vague in our minds. They would have been not only better understood, but altogether more highly appreciated.",
