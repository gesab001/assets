    "word": "Men whom the Lord calls to important positions in His work are to cultivate humble dependence upon Him. They are not to seek to embrace too much authority; for God has not called them to a work of ruling. But to plan and counsel with their fellow laborers. Every worker alike is to hold himself amenable to the requirements and instructions of God.",
