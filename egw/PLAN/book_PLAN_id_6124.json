    "word": "Purchasing Wood From Needy Farmers.--Poverty is so widespread in the colonies that starvation is staring many in the face, and the strangest part of the matter is that the farmers seem so perfectly helpless to devise plans by which to turn their time and money to account. . . . We purchase wood from our brethren who are farmers, and we try to give their sons and daughters employment. But we need a large charitable fund upon which to draw to keep families from starvation. Those who need our help are not of the tramp order, but are men who have earned in prosperous times as high as twenty and forty dollars per week. . . . I divided my household stores of provisions with families of this sort, sometimes going eleven miles to relieve their necessities.--Letter 89a, 1894.",
