    "word": "There Must Be a Manager \n\n\n     Of all places, health institutions should not depend chiefly upon the physicians as directors. They need all-sided men, of impartial judgment, to plan and execute. The Board is not to let things go in a haphazard way; \n                                                                           69\nfor something results from all our movements. There must be a manager at the Health Retreat, or it will become demoralized. Letter 71, 1896, p. 6. (To Brother and Sister Maxson, August 12, 1896.)",
