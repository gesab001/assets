    "word": "What my future course may be the Lord knows. He hangs a mist before my eyes that I shall only see the present, and I am content it should be thus. I am resting in the love of God with a peaceful trust and a happy assurance. I am not worrying about the future. I know the Lord will do all things well. I am always inclined to look ahead and make plans, but I have committed myself to God and all that I am into His hands. I am ready now to go to California any time the Lord may direct, ready to go to Australia or go to Europe, or any place in the world the Lord may see fit to send me. [LESS THAN 11 MONTHS LATER ELLEN WHITE LEFT SAN FRANCISCO FOR AUSTRALIA.] I am His property and I lean heavily upon the arm of God. It is strong and will bear me up.",
