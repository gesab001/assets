    "word": "You have, I have been shown, neglected large responsibilities, while you bring your mind to embrace small matters which others could and should do equally as well as yourself.  But the loss of a few pennies in any enterprise seems to you so large and would grieve you so sorely, that you feel that you must have everything under your inspection; therefore much good and great work is neglected for things of minor consequence.  You should have been engaged in broader plans and the execution of them, keenly observant of any talent or influence that you could obtain to bring into service.--Letter 40, 1879, pp. 1, 5",
