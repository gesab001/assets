    "word": "(Extract from letter to Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell, written from \"Cooranbong, N. S. W., Oct. 24, 1899,\" and signed by Mrs. E. G. White.) \n\n\n     I have had conversation with W. C. White, and made a proposition to him, that I would give the royalty on my coming book, \"The Parables,\" if the Review and Herald and the Pacific Press would donate their press work, and making of the books in neat, saleable style, and let all the avails be used to help relieve the debts upon our schools. This book will never grow old, and the avails shall go to the schools everywhere to help them. I thought this movement on my part would provoke others to self-denial and to benevolence and mercy, to take right hold of this matter and get out \n                                                                           18\n\"The Parables\" to do this work. Well, the Lord is, I believe, willing to help us in this work. I shall only draw upon the books to give some to the poor that can not buy. W. C. White enters into this plan with great satisfaction. Of course we have not time to get this all before you in definiteness as we will when we have time. . . .",
