    "word": "Too Many Illustrations in The Desire of Ages. [THE FIRST SUBSCRIPTION EDITION OF THE DESIRE OF AGES, PUBLISHED IN 1898, THE YEAR BEFORE THE ABOVE TESTIMONY WAS WRITTEN, WAS LAVISHLY ILLUSTRATED AND ITS PURCHASE BEYOND THE POCKETBOOK OF THE AVERAGE MAN. IT WAS ELLEN WHITE'S INTENTION THAT THE DESIRE OF AGES SHOULD BE PLACED IN EVERY HOME. AND THIS COULD NOT BE WHEN THE PRICE OF THE BOOK WAS SO HIGH.]--It is too late, altogether too late, to depend upon the expensive covers of a book, or its abundant illustrations, for its sale. It is enough, without any explanation, to say that God has not inspired this enthusiasm regarding illustrations. Had I the Desire of Ages to publish now, the showing would be entirely different. The books that the people need should be issued free from all display. The saving of the thousands of dollars expended in illustrations would make it possible for the books to be sold at a price that would enable many to obtain them. The Lord has not inspired this enthusiasm.--Lt 133, 1899. \n\n\n                                                        219",
