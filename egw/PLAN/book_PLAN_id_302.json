    "word": "Satan is busily laying his plans for the last mighty conflict, when all will take sides. After the gospel has been traveling over the world for nearly two thousand years, Satan will present to men and women the same scene that he presented to Christ.

He will present before them entrancing views of the kingdom of God, and he claims that these are views of His kingdom. But are they? No; no.",
