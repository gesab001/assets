    "word": "To Reach Thousands \n\n     There are thousands to be reached by the truth. There are thousands who are to receive Christ as a personal Saviour. Greater New York must be worked on an altogether more economical plan than the plan on which you have been working. Christ says, \"Whosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Talk the truth, live the truth, walk before God in all humility of mind and in all simplicity of action. Let the angels see that you love God, and that you practice the humility of Christ. This all must do who enter the courts of the Lord. In this life they must walk in the new and precious way that Christ has provided for His followers.",
