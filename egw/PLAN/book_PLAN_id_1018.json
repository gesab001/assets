    "word": "Chap. 39 - Physical Labor for Students\n\n     With the present plan of education, a door of temptation is opened to the youth. Although they generally have too many hours of study they have many hours without anything to do. These leisure hours are frequently spent in a reckless manner. . . . Very many young men who have been religiously instructed at home, and who go out to the schools comparatively innocent and virtuous, become corrupt by associating with vicious companions. They lose self-respect and sacrifice noble principles. Then they are prepared to pursue the downward path; for they have so abused conscience that sin does not appear so exceeding sinful. These evils . . . might be remedied in a great degree if study and labor could be combined. . . .",
