    "word": "Fun and Lawlessness \n\n     Students will be tempted to do lawless things, to please themselves. They may think this only fun. But if they would put themselves upon their honor, and realize that in doing these things they bless no one, but involve others as well as themselves in difficulty, they would be more careful of their actions. How much more manly and honorable it would be to act like gentlemen, who do not ask that all sympathy be shown them, but who realize that they must put their will on Christ's side, and work in His lines by helping their teachers to carry burdens and perplexities that Satan would make discouragingly heavy. By helping to bear these burdens, instead of making them more taxing, what a blessing students would receive. They would create an atmosphere in the school that would be helpful and exhilarating, not depressing and enfeebling. Every student would enjoy the consciousness that he had acted his part on Christ's side, and had not given one jot of his ability or influence to the great adversary of all that is good or ennobling. How much more satisfactory it would be for the students to think that they had not given their sanction to any plans showing disrespect for order, diligence, and obedience, even against the clamoring of inclination for indulgence.",
