    "word": "Do not show a spirit of littleness in deal. If one stops to haggle over a small sum, those with whom he deals will pronounce him a sharper, and will be on their guard, thinking that he means to cheat them. But if a trifle is yielded in favor of another, he will be likely to work on the same plan. Littleness begets littleness. Those who pursue this course do not see how contemptible it appears to others, and the precious cause of truth bears the stamp of their defect. We are not to imitate the world's manner of dealing, but to reveal the generous, unselfish spirit of Christ.",
