    "word": "Many transgress physical law, and seemingly pass on uninjured; but is it so? In truth God has spoken, \"That which ye sow, ye shall also reap.\" \n\n\n                                      -62- \n\nDisease of such a character will come upon the transgressor that he will be forced to admit that he is reaping the result of previous habits, which have weakened his power of resistance. When our churches plant their feet firmly upon the principles of health reform, and respect the physical [laws] which God hath instituted, they will stand where God will give them His grace, and will make them an influence for good upon the community in which they move.",
