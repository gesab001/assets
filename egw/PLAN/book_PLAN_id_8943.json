    "word": "\"But I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them\" [verses 25, 26]. That is His word. We have been reading it for more than the last year more distinctly. \"I have declared unto them thy name\"--Thy name, its goodness, its mercy, its love, its compassion, that you may gather up your forces and think, and that you may plant yourselves upon the rock Christ Jesus and believe Him. \"I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it.\" That is what He came here for.",
