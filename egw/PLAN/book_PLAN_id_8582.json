    "word": "This is the law of restitution on right lines. One portion of the Lord's vineyard is worked, and brings in fruit. Then another portion is taken up. It is the Lord's plan that the unworked part shall receive help from the part which has been worked. This should be done with cheerfulness. Thus the work in every part becomes a success. When the principles of the law of God are practiced, the work moves forward solidly and with double strength. Then the workers are enabled with great power to proclaim the third angel's message and the second appearing with power and great glory of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.",
