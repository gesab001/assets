    "word": "Nehemiah had often poured out his soul in behalf of his people. But now as he prayed a holy purpose formed in his mind. He resolved that if he could obtain the consent of the king, and the necessary aid in procuring implements and material, he would himself undertake the task of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and restoring Israel\u2019s national strength. And he asked the Lord to grant him favor in the sight of the king, that this plan might be carried out. \u201cProsper, I pray Thee, Thy servant this day,\u201d he entreated, \u201cand grant him mercy in the sight of this man.\u201d",
