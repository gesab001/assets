    "word": "My words seem inadequate. I despair of clothing the truth God has made known concerning His great redemption, which engrossed to itself His undivided attention in the only begotten Son of the Infinite One. The truths that are to last through time and through eternity, the great plan of redemption, which cost so much for the salvation of the human race, presenting before them a life that measures with the life of God--these truths are too full, deep, and holy for human words or human pen to adequately express.--Manuscript 23, 1896, p. 2.",
