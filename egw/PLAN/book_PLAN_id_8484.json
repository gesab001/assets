    "word": "There are those in Oakland who would favor an institution near them, because they need its benefits, and who would see through their eyes and not discover any flaw in your judgment in this matter. But with the light given me of the Lord I shall not encourage you or anyone else to walk in the sparks of your own kindling. You might have been a blessing in the cause and work of God if you [had] unitedly followed the instruction the Lord has given you, but if you choose to make your own plans and go independently you will not have the Lord to go with you. You need qualities brought into the institution which you do not possess.",
