    "word": "Chapter 5 \n\n     18-23 (ch. 8:12). Confidence in Man Blocks God's Messages.--[Isaiah 5:18 quoted.] Men may seek to strengthen their forces by confederating together, making, as they suppose, strong societies to carry out the plans they have formed. They may lift up their souls in pride and self-sufficiency; but the One mighty in counsel does not plan with them. Their unbelief in His purposes and work, and their confidence in man, will not permit them to receive the messages He sends (RH Dec. 22, 1896).",
