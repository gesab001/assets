    "word": "There is great danger in encouraging these things that come from the human agent, which are but a weak repetition of the words of inspiration from God, and that make feeble that which is sufficient, full, and complete. I would counsel everyone, Study your Bibles, and obey the Word so plainly given to us. None need to turn from the Word to human agencies, and accept a lower standard than that which is given in the exposition of the ten holy requirements of God. The great principles of the law of God are made plain to the comprehension of all who in their hearts desire to discern truth from error. \"To the law and to the testimony.\" Let the Word of God dwell in you richly. Let every one of the messengers lead souls to plant their feet on the sure Word of God.",
