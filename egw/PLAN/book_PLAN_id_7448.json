    "word": "Those extra buildings in Cape Town might far better have been plants in other localities. The erection of building after building in Battle Creek has not been after the order of God. Plants should have been made in regions beyond. The same mistake has been made in Africa as in Battle Creek. We ask you to keep your eyes open, and see if there are no ways to reach the souls who are not of our faith. Do something in this line.--Letter 79, 1899, p. 3. (To \"Dear Brother W. S. Hyatt,\" May 3, 1899.)",
