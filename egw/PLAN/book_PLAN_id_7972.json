    "word": "Every man needs now to take his position on the old-time foundation of obedience to God. Let no one allow the propositions of any group of men to lead him, through a spirit of compromise, to accept wrong plans and principles. I have been instructed that history will be repeated, and that the specious working of Satan will be revealed by human agents. We must work discreetly and determinedly to adjust matters. The recent efforts to induce God's people to accept binding propositions, are the last that should be passed by without a decided protest. Let us not take another step toward the acceptance of such proposition, lest we be ensnared.",
