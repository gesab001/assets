    "word": "The Necessity of Harmony. \n\n                                Takoma Park, July 23, 1904. \n\nDear Brethren Magan and Sutherland:-- \n     I have words of counsel for you. There must be harmony between you and the men in responsible positions in the General Conference. You catch at straws in matters concerning Elder Daniells and Elder Prescott. Why? Because they have not harmonized with you in all your plans, and have not given you the credit that you deserved. But when the Lord corrected errors, and spoke encouraging words concerning your efforts, why did you not thank Him, and show your gratitude by manifesting forgiveness, and showing an appreciation of the burdens borne by these fellow workers? Why did you cast imputations upon Elders \n\n\n                                     -362- \n\nDaniells and Prescott, or allow others to cast imputations upon them?",
