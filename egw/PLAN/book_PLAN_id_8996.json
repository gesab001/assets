    "word": "The Lord possesses infinite wisdom and omnipotent power. His goodness and mercy are unlimited, without partiality and without hypocrisy. God will not plan, nor His power execute, any purpose which is not in perfect harmony with infinite goodness. Neither does His justice make any requirements or demands that are in opposition to the desires or claims of His mercy. There must be the cooperation of justice and mercy, each drawing vitality, power, and infinite efficiency from the union and sympathetic cooperation of all God's attributes. This our workers in the office, high and low, will need to learn.",
