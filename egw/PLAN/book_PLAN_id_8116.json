    "word": "There are those who think that they can improve upon the plan that God has made, that they can mark out for themselves a course better than the course He has marked out for them. Such ones, choosing the things that be of men, harden their hearts against God's leading, and follow their own way. Unless they repent, the time will come when they will look upon the utter failure of their life work. Man's wisdom, exercised without Christ's guidance, is a dangerous element.",
