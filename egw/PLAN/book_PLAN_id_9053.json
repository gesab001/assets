    "word": "I have been shown that you, my dear brother, have sometimes allowed the judgment of men who are not controlled by the Spirit of God to lead you to give your influences to plans and propositions that have displeased God. In regard to some of your councils the word of the Lord has come to me again and again, presenting evils that need correcting; but if you have seen the evils, you have not dared to stand firmly and boldly in defense of the right. There is danger that your judgment will be perverted. A knowledge of this fact has brought the burden heavier upon me. God is not pleased with these \n                                                                           1261\nthings. In regard to Captain Eldridge I have had to write words of reproof again and again. You saw the evil that was at work, and yet you did not move as one in your position ought to have done. In regard to men whom I have had to reprove, the word of the Lord did not have the effect it would have had if you had discerned the evil more clearly and had acted decidedly. These words were spoken to me when the state of things in your councils was so objectionable to the Lord: 'Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off; the truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. Yes, truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.'",
