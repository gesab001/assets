    "word": "We need an increase of faith and confidence in God. To the poor souls who have been leaning on the broken staff of humanity I would say, Oh, that God would show you that there is a power above the power of humanity! May God help every one of us to work on the plan of faith, believing that the Lord wants to be represented in our world, that He wants His power to be revealed in His people. He will reveal His power through you if you will only place yourselves where He can give you this power. You may have hope and joy and strength. Open the heart to God, looking and believing and confiding in God. Look, oh, look heavenward. You have trusted too much to human help. Now consecrate self wholly, in faith believing in the One who invites you. Unite with your brethren but draw continually from Christ who is your refuge and your dependence and exceeding great reward.",
