    "word": "There are healthful methods of exercise that may be planned which will be beneficial to both soul and body. . . . It is our duty ever to seek to do good in the use of the muscles and brain God has given to youth, that they may be useful to others, making their labors lighter, . . . turning the minds of the students from fun and frolic which often carries them beyond the dignity of manhood and womanhood. . . . The Lord would have the mind elevated, seeking higher, nobler channels of usefulness.--Selected Messages, book 2, pp. 321-324.",
