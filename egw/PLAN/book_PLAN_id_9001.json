    "word": "What kind of a future is before us if men will be united in Christ? If this long controversy that has been kept up through satanic agencies shall end in the unity that Christ prayed might exist, then we will not see men framing plans and [dictating the] manner of working when they have not spiritual eye sight to discern spiritual things. They see men as trees walking. They need the divine touch that they may see as God sees and work as Christ worked. Zion's watchmen then will sound the trumpet in clearer, louder notes because they see the sword coming.",
