    "word": "The reason that there is not increased capabilities is because the powers God has given are not put into exercise. Men stop short of seeking wisdom and knowledge of how to do the work with readiness of mind. In our homes, on our premises, there is not that tact and ingenuity and sharp discernment seen that would lead us to make the most of our possessions. Those who are willing to sink down into a low, common level greatly displease God. Parents who follow this course are a dishonor to God, for they carry their children with them. Many youth are compelled to work against inherited evils in this direction, and frequently they never recover from the abuse placed upon them through a perverted education at home. Parents and children have to eat the bitter fruit of wrong ideas, wrong plans. Whole families become nonentities, hopeless of reform. This need not be so, but they do not have in them the traits of character essential to brace against these inherited and cultivated tendencies, these slack, untidy habits. If they would take themselves in hand, they could say, \"I will not sink down to this low level. I will arise; I will make diligent efforts. I will not be pushed downward by circumstances. I will not fail nor be discouraged.\"",
