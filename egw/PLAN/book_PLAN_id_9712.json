    "word": "We are in danger of spreading over more territory, and starting more enterprises than we can possibly attend to properly. There is danger of overdoing some branches of the work, and leaving some important parts of it to be neglected. To undertake a large amount of work and do nothing perfectly, would be a bad plan.
