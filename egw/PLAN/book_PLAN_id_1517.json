    "word": "Not by outward display, not by worldly patronage, is the kingdom of Christ established, but by the implanting of Christ's nature in humanity through the work of the Holy Spirit. \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\" Here is the only power that can work for the uplifting of humanity. And the human agency for the accomplishment of this work is the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.--Manuscript 42, 1905.",
