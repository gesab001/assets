    "word": "To Do a Thorough Work.--There is danger that those who hold meetings in our cities will be satisfied with doing a surface work.

Let them labor and plan with the thought in mind that time is nearly ended, and that because of this they must work with redoubled zeal and energy.--Review and Herald, Jan. 11, 1912.",
