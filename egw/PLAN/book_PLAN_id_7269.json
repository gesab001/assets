    "word": "We have been in New Zealand a little more than three months. I have spoken 42 times and written 400 pages of letter paper. I have visited Auckland, Kaeo, and Napier. Our camp meeting was excellent, because of the manifest workings of the Spirit of God upon human hearts in the conversion of souls and the reclaiming of backsliders, and the precious knowledge that many received. The reproofs given were not rejected, but brought souls to repentance and confession and renouncing of their wrongs. Many things needed to be set in order. Selfishness and unfaithfulness in those connected with various lines of work were discerned and deplored. There are so many in this country who want their own way. They do not see how important it is to preserve unity in plans of action and to work and act after the Pattern, Christ Jesus.",
