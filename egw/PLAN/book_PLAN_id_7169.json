    "word": "Counsel on a Percentage Proposition [NOTE: THIS EXCERPT IS FROM A LETTER OF COUNSEL ADDRESSED TO ELDER J. A. BURDEN, MANAGER OF LOMA LINDA SANITARIUM, WRITTEN IN RESPONSE TO HIS REQUEST FOR COUNSEL. WE QUOTE HERE FROM HIS LETTER OF OCTOBER 9, 1905: \n\n\n          \"DEAR SISTER WHITE: I WROTE BROTHER WHITE THE OTHER DAY IN \n     REFERENCE TO A RECENT PROPOSITION FROM DR. _____, OUTLINING THE \n     PLAN ON WHICH HE WOULD BE WILLING TO CONNECT WITH LOMA LINDA. IN \n     BRIEF IT IS THIS: A DEFINITE SALARY A WEEK, A PERCENTAGE ON THE \n     SURGICAL WORK, AND A CONTRACT FOR A TERM OF YEARS. HE SUGGESTED \n     $25 A WEEK SALARY, 30 PER CENT ON THE OPERATIONS, WITH A FIVE-YEAR \n     CONTRACT, AND ONE MONTH A YEAR OFF FOR STUDY AND IMPROVEMENT AT \n     HIS OWN EXPENSE. HE SAYS HIS DESIRE IS NOT TO MAKE MONEY, BUT \n     HE IS ANXIOUS TO IMPROVE HIMSELF FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WORK.\"] \n\n\n     In regard to the proposition made by Brother _____, I look at the matter as you do. We cannot afford to start out on the high wage plan. This was the misfortune of the people in Battle Creek, and I have something to say on this point. We have before us a large field of missionary work. We are to be sure to heed the requirements of Christ, who made himself a donation to our world. Nothing that we can possibly do should be left undone. There is \n                                                                           78\nto be neatness and order, and everything possible is to be done to show thoroughness in every line. But when it comes to paying twenty-five dollars a week, and giving a large percentage on the surgical work done, light was given me in Australia that this could never be, because our record is at stake. . . .",
