    "word": "Our health institutions are of value in the Lord's estimation only when He is allowed to preside in their management. If His plans and devisings are regarded as inferior to plans of men, He looks upon these institutions as of no more value than the institutions established and conducted by worldlings. God cannot endorse any institution, unless it teaches the living principles of His law and brings its own actions into strict conformity to these precepts. Upon these institutions that are not maintained according to His law, He pronounces the sentence, \"Unaccepted. Weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, and found wanting.\"",
