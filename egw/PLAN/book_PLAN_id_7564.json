    "word": "Jesus says, \"Follow me,\" \"he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" Consider it not a hard duty. The commandments of God are His expressed character flowing out of a heart of love of thoughtful plans that man may be preserved from every evil. They are not an arbitrary authority over man, but the Lord would have men as His obedient children, and members of His own family.",
