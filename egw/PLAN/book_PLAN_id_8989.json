    "word": "At the morning meetings I have enjoyed hearing the testimonies of those who came here to learn,-- testimonies of how they have learned to believe that Christ has forgiven their sins. It is very late--the eleventh hour--to learn that. But, thank God, it is not too late, even at the eleventh hour, for wrongs to be made right. If we learn what is to be the joy of our calling, we shall praise God with heart and soul and voice. And at last we shall have a glorious triumph when our captivity shall be turned, and our mourning and tears shall be forever past. What a shout of praise will then go forth from human lips! Shall we begin it here? God grant that we may! God help you to put away every fiber of the root of bitterness that has been planted in so many hearts. May you put it away, so that it shall never bud nor blossom from this time. Let Christ kill it by his Holy Spirit in every heart. God grant that the root of bitterness may die! \n\n                                               -",
