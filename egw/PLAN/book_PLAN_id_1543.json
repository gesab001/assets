    "word": "Compassion for the Unsaved.--But how few of us regard the salvation of sinners in the light in which it is viewed by the heavenly universe,--as a plan devised from eternity in the mind of God! How few of us are heart to heart with the Redeemer in this solemn, closing work! There is scarcely a tithe of the compassion that there should be for souls unsaved. There are so many to be warned, and yet how few sympathize with God sufficiently to be anything or nothing if only they can see souls won to Christ!-- Gospel Workers, p. 116. (1915)",
