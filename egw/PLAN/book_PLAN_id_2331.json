    "word": "Cologne is one of the oldest cities of Northern Europe. It is said that a colony was planted here by the mother of Nero in 51 A.D., and even this occupied the site of a still more ancient city. Many ruins of this early period are still in existence. The old streets are exceedingly narrow, and there are no sidewalks, or scarcely any. A few years ago there was one street in which a man standing in the center and extending both arms at the same time could touch the buildings on each side. But most of the narrowest streets have now been swept away.",
