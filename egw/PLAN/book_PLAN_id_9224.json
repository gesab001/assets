    "word": "The Lord has made it part of His plan that man's reaping shall be according to his sowing. And this is the explanation of the misery and suffering in our world, which is charged back on God. The man who serves himself, and makes a God of his stomach, will reap that which is a sure result of the violation of nature's laws. Those who abuse any organ of the body to gratify lustful appetite and debased passions, in the married or unmarried life, will bear testimony of the same in his countenance. He has sown to fleshly lusts, and he will just as surely realize the consequence.",
