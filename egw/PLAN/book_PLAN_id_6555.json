    "word": "One part of the ministry of heavenly angels is to visit our world and oversee the work of the Lord which is in the hands of his stewards. They are to minister in every time of necessity to those who as co-workers with God are striving to the best of their ability to successfully carry forward his work in the earth. These heavenly intelligences are represented as desiring to look into the plan and scheme of redemption, and the angelic hosts rejoice whenever any part of the work of God is in a prosperous condition.",
