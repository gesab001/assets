    "word": "Now I have not been able to sleep after twelve o'clock for two nights because the case of Elder Cottrell has been presented to me. The Lord will use Elder Cottrell if he will give up the idea that plans he may suggest are infallible, never to be revoked. This understanding is an erroneous idea. God does not endorse it. This is the position that Lucifer took. He was next to Christ in the heavenly courts, but decided that he was entitled to a higher position. Read and understand Ezekiel 28:11-18. This matter has been opened to me. When the Lord sought to correct him, he would not be corrected; and when any man in all our ranks shall not be willing to yield up his own way, but will persistently choose to follow his own judgment, carrying the idea that his judgment is unchangeable, he claims infallibility. The Lord has no more any use for him unless he changes his ideas.",
