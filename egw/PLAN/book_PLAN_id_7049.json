    "word": "Your business entanglement in Michigan injured your influence there as a representative of Jesus. Had you attended to the preaching of the word in Healdsburg, had you wisely brought your own habits in domestic life in harmony with the holy law of God, you would today stand in a position before the people where you could do them great good. You should feel the necessity of working perseveringly day by day to overcome the natural defects in your character. If you would do this, you would not be so strongly tempted to branch out and devise plans to make more money to meet your increasing expenses. With your present remuneration for your labors, and the consideration which will be made in regard to your wife's wages, you should be supplied abundantly with means, if you will only study to live within your means. But you seldom do this. You use money altogether too lavishly. Jesus is your example \n\n\n                         [25] \n\nin all things. You ought to have learned before this to be careful that your expenses do not exceed your income. Bind about your wants.",
