    "word": "Ellen White also defended the work of Sutherland and Magan when she said, \"There are those who with the Bible as their standard, have been working in the fear of God to carry out the principles of true education. They are not old men, but they are, nevertheless, men whom the Lord desires to place on vantage ground. . . . But as they have tried to carry forward the work, their efforts have been criticized, and the question has been raised, Should not older teachers be brought in to take the burden of this work? . . . The Lord encouraged these brethren, giving them victories that taught them valuable lessons and strengthened their confidence. It is not according to His plan for some other worker to come in and take the burden of this work upon his shoulders, supposing that he can do a much better and larger work. This is not right.\"--Ms 98, 1902, pp. 5, 6. (\"Consideration to be Shown to Those Who in Their Work Have Wrestled With Difficulties,\" July 10, 1902.) [Neff Manuscript, p. 103.]",
