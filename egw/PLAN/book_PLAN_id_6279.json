    "word": "Christ's gracious presence in his word is ever speaking to the soul, representing him as the well of living water to refresh the thirsting soul. It \n\n\n                    - 79 - \n\nis our privilege to have a living, abiding Saviour. He is the source of spiritual power implanted within us, and his influence will flow forth in words and actions, refreshing all within the sphere of our influence, begetting in them desires and aspirations for strength and purity, for holiness and peace, and for that joy which brings no sorrow with it. This is the result of an indwelling Saviour.",
