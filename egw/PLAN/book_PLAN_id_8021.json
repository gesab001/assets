    "word": "Your labors, Bro. Baker, need to be improved in order to be successful. You shun responsibilities. Where there is a variety of talent engaged in the work your deficiency is better supplied, so that the want in you is not so clearly recognized, but in the field where you and Brother Teasdale were the only laborers, you should have put forth every part of your being to make a complete whole, and given lessons of practice to Brother Teasdale. A part of the moral vineyard was assigned to you. The whole field in Tasmania was under your supervision, and in need of your most earnest labor. You could have connected with believers in the truth near Hobart and Bismarck, and laid out your plans before them, soliciting their suggestions. You could, and should, in every place seek counsel and give counsel much more graciously, even if you obtain but little enlightenment.",
