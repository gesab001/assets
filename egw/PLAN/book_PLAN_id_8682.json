It is roomy and a very nice building. . . . Be sure and send me that coarse material like Emma's dress. Please send that double paisley shawl. I have a plan for it. Send my plaid shawl, and you may send two comfortables. Send books, red-covered Jewish Antiquities and the Bible Dictionary. Is Night Scenes of the Bible [BY DANIEL MARCH, PUBLISHED IN 1869.] there? If so, send it.--Letter 60, 1878, p. 1. \n\n\n                                -21-",
