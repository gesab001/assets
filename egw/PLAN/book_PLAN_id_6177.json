    "word": "In these days He has instituted no new plan to preserve the purity of His people. He entreats the erring ones who profess His name to repent and turn from their evil ways, in the same manner that He did of old. He predicts the dangers before them by the mouth of His chosen servants now as then. He sounds His note of warning, and reproves sin just as faithfully as in the days of Jeremiah. But the Israel of our time have the same temptations to scorn reproof and hate counsel as did ancient Israel. They too often turn a deaf ear to the words that God has given His servants for the benefit of those who profess the truth.--Signs of the Times, Feb. 12, 1880.",
