    "word": "Cooperation \n\n     In this effort in behalf of the cities, we greatly need the cooperation of all classes of laborers. Especially do we need the help that the physician can render as an evangelist. If ministers and physicians will plan to unite in an effort to reach the honest-hearted ones in our cities, the physicians, as well as the ministers, will be placed on vantage ground. As they labor in humility God will open the way before them, and many will receive a saving knowledge of truth.--MS. 9, 1910.",
