    "word": "You are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ to riches that will be imperishable. Christ says, I go to prepare a place for you that where I am. there ye may be also.\" (See John 14:2, 3.) Then we will be with Christ until the city of God comes upon the earth and we will take possession of our home. We will build houses and inhabit them, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. Heaven is worth something to us. We want you to have a place in the earth made new. That is why we have been talking so plainly to you today. We want to tell every one of you who have been sinning against the law of God, Repent of your transgressions and come to Jesus for mercy, and He will abundantly pardon. He will cleanse you from every stain of sin.",
