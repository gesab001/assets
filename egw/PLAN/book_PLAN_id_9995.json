    "word": "To every medical worker in connection with the cause of God are addressed the words spoken by Paul to Timothy: \"Take heed to thyself and to the doctrine.\" We need to examine ourselves closely, and to renounce every plan or principle that will lead us to misrepresent the Lord. The past experience is to be closely reviewed. Every motive is to be critically examined. Every ambitious project that is contrary to the Word of God is to be put aside. We are to stand in preparedness before God. The word given to me to speak to you is, \"I have not found thy works perfect before God.\" The Lord will not accept the most splendid service that means the putting of the least yoke upon his people. We are to frame no yokes for our fellow men. God's word to us is that we are to break every yoke.",
