    "word": "IT IS THE DEVIL'S PLAN. \nTO GET US TO SEE THE GIANTS AND THE WALLED CITIES. THIS HAS BEEN A MOST EFFECTUAL WAY ON HIS PART OF POSTPONING THE COMING OF THE LORD. THE FAILURE OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS TO START SCHOOLS, FARM SCHOOLS, SELF-SUPPORTING SCHOOLS, WHEN THE LORD SAID OPEN SUCH SCHOOLS, HAS STRENGTHENED THE PREJUDICE OF MANY TOWARD THE SOUTH. NOW, WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE UNDER FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST BE DONE IN THE MIDST OF DIFFICULTIES. STILL, LET US REDEEM THE TIME, AND SAVE OURSELVES AS A DENOMINATION AS WELL AS GIVE THE WARNING TO THOSE WHO KNOW IT NOT.",
