    "word": "It is God's design that those fields which have abundant facilities shall share their advantages with more needy fields. This is the principle ever to be observed in all our institutions. God requires that there shall be less planning and devising for buildings in America and in Battle Creek, and that the means shall flow into fields where there is nothing to rely upon, where the work is carried on under great disadvantages for want of facilities. But the spirit of selfishness has been manifested in centralizing so much. Into the fields where there is already an abundance of facilities, the workers have gathered from every possible resource. Again I would say to those who have influence, \"Do the work that has been neglected.\" Letter 149, 1899, pp. 1-4. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, September 25, 1899.) \n                                                                           233",
