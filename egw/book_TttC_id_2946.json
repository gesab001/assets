    "word": "Chap. 65 - An Indulged Daughter\n\n     Dear Friend F: I was shown that you were in danger of being under the full control of the great adversary of souls. Your experience at ----- was not good for you. Your stay at ----- hurt you; you became proud and vain. Persons were not wanting who unwisely petted and praised you until you became vain, pert, and saucy. You have been opposed to restraint, have been headstrong, willful, and stubborn, and have made your parents much trouble. They have erred. Your father has unwisely petted you. You have taken advantage of this and have become deceptive. You have received approbation which you did not deserve.",
