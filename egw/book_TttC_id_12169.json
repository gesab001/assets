He says: \n\n\n     \"Blessed are they that are upright in way, \n        Who walk in the law of Jehovah. \n      Blessed are they that keep His testimonies, \n        That seek Him with the whole heart. . . . \n      O that my ways were established \n        To observe Thy statutes! \n      Then shall I not be put to shame, \n        When I have respect unto all Thy commandments.\" \n\n\n     \"Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? \n        By taking heed thereto according to Thy word.\" \n     \"I have chosen the way of faithfulness: \n        Thine ordinances have I set before me.\" \n     \"Thy word have I laid up in my heart, \n        That I might not sin against Thee.\" \n     \"And I shall walk at liberty; \n        For I have sought Thy precepts.\" \n\n\n     \"Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold \n        Wondrous things out of Thy law.\" \n     \"Thy testimonies also are my delight \n        And my counselors.\" \n     \"The law of Thy mouth is better unto me \n        Than thousands of gold and silver.\" \n                                                                           324\n\n     \"O how love I Thy law! \n        It is my meditation all the day.\" \n     \"Thy statutes have been my songs \n        In the house of my pilgrimage.\" \n     \"Thy testimonies are wonderful; \n        Therefore doth my soul keep them. \n      The opening of Thy words giveth light; \n        It giveth understanding unto the simple.\" \n     \"Thy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies; \n        For they are ever with me. \n      I have more understanding than all my teachers; \n        For Thy testimonies are my meditation. \n      I understand more than the aged, \n        Because I have kept Thy precepts. . . . \n      Through Thy precepts I get understanding: \n        Therefore I hate every false way.\" \n\n\n     \"Thy word is very pure; \n        Therefore Thy servant loveth it.\" \n     \"The sum of Thy word is truth; \n        And every one of Thy righteous ordinances endureth \n             forever.\" \n\n\n     \"Great peace have they that love Thy law; \n        And they have no occasion of stumbling. \n      I have hoped for Thy salvation, O Jehovah, \n        And have done Thy commandments. \n      My soul hath observed Thy testimonies; \n        And I love them exceedingly.\" \n\n\n     \"I have longed for Thy salvation, O Jehovah; \n        And Thy law is my delight. \n      Let my soul live, and it shall praise Thee; \n        And let Thine ordinances help me.\" \n     \"Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever; \n        For they are the rejoicing of my heart.\" \n             Psalm 119:1-6, margin, 9, 30, 11, 45, 18, 24, 72, 97, \n             54, 129, 130, 98-104, 140, 160, 165-167, 174, 175, \n             111, A.
