    "word": "No man can be a follower of Christ and yet place his affections upon the things of the world. John in his first epistle writes: \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\" Our Redeemer, who met this temptation of Satan in its fullest power, is acquainted with man's danger of yielding to the temptation to love the world.",
