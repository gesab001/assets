{"word": "After beholding the glory of the temple, we went out, and Jesus left us and went to the city. Soon we heard His lovely voice again, saying: \"Come, My people, you have come out of great tribulation, and done My will, suffered for Me, come in to supper; for I will gird Myself and serve you.\" We shouted, \"Alleluia, glory,\" and entered the city. Here I saw a table of pure silver; it was many miles in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. I saw the fruit of the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates, grapes, and many other kinds of fruit. I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said: \"Not now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land, go back to earth no more. But in a little while, if faithful, you shall both eat of the fruit of the tree of life and drink of the water of the fountain. And,\" said He, \"you must go back \n                                                                           70\nto the earth again, and relate to others what I have revealed to you.\" Then an angel bore me gently down to this dark world. Sometimes I think I can stay here no longer, all things of earth look so dreary. I feel very lonely here, for I have seen a better land. Oh that I had wings like a dove, then would I fly away and be at rest.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 69}
