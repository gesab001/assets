{"word": "Come to the Point.--Now, when we go into the house we should not begin to talk of frivolous things, but come right to the point and say, I want you to love Jesus, for He has first loved you. . . . Take along the publications and ask them to read. When they see that you are sincere they will not despise any of your efforts. There is a way to reach the hardest hearts. Approach in the simplicity, and sincerity, and humility that will help us to reach the souls of them for whom Christ died.--Manuscript 10, 1888.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 91}
