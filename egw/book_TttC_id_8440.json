    "word": "In the plan of redemption, \"mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.\" The all-wise, all-powerful God, He who dwells in light unapproachable, is full of love, of goodness. Therefore give glory to God, ye that are doubting and trembling; for Jesus lives to make intercession for us. Give God the glory for the gift of His dear Son and that He has not died for us in vain. \n                                                                           634",
