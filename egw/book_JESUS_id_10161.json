{"word": "Sin-burdened, struggling souls, Jesus in His glorified humanity has ascended into the heavens to make intercession for us. \"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.\" We should be continually looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; for by beholding Him we shall be changed into His image, our character will be made like His. We should rejoice that all judgment is given to the Son, because in His humanity He has become acquainted with all the difficulties that beset humanity.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 20}
