    "word": "Get Ready \n\n     \"Behold, I come quickly,\" Christ declares; \"and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" Revelation 22:12. The Lord at His coming will scrutinize every talent; He will demand interest on the capital He has entrusted. By His own humiliation and agony, by His life of toil and His death of shame, Christ has paid for the service of all who have taken His name and profess to be His servants. All are under deepest obligation to improve every capability for the work of winning souls to Him. \"Ye are not your own,\" He says; \"for ye are bought with a price;\" therefore glorify God by a life of service that will win men and women from sin to righteousness. 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. We are bought with the price of Christ's own life, bought that we may return to God His own in faithful service.",
