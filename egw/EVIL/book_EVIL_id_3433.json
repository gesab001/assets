    "word": "Children and youth, I entreat you, for Christ's sake, to walk in the light. Submit your will to the will of God. When \"sinners entice thee, consent thou not.\" Keep the way of the Lord, for you will have no peace in transgression. By an evil course you bring discredit upon your parents and dishonor upon the religion of Christ. Remember that your life is recorded in the books of Heaven, to be opened before the assembled universe. Think what shame, what remorse, would be yours, should it be your unhappy lot to lose eternal life! \"Turn you at My reproof: behold, I will pour out My Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. . . . Then shall they call upon Me. . . . Whoso hearkeneth unto Me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.\" Heed the instruction of Christ, \"Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.\"--The Youth's Instructor, August 10, 1893.",
