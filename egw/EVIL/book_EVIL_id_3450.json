    "word": "Efforts have been made to devise a plan for the establishment of a literary society which shall prove a benefit to all connected with it,--a society in which all the members shall feel a moral responsibility to make it what it should be, and to avoid the evils which often make such associations dangerous to religious principles. Persons of discretion and good judgment, who have a living connection with heaven, who will see the evil tendencies, and, not deceived by Satan, will move straight forward in the path of integrity, continually holding aloft the banner of Christ--such ones are needed to control in these societies. Such an influence will command respect, and make these gatherings a blessing rather than a curse.",
