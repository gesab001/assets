    "word": "There are some occupations which are not open to Christians. They are not legitimate callings for the servant of God, and they can engage in them only at the peril of their souls, for through these occupations they are exposed to the miasmal influence of the world. God desires not that His people should keep company with extortioners and robbers, even though they may wear an appearance of sanctity. There are occupations in which it is impossible to work reform; for they are thoroughly bad, and that which can be said to those who persist in engaging in them, is \"Depart, ye thieves.\" But the profession of medicine is a legitimate calling, and there is a remedy for all its evils. Christ may be represented in the character and action of every physician, and all who claim to be Christians should expect to work as He worked, having a fair price for their services, and exacting no more, although they see that they could obtain more by following the selfish customs of the world. It is just as consistent for the minister of the gospel to demand an excessive salary for visiting the sick, comforting the desponding, bringing peace and joy to the oppressed, as for the physician to make large charges for his professional visits.",
