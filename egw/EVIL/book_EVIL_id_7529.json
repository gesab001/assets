    "word": "Will we grasp and appreciate the good, and refuse the evil? Will we walk humbly with God? . . . We must not fail nor be discouraged; then the present work, now passing beyond our control, will be our paymaster. . . . We have only a little period in which to work. We are not to educate ourselves to worry. Keep the eye upward, fixed upon the mark of our high calling in Christ Jesus. We have a work to do; let us do it as in the sight of the whole universe of heaven. We are not to faint, to stumble on in unbelief. God desires us to look to Him as our sufficiency and strive to be complete in Him.",
