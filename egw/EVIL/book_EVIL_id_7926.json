    "word": "The Siege of Jerusalem\n     The longsuffering of God toward Jerusalem only confirmed the Jews in their stubborn impenitence. In their hatred and cruelty toward the disciples of Jesus, they rejected the last offer of mercy. Then God withdrew His protection from them, and removed His restraining power from Satan and his angels, and the nation was left to the control of the leader she had chosen. Her children had spurned the grace of Christ,\n241\nwhich would have enabled them to subdue their evil impulses, and now these became the conquerors.",
