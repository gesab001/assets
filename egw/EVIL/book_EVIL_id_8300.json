    "word": "Those who are \"do-nothings\" now, will have the superscription upon them, \"Weighed in the balance, and found wanting.\" They knew their Master's will, but did it not. They had the light of truth, they had every advantage, but chose their own selfish interests, and they will be left with those whom they did not try to save. \"But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin \n\n\n                         - 9 - \n\nto smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"",
