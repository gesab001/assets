Portions of this manuscript appear in Evangelism and in various Manuscript Releases.) \n\n\n     The Lord has presented your case before me several times, and I have written out the instruction given me for you, but I cannot now find it among my writings. Since coming here I have once more been given a presentation of your case. Your work has been represented to me in figures. You were passing round to a company a vessel filled with most beautiful fruit. But as you offered them this fruit you spoke words so harsh, and your attitude was so forbidding, that no one would accept it. Then another came to the same company, and offered them the same fruit. And so courteous and pleasant were His words and manner as He spoke of the desirability of the fruit, that the vessel was emptied. The words were spoken, \"Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.\" [Isaiah 52:7-10; Psalms 23; Psalms 25:4-10, quoted.]",
