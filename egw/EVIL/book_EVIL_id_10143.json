    "word": "The great controversy between good and evil is being waged. Under the leadership of Satan there are men who today are doing all in their power to plunge the world into commercial strife. Thus Satan is trying to bring about a condition of things that will make the world uncivilized. He desires to see strange things acted out, which God, who is too wise to err, has not ordained. But the Lord--yes, our God--will be Ruler of the heavens and the earth. If men and women will carry out His requirements, it will be seen that He is Ruler, carrying out His divine will.--Letter 114, 1910. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. September 8, 1988. Entire letter.",
