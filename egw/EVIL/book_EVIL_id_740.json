    "word": "The Call to Awake \n\n     The work is fast closing up, and on every side wickedness is increasing. We have but a short time in which to work. Let us awake from spiritual slumber, and consecrate all that we have and are to the Lord. His Spirit will abide with true missionaries, furnishing them with power for service.--Southern Watchman, April 9, 1903.  {ChS 80.10}  \n     Wake up, brethren and sisters, wake up. Sleep no longer. \"Why stand ye here all the day idle?\" Jesus calls you, saying, \"Go work today in My vineyard.\" Whoever has received the Holy Spirit, will make it manifest; for all his powers will be employed in the most active service. All who actually receive Christ by faith, work. They feel the burden of souls. God now calls upon every one who has a knowledge of the truth, who is a depositary of sacred truth, to arise and impart the light of heaven to others.--Review and Herald, Dec. 6, 1893.  {ChS 80.11}  \n     Wake up, brethren; for your own soul's sake, wake up. Without the grace of Christ you can do nothing. Work while you can.--Southern Watchman, July 17, 1906.  {ChS 80.12}\n     If our eyes could be open to discern the fallen angels at work with those who feel at ease and consider themselves safe, we would not feel so secure. Evil angels are upon our track every moment.--Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 302.",
