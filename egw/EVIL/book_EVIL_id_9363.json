    "word": "MR No. 431 - Polygamy\n\n     Solomon mingled error with truth, and betrayed sacred trusts. The insidious evils of paganism corrupted his religion. One wrong step taken, led to step after step of political alliance. The polygamy so common in that time was directly opposed to the law of Jehovah.

These Solomon countenanced and sustained. . . .",
