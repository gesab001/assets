    "word": "God said to the serpent, \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed, and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel\" [Genesis 3:15]. There is much work to be done in the vineyard of the Lord. Never are God's workmen to accuse one another. Time is short; the end of all things is at hand. Our work is not to repress and hinder, but to encourage and restore. All who will cooperate with the Redeemer in bruising the head of the serpent will be doing the work which the Lord has appointed them. But God has not given men the least intimation that they are to bruise their fellowmen. Their warfare is to be directed against the power of Satan. Those who cooperate with Christ will give no place to the devil but, uniting under the blood-stained banner of Price Emmanuel, will repress every evil word and work. They are never to use their power to weaken the influence of those who are trying to work for God.",
