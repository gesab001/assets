    "word": "Love Not The World. \n\n     30. Every worker should diligently search his own heart. The Lord requires that those who are purchased by the blood of the Son of God should realize that they are God's property, and no longer look upon themselves as their own, and live to serve themselves. Jesus gave his life to save an apostate race, and will those who accept this heavenly gift be selfish, and withhold from the Lord his own? All selfishness, all love of supremacy, originated with Satan. He is the root, and those who partake of his spirit are the branches; but in the day of God both root and branch will be consumed. No one can live a selfish life and enjoy the love of Jesus. Those who are determined to grasp the world's treasures will \"fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\" Can we wonder that \n                                                                           45\nthe sin of covetousness is so decidedly denounced in the Scripture? \"For this ye know, that no . . . covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of God.\" Covetousness is idolatry. Shall we as Christians pay no heed to all the warnings of God? Shall we still be in conformity to the world, when it is forbidden in the Word of God? \"Be not conformed to this world.\" \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\"",
