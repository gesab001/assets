    "word": "To follow Christ is not freedom from conflict. It is not child's play. It is not spiritual idleness. All the enjoyment in Christ's service means sacred obligations in meeting oft stern conflicts. To follow Christ means stern battles, active labor, warfare against the world, the flesh, and the devil. Our enjoyment is the victories gained for Christ in earnest, hard, warfare. . . . We are enlisted for labor, \"not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life\" (John 6:27). . . .",
