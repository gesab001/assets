    "word": "Every Christian home should have rules; and parents should, in their words and in their deportment toward each other, give to the children a precious, living example of what they desire them to be. Purity in speech, and true Christian courtesy, should be constantly practised. Let there be no encouragement of sin; no evil surmising or evil speaking. Teach the children and youth to respect themselves, to be true to God, true to principle; teach them to respect and to obey the law of God. Then these principles will control their lives, and will be carried out in their association with others. They will love their neighbors as themselves. They will create a pure atmosphere, one that will have an influence to encourage weak souls in the path that leads to holiness and heaven. Let every lesson be of an elevating, ennobling character, and the record made in the books of heaven will be such as you will not be ashamed to meet in the judgment.",
