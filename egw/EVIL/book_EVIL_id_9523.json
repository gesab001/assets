    "word": "I have not strength to dwell upon this, for I feel so strong an indignation against Satan and those who, with the Word of God in their possession, listen to the teaching of human agencies; who are intent upon declaring theories which they present as more wonderful, higher, grander than the teachings of Christ, the One who gave His life to save the world from Satan's higher education.
