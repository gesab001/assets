    "word": "The piles of rubbish that have been accumulating need to be removed. How? Let us \"cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God\" (2 Corinthians 7:1). Cultivate personal piety. God would have us inquire, \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord?\" that He may instruct us, and that we may be able to say, \"We have the mind of Christ.\" Then all the rubbish of evil words will be removed. May the Lord imbue us with His Spirit, and touch our lips with a burning coal from the altar. Earnestly, vigilantly watching and waiting and working, we are to be \"not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord\" (Romans 12:11).",
