Honor widows that are widows indeed.\" \"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.\" \"Charity [love] suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.\"",
