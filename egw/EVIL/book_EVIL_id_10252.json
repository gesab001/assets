    "word": "The three sects which in Christ's day exercised a controlling influence over the religious beliefs of the Jews were the Sadducees, Pharisees, and Essenes. These sects are mentioned as representatives of those who have not been converted. They had not been sanctified through the truth, therefore their ideas were perverse. Self was interwoven in all in which they engaged. They did not feel it to be a special part of their religious program to be one with Christ. Christian fellowship with one another was not an active principle in their lives. Against all whom they supposed did not keep the letter of the law, they cherished the evil of jealousy.",
