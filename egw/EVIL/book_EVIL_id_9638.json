    "word": "The mother said it was so unlike her child that she thought she was possessed of an evil spirit. She said, \"Since that time I have never recommended anyone who wanted a situation or any invalid to go to the Sanitarium. I could not even take the Good Health. I feel so disappointed that I should have a child of mine thus transformed. I thought Mrs. G so motherly, so good a woman. If I had had twenty children, I would not have hesitated a moment to have placed them under her care.\" The tears rolled down her cheeks. Said she, \"The work is done, I fear, for time and eternity, and I cannot undo it, but I prayed, oh, so earnestly, that God would save my children [even] if through sickness and dread death.\" I tried to present to the mother as favorably as I could the more pleasant prospect, but she only looked grieved and despairingly said, \"They have ruined my child. I never can feel that they have done right even in their intention. I hoped you could do something to prevent this state of things.\" She knew not how much I had done.--Ms 2, 1882. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. October 27, 1982",
