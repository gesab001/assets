    "word": "At this crisis all are called upon to take their position. We must stand apart from those who are determined to make shipwreck of the faith. We must not sell our Lord at any price. We are to refuse to listen to the sophistries that have been brought in to make of no effect the truth for this time. Not a stone is to be moved in the foundation of this truth--not a pillar moved. . . . The time has come when even in the church and in our institutions, some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. But God will keep that which is committed to Him. . . . Through those who depart from the faith the power of the enemy will be exercised, to lead others astray.--Letter 237, 1904, pp. 5, 6. (To Brother Butler, July 14, 1904.)",
