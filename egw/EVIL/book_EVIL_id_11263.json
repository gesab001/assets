    "word": "Here are represented the great white throne and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away. Let every teacher consider that he is doing his work in the sight of the universe of heaven. Every child with whom the teacher is brought in contact has been purchased by the blood of God's only begotten Son, and he who has died for these children would have them treated as his property. Be sure that your contact, teachers, with every one of these children shall be of that character that will not make you ashamed when you meet them in that great day when every word and action are brought in review before God, and with its burden of results laid open before you individually. \"Bought with a price.\" O what a price eternity alone will reveal! The Lord Jesus Christ hath infinite tenderness for those whom he has purchased at the cost of his own suffering in the flesh, that they should not perish with the devil and his angels, but that he can claim them as his chosen ones. They are the claim of his love, his own property, and he looks upon them with unutterable affection; and the fragrance of his own righteousness he gives to his loved ones who believe in him. It requires tact and wisdom and human love, and sanctified affection for the precious lambs of the flock, to lead them to see and appreciate their privilege in yielding themselves up to the tender guidance of the faithful shepherds. The children of God will exercise the gentleness of Jesus Christ.",
