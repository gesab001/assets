    "word": "The children of God are to appreciate and love that which Christ loves, and His saints are to be one in sympathy, as He, Christ, is one with the Father. They are not to draw apart from one another and work away from the prayer of Christ, and associate with worldlings, willing to be divided and stand apart from God's chosen ones, while they link up in bonds with unbelievers. In this they are showing what manner of spirit they are of, speaking bitterness to one another, thinking evil of one another, yet expiating largely on the sympathies \n\n\n                                   -239- \n\nto be bestowed on those who hate God and the truth. All uncharitableness is to be excluded, and God's people are to be bound together in the holy bonds of unselfish love.",
