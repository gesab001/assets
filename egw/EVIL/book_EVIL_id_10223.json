    "word": "Here we come to the Thousand Mile Tree, on which hangs a sign giving us the distance from Omaha. And a little further on we pass the wonderful rocks called the Devil's Slide. This is composed of two parallel walls of granite standing upon their edges, with about 14 feet of space between. They form a wall about 800 feet long, running up the side of the mountain. This looks as if formed by art and placed in position, so regularly are they laid. This is a wonderful sight, but we reach Ogden and night draws on.",
