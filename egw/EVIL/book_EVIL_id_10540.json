    "word": "Those who transgress the law of God are teaching their children to show disrespect for this law and to rebel against the Lawgiver. They place their children in the enemy's ranks, where they are cut off from the blessings of God's covenant and are brought under His judgments. If parents die while they are transgressors of God's law, their children will be inclined to do as they have done. By precept and example children of ungodly parents receive an education in evil-doing. When their measure of disobedience and transgression is full, God reckons with them. Both parents and children are held accountable for their idolatry. God bears long with perverse resistance, but He will surely punish iniquity.",
