Olsen\n\n                                           O - 55 -1894 \n\n                                           Norfolk Villa, Prospect Hill, \n                                           Granville, New South Wales \n\nDear Brother Olsen:- \n     I have very tender feelings toward you. I understand how you are placed in relation to the work, and I pray for you, and believe God will lead you and guide you; but I felt the time had come for me to stand in God, and Him alone. The councils at Battle Creek treat me after their own ideas, as they have treated others and will continue to do this until they are converted; and if the enemy could depress and discourage me through their course of action, he would exult. I have not had the sympathy or the faith and confidence of some men who compose your councils; therefore I shall not feel under restraints which they wish to impose upon me. If they could see things in a correct light they would see and understand that I have a connection and an experience with the work that not one of them have; that their constant suspicion, jealousies, and evil surmisings are standing directly in their own way of spiritual advancement, as well as proving a decided hindrance to me.",
