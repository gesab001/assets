    "word": "The time has come when every advantage to be gained for the furtherance of the work should be recognized, for we need all the strength we can obtain. Christ is soon coming, and Satan knows that his time is short. As we draw near to the close of time the cities will become more and more corrupt, and more and more objectionable as places for establishing centers of our work. The dangers of travel will increase, confusion and drunkenness will abound. If there can be found places in retired mountain regions where it would be difficult for the evils of the cities to enter, let our people secure such places for our sanitariums and advanced schools. The two institutions may be far enough apart so that there need be no confusion.",
