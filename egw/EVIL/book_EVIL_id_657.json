    "word": "As children of God, we should make earnest efforts to be overcomers, and as students seeking to honor and glorify God, we should study to show ourselves approved unto God, workmen that need not to be ashamed. The workman for God should make earnest efforts to become a representative of Christ, discarding all uncomely gestures, and uncouth speech. O that the youth who are now forming their habits would seek to attain perfection! They should seek to use correct language, and though there are a large class who are careless in the way they speak, yet by careful, painstaking attention, they may become representatives of the truth. Every day they should make advancement and not detract from their usefulness and influence by cherishing defects of manner, tone, or language. Through close watchfulness, and earnest discipline, the Christian youth may keep his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no \n                                                                           124\nguile. Common, cheap expressions should be replaced by sound and pure words, and we should be careful not to give an incorrect pronunciation of our words. There are men among us who in theory know better than to use incorrect language, yet in practice they make frequent mistakes. The Lord would have us careful to do our best, making wise use of our faculties and opportunities. The Lord has endowed men with gifts whereby they are to bless and edify others, and it is our duty to so educate ourselves that we may be best fitted for the great work committed to us.",
