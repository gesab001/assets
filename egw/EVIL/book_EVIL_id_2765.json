While life is the inheritance of the righteous, death is the portion of the wicked. Moses declared to Israel: \u201cI have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.\u201d Deuteronomy 30:15. The death referred to in these scriptures is not that pronounced upon Adam, for all mankind suffer the penalty of his transgression. It is \u201cthe second death\u201d that is placed in contrast with everlasting life. . . .",
