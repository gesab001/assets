    "word": "Old Testament history agrees perfectly with the New. After light has come to us through the Scripture, we are inexcusable if we do not walk in the light; for an unseen influence is drawing the soul to obedience, that it may bear witness to the truth. \"He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. . . . And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those \n\n\n                   -13- \n\nthings that are pleasing in his sight. And this is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another as he gave us commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\"                      E. G. White. Jan. 11, 1897. \n\n                                               -",
