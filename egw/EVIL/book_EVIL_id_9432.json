    "word": "During the entire life of Christ He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and had to endure the contradiction of sinners against Himself. His own nation was the most embittered against Him. The chief priests and the elders had the most to say. It was they, the most professedly pious, who declared, \"He cast out devils through Beelzebub the chief of devils.\" (Luke 11:15.) But they could not through their opposition stop Him in His work. Evidences multiplied daily of His divine power as He wrought in curing the sick and raising the dead. They then assigned these mighty works to the power of a demon. Can I expect any better lot than the divine Son of God? Shall I complain? God forbid. If my work does not stand in God, let it come to naught. If it be of God, man's hatred and opposition cannot overthrow it.",
