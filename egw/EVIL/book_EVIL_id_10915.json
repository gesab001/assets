    "word": "Let all who sit in counsel and in committee meetings write in his heart the words, I am working for time and for eternity.

Let the prayer of the psalmist go up to God, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the doors of my lips. Incline not my hand to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties.",
