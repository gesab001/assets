    "word": "Physical healing is bound up with the gospel commission. When Christ sent His disciples out on their first missionary journey, He bade them, \"As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\" Matthew 10:7, 8. And when at the close of His earthly ministry He gave them their commission, He said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; \n                                                                           498\nthey shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" Mark 16:17, 18.",
