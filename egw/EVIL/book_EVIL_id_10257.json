    "word": "There is a religion that is worth less to the possessor. Those who possess it come to the house of God with those that claim to believe the truth. They hear, and return to their homes to drink their tea and stimulate themselves by this beverage. Then they think that they can talk. But as they are not spiritually minded, as the love of Christ is not in their hearts, they have nothing profitable to bring from the treasure house. Evil thinking and evil speaking is a part of their religion. They let their light \"so shine\" that they criticize the speaker and the words spoken by the servant of God. They sow seeds of evil in the minds of those who hear them, and their sentiments are reproduced by other minds.",
