    "word": "\"Take my yoke upon you.\" When you yoke up with Christ, as colaborers with Him, you are learners, not dictators. Christ does the dictating. You may be the human agent to diffuse light to the world. Be careful that you do not gather in the darkness of the devil and call it the wisdom from above. The Spirit of Christ alone, a living principle abiding in the soul, gives competence for the task of being laborers together with God. The Lord Jesus Christ takes man into the firm, and makes him co-partner with Himself in saving the souls of men.",
