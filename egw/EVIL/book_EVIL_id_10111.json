    "word": "\"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves; . . . for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him a drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good\" [Romans 12:9, 10, 14-21]. It is never best to draw off or to be hostile toward those who are suspicious and unjust toward you.",
