    "word": "In the warfare between good and evil, the Lord requires each one to remain faithful to his post of duty. If this is the home, take hold earnestly and willingly to make home a pleasant place. If your duty lies in the kitchen, seek to be a perfect cook. Prepare food which will be healthful, nourishing, and appetizing, so that the members of the family need not resort to stimulants of any kind. This is true missionary work.",
