    "word": "A. T. JONES--WHAT I HAVE THIS AFTERNOON IS FOR THE WHOLE BOARD, AND THAT IS WHY I WISHED THE WHOLE BOARD HERE. I AM SORRY BROTHER LANE IS NOT HERE. I HAVE ASKED BROTHER ROGERS TO TAKE DOWN EVERYTHING THAT IS SAID OR READ, AND ESPECIALLY WHAT IS SAID, SO THAT THERE MAY BE NO QUESTION \n                                                                           2\nAS TO JUST EXACTLY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BY ME. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME THINGS MAY BE SAID THAT YOU DO NOT EXPECT, AND THEY MAY BE A LITTLE SURPRISING. I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF SOME THINGS WILL BE READ THAT WILL BE SURPRISING; BUT WHAT WILL BE READ IS ALL THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD; AND HOWEVER SURPRISING THAT MAY BE, IT MUST STAND, OF COURSE. IN WHAT I SHALL SAY, I INTEND TO TELL THE TRUTH JUST AS IT IS. I DO NOT INTEND TO ATTACH BLAME TO ANYBODY; BUT I DO INTEND TO STATE FACTS AND THE TRUTH JUST AS THEY ARE, AND WHEREVER THEY APPLY; IF ANYBODY WANTS TO LOCATE THE BLAME, HE CAN DO IT HIMSELF. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO STATE THE FACTS AND THE TRUTH JUST AS THEY ARE.  {PH146 1.10}  \n     BEFORE THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF 1897, THE TESTIMONIES HAD BEEN SPEAKING A LONG TIME ABOUT ROBBERY AND OPPRESSION IN THE REVIEW AND HERALD OFFICE, AND NAMED CERTAIN MEN. THE MEN CONNECTED WITH THESE MATTERS AT THAT TIME, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT WERE NAMED, WERE NOT RETAINED IN POSITIONS ANY MORE. THE TESTIMONIES CALLED FOR REFORM, FOR THE INSTITUTION TO BE DELIVERED FROM THE EVILS IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN ENWRAPPED BY THE WRONG PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED BY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN HERE FORMERLY; AND NOW IT IS NEARLY TWO YEARS SINCE THIS OCCURRED, AND THE TESTIMONIES STILL COME, SAYING THAT THAT THING HAS NOT BEEN DONE. AND THAT IS NOT THE WORST OF IT: NOT ONLY CORRECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE, BUT THE SAME EVIL THINGS ARE BEING CARRIED ON TODAY.",
