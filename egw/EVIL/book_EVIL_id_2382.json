    "word": "\"If thy brother shall trespass against thee,\" Christ declared, \"go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.\" Do not tell others of the wrong. One person is told, then another, and still another; and continually the report grows, and the evil increases, till the whole church is made to suffer. Settle the matter \"between thee and him alone.\" This is God's plan.",
