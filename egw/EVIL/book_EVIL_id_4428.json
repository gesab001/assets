    "word": "Christ illustrates the willingness of God to bless by the willingness of a father to grant the request of his child. He says, \u201cIf a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly \n220\nFather give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him? Luke 11:11-13.",
