    "word": "Parents, it is your duty to have your children under perfect subjection, having all their passions and evil tempers perfectly subdued. I saw that if they were carried to the house of God, they should be made to know where they are, that they are not at home, but where God meets with His people. They should be kept quiet, from all play and running about, then God will deign to meet with His people.",
