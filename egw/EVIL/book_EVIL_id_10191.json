    "word": "I do not think it is best to urge you to take hold at the Health Retreat, for you feel no burden. Therefore I think you would do positive harm, and then this would confirm your faithless utterances. If you have no burden of the matter, then we do not \n\n\n                                     -120- \n\nwant you. The Lord has shown me in a distinct manner that you were not influenced by the right spirit in leaving the institution when you did. Thus it stands registered in the books of heaven, and I was shown that you were not of the right mind and judgment. You are inclined to fanatical sentiments on some things, and you regard your strong feelings as presentiments from the Lord, when He has nothing to do with it. Now, please stop walking in this unsanctified independence and self-confidence, for it will prove your ruin unless you see the evil and repent of it and submit to follow the way of the Lord.",
