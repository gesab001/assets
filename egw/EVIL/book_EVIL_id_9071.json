    "word": "There is but little use in encouraging their desire for baptism and uniting with the church; for it would only have a tendency to make them hypocrites.

She knows you think she errs, that you see her errors, and this makes her miserable. It becomes you to have patience, yet to take a position in your family, and to do what you can, to remedy the evil your weak judgment has brought about.",
