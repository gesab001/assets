    "word": "MORE PRAYER NEEDED AS THE END APPROACHES.\u2014Confederacies will increase in number and power as we draw nearer to the end of time. These confederacies will create opposing influences to the truth, forming new parties of professed believers who will act out their own delusive theories. The apostasy will increase. \u201cSome shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils\u201d (1 Timothy 4:1). Men and women have confederated to oppose the Lord God of heaven, and the church is only half awake to the situation. There needs to be much more of prayer, much more of earnest effort, among professed believers.\u2014(Selected Messages, bk. 2, 383.)",
