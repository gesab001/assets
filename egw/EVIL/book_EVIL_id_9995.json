    "word": "God help us to have an education in the line of thinking no evil and speaking no evil, to watch closely every tendency of the human heart, that it may be softened and subdued, and bear the fruit of kindness, love, patience, and longsuffering. Oh, that we all might look to Jesus, and say, \"Thy gentleness hath made me great.\" We want to be above all disposition to carp, to make the service of God disagreeable because of human ideas and suppositions. God is too wise to err, too good to do us harm.",
