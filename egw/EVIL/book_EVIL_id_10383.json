    "word": "What we need is truth, present truth. Let the truth shine forth in its unmeasured superiority, in all the dignity and purity that distinguishes true religion. An acquaintance with the Word of God will strengthen us to resist evil. Hold up the cross of Calvary. This will rebuke heathen philosophy and pagan idolatry. Lift up the cross of Calvary higher and still higher as the identified reality of Christianity. Let all our works, our every enterprise, show forth the sacred principles of the gospel.",
