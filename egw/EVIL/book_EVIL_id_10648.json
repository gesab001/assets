    "word": "Jesus cannot say \"Peace be unto you,\" unless all bickering and dissension, jealousy and evil surmisings shall cease. I was burdened greatly. I knew not what I could do.

They could not let the beams of light shine upon others in love, faith, trust in God, forbearance, goodness, and purity.",
