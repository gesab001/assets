    "word": "At the time, Christ was surrounded with the sick, and with those who desired forgiveness of sin. Instead of immediately answering John's disciples, He turned to the multitude. The arm mighty to save was made bare. He spoke, and the deaf heard His voice. He touched the eyes of the blind, and they were opened to behold the blessed light of day. At His word fever was rebuked. He looked on the dying, and they were brought back to life and health. The frenzied demoniac was freed from the power of evil spirits, and fell down and worshiped the Deliverer, declaring Him to be the Christ of God.",
