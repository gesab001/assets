    "word": "I ask myself the question, \"How is it possible for men who are opening the Scriptures to others--men who have abundance of light, men who have good ability, men who are living as in the face of the judgment, upon the very borders of the eternal world--to give their thoughts and bodies to unholy practices?\" Well may the words of the apostle be repeated with emphasis: \"Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up\" [James 4:8-10]. \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is \n\n\n                                     -386- \n\ntried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: [Some have argued thus, and thought that for certain reasons they have of their own, God would have them take the course they did.] for God cannot be tempted of evil, neither tempteth He any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death\" [James 1:12-15].",
