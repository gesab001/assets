    "word": "True conversion to the message of present truth embraces conversion to the principles of health reform. \"I, if I be lifted up,\" said Christ, \"will draw all men unto Me.\" Men who in their unconverted state are controlled by human ambitions and human passions, will, through faith in the sacrifice made in their behalf, embrace the terms of discipleship.
