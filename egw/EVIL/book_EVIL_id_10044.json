    "word": "In the name of the Lord I ask you to awaken to your responsibilities and take up your work in the right way, with honest, earnest endeavor. Use your talents for good, and not for evil. Christ invites you, \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light\" [Matthew 11:29, 30]. All the Lord asks is a faithful discharge of the duties revealed in His holy Word. From the lowliest to those occupying the highest positions, each one is required to fill his appointed place. The interest the Lord expects is proportionate to the capital entrusted.",
