    "word": "There is such a thing as leaning heavily on men and lightly on God. Those in charge of our schools should put into active service every talent possessed by the students that can be used for the help of the school. When this is done as it should be, it will be found that students will not hanker for football, tennis, and other amusements. What the students need to be taught is how to make themselves as useful as possible wherever they may be placed. They should learn how to adapt themselves to the work in hand. Christ says, \"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\". . . . \n\n\n                                     -198-",
