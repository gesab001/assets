    "word": "The fact that Christ when He was on this earth was a healer of all manner of disease, is an encouragement and hope amid the moral sickness and evil that prevails; and we should do far more as physicians and nurses, as ministers of righteousness, if, instead of looking down into the grave, we fixed our gaze upon the mighty Healer. Whatever the disorder may be, the glories of the heavenly will do more for the saving of body and soul than all the drug medication in the world, than all the terrors of the grave will do if kept before the helpless and apparently hopeless.",
