    "word": "There are many, many afflicted in our world with tobacco poison, but the physicians who are summoned to treat their patients under painful afflictions brought upon them by tobacco using,--are not instructed by these worldly physicians to let the poisons alone, in order that they may recover health; for many of these physicians use these poisons themselves. How can they, then, consistently enlighten the understanding of those who indulge in the poisonous narcotic, tobacco? The physician, if he is not a novice, can trace the effects back to the true cause, but he dares not forbid its use, because he indulges in it himself. Some will in an undecided, halfway manner advise the tobacco users to take less of this narcotic; but he does not say to them, This habit is killing you. They prescribe drugs to cure a disease which is the result of indulging unnatural appetites, and two evils are produced in the place of removing one.",
