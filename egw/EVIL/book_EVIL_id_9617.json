    "word": "Men often commit wrong through ignorance or want of judgment. In many instances there is no premeditated wrong; it is caused through a lack of thoughtfulness. The one who treats this as sin is himself a sinner. There is with many a keen imagination that makes them offender for a word or action. But often the one judged is innocent in the sight of God. The accuser, who has permitted the tempter to ruffle his feelings, needs to humble his soul before God, to be purified and refined by the Holy Spirit, to love as brethren, be kind, be courteous. The promise to all is, \"Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you: (James 4:7). If one errs, remember that this is no more than you yourself have done. Put away evil surmisings. Christ says, \"All ye are brethren\" (Matthew 23:8).",
