    "word": "Brother Albert Day, I was pointed back and shown some things in the past. I was shown that you had moved injudiciously while your wife lived, in frequently visiting Sister Johnson. There was a wrong in this matter, and these things caused your wife much secret sorrow and sadness. She had the utmost confidence in your integrity, yet she did not feel at ease. The appearance was evil. You have been infatuated with Sister Johnson. She has insinuated herself into your favor. She was not right; her heart was not right; her thoughts were not right.",
