    "word": "Another danger: there are tramps everywhere, and evil, dissolute characters who will do wicked works, and ruin and kill, because they have given themselves to Satan's power. I would therefore be very cautious how in any way you are unguarded. For Satan has come down in great power. He is represented as going about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. These things must be considered. . . . If you feel that it is your work to canvass, and that you can do good in that line, I remove all my objections, but not my cautions that every precaution should be taken against exposing you to danger. This I must insist upon.--Lt 4, 1902.",
