    "word": "In this perilous day of evil, when allurements to vice and corruption are on every hand, let the earnest, heartfelt cry of the young be raised to heaven: \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\" And may his ears be open and his heart inclined to obey the instruction given in the answer: \"By taking heed thereto according to thy word.\" The only safety for the youth in this age of pollution is to make God their trust. Without divine help they will be unable to control human passions and appetites. In Christ is the very help needed.",
