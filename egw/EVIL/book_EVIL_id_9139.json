    "word": "Basel, Sept. 26, 1885. Rainy morning. The early morning meeting was appointed at six o'clock. I had been so burdened I spent some time in prayer. I could not sleep much. I felt unable to attend the morning ministers' meeting, but felt that I should lose a blessing if I remained away. We found twenty-three assembled in a small room. I opened the meeting with prayer and the Lord indeed came preciously near unto me and apparently to all those assembled. Brother Bourdeau then prayed and confessed his weakness in yielding to the temptations of the devil. He made a more full surrender to God and was coming to the light, and light from God was coming into his heart. The prayers offered were fervent and in brokenness of heart, with weeping, and the blessing of the Lord was in our midst.",
