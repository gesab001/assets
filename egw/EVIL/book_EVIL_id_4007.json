    "word": "The opinion which prevails in some classes of society, that religion is not conducive to health or to happiness in this life, is one of the most mischievous of errors. The Scripture says: \u201cThe fear of the Lord tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied\u201d (Proverbs 19:23). \u201cWhat man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it\u201d (Psalm 34:12-14). The words of wisdom \u201care life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh\u201d (Proverbs 4:22).",
