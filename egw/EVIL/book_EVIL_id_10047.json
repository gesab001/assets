    "word": "The eye of God is in every place. He knows all our temptations, and He expects us to resist them as He resisted the devil. We must have sound principles, pure, elevated, ennobling; these we can take with us into the eternal world. As a divine Saviour, Jesus died for us that we might live His life of purity, truth, and righteousness. He teaches us how to live. Our prayer should be, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\"",
