    "word": "Could our eyes be opened we should see forms of evil angels around us, trying to invent some new way to annoy and destroy us. And we should also see the angels of God guarding us from their power; for God's watchful eye is over Israel for good, and he will protect and save his people, if they put their trust in him. And when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.",
