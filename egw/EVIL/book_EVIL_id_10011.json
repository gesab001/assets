    "word": "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we now call upon all who have been in this position to consider and inquire, Am I working for Christ or the devil? God would have every man so thoroughly identified with the Word of the living God--which means true faith in the last message of mercy, the last call to sinners given to our world--that we shall demonstrate in character that we are one with Christ, that we share in the very same love that Christ expressed, that the Father loves the believing ones even as He loves His Son. He has become a \n\n\n                                 -132- \n\npartaker of His peace, His joy, His glory. This determines our true loyalty to God. It involves the highest possible measurement of character, of Christlikeness. [Ephesians 1:3-7, quoted.]",
