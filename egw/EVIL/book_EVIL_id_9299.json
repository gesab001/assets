    "word": "Let there be no oddities or eccentricities of movement on the part of those who speak the word of truth; for such things will weaken the impression that should be made by the Word. We must be guarded; for Satan is determined, if possible, to intermingle with religious services his evil influence. Let there be no theatrical display; for this will not help to strengthen belief in the Word of God. Rather it will divert attention to the human instrument.",
