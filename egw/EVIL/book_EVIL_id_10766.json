    "word": "In Christ's work there can be no neutrality, no middle ground He declared, \"He that is not with me, is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\" Jesus saw and read like an open book the motives which actuated those before him, whose consciences pronounced them guilty. The great controversy was waxing strong. Christ was not warring against finite men, but against principalities and powers, against spiritual wickedness in high places. He tells his hearers that all manner of sin and blasphemy may be forgiven if done in ignorance. In their great blindness they might speak words of insult and derision against the Son of man, and yet be within the boundary of mercy. But when the power and Spirit of God rested upon his messengers \n                                                                           912\nthey were on holy ground. To ignore the Spirit of God, to charge it with being the Spirit of the devil, placed them in a position where God had no power to reach their souls. No power in any of God's provisions to correct the erring can reach them.",
