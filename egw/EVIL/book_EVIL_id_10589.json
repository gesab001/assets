    "word": "While you are never to cloak evil or lessen the sense of wrong, you should always be filled with the spirit of the great medical missionary. Your words are not to be harsh or abrupt. In a Christlike manner you should reprove those who need reproof. Never should your efforts have a corroding, destructive influence upon minds. You need to cherish the gracious, sanctifying, ennobling influence of the Saviour, else the food you offer to the people will taste so strangely of the human dish that it will be unpalatable.",
