    "word": "But mortals were not abandoned to the results of the evil they had chosen. In the sentence pronounced upon Satan was given an intimation of redemption. \u201cI will put enmity between thee and the woman,\u201d God said, \u201cand between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel\u201d (Genesis 3:15). This sentence, spoken in the hearing of our first parents, was to them a promise. Before they heard of the thorn and the thistle, of the toil and sorrow that must be their portion, or of the dust to which they must return, they listened to words that could not fail of giving them hope. All that had been lost by yielding to Satan could be regained through Christ.",
