    "word": "Here are the two great principles--love to God and love to our neighbor. Upon these two principles hang all the law and the prophets. Those who fail in their fulfillment of these vital principles, though they profess a knowledge of the truth, though they preach the Word and understand all mysteries, \"shall eat of the fruit of their own doings, and be filled with their own devices.\" Those who cherish suspicion and imagine evil, reveal that they are not carrying out the principles of this law; and they pursue a course which brings upon themselves the evils which they imagine. God will not be trifled with. His word is to be cherished and obeyed.",
