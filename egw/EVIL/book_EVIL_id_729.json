    "word": "30\n \n     The President Sets the Example--You refer to your office as President of the General Conference, as if this justifies your course of action, which you deemed wholly right, but which, from the light the Lord has been pleased to give me, I deem to be wrong in some respects.  The very fact that you are standing in a position of responsibility I urge upon you as the reason why you should show a forbearing, courteous, Christlike spirit at all times and under all circumstances.  Your brethren in the ministry who respect you and your office, will be very apt to follow your example in the treatment of such cases.  You are to be an example to your brethren, worthy of imitation.  Your words, your spirit, your deportment, even the manner in which you treat your brethren are sowing seeds for good or evil.  It is both your privilege and duty, especially in your position of trust, to be like-minded with God; then you will be strong in His strength and meek and humble as a little child.",
