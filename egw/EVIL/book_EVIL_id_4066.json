    "word": "When Satan is permitted to mold the will, he uses it to accomplish his ends. . . . He stirs up the evil propensities, awakening unholy passions and ambitions. He says, \"All this power, these honors, and riches, and sinful pleasures, will I give thee\"; but his conditions are that integrity shall be yielded, conscience blunted. Thus he degrades the human faculties, and brings them into captivity to sin.",
