    "word": "Said Jesus, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\" Jesus here seeks to impress upon Nicodemus the positive necessity of the influence of the Spirit of God upon the human heart to purify it preparatory to the development of a righteous and symmetrical character. \"Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.\" This fountain of the heart being purified, the stream thereof becomes pure.",
