    "word": "It is not money alone, nor talent, nor learning, nor opportunities, which the church needs so much as simple, earnest, confiding faith. Possessing this, and working in faith and love wherever they can find anything to do, the followers of Christ may fulfill His great commission to speed the gospel to all nations. Neither the arguments of most able men who are wise in this world, the opposition of the skeptic, the bold revilings of the scoffer, nor the cold, carnal security of the world, will be able to stand before the truth presented in meekness and in the power of Christ. The toil and sacrifice of a united, consecrated church, laboring in faith and love, will advance the truth and have a transforming power upon the world.",
