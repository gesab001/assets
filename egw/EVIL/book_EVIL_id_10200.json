    "word": "I wish I could see Brother M straightforward, unselfish, his mind and will clean, sanctified through the truth, and every capability used to serve the Lord. Nothing would give me greater joy than to see a soul that is in peril become sensitive to the influence of the Holy Spirit. But Brother M needs the sentiments of truth to refine, purify, and ennoble the mind and the heart, the will and the purposes, that he may make himself an honor to the cause of God. In his present condition, the leaven of disaffection is at work. And when such a spirit shall be brought into the office, others will be leavened with evil. His influence in the office would be such that the souls of the apprentices serving under him would be imperiled.",
