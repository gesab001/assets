    "word": "Would that we could comprehend the significance of the words, \"Christ suffered, being tempted.\" While He was free from the taint of sin, the refined sensibilities of His holy nature rendered contact with evil unspeakably painful to him. Yet with human nature upon Him, He met the arch-apostate face to face, and single-handed withstood the foe of His throne. Not even by a thought could Christ be brought to yield to the power of temptation. Satan finds in human hearts some point where he can gain a foot-hold; some sinful desire is cherished, by means of which his temptations assert their power. But Christ declared of Himself, \"The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.\" The storms of temptation burst upon Him, but they could not cause Him to swerve from His allegiance to God.--The Review and Herald, Nov. 8, 1887.",
