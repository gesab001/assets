    "word": "My sisters, avoid even the appearance of evil. In this fast age you are not safe unless you stand on your guard. Virtue and modesty are rare. I appeal to you as followers of Christ, in view of your high profession, to cherish the priceless gem of modesty. As you hope to be finally exalted to join the society of sinless angels, and to live in an atmosphere where there is not the least taint of sin, seek purity; for nothing else will abide the searching test of the day of God, and be received into a pure and holy heaven.",
