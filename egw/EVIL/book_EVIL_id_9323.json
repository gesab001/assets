    "word": "I have a message for you. During the night season I was in a meeting where you were speaking of Elder Haskell the words which your irritated imagination had been framing against him. There were evil angels in the congregation, who were presenting before you suggestions in accordance with your utterances. The human impulses were awakened, and your words revealed the venom of a heart controlled by evil angels. Had you been under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, you would have looked upon the aged servant of God with tenderness and love, seeing the good accomplished by the stern, hard, earnest, constant labors put forth by him and his wife.",
