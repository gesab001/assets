    "word": "The Lord requires those who stand under His blood-stained banner to be faithful representatives of Him in character. He requires that those who undertake to fill any office in our sanitariums shall be of the number that are designated as His peculiar people. Concerning His children He says: \"Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; having your conversation honest among the Gentiles; that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation\" [1 Peter 2:9-12].",
