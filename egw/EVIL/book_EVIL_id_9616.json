    "word": "We who have fallen through the transgression of the law of God have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. The way is open for everyone to prepare himself for the second appearing of Jesus Christ, that at His appearing we may be vindicated, having put away all evil, and having overcome through the cleansing blood of Christ. Through the intercession of Christ, the image of God is renewed in mind, and heart, and character. Through the blood of the only-begotten Son of God, we obtain redemption. We are accepted in the Beloved, made like unto Christ in character, receiving His wisdom, His righteousness, His sanctification, His redemption, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end.",
