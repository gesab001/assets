    "word": "Elder Rice could not be kept as superintendent, for he considered himself as constituting the whole board, planning and managing, buying and selling; and the board knew not the first syllable of the matter. He was incurring great expenses and without one word of advice or counsel from the board of directors. His sharp dealing with outsiders has cut off outside patronage and he seems to lack the power of discrimination. He asks all the price that is set in the terms, which is looked upon as very high for board and treatment, and if one asks for a hot water bag to be supplied with hot water, he or she is charged extra. An extra price is put on every little favor until they go away mad, vowing they will never enter the institution again and [will] tell their friends never to enter. These cases are being revealed more and more, and in a very agony of distress we have been unable to correct the evil.",
