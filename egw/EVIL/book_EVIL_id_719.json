IN STIRRING WORDS THEY CALLED UPON THE PEOPLE TO TURN FROM THEIR EVIL WAYS, GIVING ASSURANCE THAT THE LORD WOULD GRACIOUSLY RECEIVE AND BLESS THEM, AND WOULD HEAL THEIR BACKSLIDINGS. SOME OF THE WRITINGS OF THESE PROPHETS HAVE A SPECIAL APPLICATION TO THE TIME IN WHICH WE LIVE. THEY WROTE OF THINGS WHICH SHOULD \"COME TO PASS IN THE LAST DAYS,\" OR IN THE \"TIME OF THE END.\" ISAIAH 2:2; DANIEL 12:4.",
