    "word": "The young should cultivate a spirit of devotion, and piety. They cannot glorify God unless they aim constantly to the fullness of the stature of Christ--a perfect person in Christ Jesus. Let the Christian graces be and abound in you. Give to your Saviour the best and holiest affection. Render entire obedience to his will. He will accept of nothing short of this. Be not moved from your steadfastness by the jeers and scoffs of those whose minds are given to vanity. Follow your Saviour through good report and evil report. And count it all joy, and a sacred honor, to bear the cross of Christ. Jesus loves you. He died for you. Unless you seek to serve him with your undivided affections, you will fail to perfect holiness in his fear, and you will be compelled to hear at last the fearful word, Depart.",
