    "word": "-55- \n\n     Shall we not join in united effort to press back the tide of evil that is making our world a Sodom? Shall we not put away all filthiness of the flesh, perfecting holiness in the sight of God? That is what we want to do. We hear much of holiness and sanctification; but it is a tainted holiness, one that tramples on the law of God. It does not teach obedience to God's holy law. But we law-keepers are the ones who need to perfect holiness in the sight of God, to reveal to the world. The way to reveal God to the world is to rejoice, and praise Him for what He has done for you.",
