    "word": "In the final execution of the judgment it will be seen that no cause for sin exists. When the Judge of all the earth shall demand of Satan, \"Why hast thou rebelled against Me, and robbed Me of the subjects of My kingdom?\" the originator of evil can render no excuse. Every mouth will be stopped, and all the hosts of rebellion will be speechless. . . . The whole universe will have become witnesses to the nature and results of sin. And its utter extermination, which in the beginning would have brought fear to angels and dishonor to God, will now vindicate His love and establish His honor before the universe. . . . Never will evil again be manifest. Says the Word of God, \"Affliction shall not rise up the second time.\" Nahum 1:9. . . . A tested and proved creation will never again be turned from allegiance to Him whose character has been fully manifested before them.",
