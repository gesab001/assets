    "word": "Thus saith the Lord: I have a work for Dr. Kellogg to do, but he is not to go beyond the work given him. The Lord loves him, and will save him if he will \n\n\n                                   -161- \n\nwalk humbly with Him. But no yokes are to be framed by himself or any other man for God's people. Tell Brethren Sharp and Caro that they must not give their signatures to the terms made. The future is in God's hands. He does not encourage any binding about of His workmen. Let man fear and tremble to place himself where God should be. Let man keep his hands off of his fellow workmen. Strange things will take place. The Lord will turn and overturn. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.--Ms 175, 1899. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 12, 1988. Entire Ms.",
