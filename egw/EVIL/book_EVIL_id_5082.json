    "word": "Persecution cannot do more than cause death, but the life is preserved to eternal life and glory. The persecuting power may take its stand, and command the disciples of Christ to deny the faith, to give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, by making void the law of God. But the disciples may ask, \"Why should I do this? I love Jesus, and I will never deny His name.\" When the power says, \"I will call you a disturber of the peace,\" they may answer, \"Thus they called Jesus, who was truth, and grace and peace.\"--Letter 116, 1896.",
