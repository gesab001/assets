    "word": "Chapter 7 \u2014Prayer And Obedience \n\nPRAY AND WORK.\u2014We are not to sit in calm expectancy of oppression and tribulation, and fold our hands, doing nothing to avert the evil. Let our united cries be sent up to heaven. Pray and work, and work and pray. But let none act rashly. Learn as never before that you must be meek and lowly in heart.\u2014(Selected Messages, bk. 2, 370, 371.)",
