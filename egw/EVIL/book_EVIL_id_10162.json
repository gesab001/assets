Z.) \n\n\n     I have had during the past night some things represented before me, and I have risen early at four o'clock to trace out in writing for the benefit of your family. The angel of God said, \"Follow me.\" I seemed to be in a room in a rude building, and there were several young men playing cards. They seemed to be very intent upon the amusement in which they were engaged and were so engrossed that they did not seem to notice that anyone had entered the room.",
