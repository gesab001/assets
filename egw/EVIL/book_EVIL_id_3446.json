    "word": "The eternal God has drawn the line of distinction between the saint and the sinner, between converted and unconverted. The two classes do not blend into each other imperceptibly, like the colors of a rainbow, but are as distinct as midday and midnight. God's people cannot with safety enter into intimate associations with those who know the truth, but do not practice it. The patriarch Jacob, when speaking of certain deeds of his sons, which he contemplated with horror, exclaimed, \"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly mine honor, be not thou united.\" He felt that his own honor would be compromised if he associated with sinners in their doings. He lifted the danger signal, warning us to shun wrong associations, lest we become tainted with evil. And the Holy Spirit, through the apostle Paul, utters a similar warning, \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.\" --The Youth's Instructor, February 4, 1897. \n                                                                           391",
