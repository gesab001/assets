    "word": "\"Not finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words.\" Then whose words will you speak? The very words that Christ has given to comfort, to encourage, to bless, to lift up those that are bowed down. God has given you a mind, that you may speak words to help others. Do not feed it with trash. Do not injure it by the use of tobacco or alcohol. None of us have any too much mind, and we should do our utmost to improve that which we have. We cannot afford to allow the mind to be dominated by evil for one moment, for thus we might lose an opportunity to speak a word in season to some soul ready to perish. The responsibility of winning souls to Christ rests upon us, and we must work for their salvation. We are not to speak our own words, working for our own personal benefit; we are to study how best to relieve the suffering and the oppressed, how best to help the needy and distressed.",
