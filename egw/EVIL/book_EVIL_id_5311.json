Verses 17, 18.  {ExV 39.12} \n     Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.  {ExV 39.13} \n     Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now, for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:  {ExV 39.14} \n     That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:5-7.  {ExV 39.15} \n     For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 3:8.  {ExV 39.16} \n     And these signs shall follow them that believe; in my \n40\nname shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  {ExV 39.17} \n     They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. Mark 16:17, 18.",
