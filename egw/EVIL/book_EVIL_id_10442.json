    "word": "Oh, evil things come in between me and the Saviour. It is the hellish shadow of Satan. I see that shadow and darkness; shall I fall under it? Well, when I was coming in the cars in the evening and in the night season I looked at the moon, there was a whole bank of clouds it went into. Now, I thought, we will see what that moon does. I kept my eyes upon it, and soon I began to see that there was a bright, brightness coming into the cloud. The darkness of the cloud did not put out the moon nor its light, but the light kept shining. The moon in its brightness began to scatter and lighten and brighten the darkness until it rolled back and revealed the glory and light of the moon, and then its glory lighted up the clouds all around us. There is what we want to be.",
