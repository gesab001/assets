    "word": "There is a blind affection that gives the children the privilege of doing as they please. But to allow a child to follow his natural impulses is to allow him to deteriorate and to become proficient in evil. Wise parents will not say to their children, \"Follow your own choice; go where you will, and do what you will;\" but, \"Listen to the instruction of the Lord.\" Wise rules and regulations must be made and enforced, that the beauty of the home life may not be spoiled.",
