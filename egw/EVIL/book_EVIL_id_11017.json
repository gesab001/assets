    "word": "\"Ask and it shall be given you,\" the Saviour declared; \"seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; for everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. Or what man is there, if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven, give good things to them that ask Him? Therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. \n\n\n                            -282-",
