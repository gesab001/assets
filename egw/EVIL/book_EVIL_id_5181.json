    "word": "The Divine Touch Needed.--The gospel is now resolutely opposed on every hand. Never was the confederacy of evil greater than at the present time. The spirits of darkness are combining with human agencies to set them firmly against the commandments of God.

We need the divine touch (RH March 19, 1895).",
