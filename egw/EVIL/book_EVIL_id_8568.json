    "word": "The Waiting Harvest \n\n     In every place the temperance question is to be made more prominent. Drunkenness, and the crime that always follows drunkenness, calls for the voice to be raised to combat this evil. Christ sees a plentiful harvest waiting to be gathered in. Souls are hungering for the truth, thirsting for the water of life. Many are on the very verge of the kingdom, waiting only to be gathered in.--K-10-1899.",
