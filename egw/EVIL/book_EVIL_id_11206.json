    "word": "Jesus connected John, Peter, and Judas with him in his work, making them colaborers with him, and at the same time they were to be constantly learning lessons of Christ gathering from the divine Teacher instructions that would correct their wrong ideas and incorrect views of what constituted a Christian character. John and Peter were not perfect, but they improved every opportunity to learn. Peter did not learn to be jealous and distrustful of himself, until he was overcome by the devil \n                                                                           375\nand denied the Lord. Judas had the same opportunities to learn as did the other disciples, but he was a hearer only, and not a doer. The result was manifested in the betrayal of His Lord. God has connected men with his instrumentalities, and he wants them to be learners; they must not feel self-sufficient, or self-important, but must ever realize that they are treading on holy ground. Angels of God are ready to minister unto them, and they must receive light and heavenly influences daily, or they are no more fit for the work than are unbelievers. Transformation will be wrought in those who will repress unfavorable traits of character, and develop Christlike dispositions; this alone will bring them up to the highest standard of Christian character. Judas failed to be benefited because he did not see the importance of having his character molded after the example of Christ.",
