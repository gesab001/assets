    "word": "Faith to Be Exercised \n\n     The Lord withholds from us no good thing. He declares, \"Ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\" He does not tell us to restrict our asking to certain things, but assures us that He will bless us according to the riches of His grace. He is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him than parents are to give good gifts to their children. To show his willingness, He refers to the tender relationship that a father sustains to his son. \"What man is there of you,\" He says, \"whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"",
