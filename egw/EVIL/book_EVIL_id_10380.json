    "word": "Do not perpetuate evil by talking of these theories in sermons or by publishing in our papers articles regarding them. The Lord says, Let them be unexplained. Present the affirmative of truth plainly, clearly, and decidedly. You cannot afford to study or combat these false theories. Present the truth, It is written. The time spent in dealing with these fallacies is so much time lost. Our papers are not published for the purpose of dealing with such subjects. Articles on Bible subjects, full of practical truth, and written in so simple a style that the children and the common people cannot misunderstand them, are to fill our papers.",
