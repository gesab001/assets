    "word": "Depressing Emotions Injurious to Health.--It is the duty of everyone to cultivate cheerfulness instead of brooding over sorrow and troubles. Many not only make themselves wretched in this way, but they sacrifice health and happiness to a morbid imagination. There are things in their surroundings that are not agreeable, and their countenances wear a continual frown that more plainly than words expresses discontent. These depressing \n\n\n                                                63 \n\nemotions are a great injury to them healthwise, for by hindering the process of digestion they interfere with nutrition. While grief and anxiety cannot remedy a single evil, they can do great harm; but cheerfulness and hope, while they brighten the pathway of others, \"are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh\" (Proverbs 4:22).--ST, Feb 12, 1885.",
