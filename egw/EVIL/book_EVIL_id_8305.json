    "word": "Those who are thus misrepresenting Christ, are placing a wrong mold upon the work; for they encourage all who are connected with them to do as they do. For their souls' sake, for the sake of those who are in danger from their influence, they should resign their positions; for the record will appear in heaven that the wrong-doer has the blood of many souls upon his garments. He has caused some to become exasperated, so that they have given up the faith; others have been imbued with his own satanic attributes, and the evil done it is impossible to estimate. Those only who make it manifest that their hearts are being sanctified through the truth, should be retained in positions of trust in the Lord's work.",
