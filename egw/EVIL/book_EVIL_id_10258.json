    "word": "In this way the leaven of evil has been introduced into the Echo office to injure the influence of the workers. Let every man and woman remember that God has declared, \"I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned\" [Matthew 12:36, 37]. Idle words are not thought to be swearing, but they are not of a character to help or bless anyone. They confuse the senses and cause doubt to spring up in regard to believing the words spoken by the Lord's ambassadors.",
