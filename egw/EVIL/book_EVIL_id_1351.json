    "word": "As wickedness in the world becomes more pronounced, and the teachings of evil are more fully developed and widely accepted, the teachings of Christ are to stand forth exemplified in the lives of converted men and women. Angels are waiting to co-operate in every department of the work. This has been presented to me again and again. At this time the people of God, men and women who are truly converted, are to learn, under the training of faithful teachers, the lessons that the God of heaven values.",
