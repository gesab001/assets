    "word": "A Succession of Falls and Christ's Victory Over Satan.--Adam and Eve transgressed the law of God in Eden. They fell from their high estate, and were driven out from beautiful Eden. Everything that their wants required had been provided for them, and there was only one prohibition laid upon them. The Lord said, \"Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it\" (Genesis 3:17). Many have tried to prove that there was some peculiar quality in the tree which called for this prohibition, but this was not the case. The fruit of the tree of knowledge was not in itself injurious. It was used merely as a test of their obedience to God. Will they be obedient to God's requirements, or not? We find that Satan came then, just as he comes today, with temptations upon the point of appetite.",
