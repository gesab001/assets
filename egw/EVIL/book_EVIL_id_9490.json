    "word": "MR No. 758 - Reverence on the Sabbath\n\n     The next thing that was shown me was the great sin of parents neglecting their children. I saw that they would have an awful account to give in _____. They had fostered and cherished the evil tempers of their children until God's frown was upon them and their children. They have forgotten that which is written in the Holy Word. \"He that spareth the rod hateth his son\" (Proverbs 13:24), and the children are left to come up instead of being brought up or trained up. The poor little children are thought not to know or understand a correction at eight, nine, or ten months old. They begin to show stubbornness very young, and it is cherished and nourished by their parents until these evil passions grow with their growth, and strengthen with their strength.",
