    "word": "Timothy suffered from physical infirmities, and the apostle, tender and compassionate as he was, felt it necessary to warn him to neglect no duty on this account. And fearing that his mild, yielding disposition might lead him to shun an essential part of his work, Paul exhorts him to be faithful in reproving sin, and even to rebuke with sharpness those who were guilty of gross evils. Yet he is to do this \"with all long-suffering and doctrine;\" he must manifest the patience and love of Christ, and must explain and enforce his reproofs and exhortations by the word of God.",
