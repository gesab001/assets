    "word": "Christ has pledged Himself to keep all who will look to Him and trust in Him with an abiding faith. Then commit the keeping of your souls to Him as unto a faithful Creator. Repeat the words aloud, \"I will commit the keeping of my soul to Him.\" We would better talk with God even though our words are heard by others. When there are those around you who are stirred by passion, do not retaliate to their hasty words, but repeat the words of Scripture. You should do this more in your dealing with your brethren and sisters. When untrue words are spoken about us, shall we flare up? Were not a great many \n\n\n            -169- \n\nuntrue things spoken concerning the Saviour, and did He retaliate? He was charged with being a devil.",
