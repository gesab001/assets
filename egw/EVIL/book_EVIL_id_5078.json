    "word": "We have a testing message to give, and I am instructed to say to our people, \"Unify, unify.\" But we are not to unify with those who are departing from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. With our hearts sweet and kind and true, we are to go forth to proclaim the message, giving no heed to those who lead away from the truth.--Manuscript 31, 1906.",
