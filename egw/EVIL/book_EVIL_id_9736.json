    "word": "A man may make plans that as far as he can discern appear to him to be faultless. How merciful God is to reach forth a restraining hand, saying, Follow not that course, for it will bring trouble to your own soul and confusion and perplexity to other minds, leading them to wrong conclusions. If, after the Lord has said, Do not advance in that direction, the man disregards the warning, the evil results from which God wished to save him will certainly follow.",
