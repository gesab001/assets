    "word": "Gossip, the Enemy's Work--How careful we should be to have our words and actions in harmony with the sacred truths that God has committed to us! . . . When you are associated with one another, be guarded in your words. Let your conversation be of such a nature that you will have no need to repent of it. . . . If a word is dropped that is detrimental to the character of a friend or brother, never encourage this evilspeaking; for it is the work of the enemy. Remind the speaker that God's Word forbids this kind of conversation.--RH Feb. 25, 1904.",
