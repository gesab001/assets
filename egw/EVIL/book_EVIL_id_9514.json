    "word": "My brethren and sisters, I must tell you that your spirituality is a very short pattern. You are not following the example of Christ. Let every one who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity. Satan would demoralize those who belong to the church of these last days. If you will open the way, he will put evil thoughts into your minds. But God's Word tells us that if we resist the devil, he will flee from us. You may expect to meet the sharpest temptations, but if you cherish Bible truth you can be witnesses for Christ. You can reveal Him to those in your beautiful island home who know Him not.",
