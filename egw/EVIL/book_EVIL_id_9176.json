    "word": "Great responsibilities rest upon every parent. They have a duty to educate their children and to bring them up in the fear of God. The children need transforming, and this will involve a constant work on the part of the parent. The children must be taught to respect and revere God and this will take a constant effort. Should this be done, we should see more tenderness of heart combined with all other Christian graces manifested in the children that have been given us. These graces must be instilled in our children that they may be enabled to resist the evil tendencies of this age. Abraham was faithful in educating his children, and in this he pleased God.",
