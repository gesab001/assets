    "word": "\"Be not therefore anxious for the morrow. \n . . . Sufficient unto the day is the evil \n thereof.\" Matthew 6:34, R.V. \n\n\n     If you have given yourself to God, to do His work, you have no need to be anxious for tomorrow. He whose servant you are, knows the end from the beginning. The events of tomorrow, which are hidden from your view, are open to the eyes of Him who is omnipotent.",
