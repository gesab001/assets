    "word": "When a crisis comes in the life of any soul, and another attempts to give advice, that advice and counsel will have only the weight of influence for good that the example and spirit of the adviser has accumulated for him. It is the consistent life, the revelation of a sincere, Christlike interest for the soul in peril, that will make counsel effectual to persuade and win into safe paths. Those who are quick to advise others, who speak words that cut and bruise the already wounded soul, are doing Satan's work, and are laborers with the prince of darkness. But the True Witness says: \"I know thy works,\" every work shall be brought into Judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil.\" They will have to give an account for their neglect of those whom they might have blessed, strengthened, upheld, and healed.",
