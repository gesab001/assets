    "word": "The Fruits of Selfishness \n\n     Those who allow a covetous spirit to take possession of them cherish and develop those traits of character which will place their names on the record books of heaven as idolaters. All such are classed with thieves, revilers, and extortioners, none of whom, the word of God declares, shall inherit the kingdom of God. \"The wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.\" Covetous attributes are ever opposed to the exercise of Christian beneficence. The fruits of selfishness always reveal themselves in a neglect of duty, and in a failure to use God's entrusted gifts for the advancement of His work. --R. & H., Dec. 1, 1896.",
