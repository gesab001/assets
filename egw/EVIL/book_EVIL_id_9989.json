    "word": "Those who walk through the world trampling upon the laws of God and righteousness, and [those who] link up and associate with them, will be partakers with their evil doings. Some will fabricate reasons for welcoming them, as inclination to cover their course of action; but it is not a necessity that God creates. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father to you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\" There is caution to be exercised. Now we cannot come into willing association and intercourse with the workers of evil unless we catch their spirit. They may appear as an angel of light and deceive the very elect; but none need in this particular to be deceived.",
