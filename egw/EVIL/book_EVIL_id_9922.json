    "word": "If your spirit, my sister, were in harmony with that of Christ, you would not suggest one word of envy or suspicion to your husband's mind. No thought of evil would germinate and spring up to bear fruit and result in separating you and him from the work. \"Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\" Seek the Lord with all your heart before it shall be too late.--Letter 34, 1890. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. January, 1987. Entire Letter.",
