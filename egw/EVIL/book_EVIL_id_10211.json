    "word": "Had the scribes and rulers studied the prophecies and sought to understand their deep meaning, they would have accepted Christ. The prophecies, investigated with humble hearts, would have opened a flood of light to their understanding. They would have seen that Christ answered every specification of the Messiah, whose coming the prophecies foretold. But in their pride they misinterpreted the Scriptures. They wanted a temporal Prince answering to the description of Christ at His second appearing. The glory and power which was foretold would be at His second advent, they were determined to apply to His first coming. These proud ideas were so proudly ingrained in their minds that when the wonderful miracles were wrought, it was easier for them to charge this to the power of the devil than to admit that they had not interpreted the Scriptures aright. Their pride forbade them to admit their error, and this proved their eternal ruin as a nation.",
