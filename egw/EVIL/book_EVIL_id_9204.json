    "word": "Zeal, Results of Too Much. --There are some people who are too energetic. They have so much zeal that their physical strength is overtaxed. It is a mistake to overdo and wear out the strength by constant labor without taking periods of rest. If the whole machinery is used too constantly and the necessity of resting periods and of varied exercise are overlooked, evil results will follow. The human machinery is created with all its varied nerves, muscles, and sinews to be kept in healthy action. If they are unused, they will become weak, and feel the neglect. If overtaxed, they will wear out prematurely.--Letter 231, 1905. \n\nReleased September 20, 1967.",
