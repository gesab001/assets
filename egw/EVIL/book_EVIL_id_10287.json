    "word": "God's people must be suspicious of their lower nature. They must war against fleshly lusts. The evil heart of unbelief is constantly at war with the purposes of God, tempting souls away from the side of Christ into forbidden paths. Unjust, cruel prejudice and cavils arise against the agencies God has seen fit to employ to reprove and correct the erring. This unbelief hinders those that are corrected from receiving the light that is given them, and therefore they do not submit to God, but work at cross purposes against God's will.",
