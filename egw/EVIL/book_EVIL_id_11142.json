    "word": "If Brother Daniells is not in Battle Creek, please read to the church what I am sending you. I have many letters to write, and I can not add more to this now. There is just one thing the Lord calls for, and that is, for every man, minister, or physician, or lay member, to confess his own sins. Each one will have a hard battle to fight with his own perverse self. Those who have stood directly in the way of the people, having a clear realization of their perilous condition, will have an account to settle with God. Those who have helped souls to feel at liberty to specify what is of God in the Testimonies, and what are the uninspired words of Sister White, will find that they were helping the devil in his work of deception. Please read Testimony No. 33, p. 211, \"How to Receive Reproof.\" (Or, Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 683). \n                                      (Signed) \n\n(From Doctor Paulson's Collection)                    Ellen G. White \n\n94.",
