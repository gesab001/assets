    "word": "Have an interest that every one be directed to his proper work, and his hands will not grow weary and heavy. Let men unite themselves to their fellow men by the golden links of the chain of love. Let love be without dissimulation; abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good. I tell you of a truth there are great misconceptions as to what constitutes faithfulness in the cause of God. The duties devolving upon every minister to care for the flock of God are neglected. There are those who need special attention, who need tender words, kind consideration, tangible help; they need advise, that kind of counsel which will not extinguish the last spark of courage in the soul.",
