    "word": "Satan strengthens the destructive tendencies of man's nature. He brings in envy, jealousy, selfishness, covetousness, emulation, and strife for the highest place. Evil agencies set their part in operation through the devising of Satan. Thus the enemies' plans, with their destructive tendencies, have been brought into the church. Christ comes with His own redeeming influences, proposing through the agency of His Spirit to impart His efficiency to men, and to employ them as his instrumentalities, laborers together with him in seeking to draw the world back to its loyalty.",
