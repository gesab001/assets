    "word": "Let us talk instead of the great power of God to bind up all our interests with His own. Tell of the matchless power of Christ and speak of His glory. All heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of God, thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand, are commissioned to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation. They guard us against evil and press back the powers of darkness that are seeking our destruction. Have we not reason to be thankful every moment, thankful even when there are apparent difficulties in our pathway?--MH 253, 254 (1905).",
