    "word": "Suppose we catch the spirit that breathed in this prayer that ascended to heaven. Christ here shows what methods and force he used to keep his disciples from worldly practises, maxims, and dispositions: \"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world.\" Their actions, their words, their spirit, are not in harmony with the world, \"even as I am not of the world.\" And the Saviour adds, \"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\" The children and youth should receive an education in the line that Christ has here indicated, that they may be separate from the world.",
