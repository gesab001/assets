    "word": "I saw that ministers, as well as people, have a warfare before them, to resist the Devil. It is a cruel position for ministering brethren to be in, serving the purposes of Satan, by listening to his whisperings, and letting him captivate their minds and guide their thoughts. And their most grievous sin in the sight of God is, their talking out their unbelief, and drawing other minds into the same dark channel, thus suffering Satan to carry out a two-fold purpose in tempting them. He unsettles the mind of one whose course has encouraged his temptations, and then leads that one to unsettle the minds of many.",
