    "word": "Mightier Than the Sword or Courts of Justice.-- The love of God in the heart, manifested in true, unselfish missionary labor, will be more mighty than the sword or courts of justice in dealing with the evildoer. The living missionary, with his heart overflowing with the love of God, can break down the barriers. The medical missionary, taking up his appointed work, cannot only relieve bodily maladies, but through the love and grace of Christ can heal the diseased soul, \n                                                                           298\nleprous with sin. The hearts of men will often harden under rebuke, but they cannot withstand the love expressed toward them in Christ.--Manuscript 60, 1897.",
