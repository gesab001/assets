    "word": "A Positive Testimony--It is our duty to be very jealous of the glory of God, and bring no evil report even by the sadness of the countenance or by ill-advised words, as though the requirements of God were a restriction upon our liberty. The whole person is privileged to bear a decided testimony in every line--in features, in temper, in words, in character--that the service of the Lord is good. This they proclaim: \"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\" Let your words be positive on the side of the Lord.--Ms 70, 1897.",
