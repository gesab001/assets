    "word": "\u201cA noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations: he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword.\u201d [Jeremiah 25:31.]  For six thousand years the great controversy  has been in progress; the Son of God and his heavenly messengers  have been in conflict with the power of the evil one, to warn, enlighten, and save the children of men. Now all have made their decision; the wicked have fully united with Satan in his warfare against God. The time has come for God to vindicate the authority of his downtrodden law. Now the controversy is not alone with Satan, but with men. \u201cThe Lord hath a controversy with the nations;\u201d \u201che will give them that are wicked to the sword.\u201d",
