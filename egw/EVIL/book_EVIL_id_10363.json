    "word": "Brother Evans, stand firm for the right. Be constantly on guard. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. \"Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil\" [Ephesians 6:11]. Much is at stake now. Those who have turned from the truth to fables will say anything that the enemy puts into their minds. I am charged to say, Believe them not; be not deceived. There are some whose words do eat as a canker, because they will not break from the fellowship of unholy angels.",
