    "word": "Samuel told Eli the words of the Lord; \"and he said, It is the Lord: let Him do what seemeth Him good.\" Eli knew that God had been dishonored, and he felt that he had sinned. He submitted that God was thus punishing his sinful neglect. The word of the Lord to Samuel was made known by Eli to all Israel. In doing this, he thought to correct in a measure his past sinful negligence. The evil pronounced upon Eli was not long delayed.",
