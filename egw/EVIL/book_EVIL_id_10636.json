    "word": "Those who truly love God must manifest loving-kindness of heart, judgment, and righteousness to all with whom they come in contact; for these are the works of God. There is nothing Christ needs so much as agents who feel the necessity of representing Him. Evil speaking and evil thinking are ruinous to the soul. This has been current in this conference. There is nothing the church lacks so much as the manifestation of Christlike love. As the members of the church unite together in sanctified association, cooperating with Christ, He lives and works in them. Our eyes need the anointing with the heavenly eyesalve, that we may see what we are, and what we ought to be, and that power is provided in Christ sufficient to enable us to reach the high standard of Christian perfection.",
