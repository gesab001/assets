    "word": "The apostle, speaking to Christian believers called by God's grace, says, \"If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.\" Here are conditions plainly stated. If we walk in the light as he is in the light, the sure result will follow: we shall have fellowship one with another. All jealousies and envyings and evil surmisings will be put away. We shall live as in the sight of God. It has become altogether too common to indulge our hereditary tendencies and natural inclinations, even in our religious life. These can never bring peace and love into the soul, for they always lead us away from God, away from his light. \"He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\"",
