    "word": "The world teems with corrupting influences. Fashion and custom exert a strong power over the young. If the mother fails in her duty to instruct, guide, and restrain, her children will naturally accept the evil and turn from the good. Let every mother go often to her Saviour with the prayer, \"Teach us, how shall we order the child, and what shall we do unto him?\" Let her heed the instruction which God has given in His word, and wisdom will be given her as she shall have need.",
