Day, Stephen Haskell, and Stephen Smith\n\n           (Written December 27, 1858, from Battle Creek, Michigan.) \n\n     I was shown in vision while at Mansville, New York, the state of things in the east, especially in the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. I saw that the course of I.C. Day while among the Messenger advocates was cruel, crooked, and wicked; that people were composed of dissatisfied ones who would not bear reproof, but considered their judgment better than that of their brethren who had an experience in the truth and the cause of God. These unruly spirits came together and united together to work or fight against those whom God had raised up to stand in defense of His truth. Satan and his angels were at war with them, fighting against them, and these people were co-workers with Satan and the evil angels. Falsehoods and lies would be formed by Satan's children, and this people loved them and eagerly reported them to others. I.C. Day was one of these; if he did not make the lies, he loved them.",
