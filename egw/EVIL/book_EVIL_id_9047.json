    "word": "Bro. Bell has nice ideas of order and discipline. He thinks that minds should be disciplined, that they may unitedly, in common schools as well as Sabbath-schools, move like machinery. But this desirable attainment can alone be gained through principle, which should influence every act and feeling, regulating, exciting, or repressing, as the case demands, and controlling the soul. Without the balance which religion gives the minds of youth, they are varying. They are generally controlled by impulse. They follow inclination rather than duty. Parents and teachers have a very responsible work before them to so educate the youth that the valuable qualities of the mind may be strengthened while the evil tendencies should be repressed, restrained, and controlled.",
