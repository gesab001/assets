    "word": "Chapter 9 \n\n     6. God Protects Man's Rights.--How carefully God protects the rights of men! He has attached a penalty to wilful murder. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.\" (Genesis 9:6) If one murderer were permitted to go unpunished, he would by his evil influence and cruel violence subvert others. This would result in a condition of things similar to that which existed before the Flood. God must punish murderers. He gives life, and He will take life, if that life becomes a terror and a menace (MS 126, 1901).",
