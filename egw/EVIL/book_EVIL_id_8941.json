    "word": "\"In our work more attention should be given to the temperance reform. Every duty that calls for reform, involves repentance, faith, and obedience. It means the uplifting of the soul to a new and nobler life. Thus every true reform has its place in the third angel's message. Especially does the Temperance Reform Demand Our Attention and Support. At our camp-meetings we should call attention to this work, and make it a living issue. We should present to the people the principles of true temperance, and call for signers to the temperance pledge. Careful attention should be given to those who are enslaved by evil habits. We must lead them to the cross of Christ. . . . This evil must be more boldly met in the future than it has been in the past. Ministers and doctors should set forth the evils of intemperance. . . .",
