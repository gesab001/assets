    "word": "Jesus said in His last prayer for His disciples, \"As thou hast sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world\" [John 17:18]. We are to study and cherish the meekness of Christ; we are not to condemn the world, but to save the world by being the means of winning souls to Christ. The Saviour continues, \"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth. . . . For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word\" [John 17:15-17, 19, 20].",
