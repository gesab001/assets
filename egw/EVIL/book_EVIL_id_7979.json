    "word": "A radical conversion must take place as regards the manner in which the various minds are to be dealt with. If every apparent injustice is considered as an affront; if amends for every slight injury are required with a spirit different from the spirit of Christ; if harsh language is used; if for difficulties small or great a spirit of impatience is manifested which stirs up and irritates, there will soon be a state of things worse than if nothing had been done to correct the evil. If such dispositions are entertained by believers; if everyone feels free to utter hasty words, we shall have miserable hearts, miserable families, and in the church, discord and dissension.",
