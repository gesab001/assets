    "word": "Does not Christ see enough in us of perversity and crookedness to warrant His withdrawing of His love from us? But as He does not separate His love from us, shall we not draw more closely to our divine Center, and through His gracious mercy draw closer together? Let us form a holy alliance to exalt the Son of God before the world. If the enemies became united through their hatred of Jesus, shall not we who profess His name unite in Him? Standing under the cross of Calvary, looking upon Him who has manifested unparalleled love to man, should not all jealousies, all bitterness, wrath, and malice cease? Should not all evil-speaking and evil thinking be done away? \n                                                                           1050",
