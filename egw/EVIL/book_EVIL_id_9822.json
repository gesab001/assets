    "word": "If anyone in the church desires to be a teacher, thinking himself called to instruct others, let him show his fitness for the position, not in profession merely, not in his discourses alone, but in spirit and action. Let there be no evil surmisings, no crediting of hearsay and telling the story to others, while he does not try by the best possible means to learn the facts from the one accused. Let his conversation be in meekness and wisdom.",
