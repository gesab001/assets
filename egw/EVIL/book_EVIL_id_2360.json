    "word": "I have often said to our brethren: Your opponents will make statements about your work that are false. Do not repeat their statements, but hold to your assertions of the living truth; and angels of God \n                                                                           359\nwill open the way before you. We have a great work to carry forward, and we must carry it in a sensible way. Let us never get excited, or allow evil feelings to arise. Christ did not do this, and He is our example in all things. For the work given us to do we need much more of heavenly, sanctified, humble wisdom, and much less of self. We need to lay hold firmly on divine power.",
