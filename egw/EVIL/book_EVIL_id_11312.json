    "word": "In connection with our institutions in various places, there are sometimes, among a few of the brethren, one-sided secret conversations. Misunderstandings arise and multiply.

The Lord Jesus sees it all. He himself interposes, and changes the plans that have been proposed to cure these imagined evils.",
