    "word": "Those who have sharp, rough traits of character are guilty before God if they do not, by training, repress and root out all the bitterness of their nature. The man who yields to impatience is serving Satan. \"To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey.\" A good character is more precious in God's sight than the gold of Ophir. The Lord would have men act for time and for eternity. We have received good and bad as a legacy, and by cultivation we may make the bad worse, or the good better. Shall the bad gain the ascendancy, as with Judas, or shall the evils be purged from our souls, and the good predominate?",
