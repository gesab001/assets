    "word": "Those who are adopted into the family of God are transformed by His Spirit. Self-indulgence and supreme love for self are changed for self-denial and supreme love for God. No man inherits holiness as a birthright, nor can he, by any methods that he can devise, become loyal to God. \"Without me,\" Christ says, \"ye can do nothing\" (John 15:5). Human righteousness is as \"filthy rags.\" But with God all things are possible. In the strength of the Redeemer, weak, erring man can become more than conqueror over the evil that besets him.",
