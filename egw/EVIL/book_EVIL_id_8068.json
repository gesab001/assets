    "word": "To every one of His appointed agents the Lord sends the message: \"Take your position at your post of duty, and stand firm for the right.\" To all God's workers I am instructed to say: \"Find your places, if you are the sent of God. Imbibe not the fanciful sentiments of human beings who are not taught of God. Christ is waiting to give you insight in regard to heavenly things; waiting to quicken your spiritual pulse to increased activity. No longer let any evil influence or propensity, natural or acquired, lead you to subordinate the claims of future, eternal interests to the common affairs of this life. No man can serve two masters whose interests are not in harmony. 'Ye cannot serve God and mammon.'\". . .",
