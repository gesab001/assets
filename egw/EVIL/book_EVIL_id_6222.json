    "word": "Christ Overcame in Our Behalf.--In the wilderness of temptation, Christ passed over the ground where Adam fell. He began the work where the ruin began, and on the point of appetite He overcame the power of the evil one in our behalf. Satan left the field a vanquished foe, and no one is excused from entering the battle on the Lord's side, for there is no reason why man may not be an overcomer if he trusts in Christ. \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\" \n                                                                           283",
