    "word": "Nonessential questions will be brought in by those who do not purify their souls by obeying the truth. They fall far short of the standard of loving God supremely and their neighbor as themselves. I am bidden to say that sophistries will be brought in to take the place of the pure gospel of Jesus Christ. The message is given, \"Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\" This word has been fulfilling among our people.",
