    "word": "The blessings of the new covenant are grounded purely on mercy in forgiving unrighteousness and sins. The Lord specifies, I will do thus and thus unto all who turn to Me, forsaking the evil and choosing the good. \"I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.\" (Hebrews 8:12). All who humble their hearts, confessing their sins, will find mercy and grace and assurance.",
