    "word": "MR No. 253 - A Consecrated Ministry\n\n     Now I tell you God will not be trifled with. God is a jealous God, and when He manifests His power as He has manifested it, it is very nigh unto the sin [against] the Holy Ghost to disbelieve it. The revealings of God's power have not had any effect to move and to stir persons from their position of doubting and unbelief. God help us that we may remove ourselves out of the snares of the devil! If ever a people needed to be removed, it is those that took their position in Minneapolis at that time on the wrong side. . . .",
