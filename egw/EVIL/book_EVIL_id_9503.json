    "word": "The sieve is going, and let us not say, \"Stay Thy hand, O God.\" We know not the heart of man. If God causes the feelings of the heart to be manifested and gives you sight of what is in the heart by the words of the mouth (by the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh), let it not afflict your soul too much, although your hopes may be cruelly disappointed. But the church must be purged, and will be. \"Fret not thyself because of evildoers.\" God reigns; let the people tremble.--Letter 2a, 1856, pp. 2,3,4.
