    "word": "The Evil of Long Sermons. \nDear Brother-----:-- \n     Those who shall be mouthpiece for God should know that their lips have been touched with a live coal from off the altar, and present the truth in the demonstration of the Spirit. But lengthy discourses are a taxation to the speaker, and a taxation to the hearers who have to sit so long. One half the matter presented would be of more benefit to the hearer than the large mass poured forth by the speaker. That which is spoken in the first hour is of far more value if the sermon closes then than the words that are spoken in an added half-hour. There is a burying up of the matter that has been presented.",
