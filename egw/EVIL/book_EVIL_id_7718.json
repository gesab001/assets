    "word": "These words were but a reiteration of the teaching of the Old Testament. It is true that the rule, \"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" (Leviticus 24:20), was a provision in the laws given through Moses; but it was a civil statute. None were justified in avenging themselves, for they had the words of the Lord: \"Say not thou, I will recompense evil.\" \"Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me.\" \"Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth.\" \"If he that hateth thee \n                                                                           71\nbe hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.\" Proverbs 20:22; 24:29, 17; Proverbs 25:21, 22, R.V., margin.",
