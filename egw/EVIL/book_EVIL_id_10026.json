    "word": "Those who think and speak evil of their fellow laborers, opening the mind to false reports and taking up a reproach against their neighbor, grieve the Spirit of God and put Christ to open shame. Shall those who minister in the word of God grow away from Christ, into uncomeliness and coarseness, becoming boastful and hardhearted? This is the picture that the lives of many now present. Shall not the picture be changed? When we allow spiritual moisture to fall constantly on the soul, we shall thrive as trees of the Lord's planting.",
