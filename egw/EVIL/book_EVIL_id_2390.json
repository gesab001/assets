    "word": "Though rewarded with evil for good, and hatred for his love, [Psalm 109:5.] he had steadfastly pursued his mission of mercy. Never were those repelled that sought his grace.

The waves of mercy, beaten back by those stubborn hearts, returned in a stronger tide of pitying, inexpressible love. But Israel had turned from her best friend and only helper. The pleadings of his love had been despised, his counsels spurned, his warnings ridiculed.",
