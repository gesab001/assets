    "word": "\"I might go to much larger lengths in these matters, but what will it amount to? Those who have entered into the scheming principles, those who have co-operated together in this work of injustice, have so confused their senses that \n                                                                           15\nrighteous principles are not discerned. They are scattered, but not reformed, not converted. Would it not be wise to clear the King's highway, that the Lord may remove his displeasure at the moral degeneracy of his work? Holy things are brought down to a common level. The cause of truth has been dishonored. Men greedy of gain have brought their evil propensities into the work of God. They have resorted to any means that they might obtain what they wanted. 'Who is wise? and he shall understand these things; prudent? and he shall know them; for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall.'\"",
