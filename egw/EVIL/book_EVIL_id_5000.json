    "word": "Much harm has resulted to the sick from the universal custom of having watchers, nights. In critical cases this may be necessary; but it is often the case that more harm is done the sick by this practice than good. It has been the custom to shut out the air from the sick room. The atmosphere of such rooms, to say the least, is very impure, which greatly aggravates the condition of the sick. In addition to this, to have one or two watchers to use up the little vital air which may find its way to the sick room through the crevices of doors and windows, is taking from them this vitality, and leaving them more debilitated than they would have been had they been left to themselves. The evil does not end here. Even one watcher will make more or less stir, which disturbs the sick. But where there are two watchers, they often converse together, sometimes aloud, but more frequently in whispered tones, which is far more trying and exciting to the nerves of the sick than talking aloud.",
