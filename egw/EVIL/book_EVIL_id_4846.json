    "word": "Chap. 10 - Christian Character\n\n     The character of the Christian is shown by his daily life. Said Christ, \"Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit\" (Matthew 7:17). Our Saviour compares Himself to a vine, of which His followers are the branches. He plainly declares that all who would be His disciples must bring forth fruit; and then He shows how they may become fruitful branches. \"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me\" (John 15:4).",
