    "word": "Spiritualism is the masterpiece of deception. It is Satan's most successful and fascinating delusion--one calculated to take hold of the sympathies of those who have laid their loved ones in the grave. Evil angels come in the form of those loved ones, and relate incidents connected with their lives, and perform acts which they performed while living. In this way they lead persons to believe that their dead friends are angels, hovering over them, and communicating with them. These evil angels, who assume to be the deceased friends, are regarded with a certain idolatry, and with many their word has greater weight than the Word of God. Thus men and women are led to reject the truth, and give \"heed to seducing spirits.\"",
