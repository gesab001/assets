    "word": "God is always giving; and upon whom are His gifts bestowed? Upon those who are faultless in character? \"He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\" Matthew 5:45. Notwithstanding the sinfulness of humanity, notwithstanding that we so often grieve the heart of Christ and prove ourselves most undeserving, yet when we ask His forgiveness, He does not turn us away. His love is freely extended to us, and He bids us: Love one another as I have loved you. John 13:34.",
