    "word": "While the followers of Christ have sinned, they have not given themselves to the control of evil. They have put away their sins, and have sought the Lord in humility and contrition, and the divine Advocate pleads in their behalf. He who has been most abused by their ingratitude, who knows their sin, and also their repentance, declares, \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee, O Satan. I gave My life for these souls. They are graven upon the palms of My hands.\u201d\u2014Review and Herald, Jan. 9, 1908.",
