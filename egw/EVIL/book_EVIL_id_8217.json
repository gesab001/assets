    "word": "The apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, says, \"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth\" (Ephesians 4:29). A corrupt communication does not mean only words that are vile. It means any expression contrary to holy principles and pure and undefiled religion. It includes impure hints and covert suggestions of evil. Unless instantly resisted, these lead to great sin.",
