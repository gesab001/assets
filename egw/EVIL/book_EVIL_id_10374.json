    "word": "Friday, July 16, 1896, Cooranbong, New South Wales, Australia, EGW to Mrs. Wessels \n\n\n     Dear Sister Wessels: . . . The manuscript for the \"Life of Christ\" is just about to be sent to America. This will be handled by the Pacific Press. I have employed workers to prepare this book, especially Sister Davis, and this has cost me three thousand dollars. Another three thousand will be needed to prepare it to be scattered broadcast through the world in two books. We hope that they will have a large sale. I have devoted little time to these books, for speaking, writing articles for the papers, and writing private testimonies to meet and repress the evils that are coming in, keeps me busy.--Letter 114, 1896, p. 3. \n\n\n                              -33-",
