They must meet a higher standard--the Bible standard. While Satan and his confederacy of evil are strengthening their forces to make of no effect the power and the Word of God, their most effective argument is the unconsecrated lives of those who, like Judas, profess to be disciples of Christ, but like Judas are betraying sacred interests, and thus betraying Christ. Every departure from the principles of truth and the grace of Christ causes Satan to exult, for it places in his hands weapons to use against Christ and the truth.",
