    "word": "Many of our people are lukewarm. They occupy the position of Meroz, neither for nor against, neither cold nor hot. They hear the words of Christ, but do them not. If they remain in this state, he will reject them with abhorrence. Many in Battle Creek who have had great light, great opportunities, and every spiritual advantage, praise Christ and the world with the same breath. They bow themselves before God and mammon. They make merry with the children of the world, and yet claim to be blessed with the children of God. They wish to have Christ as their Saviour, but will not bear the cross and wear his yoke. May the Lord have mercy upon you; for if you go on in this way, nothing but evil can be prophesied concerning you.",
