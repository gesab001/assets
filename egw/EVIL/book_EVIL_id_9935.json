    "word": "While it is duty for the watchmen to be wide-awake, faithful to discern evil, and understanding the necessities of the cause and work of God, they will frequently be called to bear a plain, pointed testimony to individuals who are in danger. Their testimony must not be given in an impatient spirit, not in an overbearing spirit, not with a domineering spirit, but with the spirit and meekness of Christ. There are two extremes to be avoided: one is the shunning to declare the whole counsel of God, and running into the spirit of revivalists in this age of crying \"peace, peace, when there is no peace,\" and weaving into the labors an element which moves the feelings but leaves the heart unchanged. A sensational religion is to be dreaded, for it is hard work, when once it has been woven into the experience, to ever make the individuals feel that they must go deeper than mere emotional exercise; that they must practice true godliness.",
