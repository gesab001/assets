Establish your sanitariums, your schools, and offices away from the centers of population.\" Many now will plead to remain in the cities, but the time will come ere-long when all who wish to avoid the sights and sounds of evil will move into the country; for wickedness and corruption will increase to such a degree that the very atmosphere of the cities will seem to be polluted.--Letter 26, 1907.",
