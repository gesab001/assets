The managers of the sanitarium will often be tempted to depart from the principles which should govern such an institution. But they should not vary from the right course to gratify the inclinations or minister to the depraved appetites of wealthy patients or friends. The influence of such a course is only evil. Deviations from the teachings given in the lectures or through the press have a most unfavorable effect upon the influence and morals of the institution and will, to a great extent, counteract all efforts to instruct and reform the victims of depraved appetites and passions and to lead them to Christ, the only safe refuge.",
