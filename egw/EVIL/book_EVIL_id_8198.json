    "word": "When you are associated together, be guarded in your words. Let your conversation be of such a nature that you will have no need of repentance. \"Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption\" (Ephesians 4:30). \"A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things\" (Matthew 12:35). If the love of the truth is in your heart, you will talk of the truth. You will talk of the blessed hope that you have in Jesus. If you have love in your heart, you will seek to establish and build up your brother in the most holy faith. If a word is dropped that is detrimental to the character of your friend or brother, do not encourage this evil-speaking. It is the work of the enemy. Kindly remind the speaker that the Word of God forbids that kind of conversation.",
