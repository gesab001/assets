    "word": "Hanging on the cross, the Son of God bore the insults of Satan and his agencies. Those that Christ had declared were whited sepulchers, who deceived the people by an outward appearance of sanctity, were now reviling One who came from heaven to save a perishing world, and in whose heart a zeal for right and justice and for the glory of God was the highest object. Those who chose Barabbas, thus yoking up with Satan, gave evidence that a profession of piety and of love for God, and a claim to know the Scriptures, neither made them the sons of God nor led them to represent His character. To those who had true religion--and there were such among the spectators--it must indeed have appeared as if Satan were linked up with the men triumphantly shouting in blasphemy against One who was Commander of all heaven.",
