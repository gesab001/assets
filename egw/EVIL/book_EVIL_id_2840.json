    "word": "There is a lesson for parents in the instruction given to the wife of Manoah, and to Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist. The angel of the Lord brought the tidings that Manoah should become the father of a son who was to deliver Israel; and in reply to the anxious inquiry, \u201cHow shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?\u201d the angel gave special directions for the mother: \u201cNeither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.\u201d The child will be affected, for good or evil, by the habits of the mother. She must herself be controlled by principle, and must practice temperance \n209\nand self-denial, if she would seek the welfare of her child.",
