    "word": "Christ Is Voice Through You--Make a covenant with God that you will guard well your words. \"If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.\" James 3:2. Remember that a revengeful speech never makes one feel that he has gained a victory. Let Christ speak through you. Do not lose the blessing that comes from thinking no evil.--7T 243.",
