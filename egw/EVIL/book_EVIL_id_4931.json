    "word": "Chap. 5 - Miracles not a Test of God's Favor\n-\n\n      Seek not for Miraculous Manifestations \n\n     Let none cherish the idea that special providences or miraculous manifestations are to be the proof of the genuineness of their work or of the ideas they advocate. If we keep these things before the people, they will produce an evil effect, an unhealthful emotion. The genuine working of the Holy Spirit on human hearts is promised, to give efficiency through the Word. Christ has declared the Word to be spirit and life. \"The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea\" (Habakkuk 2:14, A.R.V.).",
