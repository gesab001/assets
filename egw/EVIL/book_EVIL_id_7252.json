    "word": "Notwithstanding, I went to Elder H with the testimony given me of God, yet he did not reform. His course has said, \"I will do as I please in the matter; there is no sin in it.\" He promised before God what he would do, but he broke his promises made to Brother C. H. Jones, W. C.

Notwithstanding all the light given, he has evidenced no real conviction or sense of sin; no repentance, no reformation. Hearts have ached sorely over this state of things, but they had no power to change his heart or his purposes.",
