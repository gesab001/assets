    "word": "There are persons who will never receive reproof, who build themselves up in their own way, and insist on clinging to their own evil habits and practices. When reproved they say, \"Why do you tell me these things? I can not be any different.\" But they deceive themselves in saying this. They could make changes if they would; but they prefer to have their own way, rather than to make a determined effort to seek a better and more perfect way, by which their usefulness might be greatly increased, and their ability developed to fill positions of trust.",
