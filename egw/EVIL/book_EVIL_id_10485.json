    "word": "Many who profess to believe the Word of God do not seem to understand the deceptive working of the enemy. They do not realize that the end of time is near. But Satan knows it, and while men sleep he works. The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye, and the pride of life are controlling men and women. Satan is at work, even among the people of God, to cause disunion and difference of opinion. There is biting and devouring among them, and Satan designs that they shall be consumed one of another. Selfishness, corruption, and evil of every kind is taking a firm hold upon hearts.",
