    "word": "The wisdom which is from above leads to no such evil results. It is the wisdom of Christ--\"first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits.\" Those who manifest these fruits have placed themselves on God's side; their will is the will of Christ. They believe the word of God, and obey its plain injunctions. They do not consult their feelings, neither do they extol their own opinions above those of others. They esteem others better than themselves. They do not stubbornly strive to carry out their own purposes, irrespective of the influence their plans will have on other souls that are precious in the sight of God. In order to have unity and peace in our institutions and in the church, our pet ideas and preferences must be sacrificed. No principle of divine truth is to be sacrificed, by any means, but our own hereditary and cultivated tendencies must often yield. No man is perfect, no one without defect.",
