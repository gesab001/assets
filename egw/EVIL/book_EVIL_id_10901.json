    "word": "The Lord commands us, \"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, we shall receive a crown of glory which fadeth not away.\" \"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder; yes all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. Be sober, be vigilant,; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.\"",
