    "word": "Publishing Houses to Avoid Strife for Supremacy.-- In book making there is a striving for the supremacy.... God says to every soul, \"Take heed.\" The leaven of influence is a powerful thing. Whether good or evil, it gathers all to itself. If the leaven of selfishness, covetousness, and hardheartedness is allowed to enter, it will subdue all the properties of the body to corrupting force. There will be no bowels of mercy, no tender consideration, no fighting against objectionable traits of character, which so quickly develop into giants of evil. Unless this root of bitterness is cast out of the soul, it will continually spring up, and by it many will be defiled.--MS 131, 1899.",
