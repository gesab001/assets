    "word": "There has been a fearful neglect of duty with the parents. Like Eli, they have not restrained their children, and when the conduct of \n\n\n                                     -185- \n\ntheir children is such that it testifies against their management they think to obtain relief by sending them to college to be disciplined and to learn better manners than their parents have taught them at home. Here the teachers are left with a task on their hands which few can appreciate. If they succeed in reforming this crude and undisciplined class, parents take the credit, which is not due them, and do not give the teachers the credit they deserve. If the children choose the society of the evil-inclined, and go from bad to worse, then the teachers are censured and the school is denounced as being what it should not be, when the condemnation justly belongs upon the parents. They have the first and best years of the lives of their children while they were teachable and impressible. But the wicked, slothful parents failed in doing their work, and their children became confirmed in an evil course. They were hardened like flint when sent to the college.",
