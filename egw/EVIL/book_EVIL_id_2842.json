    "word": "We are exhorted to love as brethren, to be kind, courteous, forbearing, in honor preferring one another. Love for God and for one another constitutes the divine credentials which the children of God bear to the world. \u201cBy this,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cshall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d Those who cherish this love will sacredly guard the interests of one another. No evil reports will be carried; tattling and gossip will cease; Christ and the truth will be magnified.",
