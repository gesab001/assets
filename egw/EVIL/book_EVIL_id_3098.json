    "word": "That God who sent the ravens to feed Elijah by the brook Cherith will not pass by one of His faithful, self-sacrificing children. Of him that walketh righteously it is written, \"Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.\" \"They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.\" \"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\"",
