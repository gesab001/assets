The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul\" (Psalm 121:6, 7). \"He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust.... Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling\" (Psalm 91:3-10).--The Great Controversy, pp. 627-630.",
