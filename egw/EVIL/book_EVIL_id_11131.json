    "word": "\"Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, will ye not receive instruction hearken to my words? Saith the Lord. . . I have sent also unto you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I shall give you and to your fathers, but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto Me. . .Therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them and they have not heard; and I have called upon them, but they have not answered.",
