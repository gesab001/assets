    "word": "How can any of our brethren who have before them the history of the Lord of life and glory, open their lips to utter words similar to the taunting words of the murderers of our Lord? Does the Lord lead our brethren to say these things? I answer, No. They know not what spirit they are of. Could their eyes be opened, they would see evil angels exulting around them, and triumphing in their power to deceive them. The day is just before us when Satan will answer the demand of these doubters, and present numerous miracles to confirm the faith of all those who are seeking this kind of evidence. How terrible will be the situation of those who close their eyes to the light of truth, and ask for miracles to establish them in deception!",
