    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     God employs men to carry on his work, but there is constant danger that they will place their own impress upon it. Too often the messenger that God has used, come to be depended upon, and to be placed were God should be, by the people. Therefore from time to time the Lord calls others to aid in carrying forward the message. The work must not become circumscribed by the influence of man; the truth should not be crippled and dwarfed by the imperfect experience of the workers. God does not set the earlier laborers aside, for their capabilities are all needed for the perfection of the work; and if they submit themselves to God, they may still aid in its upbuilding; but if they become jealous, and imagine evil, they will stand directly in the way of its advancement.",
