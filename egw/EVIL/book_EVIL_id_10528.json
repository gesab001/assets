    "word": "\"Thou art this head of gold,\" said Daniel. How did the king treat that? In place of letting that dream teach him what was to be the end of the kingdoms, he studied on the dream and the devil took possession of his mind, leading him to build that great image of gold and to set it up. All the time he was thinking, \"Thou art this head of gold.\" There you see [that] the [talent of] reason did not work under the control of God, and therefore he set up his image to be worshiped, and everybody was to fall down and bow to this image which was a representation of his kingdom. There were young men there that would not bow down, for they had been educated that \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" They had been educated to worship God and serve Him only.",
