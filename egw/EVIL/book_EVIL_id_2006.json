    "word": "A Christian father is the house-band of his family, binding them close to the throne of God. Never is his interest in his children to flag. The father who has a family of boys should not leave these restless boys wholly to the care of the mother. . . . He should make himself their companion and friend. He should exert himself to keep them from evil associates. . . . He should take more of the burden upon himself, doing all in his power to lead his boys to God.",
