    "word": "Study to Follow Scripture Teaching \n     The rebuke of God is upon presidents of conferences, and ministers in sacred office, who make light of these gross evils [various and sundry weaknesses and maladministration], and pass them by as matters undeserving attention. In the future there will be more instead of fewer missions [REFERENCE HERE IS TO EVANGELISTIC CENTERS ESTABLISHED IN CITIES, POPULAR IN THE 1880'S AND 1890'S, ESPECIALLY IN OPENING UP THE WORK.] established to do God's work, to hold the standard high; and those who are placed at the head of these missions should be persons of pure, elevated, noble character; persons who will study the Scriptures to some purpose, that they may know the way of the Lord and keep it; who will take that holy Word as the director of their course of action, the light of the soul. If they do thus accept the Bible as their counselor and guide, they will walk under the direction of the Father of Lights, \"with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning\" (James 1:17).--Letter 24, 1890, p. 9.",
