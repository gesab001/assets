    "word": "The physicians employed in our institutions should have a sacred regard for honor and loyalty. If they fail to walk uprightly and unselfishly; if they do not honor the principles that should control the followers of Christ in any and every branch of the work, then let the church take action in their case. Let the Bible rule be \n\n\n                      -5- \n\nfollowed, just as the Master has taught. Be the physician great or small, if he refuses to submit to church discipline, after suitable time has been given for patient labor according to Christ's direction, he should be separated from the church as unworthy of its fellowship. The fact that the physician occupies a position of influence is the very reason why, in the case of any unchristian practise on his part, there should be careful investigation by judicious persons. Let our health institutions be purged of every evil, that the blessing of God may rest upon these his instrumentalities.",
