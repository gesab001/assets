    "word": "PRAYER BAFFLES SATAN\u2019S STRONGEST EFFORTS.\u2014Man is Satan\u2019s captive and is naturally inclined to follow his suggestions and do his bidding. He has in himself no power to oppose effectual resistance to evil. It is only as Christ abides in him by living faith, influencing his desires and strengthening him with strength from above, that man may venture to face so terrible a foe. Every other means of defense is utterly vain. It is only through Christ that Satan\u2019s power is limited. This is a momentous truth that all should understand. Satan is busy every moment, going to and fro, walking up and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour. But the earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts. Then take \u201cthe shield of faith,\u201d brethren, \u201cwherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.\u201d(Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, 294.)",
