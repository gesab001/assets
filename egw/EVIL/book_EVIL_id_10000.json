    "word": "Obedience to every word that proceeds from the mouth of God is required. Had Christ conceded one jot or tittle of this, the hostility of Satan and his army would not have burst upon Him with irrepressible fury. He was able to perform marvelous works, and had He but allowed some license to sin, had He permitted evil passions to go unrebuked, men would have given Him their homage. But He rebuked all sin and hypocrisy, and they said, He is an impostor. Satan and his angels united with the priests and rulers in mocking and deriding the Son of God. Thus were the words fulfilled. \"Thou shalt bruise His heel.\"",
