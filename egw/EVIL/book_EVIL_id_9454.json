    "word": "For a time health food restaurants may be carried on in the cities. If those who take up this work will make it a means of the conversion of souls, then the plans of God in establishing the health food work will be carried out. But if the managers continue to increase their facilities, and to bring in workers, who are brought into daily contact with the worldly element, without putting forth a strong effort to counteract the evil influences, the workers will be led astray by temptation, and souls will not be converted. And if souls are not saved by the work of our restaurants, why should those interests continue to be conducted under the present plan?",
