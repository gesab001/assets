    "word": "The true motive of service is to be kept before students. The training they receive is to help them to develop into useful men and women. Every means that will uplift and ennoble them is to be employed. They are to be taught to use their powers in harmony with God's will. The influence exerted by a true, pure life is ever to be kept before them. This will aid them in their preparation for service. Daily they will grow stronger, better prepared, through the grace of Christ and a study of His word, to put forth aggressive efforts against evil. \n\n                                               -",
