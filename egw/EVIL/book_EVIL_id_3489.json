    "word": "My brother, cast away all evil thinking. Humble your heart before God. Then, your eyes being opened, you will no longer stand on the negative side. \"If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire\" (Matthew 18:8). Cut away your defective attributes, however painful to human nature it may be to do this. \"And if thine eye\"--so sharp to see something to criticize or oppose--\"offend thee, pluck it out, and cast if from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire\" (verse 9).--Lt 93, 1901.",
