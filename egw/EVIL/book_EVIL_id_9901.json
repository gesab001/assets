    "word": "Let our people show that they have an interest in medical missionary work. Let them study the books that have been written for our instruction in these lines. These books deserve much more attention, respect, and appreciation than they have received. I understand that Dr. Kellogg has published a new book, which has been written for the special purpose of instructing others in the health principles that it is for the advantage of all to understand.
