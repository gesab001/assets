    "word": "It is the reign of anti-Christ. God's law is set aside. The Scriptures are exchanged for the traditions of men. Satan has become the ruler of the world, and in his hands temptation has become a science. He rules over a vast, well-organized empire. Sin has stimulated his followers into fearful activity. Men have combined to perpetuate evil. The sale of intoxicating liquor, destructive alike to soul and body, is legalized by Christian governments. And those who authorize the sale of that which makes men demons make Sunday laws, which they give to the world under the solemn name of religion.",
