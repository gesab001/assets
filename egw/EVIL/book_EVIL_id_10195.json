    "word": "We all have a personal influence. Our words and actions leave an indelible impress. It is our duty to live, not for self but for the good of others; not to be controlled by feelings, but by principle. We should consider that our influence is a power for good or for evil. We are either a light to cheer, or a tempest to destroy. God would have His workmen show themselves men. In our association with men, we are bound by the law of Jehovah to influence them in the direction of good. This power of personal influence will be felt by others. The law of God requires that we love our fellow men as we love ourselves. Then every power and action of the mind must be put forth to that end -- to do the greatest amount of good. To overdo wearies and disables us, and cripples the powers God has given us, so that much less good is done than might have been accomplished had we worked intelligently. Had all the powers been treated considerately, what a precious work might have been done! How pleasing to the Giver for man to hold the royal gifts of the soul so that they shall tell with power upon others! They are the connecting link between God and man, and reveal the Spirit of Christ and the attributes of heaven. The power of holiness, seen but not boasted of, speaks more eloquently than the most able sermons. It speaks of God, and opens to men their duty more powerfully than mere words can do.",
