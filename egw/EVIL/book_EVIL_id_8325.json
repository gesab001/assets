    "word": "The prince of darkness has set in operation every device to ruin and destroy man. He has \n\n\n                       - 57 - \n\nlegions of evil workers uniting with him to obliterate the image of God in our youth. I ask those who are acquainted with truth, who know righteousness, What are you doing? Are you using your influence to bring into the ranks of the Lord's army all whom you can possibly reach? Have you yourself enlisted to fight the battles of the Lord? As Christians it is our work to represent Christ. We are to set an example that shall be in striking contrast to the practises of this evil age. He that is selfish will neglect to do the very work he ought to do, and take up a work that God has not given him to do. \"He that loveth pleasure [margin, sport] shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.\" \"He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honor.\" \"The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labor. He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.\"",
