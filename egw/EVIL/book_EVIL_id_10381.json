    "word": "Let Bible truth be presented in our papers. Give the reasons of our faith. In the most cheerful, hopeful, encouraging articles recommend the diligent searching of the Scriptures. Urge our people to become familiar with the Word of God. In their study, the students in our schools should commit to memory portions of the Word. The time will come when many will be deprived of the written Word. But if this Word is printed in the memory, no one can take it from us. It is a talisman that will meet the worst forms of error and evil. \n\n\n                                                                     page 25",
