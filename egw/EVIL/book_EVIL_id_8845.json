    "word": "8. Let every soul carefully consider his condition, and inquire, What is my state before God? Let him examine closely what kind of material he is bringing into his character-building. Is it that which can be compared to solid timbers, or that which can only be likened to that which is rotten and worm-eaten? We are charged in the word of God to \"keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.\" The unconverted heart is the habitation of the evil one, and it is filled with unholy thoughts, with evil surmisings, envy, jealousy, falsehood, and uncontrolled passions, with strife and confusion and every evil work. Let each one search diligently, and inquire, Is my heart free from all these? Let each one closely examine himself to see whether he is in the faith, whether the truth which he professes to believe has been kept in the outer court, or brought into the inner sanctuary of the soul, that he may be sanctified thereby. The whole heart must be \n                                                                           31\nentered and purified by the searching Spirit of God. Jesus will not abide in the soul where pride exists; and if we desire his presence, the soul temple must be cleansed of all evil occupants. If the door of the heart is open to Jesus, he will come in, and his presence will expel every unholy thought, and by faith we may hold sweet communion with God. If Jesus abides in the heart, we shall glorify him in our lives; for the Christian is to let his light shine forth to the world in good works.",
