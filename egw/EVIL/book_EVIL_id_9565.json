    "word": "What Might Have Been Accomplished If Selfishness Had Been Eradicated-- It is not wise to open up more fields than can be thoroughly worked. If selfishness from the first had been eradicated from the hearts of the laborers; if the love of Jesus and the love of souls for whom Christ died had controlled the workers, what a strong company might have been raised up. Jealousies, evil surmisings, envyings have built up barriers between you and God, making it impossible for the Lord to do His work, His precious work of bringing souls to the knowledge of truth. If many had been converted, who \n\n\n                                     -81- \n\nwould have been able to care for these lambs, these newly come to the faith? What lessons they would have learned of envy, jealousy, and evil surmisings. Wherein would inquiring souls find the right kind of instruction? Who would educate and train them for the work of the Master?--Letter 3, 1892, p. 15. (To W. D. Curtis, Jan. 16, 1892.)",
