    "word": "\"The Lord is looking with pitying tenderness upon the entire family. The appetite and hereditary tendencies of the father had been transmitted to the children. That God who marks the fall of the little sparrows knows every member of the family by name. He loves and pities them. He will save every member of the family from disgrace and sin if they will accept of Christ their Redeemer by living faith. Then they will leave their course of sin, cease to do evil, and learn to do well.",
