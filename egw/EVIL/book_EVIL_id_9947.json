    "word": "Brother Day, you were not as careful as you should have been to abstain from all appearance of evil before Sister Johnson left her husband. You were in her company, often alone in conversation with her. However pure your motives, you have been judged, and now, especially since the death of your wife, unbelievers put their own construction on the matter; and if you should make her your wife you would bring a reproach upon yourself and the cause that your whole future life could not wipe away. You would give the enemies of our faith cause to blaspheme.",
