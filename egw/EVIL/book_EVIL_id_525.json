    "word": "In Christ\u2019s mighty works there was sufficient evidence for faith. But these people did not want truth. They could not but acknowledge the reality of the works of Christ, but they cast condemnation upon them all.

No; but they were so determined that the truth should not affect their hearts and they be converted that they charged the work of the Spirit of God to the devil. . . .",
