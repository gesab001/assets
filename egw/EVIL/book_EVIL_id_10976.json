    "word": "\"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, April 18, 1900. \nElders Jones, Wilcox, and Irwin,- \n\nDear Brethren: \n\n\n     It is not always best to meet the Sunday question in Parliament or among a large crowd of people, where are talented men and women who are moved by a power from beneath, inspired with Satan's venomous spirit. When the Seventh-day Adventists at the heart of the work show uncorrupted principles, when the word of God, straight as an arrow, goes to the mark to kill the unjust and unholy principles which are so displeasing to the Lord, the God can bless his people. But God's favor will not be restored until decided work is done to cleanse our institutions from the evils existing in them. When this work is done, it will be shown by the softening, subduing influence of the Spirit of God, which will teach men how to use pen and voice with the eloquence Christ had when He was upon this earth. But stay your pen and voice in judging and condemning others until that work is accomplished which God would have done in our very midst, lest the leprosy of Gehazi come upon the cause because of those who while handling sacred things are mingling the sacred and the common.",
