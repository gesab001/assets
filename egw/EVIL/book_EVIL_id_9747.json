    "word": "Those who are under Satan's rules and laws suppose themselves to be independent atoms. Each follows his own human passions. It is Satan's principles which have placed men in collision with their fellow men. They lead men to draw apart from one another in suspicion, jealousy, and evil-surmising. Under the power of these principles, violence, crime, and every species of iniquity are steadily increasing.",
