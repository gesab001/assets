    "word": "\"I am a Christian,\" must be repeated, \"and I must love my neighbor as myself. I must do unto others as I would that they should do to me. I must not exalt myself as a privileged character, and look down upon others as of no value. I am a Christian, and must esteem others better than myself. I am a Christian, and must not join any ring or party which would connive at evil, no matter how trivial might seem the transgression.\" It was a small transgression that opened upon our world the floodgates of woe. The act of sin may be one that is called common, and the eternal ruin will be common. We need not seek to excuse ourselves because men in high esteem are guilty of strange misdemeanors, and place sin in wrong light before the world. The uprightness of all who make high professions, and practice iniquity is known a pretense before that God whose eye reads the hearts of men. So few are found who act upon the principles of the Bible, that we can say indeed that many shall seek to enter in and shall not be able. Christ's followers are a little flock.",
