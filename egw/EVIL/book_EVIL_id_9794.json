    "word": "The Evils of Pharisaism \n     In every age of the world there have been some who professed Christ while they were pursuing an erroneous course of seclusion or of Pharisaical preeminence. But they have not blessed their fellow men. They have found no excuse in the life of Christ for this self-righteous bigotry, for His character was genial and beneficent. He would have been excluded from every monastic order on earth because of overstepping their prescribed rules.",
