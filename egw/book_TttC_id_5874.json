    "word": "Chap. 32 - Religion in the Daily Life\n\n     Brother H: I was shown that you really love the truth, but that you are not sanctified through it. You have a great work before you to do. \"Every man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\" You have this work to do, and you have no time to lose. I was shown that your life has been a stormy one. You have not been right yourself; but you have been deeply wronged, and your motives have been misjudged. But your disappointments and pecuniary losses have, in the providence of God, been overruled for your good.",
