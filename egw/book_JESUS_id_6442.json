{"word": "The word that was spoken to Jesus at the Jordan embraces humanity. God spoke to Jesus as our representative. With all our sins and weaknesses, we are not cast aside as worthless. \"He hath made us accepted in the beloved\" (Ephesians 1:6). The glory that rested upon Christ is a pledge of the love of God for us. It tells us of the power of prayer--how the human voice may reach the ear of God and our petitions find acceptance in the courts of heaven. . . .

The voice which spoke to Jesus says to every believing soul, \"This is my beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 26}
