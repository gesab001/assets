But they are not in harmony with the body. \n                                                                           691\nYou do not make a right application of Scripture. When Jesus rises up in the most holy place, and lays off His mediatorial garments, and clothes Himself with the garments of vengeance in place of the priestly attire, the work for sinners will be done.

And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\"",
