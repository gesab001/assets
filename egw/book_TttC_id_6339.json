    "word": "God will not place His benediction upon those who are negligent, selfish, and ease-loving--who will not lift burdens in His cause. The \"Well done\" will be pronounced upon those only who have done well. Every man is to be rewarded \"according as his work shall be.\" We want an active ministry --men of prayer who will wrestle with God as did Jacob, saying: \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\" If we obtain the victor's crown we must stretch every nerve and exercise every power. We can never be saved in inactivity. To be an idler in the Lord's vineyard is to relinquish all title to the reward of the righteous. \n\n                                               -",
