    "word": "You have stood aloof from those upon whom God has laid the heavy burden of His work. While my husband already had the labor and burden which three men should have shared, you have injured him by remarks and hints, and have helped others to bring burdens upon him. You must see this. You have had no special burden laid upon you, but have had time for reflection and study, rest and sleep, while my husband has been obliged to labor day after day, and often long into the night, and sometimes when he did lie down to rest, he could not sleep, but could only weep and groan for the cause of truth, and the injustice of his brethren toward him, whose whole interest and life was devoted to the cause. \n                                                                           320",
