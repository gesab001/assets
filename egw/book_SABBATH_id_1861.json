{"word": "IN GREAT CONTROVERSY, VOLUME IV, PUBLISHED IN 1885, IN THE CHAPTER \"SNARES OF SATAN,\" THERE ARE THREE PAGES OR MORE OF MATTER THAT WAS NOT USED IN THE LATER EDITIONS, WHICH WERE PREPARED TO BE SOLD TO THE MULTITUDES BY OUR CANVASSERS. IT IS MOST EXCELLENT AND INTERESTING READING FOR SABBATHKEEPERS, AS IT POINTS OUT THE WORK THAT SATAN WILL DO IN PERSUADING POPULAR MINISTERS AND CHURCH MEMBERS TO ELEVATE THE SUNDAY SABBATH, AND TO PERSECUTE SABBATHKEEPERS. [CURRENTLY FOUND IN TESTIMONIES TO MINISTERS, PP. 472-475.]", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 443}
