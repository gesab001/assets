{"word": "Without Sufficient Evidence \n\n     I want to say just as little as possible in regard to Anna Phillips. The less this matter is talked over and agitated, the better. There is a \"dead fly in the ointment.\" Before this reaches you, you will have received a letter giving a more complete statement in regard to what we may expect in the case. I am more sorry than I can express to you that the matter has been handled unwisely. We shall have scores of just such developments, and if our leading brethren shall catch up things of this character and endorse them as they have done in this case, we shall have one of the most sweeping tidal waves of fanaticism that has been seen in our experience. There will be the wildest performances. Satan has already begun his work. To give ready credence to these things, and make loose, unguarded statements endorsing them without sufficient evidence of their genuine character, is one of Satan's devices. The Lord Jesus has certainly given cautions sufficient in regard to this matter, so that none need be deceived.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 92}
