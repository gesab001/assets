{"word": "Thus far every specification of the prophecy is strikingly fulfilled, and the beginning of the seventy weeks is fixed beyond question at B. C. 457, and their expiration in A. D. 34. From this data there is no difficulty in finding the termination of the 2300 days. The seventy weeks\\97490 days\\97having been cut off from the 2300, there were 1810 days remaining. After the end of 490 days, the 1810 days were still to be fulfilled. From A. D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844. Consequently the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14 terminate in 1844. At the expiration of this great prophetic period, upon the testimony of the angel of God, \\93the sanctuary shall be cleansed.\\94 Thus the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary \\97which was almost universally believed to take place at the second advent\\97was definitely pointed out.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 328}
