    "word": "I will here copy from another testimony, written June 6, 1863: \"I was shown that our testimony is still needed in the church, that we should labor to save ourselves trials and cares, \n                                                                           12\nand that we should preserve a devotional frame of mind. It is the duty of those in the office to tax their brains more, and of my husband to tax his less. Much time is spent by him upon various matters which confuse and weary his mind, and unfit him for study or for writing, and thus prevent his light from shining in the Review as it should.",
