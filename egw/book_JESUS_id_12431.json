{"word": "If you see that students are in danger of becoming engrossed in their studies to such an extent as to neglect the study of that Book which gives them information as to how to secure the future welfare of their souls, then do not present the temptation of going deeper, of protracting the time for educational discipline. In this way all that will make the student's education of value to the world will be sunk out of sight. Christ Jesus is to be loved more and more; but some have gone to Battle Creek in the pursuit of education, when, had they remained away, they would have been far better prepared for the work of God. They would have carried it forward in simplicity, in the manner in which Christ labored. They would have depended more upon God and upon the power of the Holy Spirit, and far less upon their education. Long periods of continual study are injurious to physical, mental, and moral well-being.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 134}
