{"word": "Begin With the Children.--Parents, you must arouse to your God-given duty. Teach your children obedience. Many have lost respect for father and mother. They will have just as much respect for their heavenly Father as for their own parents. \n                                                                           290\nTeach your children. Give them lessons when babies in your arms. Angels will be around you when you do this. When those weary mothers knew not what to do with their children, they thought that they would bring them to Jesus. And as one mother started, and would say to another, \"I want Jesus to bless my children,\" then another would join the company, and still another, and so on until quite a little group came to Jesus with their children. As they came to where Jesus was, He caught the sound. He knew when they had first left. Jesus Christ sympathized with these mothers. As they brought their little ones to Jesus, He said, \"Suffer little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\" Parents, take hold; the gates are ajar.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Te", "page": 289}
