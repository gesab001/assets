{"word": "No other light ever has shone or ever will shine upon fallen man save that which emanates from Christ. Jesus, the Saviour, is the only light that can illuminate the darkness of a world lying in sin. Of Christ it is written, \"In him was life; and the life was the light of men\" (John 1:4). It was by receiving of His life that His disciples could become light bearers. The life of Christ in the soul, His love revealed in the character, would make them the light of the world.--Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 39, 40.", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 288}
