{"word": "The sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire being,\\97spirit, soul, and body. Paul prayed for the Thessalonians, that their \\93whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\\94 [1 Thessalonians 5:23.] Again he writes to believers, \\93I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\\94 [Romans 12:1.] In the time of ancient Israel, every offering brought as a sacrifice to God was carefully examined. If any defect was discovered in the animal presented, it was refused; for God had commanded that the offering be \\93without blemish.\\94 So Christians are bidden to present their bodies, \\93a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\\94 In order to do this, all their powers must be preserved in the best possible condition. Every practice that weakens physical or mental strength unfits man for the service of his Creator. And will God be pleased with anything less than the best we can offer? Said Christ, \\93Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.\\94 Those who do love God with all the heart, will desire to give him the best service of their life, and they will be constantly seeking to bring every power \n474\nof their being into harmony with the laws that will promote their ability to do his will. They will not, by the indulgence of appetite or passion, enfeeble or defile the offering which they present to their heavenly Father.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 473}
