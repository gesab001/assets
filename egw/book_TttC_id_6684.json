    "word": "Chap. 63 - Proper Education\n\n     Education comprises more than a knowledge of books. Proper education includes not only mental discipline, but that training which will secure sound morals and correct deportment. We have had many fears that those who take students into their houses will not realize their responsibility and will neglect to exert a proper influence over these youth. Thus students will fail to obtain all the benefit which they might receive at the college. The question too often arises: \"Am I my brother's keeper?' What care, what burden or responsibility, should I have for the students who occupy rooms in our houses?\" I answer: The very same interest that you have for your own children.",
