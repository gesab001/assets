    "word": "My brother, you could do a good work. You have a knowledge of the truth and could be a great blessing to the cause of present truth if you were consecrated and sanctified to the work, having no selfish interest aside from it. God has committed to you a sacred trust, precious talents; and if you are found true to your trust, faithfully improving your talents, you will not be ashamed when the Master shall come, requiring both principal and interest. It is not safe to slight, or in any sense disregard, the light which God has been pleased to give. You have something to do to bring yourself into a position where God can especially work for you.",
