{"word": "Pray much. While at your work let your heart be uplifted to God. When you have committed to God the keeping of your soul, do not go away and act directly contrary to the prayer you have made. Watch as well as pray, lest you be overcome with temptation. Resist the first inclination to do wrong. Pray in your heart, \"Jesus, help me; preserve me from evil,\" and then do what you know Christ would be pleased to have you do. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 41}
