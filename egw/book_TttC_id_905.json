    "word": "Chap. 68 - The Future\n\n     At the transfiguration, Jesus was glorified by His Father. We hear Him say: \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\" Thus before His betrayal and crucifixion He was strengthened for His last dreadful sufferings. As the members of the body of Christ approach the period of their last conflict, \"the time of Jacob's trouble,\" they will grow up into Christ, and will partake largely of His spirit. As the third message swells to a loud cry, and as great power and glory attend the closing work, the faithful people of God will partake of that glory. It is the latter rain which revives and strengthens them to pass through the time of trouble. Their faces will shine with the glory of that light which attends the third angel.",
