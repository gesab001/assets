    "word": "Every church member should feel under obligation to consecrate his tithe to God. None are to follow the sight of their eyes or the inclination of their selfish hearts and thus rob God. They should not use their means to gratify vanity or for any other selfish indulgence, for in so doing they entangle themselves in Satan's snares. God is the giver of tact, of ability to accumulate wealth, and therefore all is to be laid upon His altar. The requirement is: \"Honor the Lord with thy substance.\" The tendency to covetousness must be constantly restrained, else it will eat into the hearts of men and women, and they will run greedily after gain.",
