    "word": "Hardly a town or hamlet that we have passed on our journey since leaving Basle but has an interesting history connected with the Reformation. Malmo was one of the first cities of Denmark\u2014to which it then belonged\u2014to fully receive the gospel. In 1527 the first Protestant sermon was preached in a meadow outside the  walls. Those who had listened to the gospel of God's glorious grace desired to express their feelings in songs of praise, but there existed nothing in the Danish language suitable to be used on such occasions. In the Romish church the people were silent worshipers; the only songs were the chants and canticles of the priests in an unknown tongue. But such worship could not satisfy an intelligent faith. A translation of the songs of David into the Danish language, soon after published, was everywhere received with great joy. They soon displaced the ballads which had been sung till then. They were heard in the castles of the nobles, and were used in the assemblies of the Protestants, and they may be said to have opened the gates of Malmo to the gospel.",
