    "word": "Two brethren are working in the same field. They each have their work; but Satan has tempted them and they are at variance. Shall these brethren labor separately in the field because they do not harmonize? Shall we separate them if they do not harmonize here? No, no. Let them work together until they do labor unitedly. In heaven they must harmonize in songs of triumph to the glory of God and of the Lamb. Well, when is this unity to take place? Are we to wait until we get home to heaven? No, it should take place right here before we leave this house. The melting power of God may be felt right here and the rough edges of our hearts \n\n\n                -16- \n\nare to be melted right down. From our hearts is to flow forth love, peace, and harmony.",
