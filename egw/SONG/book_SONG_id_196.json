    "word": "I see, Addie, more especially in you a growing disposition to jealousy. Jealousy, the Scriptures tell us, \"is cruel as the grave.\" Song of Solomon 8:6. You may inquire, \"What is jealousy?\" It is this: thinking that those around you do not think enough of you and appreciate your value. You imagine they talk about you and say things of you not correctly. You feel that others are favored and you are not. Many such feelings are the outgrowth of jealousy.",
