    "word": "Battle Creek is in a congested state, and needs to be relieved of some of its blood. Move out, move out of Battle Creek. Bring your blood where it is needed. There is a great work for all to do. Let a move be made; for there is deep, earnest work before us, solemn, real, and useful. Life to us is no idle song, no mere amusement, which does no one any good. It is full of duties, full of goodness, mercy, and love to be shown to others.--Letter 75, 1898. (Written from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N. S. W., Sept. 24, 1898, to E. A. Sutherland.) \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. September 1, 1983 \n\nEntire Manuscript Released",
