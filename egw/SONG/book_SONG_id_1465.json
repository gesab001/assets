    "word": "Man was made for happiness, not to be kept in continual worry. At his creation man was perfectly happy. The garden of Eden was an emblem of heaven and the love of God. The flowers exhibited their beauty and loveliness, ever giving out a fragrance grateful to the senses. Fruit trees bore their burden of precious treasures for the good of man. On every tree the birds caroled forth their songs of praise to God. In their untainted purity Adam and Eve delighted to listen to these glad songs of praise.",
