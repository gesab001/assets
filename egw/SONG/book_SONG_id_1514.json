They were exposed to temptation and received various errors as Bible truth. But I was shown that the Lord would, in His providence, clear away the rubbish of error and reveal to them the jewels of truth. These would be gladly received by many, and the harps that had been left tuneless would be taken from the willows and again give forth sweet music. Many will discover the lost links in the chain of truth, and they will see a beautiful harmony in the whole. They will have a fresh experience, being assured that He whom they trusted has not forsaken them and left them in darkness. \"The Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night His song shall be with me\" [Psalms 42:8].",
