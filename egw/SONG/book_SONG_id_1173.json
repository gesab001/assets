    "word": "There are persons who believe that they are right, when they are wrong. While claiming Christ as their Lord, and professedly doing great works in His name, they are workers of iniquity. \"With their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.\" He who declares God's word is to them \"as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear Thy words, but they do them not.\" Ezekiel 33:31, 32.",
