    "word": "David sinned. He transgressed the law of God. A prophet was sent of God to reprove and convict David of his great sin. This prophet did not sing to David sensational songs; neither did he relate simple humorous anecdotes. He brought before him an illustration of his own case in a figure and let David pass sentence upon himself; then he stated, \"Thou art the man.\" David repented before God, whose law he had transgressed, and relied for pardon on the efficacy of the blood of Christ.",
