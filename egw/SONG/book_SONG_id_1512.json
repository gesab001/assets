    "word": "At first an experienced man or woman should go out with these young workers, giving them instruction how to labor. When favors of food or of lodging are offered, these should be accepted. This will give opportunity for conversation, for explaining the Scriptures, for singing Bible songs, and praying with the family. All these exercises will prove a blessing. There may be brethren in the faith to whom such labor as this would prove a blessing. The very youth of these consecrated young men and women will often be a source of encouragement and help to the people.",
