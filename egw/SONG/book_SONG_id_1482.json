    "word": "Oh, why are our lips so ready to exalt and praise ourselves? Why have we so few words of praise to give our Lord Jehovah? Have we not fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us? Are we not commanded to be joyful in our King? Jesus is our living Advocate in the presence of our Father. Talk of Him as the One who can and does save to the uttermost all who come unto God through Him. Let us learn to speak His praises. \"Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; He also is become my salvation\" [Isaiah 12:2]. If we have tasted that the Lord is gracious, let us show that we are able intelligently to make Him known. Let us talk faith, helping others who are in the region and shadow of death.",
