    "word": "\"And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called. The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; \n\n\n                             -127- \n\nbut it shall be for those; the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, not any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there; and the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\"",
