    "word": "God is high and holy; and to the humble, believing soul, His house on earth, the place where His people meet for worship, is as the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the words spoken by Christ's ministers, are God's appointed agencies to prepare a people for the church above, for that loftier worship into which there can enter nothing that is impure. . . . God sees every irreverent thought or action, and it is registered in the books of heaven. . . . Nothing is hid from His all-searching eye. If you have formed in any degree the habit of inattention and indifference in the house of God, exercise the powers you have to correct it. . . . Practice reverence until it becomes a part of yourself. \n                                                                           189",
