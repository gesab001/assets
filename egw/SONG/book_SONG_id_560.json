    "word": "Scripture Reading \n\n     \"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth,\" read Elder F. M. Wilcox, of Washington, D.C. \"Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God \n                                                                           465\nHimself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" The passages read from the visions of John on the isle of Patmos were Revelation 21:1-7;  22:1-5; and with these were linked the precious promises recorded in the thirty-fifth chapter of Isaiah's prophecy. \"The ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\"",
