    "word": "We need to prepare the way of the Lord, according to the light given. We need to have a new experience. We need to offer praise and thanksgiving to God, not only in the congregation, but in the home life. Let the voices of His heritage be heard recounting the works of the Lord. Speak of His goodness, tell of His power. Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And there is none upon the earth that I desire but Thee. We need more songs of praise and less murmuring and complaining.",
