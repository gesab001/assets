    "word": "Oh, my Saviour, my Saviour, who is like unto Thee? None, none that can save to the uttermost but Thee. We give ourselves to Thee this evening. Wash away our sins; cleanse us in the blood of the Lamb; and may we be present when the family shall assemble in the kingdom of God and we become members of the royal family and children of the heavenly King. Then we shall strike the golden harp and fill all heaven with music and songs to the Lamb.",
