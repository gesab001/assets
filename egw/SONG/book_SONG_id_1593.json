    "word": "Do not be in haste to reveal the spirit of unbelief. Close the windows earthward, and then sing the songs of Zion. Perfect confidence in God is essential. Be not faithless, but believing. Thus far the Lord has certainly helped you. Although His overworked servant has been afflicted, in His great mercy the Lord has spared his life. Then rejoice in the Lord always; and again I say, Have faith in God, and rejoice.",
