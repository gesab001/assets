    "word": "The dealings of God with His people should be often repeated. How frequently were the waymarks set up by the Lord in His dealings with ancient Israel! Lest they should forget the history of the past, He commanded Moses to frame these events into song, that parents might teach them to their children. They were to gather up memorials and to lay them up in sight. Special pains were taken to preserve them, that when the children should inquire concerning these things, the whole story might be repeated. Thus the providential dealings and the marked goodness and mercy of God in His care and deliverance of His people were kept in mind. We are exhorted to \u201ccall to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions\u201d (Hebrews 10:32). For His people in this generation the Lord has wrought as a wonder-working God. . . . We need often to recount God\u2019s goodness and to praise Him for His wonderful works.",
