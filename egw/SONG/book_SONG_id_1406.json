    "word": "The schools must be helped. Let all lift harmoniously and help as much as they possibly can. Great blessings will come to those who will take hold of this matter just now. Let no discouragement be offered by our ministers, as though it were not a proper thing to do. They should take hold of this work. If they do it aright, cheerfully, hopefully, they will find it a very great blessing. The Lord does not force any man to work, but to those who will place themselves decidedly on his side, he will give a willing mind. He will bless the one who works out the spirit which He works in. God will make the movement for the help of our schools a success if it is made in a free, willing spirit, as to the Lord. Only in this way can be rolled back the reproach that has come upon our schools all over the land. If all will take hold of this work in the spirit of self-sacrifice, for Christ's sake, and for the truth's sake, it will not be long before the jubilee song of freedom can be sung through our borders.",
