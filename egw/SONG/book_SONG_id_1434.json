    "word": "I must tell you something I saw in the cars. A wealthy gentleman took a little box from his pocket and wound it up like a watch. At the top of the box was a glass door, and open flew this little door and a little, tiny bit of a bird, with fine downy feathers popped up, and then forth from the box came a most beautiful song such as canaries sing. And the little feathers \n\n\n                                     -122- \n\nwould move on the little bird, and it would twirl its pretty little head this way and that, flap its little wings, move its tail and fly about and act just as pretty as though the noise came from its tiny little throat.",
