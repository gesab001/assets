    "word": "\"If your earthly treasures are taken away, you are not to grieve, for I will give you heavenly treasure. If I remove the dearest objects of earthly attachment, I will supply the lack with more of Myself. It is in the time of deepest sorrow that I send the richest tokens of My grace. I will cause the afflicted soul to break forth into the song of praise and thanksgiving, 'It is good for me that I have been afflicted.' The trials and losses that come to you are to purify and refine you, and fit you for immortality.\"",
