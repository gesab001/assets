    "word": "Lift up Jesus, you that teach the people, lift Him up in sermon, in song, in prayer. Let all your powers be directed to pointing souls, confused, bewildered, lost to \"the Lamb of God.\" Lift Him up, the risen Saviour, and say to all who hear, Come to Him who \"hath loved us, and hath given himself for us\" (Ephesians 5:2). Let the science of salvation be the burden of every sermon, the theme of every song. Let it be poured forth in every supplication. . . . Show forth the grace and completeness of the Saviour (ibid., p. 160). \n                                                                           162",
