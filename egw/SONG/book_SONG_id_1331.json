    "word": "\"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name give glory, for Thy mercy, and for Thy truth's sake.\" Psalm 115:1. Such was the spirit that pervaded Israel's song of deliverance, and it is the spirit that should dwell in the hearts of all who love and fear God. In freeing our souls from the bondage of sin, God has wrought for us a deliverance greater than that of the Hebrews at the Red Sea. Like the Hebrew host, we should praise the Lord with heart and soul and voice for His \"wonderful works to the children of men.\" Those who dwell upon God's great mercies, and are not unmindful of His lesser gifts will put on the girdle of gladness, and make melody in their hearts to the Lord.",
