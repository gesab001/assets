And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the \n\n\n                                       -28- \n\nhundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.
