    "word": "We attended meetings in South Lancaster [Jan. 11-22, 1889], and the fruits were good. We had the same spirit and power that attended the first and second angels' messages. I have given you an account of these meetings. The Lord wrought upon all hearts, and many were able to say, \"The Lord hath put a new song in my mouth, the matchless love of Jesus.\" His excellencies were kept before the mind's eye, and souls began to see the delights in Jesus. They could speak of His love and tell of His power. The Sun of righteousness was rising in the hearts of nearly all present. Many were zealous and were repenting of their lukewarmness and complying with the invitation of the Merchantman, \"Buy of Me gold tried in the fire,\" \"and white raiment,\" \"and eyesalve.\" Their testimony was, \"I have found the Pearl of great price.\" Hearts were impressed, confessions were made of wrongs to unbelievers and believers, and restitutions were made.",
