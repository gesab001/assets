    "word": "Heaven and earth are no wider apart today than when shepherds listened to the angels\u2019 song. Humanity is still as much the object of heaven\u2019s solicitude as when common men of common occupations met angels at noonday, and talked with the heavenly messengers in the vineyards and the fields. To us in the common walks of life, heaven may be very near. Angels from the courts above will attend the steps of those who come and go at God\u2019s command.",
