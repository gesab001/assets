    "word": "Students, do your best. This is all that God asks of you, He who has given His life for you will aid you in your efforts to win eternal life. God wants you to have a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Obey Him, and in this school His salvation will be revealed. I want to meet you all around the throne of God. Learn here the lessons God desires to teach you, and you will join in the song of triumph in the heavenly courts.--Ms 125, 1902. (\"Words to Students,\" a talk given at the opening of the Fernando School, Oct. 1, 1902.) (MR 900.7)",
