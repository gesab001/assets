    "word": "The deep moving of the Spirit of God came upon me, and the people were deeply impressed. After I had finished speaking, Elder Corliss invited all those who desired to give themselves to the Lord to come forward. A large number responded, among them a young man who is a Catholic. Prayer was offered for these precious souls. Several who came forward were in the valley of decision. May the Lord strengthen the good impression made upon their minds, and may they give themselves wholly to the Lord, is my prayer. Oh, how I long to see souls converted, singing a new song, even praise to God's name.",
