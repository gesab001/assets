    "word": "The cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the redeemed through all eternity. In Christ glorified they will behold Christ crucified. Never will it be forgotten that He whose power created and upheld the unnumbered worlds through the vast realms of space, the Beloved of God, the Majesty of heaven, He whom cherub and shining seraph delighted to adore\u2014humbled Himself to uplift fallen man; that He bore the guilt and shame of sin, and the hiding of His Father\u2019s face, till the woes of a lost world broke His heart and crushed out His life on Calvary\u2019s cross. That the Maker of all worlds, the Arbiter of all destinies, should lay aside His glory and humiliate Himself from love to man will ever excite the wonder and adoration of the universe. As the nations of the saved look upon their Redeemer and behold the eternal glory of the Father shining in His countenance; as they behold His throne, which is from everlasting to\n343\neverlasting, and know that His kingdom is to have no end, they break forth in rapturous song: \u201cWorthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and hath redeemed us to God by His own most precious blood!\u201d",
