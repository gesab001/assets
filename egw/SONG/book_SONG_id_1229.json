    "word": "King Saul \n\n     Fluency and Wisdom--As Saul approached them [a band of prophets], the Spirit of the Lord came upon him also, and he joined in their song of praise, and prophesied with them. He spoke with so great fluency and wisdom, and joined so earnestly in the service, that those who had known him exclaimed in astonishment, \"What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\"--PP 610. \n                                                                           356",
