Happy will it be for the children of our homes and the students of our schools when parents and teachers shall learn in their own lives the precious experience pictured in these words from the Song of Songs:\n\u201cAs the apple tree among the trees of the wood, \nSo is my Beloved among the sons. \nI sat down under His shadow with great delight, \nAnd His fruit was sweet to my taste. \nHe brought me to the banqueting house, \nAnd His banner over me was love.\u201d Canticles 2:3, 4.",
