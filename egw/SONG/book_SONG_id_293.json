    "word": "Calling for Decisions in Song.--In my dreams last night I was speaking to a company of young men. I asked them to sing \"Almost Persuaded.\" Some present were deeply moved. I knew that they were almost persuaded, but that if they did not make decided efforts to return to Christ, the conviction of their sinfulness would leave them. You made some confessions, and I asked you, \"Will you not from this time stand on the Lord's side?\" If you will receive Jesus, He will receive you.--Letter 137, 1904.",
