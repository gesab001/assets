    "word": "It would be a difficult matter to convince those who have tasted of the rich knowledge of Christ, that He is as a root out of dry ground, without form or comeliness; and He may become to our souls \"the chiefest among ten thousand,\" and the One \"altogether lovely\" (Song of Solomon 5:10, 16). I love Him! I love Him! I see in Jesus matchless charms. I see in Him everything to be desired by the children of men. Let us come to the \"Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). Let us, through His merits and righteousness, obtain a fitting up for heaven. The broken and contrite heart He will not despise.-- Review and Herald, April 2, 1889.",
