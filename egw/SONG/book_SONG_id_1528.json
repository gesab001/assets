    "word": "Is the joy of Christ in you? Is Christ glorified, or God glorified in you? Verily, verily, I say unto you, unless you are born again you never can see the kingdom of heaven. [See John 3:3] You may have addicted yourself to fretting and to scolding for a long while, but it has not perfected your Christian character. Now suppose you change the order of things and you begin, when Satan begins to put in the word of complaint, to find fault, you begin to sing a song, if it is the simple hymn, \"I will follow Thee, my Saviour, Wheresoe'er my lot may be.\" Just begin to sing. Do you think that will please the devil and the confederacy of evil angels? No; they will get out of your presence as soon as possible. You have garrisoned the soul against them.",
