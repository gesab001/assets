    "word": "MR No. 910 - Make the Second Advent Part of Life\n\n     The Lord is soon coming. Talk it, pray it, live it! Make it a part of the life. You will meet lifeless, doubting, objecting faith, but this will give way before firm, consistent trust in God. When objectionable features arise, lift the soul to God in songs of thanksgiving. Preach the truth with boldness and fervor.--Letter 66, 1901, p. 6. (To R. M. Kilgore, June 26, 1901.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. December 10, 1981",
