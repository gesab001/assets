    "word": "On Sunday I rode several miles to the Baths, where Elder Simpson baptized thirty-one candidates. The service was beautifully conducted, and everything passed off with perfect order. The songs interspersed through the service seemed to be carrying the joyful news to heaven. As many more persons will be baptized in about four weeks' time; for all were not fully prepared to go forward in this ordinance at that time. My heart is filled with gratitude for this representation of those who have received the truth under the teaching of Elder Simpson.",
