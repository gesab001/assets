Portions appear in Evangelism and The Voice in Speech and Song.] \n\n\n     I have been thinking much in regard to what the Word of God is to us.

We all know that there are many who regard this scripture as a closed book, because they cannot understand it; and yet it is a revelation that Christ has given in order to enlighten our understanding.",
