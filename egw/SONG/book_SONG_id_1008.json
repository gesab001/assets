    "word": "I saw the beauty of Heaven. I heard the angels sing their rapturous songs; I heard them sing praise, honor, and glory, to Jesus. I could then realize something of the wondrous love of the Son of God. He left all the glory, all the honor he had in Heaven, and was so interested for our salvation that he patiently and meekly bore every indignity and slight that man could heap upon him. He was wounded, smitten, and bruised; he was stretched on Calvary's cross and suffered the most agonizing death to save us from death, that his blood might wash us and we be raised up to live with him in the mansions he is preparing for us, \n                                                                           11\nenjoy the light and glory of Heaven, and hear the angels sing, and sing with them.",
