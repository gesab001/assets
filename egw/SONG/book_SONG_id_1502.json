    "word": "I tell you in the fear of God, you do not know yourself. I have respect for your soul. Christ has died for you, but you are surely destroying yourself. I want you to swell the song of triumph and victory in the city of God, that Christ shall not have died for you in vain. Be not like boasting Peter, although warned faithfully of his defection of character. Self-confident and presumptuous, he affirmed a constancy superior to that of the other disciples, \n\n\n                                   -60- \n\nand expressed his willingness and readiness to follow his Master to prison and to death.",
