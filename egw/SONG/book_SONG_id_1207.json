    "word": "Soon our eyes were drawn to the east, for a small black cloud had appeared, about half as large as a\n278\nman's hand, which we all knew was the sign of the Son of man. In solemn silence we all gazed on the cloud as it drew nearer, and became lighter, glorious, and still more glorious, till it was a great white cloud. The bottom appeared like fire; a rainbow was over the cloud, while around it were ten thousand angels, singing a most lovely song; and upon it sat the Son of Man.\u20141T 60.",
