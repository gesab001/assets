{"word": "Parental Harmony Essential.--Perfect confidence should exist between husband and wife. Together they should consider their responsibilities. Together they should work for the highest good of their children Never should they in the presence of the children criticize each other's plan or question each other's judgment. Let the wife be careful not to make the husband's work for the children more difficult. Let the husband hold up the hands of his wife, giving her wise counsel and loving encouragement.--MH 393, 394 (1905).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 502}
