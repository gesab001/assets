    "word": "It is right that you should both cherish integrity and be true to your sense of right. The straight path of duty should be yours from choice. The love of property, the love of pleasure and friendship, should never influence you to sacrifice one principle of right. You should be firm in following the dictates of an enlightened conscience, and your convictions of duty; \n                                                                           63\nbut you should guard against bigotry and prejudice. Do not run into a pharisaical spirit.",
