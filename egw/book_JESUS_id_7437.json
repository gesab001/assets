{"word": "Like the builders of these houses on the rock, said Jesus, is he who shall receive the words that I have spoken to you, and make them the foundation of his character and life. Centuries before, the prophet Isaiah had written, \"The word of our God shall stand for ever\" (Isaiah 40:8); and Peter, long after the Sermon on the Mount was given, quoting these words of Isaiah, added, \"This is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you (1 Peter 1:25). The Word of God is the only steadfast thing our world knows. It is the sure foundation. \"Heaven and earth shall pass away,\" said Jesus, \"but my words shall not pass away\" (Matthew 24:35).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 195}
