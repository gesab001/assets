{"word": "The Twelve Sent Forth in House-to-House Labor. --On this first tour the disciples were to go only where Jesus had been before them and had made friends. . . . Nothing must be allowed to divert their minds from their great work or in any way excite opposition and close the door for further labor. They were not to adopt the dress of the religious teachers, nor use any guise in apparel to distinguish them from the humble peasants. They were not to enter into the synagogues and call the people together for public service; their efforts were to be put forth in house-to-house labor. . . . They were to enter the dwelling with the beautiful salutation, \"Peace be to this house.\" That home would be blessed by their prayers, their songs of praise, and the opening of the Scriptures in the family circle.-- The Desire of Ages, pp. 351, 352.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 61}
