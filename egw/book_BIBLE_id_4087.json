{"word": "Because they cannot fathom all its mysteries, the skeptic and the infidel reject God's word; and not all who profess to believe the Bible are secure from temptation on this point. Says the apostle: \"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.\" Minds that have been educated to criticize, to doubt and cavil because they cannot search into the purposes of God, will \"fall after the same example of unbelief.\" It is right to study closely the teaching of the Bible, and to search into \"the deep things of God,\" so far as they are revealed in Scripture. While \"the secret things belong unto the Lord our God,\" \"those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children.\" But it is Satan's work to pervert the investigative powers of the mind. A certain pride is mingled with the consideration of Bible truth, so that men feel defeated and impatient if they cannot explain every portion of Scripture to their satisfaction. It is too humiliating to them to acknowledge that they do not understand the inspired words. They are unwilling to wait patiently until God shall see fit to reveal the truth to them. They feel that their unaided human wisdom is sufficient to enable them to comprehend the Scripture; and failing to do this, they virtually deny its authority. It is true that many theories and doctrines popularly supposed to be the teaching of the Bible have no foundation in Scripture and, indeed, are contrary to the whole tenor of \n                                                                           702\ninspiration. These things have been a cause of doubt and perplexity to many minds. They are not, however, chargeable to God's word, but to man's perversion of it. But the difficulties in the Bible do not reflect upon the wisdom of God; they will not cause the ruin of any who would not have been destroyed if no such difficulties had existed. Had there been no mysteries in the Bible for them to question, the same minds would, through their own lack of spiritual discernment, have found cause of stumbling in the plainest utterances of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 701}
