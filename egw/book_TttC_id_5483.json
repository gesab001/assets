    "word": "The apostle Jude says: \"Of some have compassion, making a difference.\" This difference is not to be exercised in a spirit \n                                                                           222\nof favoritism. No countenance should be given to a spirit that implies: \"If you favor me, I will favor you.\" This is unsanctified, worldly policy, which displeases God. It is paying favors and admiration for the sake of gain. It is showing a partiality for certain ones, expecting to secure advantages through them. It is seeking their good will by indulgence, that we may be held in greater estimation than others fully as worthy as ourselves. It is a hard thing to see one's own errors, but everyone should realize how cruel is the spirit of envy, rivalry, distrust, faultfinding, and dissension.",
