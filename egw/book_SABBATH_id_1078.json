{"word": "Some urge that it is of no consequence whether we keep the Sabbath or not; but we say that from the Bible standpoint it is a matter of great importance. Had it not been important, God would not have wrought in so marvelous a manner to deliver his people from Egyptian bondage. It was because he saw that they could not obey his commandments in their servitude, that he revealed his mighty arm in bringing them into a place where they could serve him. When they came to Sinai, he took occasion to refresh their minds in regard to his requirements. Christ and the Father, standing side by side upon the mount, with solemn majesty proclaimed the ten commandments, placing in the very center of the decalogue the Sabbath command. Again \n232\nand again the Lord told the people that if they would keep his Sabbath he would take them to himself to be his chosen people; and again and again sorrow and shame were brought upon them because they failed to keep it. He also told them that the Sabbath should be a sign between him and them forever, that they might know that he was the Lord their God. Therefore it is of great importance that the Sabbath be regarded according to the commandment.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 231}
