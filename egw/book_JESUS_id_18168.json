{"word": "Jesus asks the use of Simon's boat. Although weary with his toil and disappointment, Simon cheerfully complies with the request of Christ. The unpretentious fishing boat is made the pulpit from which come forth the words of Christ. Surely the little craft of Simon's was never so honored as on this occasion. It had never been put to so profitable use by its owner. Jesus proclaims Bible truth; He speaks words of eternal life. The truths spoken in that sermon . . . [have gone] all over the world, and accomplished a work that eternity alone will reveal.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 288}
