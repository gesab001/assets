    "word": "The workers in our restaurants should live in such close connection with God that they will recognize the promptings of His Spirit to talk personally about spiritual things to such and such a one who comes to the restaurant.

The Lord will be with us, and through us the Holy Spirit will work to reach those who are out of Christ.",
