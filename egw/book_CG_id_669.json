{"word": "Chap. Forty-Four - Administration of Corrective Discipline\n\n     Ask the Lord to Come In and Rule.--Exact obedience in your family; but while you do this, seek the Lord with your children, and ask Him to come in and rule. Your children may have done something that demands punishment; but if you deal with them in the spirit of Christ, their arms will be thrown about your neck; they will humble themselves before the Lord and will acknowledge their wrong. That is enough. They do not then need punishment. Let us thank the Lord that He has opened the way by which we may reach every soul.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 244}
