{"word": "An Ear That Can Listen With Sympathy.--There is need of shepherds who, under the direction of the Chief Shepherd, will seek for the lost and straying. This means the bearing of physical discomfort and the sacrifice of ease. It means a tender solicitude for the erring, a divine compassion and forbearance. It means an ear that can listen with sympathy to heartbreaking recitals of wrong, of degradation, of despair and misery.--GW 184 (1915).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 763}
