{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     The third angel is represented as flying in the midst of heaven, showing that the message is to go forth throughout the length and breadth of the earth. It is the most solemn message ever given to mortals, and all who propose to connect themselves with the work should first feel their need of an education and the most thorough training. Plans should be made and efforts put forth for the improvement of all who anticipate entering any branch of the work. Ministerial labor should not be entrusted to boys, neither should the work of giving Bible readings be entrusted to young girls because they offer their services, and are willing to take responsible positions, while they are wanting in religious experience, and lack a thorough education and training. They must be proved; and unless they develop a firm, conscientious principle to be all that God would have them to be, they would not correctly represent his cause. All who are \n291\nengaged in the work, in every mission, should have a depth of experience. Those who are young in the work should have the help of such as have had an experience, and understand the manner of working. The missionary operations are constantly embarrassed for the want of workers of the right class of mind,\\97workers who have devotion and piety that will correctly represent our faith.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 290}
