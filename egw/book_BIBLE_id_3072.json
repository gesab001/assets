{"word": "There is no limit to the Lord's efficiency. He is prepared to advance and to add new territory to His kingdom; but His people must do their part in carrying forward this work. \"Ask, and it shall be given you\" is the promise. Our part is to rest on the word with unwavering faith, believing that God will do according to His promise. Let faith cut its way through the shadows of the enemy. When a questioning doubt arises, go to Christ, and let the soul be encouraged by communion with Him. The redemption He has purchased for us is complete. The offering He made was plenteous and without stint. Heaven has a never-failing supply of help for all who need help.--Bible Echo, June 11, 1900.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 197}
