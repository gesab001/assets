{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     Ministers need to have a more clear, simple manner of presenting the truth as it is in Jesus. They themselves need to comprehend more fully the great plan of salvation. There are many among their hearers who want a plain, clear explanation of the steps requisite in conversion. The great masses of the people are more ignorant on this point than many suppose. Among graduates of colleges, eloquent orators, able statesmen, men in high positions of trust, there are many who have given their powers \n263\nto other matters, and have neglected the things of greatest importance. When such men form a part of the congregation, the speaker generally strains every power to preach an intellectual discourse; he chooses a subject that will have in it as little of the simplicity of true Bible religion and heart service to God as possible. He does not preach Christ. He does not show that sin is the transgression of the law. He seldom makes plain the plan of salvation. He seldom tells what one must do to be saved. That which would have touched the hearts of the hearers would have been to show them Christ upon the cross of Calvary to bring redemption within their reach. They need to be taught as children how to make Jesus their friend, how to bring him into their life-work.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 262}
