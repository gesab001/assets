{"word": "Jesus said of His disciples, \\93And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.\\94 That love wherewith the infinite God loved His Son is to be conveyed to fallen man who believes in Jesus Christ. He transfuses this love through those who believe. As our life-blood, so is the circulating vitality of that love diffused through every part of our nature, that it may dwell in us as it does in Him. Wonderful statement! That it is possible for God to love us as He loves Christ. He loves the believing soul because he is a part of Christ, a partaker of the divine nature.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 38}
