    "word": "When we follow plans of the Lord's devising \"we are laborers together with God.\" Whatever our position,-- whether presidents of conferences, ministers, teachers, \n                                                                           87\nstudents, or lay members,--we are held accountable by the Lord for making the most of our opportunities to enlighten those in need of present truth. And one of the principal agencies He has ordained for our use is the printed page. In our schools and sanitariums, in our home churches, and particularly in our annual camp meetings, we must learn to make a wise use of this precious agency. With patient diligence chosen workers must instruct our people how to approach unbelievers in a kindly, winning way and how to place in their hands literature in which the truth for this time is presented with clearness and power.",
