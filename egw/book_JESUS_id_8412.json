Now I want you to consider this and put away your distrust, your worrying, your fears. Look away from yourself to Jesus, look away from your husband to Jesus. God has spoken to you words of encouragement. Grasp them, act upon them, walk by faith and not by sight. \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" (Hebrews 11:1).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 807}
