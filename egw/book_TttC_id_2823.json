    "word": "I entreat you to carefully consider the instructions in Paul's Epistle to the Galatians: \"For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.\" I fear that you are in great danger of making shipwreck of faith. You consider that you have sacrifices to make to obey the truth. We believe that you have made some sacrifices, but had you been more thorough in this \n                                                                           493\nwork, your feet would not now be stumbling, your faith wavering. I do not refer now to sacrifice of means, but to what comes closer than this, to that which would cause you a more painful conflict than to give your means, to that which touches self especially. You have not yielded your pride, your love of the approbation of an unbelieving world. You love to have men speak well of you.",
