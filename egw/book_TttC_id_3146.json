    "word": "Brother G might have pursued a course to help Brother H and at the same time help himself; but selfishness deprived Brother H of advantages, and Brother G himself was disadvantaged through fear that he would advantage others. Brother G has not loved his neighbor as himself, and his supreme selfishness in many things has deprived him of good and shut away from him the blessing of God. In the end, it does not profit any man to be selfish; for God marks it all and will render to every man according to his works. \"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" \"He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly.\"",
