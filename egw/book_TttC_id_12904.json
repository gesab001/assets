    "word": "Although much remains to be done for the colored people, we have cause for rejoicing over the good beginning that has been made. In a recent number of The Gospel Herald [1907] it is reported that \"fifteen years ago there were not over twenty colored Seventh-day Adventists south of Mason and Dixon's line; but today there are seven hundred. Twelve years ago there was only one colored Seventh-day Adventists church; today there are fifty, not counting those in Africa and the West Indies. . . . The tithe of the colored people last year in the United States amounted to five thousand dollars; fifteen years ago it was not over fifty dollars.\"",
