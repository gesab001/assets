    "word": "Unbelief, like the pall of death, is surrounding our churches, because they do not exercise the talents God has given them, by imparting the light to those who know not the precious truth. The Lord calls for the pardoned soul, those who rejoice in the light, to make known the truth to others. The living agents are needed to communicate the light of truth, and the result will be, those who are now ignorant of the truth will, through the grace of Christ, become precious in the sight of the Lord, and will exert an influence to the glory of God. [GENERAL CONFERENCE DAILY BULLETIN, VOL. V, NO. 4, PP. 131-133 (PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY, 1893).]",
