    "word": "It seemed a great mystery to the people when it was ascertained that Jesus was already dead. They could not reason that this sudden death was from a supernatural cause. It was found that the two thieves were still living, and their legs were broken; but Christ was dead already, and His legs were left untouched. \"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
