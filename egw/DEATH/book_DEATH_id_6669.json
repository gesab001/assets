    "word": "Oh, my Father, my Father, Thou didst so love the world that Thou gavest Thine only beloved Son to die a shameful death, that the world through Him might have everlasting life! Thou hast given the human family here below the privilege of educating themselves in right-doing, that they may be prepared to unite with the sinless family above, and dwell forevermore in Thy kingdom. We see the opportunities and the privileges that are passing by, and yet there are hearts that are becoming more and still more hardened, less and still less sensitive. Oh, we pray Thee, for the sake of Jesus Christ who has borne the stripes, who has suffered the agonies of the crucifixion to make it possible for every soul that lives to unite with the family of God--oh, we pray, my Saviour, we pray Thee to break up this hardness of heart! I pray Thee to melt and subdue the soul.",
