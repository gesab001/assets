White\n     The Lord desires every one of us to be decidedly in earnest. We cannot afford to make a mistake in spiritual matters. The life-and-death question with us is, \"What shall I do, that I may be saved, eternally saved?\" \"What shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life--a life that measures with the life of God?\" This is a question that it becomes every one of us to consider carefully. . . .",
