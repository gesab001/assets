    "word": "THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE PATTERN.\u2014The waiting saints will be looking for Him, and gazing into heaven, as were the \u201cmen of Galilee\u201d when He ascended from the Mount of Olivet. Then, those only who are holy, those who have followed fully the meek Pattern will, with rapturous \n95\njoy, exclaim as they behold Him, \u201cLo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us.\u201d And they will be changed \u201cin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump,\u201d that wakes the sleeping saints, and calls them forth from their dusty beds, clothed with glorious immortality, shouting Victory! Victory! over death and the grave. The changed saints are caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air, never more to be separated from the object of their love.\u2014RH June 10, 1852 quoted in SD 360.",
