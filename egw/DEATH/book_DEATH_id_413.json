    "word": "If the church of Christ were fulfilling the purpose of our Lord, light would be shed upon all that sit in darkness and in the region and shadow of death. Instead of congregating together and shunning responsibility and cross-bearing, the members of the church would scatter into all lands, letting the light of Christ shine out from them, working as He did for the salvation of souls, and this \"gospel of the kingdom\" would speedily be carried to all the world.--Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 42, 43.",
