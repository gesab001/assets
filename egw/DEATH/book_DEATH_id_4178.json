    "word": "Peter, speaking through the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, said: \"Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day.\" \"For David is not ascended into the heavens.\" [Acts 2:29, 34.] The fact that David remains in the grave until the resurrection proves that the righteous do not go to Heaven at death. It is only through the resurrection, and by virtue of the fact that Christ has risen, that David can at last sit at the right hand of God.",
