    "word": "Christ sought to impart special instruction to the first disciples to prepare them for the trial of faith they must endure in His rejection and crucifixion by the Jews. \"The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men,\" He said, \"and they shall kill Him; and the third day He shall rise again.\" \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whosoever shall save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for My sake shall find it. For what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father, with His angels; and then shall He reward every man according to his works. Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in His kingdom.\"",
