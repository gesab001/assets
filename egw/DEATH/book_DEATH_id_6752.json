    "word": "More recently your case has again been presented before me. I was shown that for a long time your thoughts and feelings, your spirit and deportment, have not been of a character to give you moral solidity, to make you a man of holy influence. After the death of your wife, the weakness of your character was evinced in your attentions to young girls.

Your own ways, your own feelings, your appetites and passions, have held sway until you have placed yourself where you are now trammeled and are inclined to please yourself irrespective of the counsel of God.",
