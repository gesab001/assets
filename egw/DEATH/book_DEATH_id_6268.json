    "word": "MR No. 581 - Relationship of Prayer to Soulwinning\n\n     Had you helped them when you saw them [discouraged ones] halting, had you in brotherly love drawn them into safe paths, had you manifested a spirit of interest, and shown that you did care for their souls, had you prayed with them and for them, you might have saved souls from death, and covered a multitude of sins. He who offers up fervent prayers in earnest love for the souls for whom Christ has died, will not only benefit those for whom he prays, but will benefit himself. . . .",
