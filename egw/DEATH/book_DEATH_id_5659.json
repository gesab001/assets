    "word": "\"'He that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.' Every one is sowing some kind of seed, the fruit of which will be a savor of life unto life, or of death unto death. Young men and women, what kind of a harvest are you preparing to garner? Are you sowing unto eternal life, or unto wretchedness and corruption? On the decision of this momentous question depends your happiness or misery for eternity.\" \n                                      Ellen G. White \n                                                                           19",
