    "word": "I saw the nominal churches had fallen, coldness and death reigned in their midst. God gave them His word to humble them, if they had followed His teachings. But they got above the work, it was too humbling for them to repeat the same simple story when they met together. They tried to get something new and great, and studied how they could please men and have their words exact to their ear, and God's Spirit left them, for instead of praying and talking to God, they prayed and talked to man.--Letter 9, 1853, p. 2. (To Sister Kellogg, December 4, 1853.)",
