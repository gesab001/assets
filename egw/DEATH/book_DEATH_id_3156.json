    "word": "\"Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\" (Galatians 6:6, 7). Wonderful truth! This is a two-edged sword which cuts both ways.

There is no middle ground, no second probation.",
