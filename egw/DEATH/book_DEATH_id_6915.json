    "word": "Your skin may be black; this you cannot help. You are not accountable for the color of your skin. And it does not in any way affect the question of your salvation. Your words are of far more consequence with God. It is your words and manner of works that tell whether you have passed from death unto life. Give yourselves to the hearing of the Word of God, and let each one make as much as possible of the opportunities that God has given him. You are not man\u2019s property. You belong to Christ, for He has bought you. You have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb. Will you not be witnesses for Christ? Will you not show by a well-ordered life and godly conversation that the seed of truth sown in your heart has sprung up to bear good fruit?",
