    "word": "Where, in the pages of God's Word, is such teaching to be found? Will the redeemed in Heaven be lost to all emotions of pity and compassion, and even to feelings of common humanity? Are these to be exchanged for the indifference of the stoic, or the cruelty of the savage?\u2014No, no; such is not the teaching of the Book of God. Those who present the views expressed in the quotations given above may be learned and even honest men; but they are deluded by the sophistry of Satan. He leads them to misconstrue strong expressions of Scripture, giving to the language the coloring of bitterness and malignity which pertains to himself, but not to our Creator. \u201cAs I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked \n536\nturn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?\u201d [Ezekiel 33:11.]",
