    "word": "A physician occupies a more important position because of dealing with morbid souls, diseased minds, and afflicted bodies, than does the minister of the gospel. The physician can present an elevated standard of Christian character, if he will be instant in season and out of season. He is thus a missionary for the Lord, doing the Master's work with fidelity, and will receive a reward by and by. Let the Christian keep his own counsel, and divulge no secret to unbelievers. Let him communicate no secret that will disparage God's people. Guard your thoughts; close the door to \n\n\n                      -38- \n\ntemptation. Do your work as in the sight of the Divine Watcher. Work patiently, expecting that, through the grace of Christ, you will make a success in your profession. Keep up the barriers which the Lord has erected for your safety. Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life, or of death.",
