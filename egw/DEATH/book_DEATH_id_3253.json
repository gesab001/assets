    "word": "Sin did not kill the law, but it did kill the carnal mind in Paul. \"Now we are delivered from the law,\" he declares, \"that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter\" (Romans 7:6). \"Was that then which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful\" (Romans 7:13). \"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Romans 7:12). Paul calls the attention of his hearers to the broken law, and shows them wherein they are guilty. He instructs them as a schoolmaster instructs his scholars, and shows them the way back to their loyalty to God.",
