    "word": "A defective life is a dishonor to God.  Co-workers with Christ will manifest no harshness, no self-sufficiency.  These elements must be purified from the soul, and the gentleness of Christ take possession.  Never be unkind to any soul, for by the grace of God that soul may become an heir of God and joint heir with Christ.  Do not bruise the hearts of Christ's purchased ones, for in doing this you bruise the heart of Christ.  Ever remember that we must all meet again around the great white throne, there to receive the approval or disapproval of God.  A soul hurt is often a soul destroyed.  Let those who have light and privileges remember that their very position of trust makes them responsible for souls.  They will have to meet again those whom they have driven from Christ bruised and wounded to death.",
