    "word": "God in Christ gave Himself for our sins. He suffered the cruel death of the cross, bore for us the burden of guilt, \u201cthe just for the unjust,\u201d that He might reveal to us His love and draw us to Himself. And He says, \u201cBe ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.\u201d Ephesians 4:32, R.V. Let Christ, the divine Life, dwell in you and through you reveal the heaven-born love that will inspire hope in the hopeless and bring heaven\u2019s peace to the sin-stricken heart. As we come to God, this is the condition which meets us at the threshold, that, receiving mercy from Him, we yield ourselves to reveal His grace to others.",
