    "word": "Fashionable mothers clothe their little girls as unhealthfully as they do themselves. Their waists are compressed at an early age, and the limbs are left with but slight protection, when the forces of nature need every advantage to enable them to perfect the physical frame. The limbs were not formed to endure exposure, as was the face. Children who are clothed according to fashion cannot be out-doors much, unless the weather is mild. Therefore they are kept in ill-ventilated rooms, for fear of the cold; and well they may be, with their fashionable style of clothing. But if they were comfortably clothed, it would not harm them to exercise freely in the open air summer or winter. Unhealthful dress brings many a child to a state of invalidism, or, which in many cases may be preferable, to an early death. Thus fashion fills the homes of its slaves with invalids, and our cemeteries with little graves.",
