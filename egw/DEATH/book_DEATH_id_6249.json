    "word": "My husband died in 1881. During the time that has passed since then, I have missed him constantly. For one year after his death, I felt my loss keenly, until the Lord, when I was at the gates of death, healed me instantly. This was at a campmeeting held at Healdsburg, about a year after my husband's death. Since that time, I have been willing to live, or willing to die, just as the Lord sees I can best glorify Him.--Letter 396, 1906, pp. 1, 2. (To Sister Belden, December 26, 1906.)",
