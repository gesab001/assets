    "word": "Letter E\n     \u201cSunnyside\u201d \n     Cooranbong, N.S.W. \n     March 8, 1897 \n     If we could only realize that Christ crucified is the great object of our faith. Had Christ lived, He could not have been our Redeemer. Our faith must lay hold of the sacrificial offering of His life as a ransom for the world. His holiness of life, the tender compassion, the sympathy He manifested for all human woe, would not have saved us had it stopped there. It was not until, \n48\nwhen dying upon the cross, He cried in agony, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d that the work was accomplished. Not until He had descended to the lowest depths of humiliation, until He could go no farther, was the tyranny of Satan broken. It was the death of Christ that satisfied divine justice. This was the price our ransom cost. Nothing is wanting now but for the will of man to bow, self to be crucified, and Christ to live in the heart. The soul temple must be dedicated to Him.",
