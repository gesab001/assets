    "word": "All heaven will be emptied of the angels, while the waiting saints will be looking for Him and gazing into heaven, as were the men of Galilee when He ascended from the Mount of Olivet. Then only those who are holy, those who have followed fully the meek Pattern, will with rapturous joy exclaim as they behold Him, \"Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us.\" And they will be changed \"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump\"--that trump which wakes the sleeping saints, and calls them forth from their dusty beds, clothed with glorious immortality, and shouting, \"Victory! Victory over death and the grave!\"",
