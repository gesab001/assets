    "word": "The question, What is the sanctuary? is clearly answered in the Scriptures. The term \"sanctuary,\" as used in the Bible, refers, first, to the tabernacle built by Moses, as a pattern of heavenly things; and, secondly, to the \"true tabernacle\" in heaven, to which the earthly sanctuary pointed. At the death of Christ the typical service ended. The \"true tabernacle\" in heaven is the sanctuary of the new covenant.",
