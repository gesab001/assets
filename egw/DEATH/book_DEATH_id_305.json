    "word": "In the experience of Huss was a witness, a monument erected, calling the attention of the world to the promise: \u201cBe thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life\u201d (Revelation 2:10). Registered in the history of nations, John Huss lives. His godly works and steadfast faith, his pure life and conscientious following of the truth that was unfolded to him, these he would not yield even to be saved a cruel death. That triumphant death was witnessed by all heaven, by the whole universe. Satan bruised the heel of the seed of the woman, but in the act of Huss his head was bruised. . . .",
