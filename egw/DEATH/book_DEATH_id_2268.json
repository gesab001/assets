    "word": "Visit to Texas \n\n     Thursday we went to Brother McDearman's at Grand Prairie. Here our daughter met her parents and her brother and sister, who had all been brought near to the door of death by the fever which had prevailed in the State during the past summer. We took great pleasure in ministering to the wants of this  afflicted family, who  had in years past liberally assisted us in our affliction. They were somewhat  improved in health when we left them to attend the Plano camp meeting, held November 12-19. Here we were happy to meet our old friends Elder R. M. Kilgore and his wife. And we were highly pleased to find a large and intelligent body of brethren on the ground. My testimony was never received more readily and heartily than by this people. I became deeply  interested in the work in the great State of Texas.",
