    "word": "Paul proceeded to give the order and object of the Lord's supper, and then warned his brethren against perverting this sacred ordinance: \"As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. . . . He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.\"",
