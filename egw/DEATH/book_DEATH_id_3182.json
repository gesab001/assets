    "word": "Help Needed Now \n\n     Many who are able to give liberally when the cause is in need, selfishly retain their means, and soothe their conscience with a plan for doing some great thing for the cause of God after their death.  They make a will, giving a large sum to the church and its various interests, and then settle down with a feeling that they have done all that is required of them.  Wherein have they denied self by this act?  They have, on the contrary, revealed selfishness. When they have no further use for their money, they propose to give it to God. But they will retain it as long as they can, till they are compelled to relinquish it by a messenger that cannot be turned aside.",
