    "word": "Now Fannie, I am desirous for your best good, and wish that you may not have the least bit of vanity of mind in any direction. I am burdened for you. I want you should make a success of overcoming every temptation to be vain, or worldly, or self-sufficient; for it is death to spirituality. It places our souls open to the suggestions of Satan. O, I am sure our sisters from America in many respects have done great harm in influence to the work of God among the people of this country, and the converting power of God must be daily realized in their hearts and upon their characters, else Satan will use them as decoys to souls, although they may be zealously engaged in missionary work as far as appearances go, and yet God has been dishonored, God has not been glorified in all things, and heaven is disappointed.",
