    "word": "In the last great conflict of the controversy with Satan those who are loyal to God will see every earthly support cut off. Because they refuse to break His law in obedience to earthly powers, they will be forbidden to buy or sell. It will finally be decreed that they shall be put to death. . . . But to the obedient is given the promise, \"He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.\" Isaiah 33:16. By this promise the children of God will live.",
