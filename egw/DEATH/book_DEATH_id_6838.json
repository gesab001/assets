    "word": "Prayer \n\n     Every sanitarium established among Seventh-day Adventists should be made a Bethel. All who are connected with this branch of the work should be consecrated to God. Those who minister to the sick, who perform delicate, grave operations, should remember that one slip of the knife, one nervous tremor, and a soul may be launched into eternity. They should not be allowed to take so many responsibilities that they have no time for special seasons of prayer. By earnest prayer they should acknowledge their dependence upon God. Only through a sense of God's pure truth in the mind and heart, only through the calmness and strength, which He alone can impart, are they qualified to perform those critical operations which mean life or death to the afflicted ones.",
