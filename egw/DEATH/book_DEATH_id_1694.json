    "word": "Said the  prophet Isaiah: \u201cAwake and sing, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.\u201d \u201cThy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.\u201d \u201cHe will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth; for the Lord hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us. This is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.\u201d [Isaiah 26:19; 25:8, 9.]",
