The teachers of the Jewish nation professed to educate the youth to understand the purity and excellence of the laws of that kingdom which is to stand for ever and ever, but they perverted truth and purity. Though they said of themselves, \"The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are we,\" yet they crucified the originator of all the Jewish economy, him to whom all their ordinances pointed. They failed to discern the veiled mystery of godliness; Christ Jesus remained veiled to them. The truth, the life, the heart of all their service, was discarded. They held, and still hold, the mere husks, the shadows, the figures symbolizing the true. A figure for the time appointed, that they might discern the true, became so perverted by their own inventions, that their eyes were blinded.

Meats and drinks and divers ordinances were multiplied until ceremonial religion constituted their only worship.",
