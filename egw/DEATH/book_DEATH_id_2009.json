    "word": "A TIE NEVER TO BE BROKEN.\u2014By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan\u2019s purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us. \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son.\u201d John 3:16. He gave Him not only to bear our sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human nature. This is the pledge that God will fulfill His word. \u201cUnto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder.\u201d",
