    "word": "God has made one great condescension to save erring, lost man; He yielded His dearly Beloved from His bosom to suffer indignity, scorn, and hate, to die an ignominious death upon the cross. If anyone will be His disciple now, he must live a self-denying life. His will must die. The plan of salvation is laid. Now man must condescend, now man must yield. His life must be a continual yielding. God does not deviate or change from His plan at all to save any. The great condescension has been made. Now it all lies with man, whether he will accept the plan God has laid down, whether he will yield his will to the will of God. God does not change now to accommodate man. He is left now to choose life or death. If he chooses life, he chooses the cross, the suffering, self-denying life of Christ, and he must not go murmuring along at the ruggedness of the way.",
