    "word": "The influence of a few friends balanced the matter with Bro. Andrews. It would have been for the salvation of Alva Orton had his parents moved with him from Rochester to some more retired place. But Bro. Andrews' locating there made it hard for them to leave. Bradley Lamson should not have settled in Rochester. It is a hard place to live the truth and to bring up children aright. Since the death of Bro. Lamson, sister Lamson should have moved from that wicked city, and placed her children in a community more favorable to their forming a Christian character. The sight of the eyes and the hearing of the ears in a wicked city like Rochester blunt the conscience and stupefy the sensibilities to eternal things. Good and evil are placed nearly upon a level. Bro. Andrews' living in Rochester has influenced, or held, the others there. They seemed rooted, and no influence could be brought to bear upon them of sufficient force to start them from Rochester. These believers in the truth were not wise in bringing up their children in that wicked city. \n                                                                           78",
