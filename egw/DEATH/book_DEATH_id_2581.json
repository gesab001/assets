    "word": "Chap. 57 - Hatred and Revenge\n\n\n     Thought Enfolds the Deed.--The spirit of hatred and revenge originated with Satan, and it led him to put to death the Son of God. Whoever cherishes malice or unkindness is cherishing the same spirit, and its fruit will be unto death. In the revengeful thought the evil deed lies enfolded, as the plant in the seed. \"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him\" (1 John 3:15).--MB 56 (1896).",
