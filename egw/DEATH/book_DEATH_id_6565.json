    "word": "But the wages of sin is death. All is a delusive snare. Satan is a deceiver; he deceives the whole world, and those who yield themselves up to his will to follow the prince of darkness become the agents of the wily tempter to solicit others to sin; the tempted to enter into unsafe paths becomes a tempter and leads others to forbidden paths to the transgression of the law of God.",
