    "word": "SJ - The Story of Jesus (1896, 1900) [Adapted from EGW material]\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n     THE INFLUENCE OF THE EARTHLY LIFE OF JESUS OUR SAVIOUR APPEARS ON EVERY FEATURE OF NATURE, IN EVERY PHASE OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE, IN EVERY FACT OF LIFE. WE CAN NEVER FULLY REALIZE HOW DEEP IS THE IMPRESSION, HOW WIDESPREAD IS THE INFLUENCE, OF THE LIFE OF JESUS OF NAZARETH. EVERY BLESSING OF EVERY KIND COMES TO US THROUGH THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH WHICH WAS FORMED WHEN THE LORD OF GLORY ESPOUSED THE CAUSE OF A WORLD LOST IN SIN.\n     THE INFINITE PATHOS OF THAT STORY HAS INSPIRED THE PEN OF THE LEARNED AND THE TONGUE OF THE ELOQUENT. BUT IT IS BEST TOLD IN CHILDLIKE LANGUAGE. THE WONDERFUL SPECTACLE NEEDS NO HUMAN COLORING. ITS GLORY SURPASSES THE ART OF MEN. IT SHINES BRIGHTEST IN ITS OWN LUSTER.\n     IN THESE PAGES NO EFFORT IS MADE TOWARD ARTIFICIAL EMBELLISHMENT. THE PLAIN STORY, AS TOLD BY ONE WHO IS MOVED BY A DEEP SENSE OF THE INFINITE PROPORTIONS OF THE SUBJECT, HAS BEEN PUT INTO THE LANGUAGE OF THE YOUNG. IN ITS SIMPLICITY NOT ONLY DOES IT SPEAK TO THE HEARTS OF THE YOUNG, BUT IT MEETS THE DESIRE EXPRESSED BY US ALL IN THE FAMILIAR SONG--\n\n          \"TELL ME THE STORY SIMPLY, AS TO A LITTLE CHILD.\"\n\n     MAY IT BE RECEIVED IN THE SAME SIMPLICITY AND PURITY OF FAITH.\n\n                      GEORGE C. TENNEY.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Birth of Jesus ................................................. 13\n\nJesus Presented in the Temple ...................................... 17\n\nThe Visit of the Wise Men .......................................... 21\n\nThe Flight into Egypt .............................................. 25\n\nChild Life of Jesus ................................................ 29\n\nDays of Conflict ................................................... 37\n\nThe Baptism ........................................................ 41\n\nThe Temptation ..................................................... 43\n\nEarly Ministry ..................................................... 49\n\nTeachings of Christ ................................................ 59\n\nSabbathkeeping ..................................................... 67\n\nThe Good Shepherd .................................................. 75\n\nRiding into Jerusalem .............................................. 83\n\n\"Take These Things Hence\" .......................................... 89\n\nAt the Passover Supper ............................................. 93\n\nIn Gethsemane ..................................................... 101\n\nThe Betrayal and Arrest ........................................... 107\n\nBefore Annas, Caiaphas, and the Sanhedrin ......................... 113\n\nJudas ............................................................. 119\n\nBefore Pilate ..................................................... 123\n\nBefore Herod ...................................................... 129\n\nCondemned by Pilate ............................................... 133\n\nCalvary ........................................................... 139\n\nDeath of Christ ................................................... 145\n\nIn Joseph's Tomb .................................................. 149\n\nHe is Risen ....................................................... 153\n\nGo Tell My Disciples .............................................. 157\n\nWitnesses ......................................................... 161\n\nThe Ascension ..................................................... 167\n\nComing Again ...................................................... 173\n\nA Day of Judgment ................................................. 179\n\nThe Home of the Saved ............................................. 183\n\n\nChap. 1 - The Birth of Jesus\n\n     In the little town of Nazareth, nestled among the hills of Galilee, was the home of Joseph and Mary, who were afterward known as the earthly parents of Jesus.",
