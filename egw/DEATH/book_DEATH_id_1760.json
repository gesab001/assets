But the \u201cfamiliar spirits,\u201d as these visitants from other worlds were called, are declared by the Bible to be the \u201cspirits of devils.\u201d [COMPARE Numbers 25:1-3; Psalm 106:28; 1 Corinthians 10:20; Revelation 16:14.] The work of dealing with familiar spirits was pronounced an abomination to the Lord, and was solemnly forbidden under penalty of death. [Leviticus 19:31; 20:27.] The very name of witchcraft is now held in contempt. The claim that men can hold intercourse with evil spirits is regarded as a fable of the Dark Ages. But Spiritualism, which numbers its converts by hundreds of thousands, yea, by millions, which has made its way into scientific circles, which has invaded churches, and has found favor in legislative bodies, and even in the courts of kings\u2014this mammoth deception is but a revival, in a new disguise, of the witchcraft condemned and prohibited of old.",
