    "word": "Mental Illness Produced by Unsanctified Tongues (comments on the death of the wife of an executive).-- Sister _____ was so weighted down with sorrow that she lost her reason. I ask, Who, in the day of judgment, will be held responsible for putting out the light of that mind that should be shining today? Who will be accountable in the day of God for the work that caused the distress which brought on this sickness? She suffered for months, and the husband suffered with her. And now the poor woman has gone, leaving two motherless children. All this because of the work done by unsanctified tongues.--MS 54, 1904.",
