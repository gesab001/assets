    "word": "We must keep Jesus our pattern ever before us. This is and ever will be present truth. It was by beholding Jesus and appreciating the virtues of His character that John became one with his Master in spirit. With spiritual vision he saw Christ's glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth; and he was changed from glory to glory into His likeness. And to him was committed the work of telling of the Saviour's love and the love His children should manifest for one another. \"This is the message that ye heard from the beginning,\" \n                                                                           136\nhe writes, \"that we should love one another. . . . We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.\"",
