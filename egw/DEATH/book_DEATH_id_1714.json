    "word": "The slaying of the passover lamb was a shadow of the death of Christ. Says Paul, \u201cChrist our passover is sacrificed for us.\u201d [1 Corinthians 5:7.] The sheaf of first-fruits, which at the time of the Passover was waved before the Lord, was typical of the resurrection of Christ. Paul says, in speaking of the resurrection of the Lord, and of all his people, \u201cChrist the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.\u201d [1 Corinthians 15:23.] Like the wave-sheaf, which was the first ripe grain gathered before the harvest, Christ is the first-fruits of that immortal harvest of redeemed ones that at the future resurrection shall be gathered into the garner of God.",
