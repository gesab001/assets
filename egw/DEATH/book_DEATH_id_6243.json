    "word": "MR No. 504 - Divorce and Remarriage\n\n     I am fully convinced that Brother Wales should be given encouragement to stand forth in the strength of the Lord as an overcomer. I see no reason why he should be hounded to death by his fellow-men, when the Lord Jesus says, \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land. . . . And I will turn My hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away thy sin.\"",
