    "word": "Gracious Words--The Pharisees were filled with a frenzy of hatred against Him, because they could see that His teaching had a power and an attractiveness that their words were utterly devoid of. \n                                                                           78\nThey decided that the only way to cut off His influence was to pass sentence of death upon Him, and therefore they sent officers to take Him. But when the officers came within hearing of His voice, and listened to His gracious words, they were charmed into forgetting their errand.--Ms 33, 1911.",
