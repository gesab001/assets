    "word": "Previously when the Sanhedrin had been called together, to lay plans for waylaying Christ, and putting Him to death, Caiaphas said, Cannot ye see that the world is gone after Him?

In reply to them, Caiaphas said, \"Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us (He might have said, a corrupted priesthood), that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not\" [John 11:49, 50].",
