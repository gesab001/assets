    "word": "The disciples of Christ who were with Him from day to day did not comprehend His mission. . . . They were unacquainted with His unlimited resources and power. Although they had witnessed His miracles they did not discern His relationship to the Father. Just before His death He said to them, \"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name.\" In simple language Jesus explained to them that the secret of their success would be in asking the Father for strength and grace in His name. He would be present before the face of the Father to make request in their behalf. . . .",
