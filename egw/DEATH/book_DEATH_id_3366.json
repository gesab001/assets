    "word": "In regard to cleanliness, God requires no less of his  people now, than he did of ancient Israel. A neglect of cleanliness will induce disease. Sickness and premature death, do not come without a cause. Stubborn fevers and violent diseases have prevailed in neighborhoods, and towns, that had formerly been considered healthy, and some have died, while others have been left with broken constitutions to be crippled with disease for life. In many instances their own yards contained the agent of destruction, which sent forth deadly poison into the atmosphere, to be inhaled by the family, and the neighborhood. The slackness and recklessness sometimes witnessed, is beastly, and the ignorance of the results of such things upon health is astonishing. \n                                                                           462\nSuch places should be purified, especially in summer, by lime, or ashes, or by a daily burial with earth.",
