    "word": "Many of the old, experienced hands have fallen in death. Those who led out in the work of God, and who could tell how it came into existence, have passed away from the scene of action. In every branch of the work, men have been departing from the principles laid down by the Lord Jehovah to control the working of the cause. Inexperienced hands and unsanctified minds have been placing their mold upon the work, and self has been woven into it in every branch.",
