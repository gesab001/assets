Martha hastened to meet Him; she told Him of her brother's death, saying, \"Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.\"  In her disappointment and grief she had not lost confidence in Jesus, and added, \"But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it unto thee.\" Jesus encouraged her faith by declaring to her, \"Thy brother shall rise again.\" . . .",
