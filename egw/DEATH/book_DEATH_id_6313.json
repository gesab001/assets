    "word": "Again Moses looked and saw the covenant of peace made with God's commandment-keeping people when He spoke from His holy habitation, shaking the heavens and the earth by His voice. Moses saw that God is the hope of His people, while the despisers of the law, those who had crucified Jesus Christ afresh, bowed . . . at the feet of the saints in fear of God's voice. He saw the countenances of the saints lighted up with glory and beaming upon those around them, as the faces of himself and those who were with him shone when the law was given on Mount Sinai. The commandment-keepers, those who had honored the law, were glorified. At the appearing of Christ in splendor and glory they were translated to heaven without seeing death, rising with songs of triumph to enter through the gates into the city, into the land of Eden.",
