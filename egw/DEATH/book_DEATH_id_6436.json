    "word": "God does not call upon His missionaries to show their devotion to Him by burying themselves in monasteries, or by going on long, painful pilgrimages. It is not necessary to do this to show a willingness to deny self. It is by working for those for whom Christ died that we show true love. By humiliation, suffering, and rejection Christ purchased the salvation of the human race. By His death He made it possible for man to enjoy a home in His eternal kingdom.",
