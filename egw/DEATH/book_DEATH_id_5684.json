    "word": "God gave his Son to a life of humiliation, self-denial, poverty, toil, reproach, and the agonizing death of the crucifixion. But there was no angel to bear the joyful commission, It is enough, you need not die, my well-beloved Son. Legions of angels were sorrowfully waiting, hoping that, as in the case of Isaac, God would at the last moment prevent his shameful death. But angels were not permitted to bear any such message to God's dear Son.",
