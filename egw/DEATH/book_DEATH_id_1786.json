    "word": "During the thousand years between the first and the second resurrection, the Judgment of the wicked takes place. The apostle Paul points to this Judgment as an event that follows the second advent. \u201cJudge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts.\u201d [1 Corinthians 4:5.] Daniel declares that when the Ancient of days \n661\ncame, \u201cJudgment was given to the saints of the Most High.\u201d [Daniel 7:22.] At this time the righteous reign as kings and priests unto God. John in the Revelation says: \u201cI saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.\u201d \u201cThey shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.\u201d [Revelation 20:4, 6; 1 Corinthians 6:2,3.] It is at this time that, as foretold by Paul, \u201cthe saints shall judge the world.\u201d [Revelation 20:4, 6; 1 Corinthians 6:2, 3.] In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according to the deeds done in the body. Then the portion which the wicked must suffer is meted out, according to their works; and it is recorded against their names in the book of death.",
