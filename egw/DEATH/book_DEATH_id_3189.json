    "word": "Wills should be made in a manner to stand the test of law.  After they are drawn, they may remain for years, and do no harm, if donations continue to be made from time to time as the cause has need.  Death will not come one day sooner, brethren, because you have made your will.  In disposing of your property by will to your relatives, be sure that you do not forget God's cause. You are His agents, holding His property; and His claims should have your first consideration.  Your wife and children, of course, should not be left destitute; provision should be made for them if they are needy.  But do not, simply because it is customary, bring into your will a long line of relatives who are not needy.",
