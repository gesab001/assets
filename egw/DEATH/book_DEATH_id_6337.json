    "word": "MR No. 846 - If One Sin had Tainted Christ's Character\n\n     To the honor and glory of God, His beloved Son--the Surety, the Substitute--was delivered up and descended into the prisonhouse of the grave. The new tomb enclosed Him in its rocky chambers. If one single sin had tainted His character the stone would never have been rolled away from the door of His rocky chamber, and the world with its burden of guilt would have perished. But it was only for a little while the divine Vanquisher seemed the vanquished. The serpent had bruised the heel, but Christ could not be holden by death. The stone was rolled away. The Lord Jesus walked forth from His prison house a triumphant, majestic conqueror, and proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, \"I am the resurrection and the life\" (John 11:25).--Ms. 81, 1893, p. 11.
