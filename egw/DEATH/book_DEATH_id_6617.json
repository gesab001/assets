    "word": "Brother [J.H.] Waggoner went to Ohio and took his wife, a body of death and darkness. He was a deceived man. God marked such inconsistencies. Repeatedly he had \n\n\n                                     -263- \n\nbeen reproved for being affected by the influence of his wife, for Satan was using her as an agent to destroy him and get him down from the work. Yet to please her he took the body of darkness with him. He did not believe the vision which had been related to him; if he had he would have acted out his faith. Had another taken the course he had taken, he would have censured him severely. He had had much light but did not follow it.",
