    "word": "Parents to Teach Their Children Obedience--Let ministers and people read the Word of the Lord on this point, for it is a life-or-death question [parental training]. Will you obey the word of the Lord, or will you walk contrary to a plain \"Thus saith the Lord\"? Parents, listen to the word of the Lord rather than to the word of men. Teach your children to obey the Word of God, for obedience means life and disobedience means death.",
