    "word": "About midnight every Egyptian household was aroused from their sleep by the cry of pain. They feared they were all to die. They remembered when the cry of\n95\ndistress and mourning was heard from the Hebrews because of the inhuman decree of a cruel king to slay all their male infants as soon as they were born. The Egyptians could not see the avenging angel, who entered every house and dealt the death blow, but they knew that it was the Hebrews\u2019 God who was causing them to suffer the same distress they had made the Israelites to suffer.\u2014YI May 1, 1873.",
