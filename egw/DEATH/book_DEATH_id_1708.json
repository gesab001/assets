    "word": "In 1821, three years after Miller had arrived at his exposition of the prophecies pointing to the time of the judgment, Dr. Joseph Wolff, \u201cthe missionary to the world,\u201d began to proclaim the Lord's soon coming. Wolff was born in Germany, of Hebrew parentage, his father being a Jewish Rabbi. While very young he was convinced of the truth of the Christian religion. Of an active, inquiring mind, he had been an eager listener to the conversations that took place in his father's house, as devout Hebrews daily assembled to recount the hopes and anticipations of their people, the glory of the coming Messiah, and the restoration of Israel. One day hearing Jesus of Nazareth mentioned, the boy inquired who he was. \u201cA man of the greatest talent,\u201d was the answer; \u201cbut because he pretended to be the Messiah, the Jewish tribunal sentenced him to death.\u201d \u201cWhy, then,\u201d rejoined the questioner, \u201cwhy is Jerusalem destroyed? and why are we in captivity?\u201d \u201cAlas, alas!\u201d answered his father, \u201cbecause the Jews murdered the prophets.\u201d The thought that was at once suggested to the child, \u201cPerhaps Jesus of Nazareth was also a prophet, and the Jews killed him when he was innocent.\u201d So strong was this feeling, that though forbidden to enter a Christian church, he would often linger outside to listen to the preaching.",
