    "word": "When Christ saw in the Jewish people a nation divorced from God, he saw also a professed Christian church united to the world and the Papacy. And as he stood upon Mount Olivet, weeping over Jerusalem till the sun sank behind the western hills, so he is watching over and pleading with sinners in these last moments of time. Soon he will say to the angels who are holding the four winds, \"Let the plagues loose; let darkness, destruction, and death come upon the transgressors of my law.\" Will he be obliged to say to those who have had great light and great knowledge, as he said to the Jews, \"O that thou hadst known, even thou in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace. But now they are hid from thine eyes.\"? (D.E.R August 22, 1900).",
