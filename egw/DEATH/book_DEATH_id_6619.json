    "word": "I spoke on Sabbath. These men were all there, no less than three of them hanging in the balance. The wind blew so that the pulpit had to be moved near to the people to preserve me from taking cold. I had great freedom in speaking, and told them plainly that the Lord Jesus was in our midst. I asked them to turn to Exodus 31: \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, [Now, said I, listen attentively to what the Lord is saying unto you this day] Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people\" [Exodus 31:12-14]. I read to the close of the chapter.",
