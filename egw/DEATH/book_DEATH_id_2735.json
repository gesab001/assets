    "word": "170\nThe book of Genesis gives quite a definite account of social and individual life, and yet we have no record of an infant\u2019s being born blind, deaf, crippled, deformed, or imbecile. There is not an instance upon record of a natural death in infancy, childhood, or early manhood. There is no account of men and women dying of disease. Obituary notices in the book of Genesis run thus: \u201cAnd all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\u201d\u201cAnd all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.\u201d . . .",
