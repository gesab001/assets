    "word": "Satan is not dead by any means. He is working to bring the shadow of death over your souls. Will you let him do it? Will you let him make you look at the darkness, and talk of the darkness? We are just to be like that moon. Light up all our way by faith. Through the shadow of darkness and of death Thou art the light of heaven. We are to talk of heaven and of heavenly things. We are to become more and more heavenly-minded. Now all the faith that you profess--we shall know something about it. You need not think that you can shut it up in a box like a nice perfume, and keep it there or in a bottle. But we shall know \n\n\n                                    -207- \n\njust the measure of your faith. How? By your works. By the fruits that you bear. If you have Christ abiding in your heart, you will talk Christ.",
