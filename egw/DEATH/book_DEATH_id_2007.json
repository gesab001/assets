    "word": "A HAPPY FAMILY.\u2014The nations of the saved will know no other law than the law of heaven. All will be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments of praise and thanksgiving. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, and the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and Christ will unite in proclaiming, \u201cThere shall be no more sin, neither shall there be any more death.\u201dPK 732, 733.",
