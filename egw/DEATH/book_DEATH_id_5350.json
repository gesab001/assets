    "word": "We must not allow ourselves to be chilled to death by those who know not what it means to walk with God. . . . We must not allow ourselves to enter into contention. We are to speak words that make for peace and grace and truth. We are to search our hearts diligently, humbling ourselves before God. We are to respect our brethren, but we are not to place them where God should be, for they are but men.--Letter 195, Sept. 6, 1903, to W. C. White.",
