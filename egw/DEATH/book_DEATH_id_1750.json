    "word": "What say the Scriptures concerning these things? David declares that man is not conscious in death. \u201cHis breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.\u201d [Psalm 146:4.] Solomon bears the same testimony: \u201cThe living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything.\u201d \u201cTheir love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.\u201d \u201cThere is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.\u201d [Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6, 10.]",
