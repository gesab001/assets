    "word": "Souls are perishing in their sins on every side. My soul is drawn out after them. I long to arouse them from their stupor of death. Oh, how many have never yet been warned, never heard the truth, while expostulations and warnings and prayers fall upon the ears of others who pay no heed but reject privileges and opportunities \n\n\n                                     -244- \n\nwhich would be for their salvation if they would profit by them. They seem ice-bound. But our own hearts must be warmed with the divine fire. Our own Christian efforts and our Christian example must be earnest and powerful.
