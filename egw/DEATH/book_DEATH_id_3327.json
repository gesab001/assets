    "word": "Blessed Are the Dead Who Die in the Lord \n\n            Comfort on the Death of a Mother \n\nDear Sister: \n\n\n     I have read the letter . . . in regard to your mother's death, and I could but say, \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord\" (Revelation 14:13). For a long time your mother had been very feeble. You have cared constantly for her. To see her face no more will be a great grief to you. Were we living nearer you, we would say, Come apart, and rest awhile. But your duties claim your time. I would say to you, Trust in the Lord.",
