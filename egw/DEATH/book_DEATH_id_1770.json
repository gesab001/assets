    "word": "\u201cThere is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.\u201d [Proverbs 16:25.] Ignorance is no excuse for error or sin, when there is every opportunity to know the will of God. A man is travelling, and comes to a place where there are several roads, and a guide-board indicating where each one leads. If he disregards the guide-board, and takes whichever road seems to him to be right, \n598\nhe may be ever so sincere, but will in all probability find himself on the wrong road.",
