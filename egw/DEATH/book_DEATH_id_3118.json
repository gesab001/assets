    "word": "The claim that Christ by His death abolished His Father's law is without foundation. Had it been possible for the law to be changed or set aside, then Christ need not have died to save man from the penalty of sin. The death of Christ, so far from abolishing the law, proves that it is immutable. The Son of God came to \"magnify the law, and make it honourable\" (Isaiah 42:21).... And concerning Himself He declares: \"I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart\" (Psalm 40:8).",
