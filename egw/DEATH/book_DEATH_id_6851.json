    "word": "(258) Men will arise with interpretations of Scripture which are to them truth; but which are not truth. The truth for this time, God has given us as a foundation for our faith. He himself has taught us what is truth. One will arise, and still another with new light, which contradicts the light that God has given under the demonstration of His Holy Spirit. A few are still alive who passed through the experiences gained in the establishment of this truth. God has graciously spared their lives to repeat and repeat, till the close of their lives, the experiences through which they passed, even as did John the apostle till the very close of his life. And the standard-bearers who have fallen in death are to speak through the reprinting of their writings. I am instructed that thus their voices are to be heard. [They are to bear] their testimonies as to what constitutes the truth for this time.",
