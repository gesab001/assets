    "word": "MR No. 991 - At Times Jesus Spoke Cutting Truths\n\n     The Lord Jesus was the light of the world, the greatest witness for truth the world has ever seen. When necessary He spoke truths which were keen and cutting as a two-edged sword, and sent them home to the conscience so forcibly that the priests and rulers could not bear His words, and planned again and again to put Him to death. But when they sought to take His life, He departed to other places.--Letter 123, 1900, pp. 2, 3. (Written to Edson and Emma White from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, N.S.W., August 14, 1900.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. June 6, 1983",
