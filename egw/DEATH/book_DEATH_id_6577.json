    "word": "On Sunday, for the last time I hope, I was carried up the stairs to the office hall, and met with the board. I read to them matters relating to the Echo Office. This is a new chapter in their experience, and I am anxiously waiting to see the result of \n\n\n                                     -162- \n\nthese meetings. Tuesday the committee came here, and I read to them some forty pages more of important matter. One man on the board, Brother P, is a critic; he has criticized everything. I made an appointment to meet him alone Wednesday morning at half-past five. I then talked two hours, and the Lord's presence was with me. I told him it was surely a case of life or death with him. If he continued his practice of criticizing everything as he had done, the Spirit of the Lord would be entirely withdrawn from him; the love of Jesus would not, could not, abide in his heart.",
