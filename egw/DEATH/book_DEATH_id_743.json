    "word": "The tree of knowledge, so-called, has become an instrument of death. Satan has artfully woven his dogmas, his false theories, into the instruction given. From the tree of knowledge he speaks the most pleasing flattery in regard to the higher education. Thousands partake of the fruit of this tree, but it means death to them. Christ says, \"Ye spend money for that which is not bread.\" Isaiah 55:2. You are using your heaven-entrusted talents to secure an education which God pronounces foolishness.",
