    "word": "Let us never forget that we are not our own, that we have been bought with a price. Our powers are to be regarded as sacred trusts, to be used to the glory of God and the good of our fellow men. We are a part of the cross of Christ. With earnest, unwearying fidelity we are to seek to save the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The Lord has put it out of our power to give Him anything that does not already belong to Him. He gave His life for us. We are His, bought with an infinite price. His sacrifice on Calvary has made it possible for us to live a new, transformed life. For life and for death we are bound up with His mercy and His love. We are included in His great plan for the saving of the lost. We are to be laborers together with Him, drawing others within the circle of His love. \n     ____________",
