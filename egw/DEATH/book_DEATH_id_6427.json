    "word": "An idol sabbath has been set up, as the golden image was set up in the plains of Dura. And as Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, issued a decree that all who would not bow down and worship this image should be killed, so a proclamation will be made that all who will not reverence the Sunday institution will be punished with imprisonment and death. Thus the Sabbath of the Lord is trampled underfoot. But the Lord has declared, \"Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and write grievousness which they have prescribed\" [Isaiah 10:1]. [Zephaniah 1:14-18; 2:1-3, quoted.]",
