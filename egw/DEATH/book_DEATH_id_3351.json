    "word": "Some animals that are brought to the slaughter seem to realize what is to take place, and they become furious, and literally mad. They are killed while in that state; and their flesh prepared for market. Their meat is poison, and has produced, in those who have eaten it, cramp, convulsions, apoplexy, and sudden death. Yet the cause of all this suffering is not attributed to meat. Some animals are inhumanly treated while being brought to the slaughter. They are literally tortured, and after they have endured many hours of extreme suffering, are butchered. Swine have been prepared for market even while the plague was upon them, and their poisonous flesh has spread contagious diseases, and great mortality has followed.--How to Live, No. 1, pp. 51-60. \n                                                                           420",
