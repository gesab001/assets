    "word": "\"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: to the one we are a savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ\" (2 Corinthians 2:14-17).",
