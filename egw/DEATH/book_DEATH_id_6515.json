    "word": "The Word of God is our standard of character. It is a \"form of sound words\" from the great Source of light and life. There is nothing that we need to preserve so sacredly as this standard of doctrine, a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" This is the pure fountain from which we are to draw the reasons for our faith. The Bible is our guide and textbook. The law of God is our covenant with our Maker, in life, in death, in the resurrection, and through all eternity. Our loyalty to God in obeying, in spirit and letter, the ten commandments, reveals to the world, to angels, and to men, our covenant relation with Him. Adam and Eve were to glorify God by personal and perpetual obedience to His law, and it is in this way that we are to give God glory for all His entrusted gifts. We are to love God supremely and our neighbor as ourselves.",
