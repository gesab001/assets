    "word": "It will be seen that Satan's rebellion against God has resulted in ruin to himself, and to all that chose to become his subjects. He has represented that great good would result from transgression; but it will be seen that \"the wages of sin is death.\" Romans 6:23. . . . An end will be made of sin, with all the woe and ruin that have resulted from it. Says the psalmist, \"Thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end.\" Psalm 9:5, 6.",
