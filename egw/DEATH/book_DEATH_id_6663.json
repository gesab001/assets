    "word": "And because the children of Israel went down into Egypt, they lost the knowledge of God. Moses went to bring them out with a strong arm, and the Lord told Moses to say, \"I am sent unto thee. Let my son go that he may serve me.\" (See Exodus 4:23.) Afterwards he says, \"Reprove them because they have not kept my Sabbath.\" And he brought them to Sinai, and the law of God \n\n\n                                      -234- \n\nwas spoken from the Mount. There God through His son, Jesus Christ, was the Founder of the whole Jewish economy. The sacrifices typified the wonderful Antitype. Jesus Christ was to come and give His life that He might set man free from Satan's claims, that He might unlock the prison houses and bring forth those that plead for a glorious immortality. When type met Antitype in the death of Christ, what was done? What need was there for any more sacrificial offerings? Type had met antitype. No more need for any sacrificial offerings, because the great antitypical offering had been made to save every transgressor of the law if they would believe on Jesus Christ as their Saviour and return to their loyalty. Then every sin and transgression would be forgiven.",
