    "word": "Aaron was a man of amiable disposition, whom God selected to stand with Moses and speak for him. . . . God might have chosen Aaron as leader; but He who is acquainted with hearts, who understands character, knew that Aaron was yielding and lacked moral courage to stand in defense of the right under all circumstances, irrespective of consequences. Aaron's desire to have the good will of the people sometimes led him to commit great wrongs. . . .

Nadab and Abihu failed to reverence the command of God to offer sacred fire upon their censers with the incense before Him. . . .",
