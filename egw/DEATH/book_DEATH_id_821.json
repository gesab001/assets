    "word": "Death of Mrs. S.M.I. Henry\nBrings a Real Loss to the Cause of God\n     Mrs. Henry Had a Work to Do Among WCTU Members.--I feel very sad in regard to Sister Henry's death. The light given me by the Lord was that He had a work for her to do among the WCTU, and that her strength must not be absorbed among our people. She could do for the WCTU that which no other one in our ranks could do, and she must not allow our people to lead her to use her God-given capabilities upon them. The Lord would go before her in her work.--7MR 167 (1900).",
