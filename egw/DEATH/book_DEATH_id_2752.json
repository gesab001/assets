    "word": "This earth is the place of preparation for heaven. The time spent here is the Christian\u2019s winter. Here the chilly winds of affliction blow upon us, and the waves of trouble roll against us. But in the near future, when Christ comes, sorrow and sighing will be forever ended. Then will be the Christian\u2019s summer. All trials will be over, and there will be no more sickness or death. \u201cGod shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away\u201d (Revelation 21:4).",
