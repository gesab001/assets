    "word": "At Gottenburg we embarked in a small boat which was to convey us across the channel to the coast of Denmark. Here I was provided with a state-room containing two sofas, and shut in by heavy curtains,\u2014accommodations which we then thought hardly necessary for a day journey of only six hours. We had occasion, however, to change this opinion before reaching land. The first hour we spent on deck, in the cheerful and well-furnished ladies\u2019 cabin. The weather was pleasant, the sea smooth, and we anticipated an enjoyable trip. But soon the captain, passing through the cabin, advised us to go below and lie down at once, for we were coming into rough water. We complied, though rather unwillingly. In a short time the boat began to rock violently; we could hardly keep our position upon the sofas. I became very ill, now in a profuse perspiration, as if every organ was struggling against the terrible malady, and then overcome by deathly seasickness. This was what I had dreaded in crossing the Atlantic, fearing the effect of violent wrenching upon my heart. At that time I happily escaped, but I now suffered all that I then anticipated.",
