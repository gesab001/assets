    "word": "Many complain of providence when their friends suffer or are removed by death; but it is not in the order of God that men and women should lead lives of suffering and die prematurely, leaving their work unfinished. God would have us live out the full measure of our days, with every organ in health, doing its appointed work. It is unjust to charge Him with a result which in many cases is due to the individual's own transgression of natural law.--RH, Feb 11, 1902.",
