    "word": "Will not old and young in your island home seek the Lord? Will you not strive most earnestly for the crown of immortality? Will you not hate sin, and pray most earnestly that you may have a sense of its exceeding sinfulness? Will you not hate that which caused the death of the Majesty of heaven, the Son of God? Always bear in mind the fact that there is one thing which God hates with a perfect hatred, and that is sin. It will prove the ruin of thousands, yea, millions of souls, because they choose to sin, and in sinning make themselves characters after Satan's likeness; and such, unless they repent, forsake sin, and believe in Jesus Christ, will never find a place in heaven.",
