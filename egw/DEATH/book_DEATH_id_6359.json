    "word": "My heart aches as I see how faint a realization human beings have of what has been done for them. How I wish they could see as I see what is meant by the punishment of the guilty. The invitation comes to us, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). Those who do not believe in Christ, receiving Him as a personal Saviour, must die in their sins. They must suffer the punishment of the second death. Those who remain in unbelief cannot appreciate the love that Christ has expressed for them, and they will never have an experimental knowledge of the suffering that Christ endured in order that their sins might be pardoned and they be received as children of God.--Letter 257, 1903, p. 5. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, Nov. 26, 1903.)",
