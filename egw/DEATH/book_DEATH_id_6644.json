    "word": "I had a long talk with Stephen Belden. [ELLEN WHITE'S FORMER BROTHER-IN-LAW. STEPHEN BELDEN WAS MARRIED TO ELLEN WHITE'S SISTER SARAH UNTIL HER DEATH IN 1868.] He is humble and seems to be in a good state spiritually. He is passing through sore trials now. I am sorry for him and tried to comfort him and encourage him to trust in the Lord. I had a talk with Brother Robinson. Profitable, I trust.",
