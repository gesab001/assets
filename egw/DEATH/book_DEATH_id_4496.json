    "word": "The Beginnings of Death\n \n\n     While Abel justifies the plan of God, Cain becomes enraged, and his anger increases and burns against Abel until in his rage he slays him. God inquires of Cain for his brother, and Cain utters a guilty falsehood: \"I know not: am I my brother's keeper?\" God informs Cain that He knew in regard to his sin--that He was acquainted with his every act, and even the thoughts of his heart, and says to him, \"Thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\"",
