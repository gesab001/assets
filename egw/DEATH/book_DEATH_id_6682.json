    "word": "Afterward, as two of His big disciples journeyed toward Emmaus, they were telling of their troubles, instead of searching the Scriptures to see if these things were so. They were talking with one another, and were sad. Jesus drew near. Their faith was so small they had not expected Him, and did not recognize Him. He said \"What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad\" (Luke 24:17)? They turned to Him and said \"Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? And He said unto them, What things? And they said unto Him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and have crucified Him\" (Luke 24:18-20).",
