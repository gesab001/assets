    "word": "Here is a business that man cannot give to others, but in which each individual has his own work to do. We need to give our hearts to God. To do this we shall meet with crosses. Nothing should stand in the way of duty. Even if losses in business should have to be made it should not keep us from discharging our duty. Our purpose should be to obey God so that Christ's death will not be in vain in our behalf. We must have the same integrity and principle that was found in Joseph and Daniel. Joseph was so established in principle that he could resist the great temptation that was brought upon him, because he had determined to obey God.",
