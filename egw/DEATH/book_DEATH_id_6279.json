    "word": "The Lord has led out representative men to proclaim the first, second, and third angels' messages. We know that God was with His faithful standard bearers. Many of them held fast their faith until their hands were palsied by death. I labored with the workers, bearing the burden in the heat of the day. Our work was a part of the great web of God's plans, and nothing can be more offensive to God than to give discredit to those who have fought a good fight, who have finished their course, who have kept the faith unto the end. He says, \"Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them\" (Revelation 14:13). They being dead yet speak. Their words, their influence, their example, have lived after their death.",
