{"word": "At the evening meeting I was taken off in vision, and the power of God fell upon the company. I related what the Lord had given me for the people. It was this: \"Return unto Me, and I will return unto thee, and heal all thy backslidings. Tear down the rubbish from the door of thy heart, and open the door, and I will come in and sup with thee.\" I saw that if they would clear the way, and confess their wrongs, Jesus would walk through the midst of us in power.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 160}
