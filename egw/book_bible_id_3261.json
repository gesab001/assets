{"word": "Chap. 48 - The Bible Prophets Wrote for Our Time\n-\n\n     Never are we absent from the mind of God. God is our joy and our salvation. Each of the ancient prophets spoke less for their own time than for ours, so that their prophesying is in force for us. \"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come\" (1 Corinthians 10:11). \"Not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into\" (1 Peter 1:12).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 338}
