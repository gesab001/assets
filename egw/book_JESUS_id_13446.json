{"word": "Jesus, in giving the disciples their first commission, had said, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou [referring to responsible men who should represent his church] shalt bind upon earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven.\" In renewing the commission of those to whom he had imparted the Holy Ghost, he said, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.\" These words conveyed to the disciples a sense of the sacredness of their work, and its tremendous results. Imbued with the Spirit of God, they were to go forth preaching the merits of a sin-pardoning Saviour; and they had the assurance that all Heaven was interested in their labors, and that what they did on earth, in the spirit and power of Christ, should be ratified in Heaven.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 244}
