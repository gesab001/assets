{"word": "18. It was a wonderful thing for God to create man, to make mind. He created him that every faculty might be the faculty of the divine mind. The glory of God is to be revealed in the creating of man in God's image, and in his redemption. One soul is of more value than a world. The Lord Jesus is the author of our being, and he is also the author of our redemption; and every one who will enter the kingdom of God must develop a character that is the counterpart of the character of God. None can dwell with God in a holy heaven but those who bear his likeness. Those who are redeemed will be overcomers; they will be elevated, pure, one with Christ. --S. T., May 31, 1896.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HL", "page": 12}
