    "word": "The king saw his prosperity, and because of it he was lifted up. Notwithstanding the warnings that God had given him, he did the very things which the Lord had told him not to do. \n                                                                           127\nHe looked upon his kingdom with pride and exclaimed: \"Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?\" Daniel 4:30. The instant that the words were uttered, the sentence of judgment was pronounced. The king's reason was taken away. The judgment that he had thought so perfect, the wisdom that he had prided himself on possessing, were removed. The jewel of the mind, that which elevates man above the beasts, he no longer retained.",
