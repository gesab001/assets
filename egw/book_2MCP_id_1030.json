{"word": "Doubt Induces Nervous Diseases.--The assurance of God's approval will promote physical health. It fortifies the soul against doubt, perplexity, and excessive grief that so often sap the vital forces and induce nervous diseases of a most debilitating and distressing character. The Lord has pledged His unfailing word that His eye shall be over the righteous and His ear open to their prayer, while He is against all them that do evil. We make very hard work for ourselves in this world when we take such a course that the Lord is against us.--RH, Oct 16, 1883. (3BC 1146.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 674}
