{"word": "In this world we are to shine in good works. The Lord requires His people who handle sacred things to be alone with God, to reflect the principles of heaven in every business transaction, to reflect the light of God's character, God's love, as Christ reflected it.

Every part of us is to be light; then whichever way we turn, light will be reflected from us to others. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 273}
