{"word": "When the Pharisees, disturbed and angered by this outburst of rejoicing, wished Jesus to rebuke His disciples, He replied, \"If these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.\" Luke 19:40. Prophecy must be fulfilled. The disciples were accomplishing the purpose of God; yet they were doomed to a bitter disappointment. But a few days had passed ere they witnessed the Saviour's agonizing death and laid Him in the tomb. Their expectations had not been realized in a single particular, and their hopes died with Jesus. Not till their Lord had come forth triumphant from the grave could they perceive that all had been foretold by prophecy, and \"that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead.\" Acts 17:3. In like manner was prophecy fulfilled in the first and second angels' messages. They were given at the right time and accomplished the work which God designed to accomplish by them.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SR", "page": 373}
