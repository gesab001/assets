{"word": "The work of higher criticism, in dissecting, conjecturing, reconstructing, is destroying faith in the Bible as a divine revelation. It is robbing God's Word of power to control, uplift, and inspire human lives. By spiritualism, multitudes are taught to believe that desire is the highest law, that license is liberty, and that man is accountable only to himself. . . . The power of a higher, purer, nobler life is our great need.--The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 473-478.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 344}
