{"word": "In this world we are to shine in good works. The Lord requires His people . . . to reflect the light of God's character, God's love, as Christ reflected it. As we look unto Jesus, all our lives will be aglow with that wondrous light. Every part of us is to be light; then whichever way we turn, light will be reflected from us to others. Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. In Him is no darkness at all; therefore, if we are in Christ, there will be no darkness in us.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 281}
