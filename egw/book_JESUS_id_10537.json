{"word": "God is the fountain of life, and we can have life only as we are in communion with Him. Separated from God, existence may be ours for a little time, but we do not possess life. . . . Only through the surrender of our will to God is it possible for Him to impart life to us. Only by receiving His life through self-surrender is it possible, said Jesus, for these hidden sins . . . to be overcome. It is possible that you may bury them in your hearts and conceal them from human eyes, but how will you stand in God's presence?. . . To sin, wherever found, God is a consuming fire. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 377}
