{"word": "The first great commandment is, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\" (Matthew 22:37). Here is allowed no separation of the affections from God. In 1 John 2:15-17 we read, \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, \n                                                                           331\nthe love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.\" Now if the pictures made have a tendency to separate the affections from God, and are worshiped in the place of God, they are idols. Have those who claim to be followers of Jesus Christ exalted these things above God, and given their affections to them? Has their love for treasures filled a place in their hearts that Jesus should occupy?", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 330}
