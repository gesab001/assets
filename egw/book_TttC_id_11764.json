The medical missionary work now called for is that outlined in the commission which Christ gave to His disciples just before His ascension. \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,\" He said. \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Matthew 28:18-20.",
