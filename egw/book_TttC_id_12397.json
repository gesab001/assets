    "word": "Christ was tempted in all points as man is tempted, but at no time did He bring against the tempter a railing accusation. To every temptation He presented the word of the Lord. \"It is written\" was His never-failing weapon. We, as the representatives of Christ, are to meet every thrust of the enemy with the word of the living \n                                                                           69\nGod. Never should we allow ourselves to follow the trail of the serpent by using his scientific arguments. Satan can never gain advantage of the child of God who relies on the word of God as his defense.",
