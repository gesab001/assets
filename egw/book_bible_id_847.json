{"word": "The wise men were surprised at the questions that the child Jesus asked. They wanted to encourage Him in studying the Bible, and they\n52\nwanted to see how much He knew about the prophecies. This is why they asked Him so many questions. Joseph and Mary were as much surprised at the wise answers of their son as were the wise men themselves. When there was a pause,  Mary, the mother of Jesus, came up to her son, and asked, \"Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us?  Behold,  thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.\"  Then a divine light shone from Jesus' face, as He lifted His hand and said, \"How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?  And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.\"  They did not know what He really meant by these words, but they knew He was a true son, who would be submissive to their commands. Though He was the Son of God, He went down to Nazareth and was subject to His parents. Though His mother did not understand the meaning of His words, she did not forget them, but \"kept all these saying in her heart.\"--YI, Nov. 28, 1895.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 51}
