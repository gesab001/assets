{"word": "Chap. 82 - Working With Science\n\n\n     Information, Power, Goodness, and Character.-- True education does not ignore the value of scientific knowledge or literary acquirements; but above information it values power; above power, goodness; above intellectual acquirements, character. The world does not so much need men of great intellect as of noble character. It needs men in whom ability is controlled by steadfast principle.--Ed 225 (1903).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 739}
