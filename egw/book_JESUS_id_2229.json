{"word": "God's Ideal for Man \n\n     The religion of Christ never degrades the receiver. It never makes him coarse or rough, discourteous or self-important, passionate or hardhearted. On the contrary, it refines the taste, sanctifies the judgment, and purifies and ennobles the thoughts, bringing them into captivity to Jesus Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 365}
