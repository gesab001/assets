    "word": "A Word in Season \n\n     Those who keep in a prayerful frame of mind will be able to speak a word in season to those who are brought within the sphere of their influence; for God will give wisdom whereby they may serve the Lord Jesus. \"When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee.\" Proverbs 2:10, 11. You will open your mouth with wisdom, and in your tongue will be the law of kindness. \n                                                                           70",
