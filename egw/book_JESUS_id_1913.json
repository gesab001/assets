{"word": "Looking Unto Jesus [SPECIAL TESTIMONIES, SERIES B, NO. 19, PP. 29-31 (1902).] \n\n\n     Last night I had a wonderful experience. I was in an assembly where questions were being asked and answered. I awoke at one o'clock and arose. For a time I walked the room, praying most earnestly for clearness of mind, for strength of eyesight, and for strength to write the things that must be written. I entreated the Lord to help me to bear a testimony that would awake His people before it is forever too late. . . .", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 299}
