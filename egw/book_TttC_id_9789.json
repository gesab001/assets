    "word": "In the providence of God we are associated with those who are inexperienced, with many who need pity and compassion. They need succor, for they are weak. Young men need help. In the strength of Him whose loving-kindness is exercised toward the helpless, the ignorant, and those counted as the least of His little ones, we must labor for their future welfare, for the shaping of Christian character. The very ones who need help the most will at times try our patience sorely. \"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones,\" Christ says, \"for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 18:10. And to those who minister to these souls, the Saviour declares: \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\" Matthew 25:40.",
