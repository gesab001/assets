{"word": "RESTORED IN THE LAST DAYS\n \n     BUT THE SCRIPTURES, WHILE FORETELLING THIS DREADFUL APOSTASY, ALSO PLAINLY TEACH THAT JUST BEFORE THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST, MANY WILL BE RESCUED FROM THE DARKNESS OF ERROR AND SUPERSTITION. ONCE MORE THE EARTH IS TO BE LIGHTENED BY THE GLORY OF GOD. THE PURE TRUTHS OF THE BIBLE ARE TO SHINE FORTH. AND IN THIS TIME OF HEAVENLY ILLUMINATION MARKING THE APPROACHING END OF THE AGE, THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT ARE AGAIN TO BE MANIFEST IN THE TRUE CHURCH. \"IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE LAST DAYS, SAITH GOD, I WILL POUR OUT OF MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH: AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY, AND YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS, AND YOUR OLD MEN SHALL DREAM DREAMS: AND ON MY SERVANTS AND ON MY HANDMAIDENS I WILL POUR OUT IN THOSE DAYS OF MY SPIRIT; AND THEY SHALL PROPHESY.\" ACTS 2:17, 18; JOEL 2:28, 29.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CET", "page": 242}
