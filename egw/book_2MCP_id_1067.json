{"word": "Deliverance From Sin and Healing Disease Linked.-- In the ministry of healing, the physician is to be a co-worker with Christ. The Saviour ministered to both the soul and the body. The gospel which He taught was a message of \n\n684 \n\nspiritual life and of physical restoration. Deliverance from sin and the healing of disease were linked together. The same ministry is committed to the Christian physician. He is to unite with Christ in relieving both the physical and spiritual needs of his fellowmen. He is to be to the sick a messenger of mercy, bringing to them a remedy for the diseased body and for the sin-sick soul.--MH 111 (1905).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 683}
