Lately the number of patients at the sanitarium has decreased, owing to an array of circumstances that could not be helped. One reason for the lack of patronage is, I think, the stand that those at the head of the institution have taken against serving flesh meat to the patients.

We knew that it was not pleasing to God for flesh meat to be placed before the patients.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 414}
