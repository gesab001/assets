    "word": "Some brethren have erred in this respect. They have thought that Brother C was the right man to labor in Vermont and that he could accomplish more than any other minister in that state. Such do not view matters from a right standpoint. Brother C can speak in a manner to interest a congregation, and if this were all that is necessary to make a successful preacher, then a class of brethren and sisters would be right in their estimation of him. But he is not a thorough workman; he is not reliable. In church trials he is of no account. He has not experience, judgment, and discernment to be of any benefit to the church when in trial. He has not been a thoroughgoing man in temporal matters, and although he has but a small family, he has needed assistance more or less. The same lack is manifested in spiritual things as in temporal affairs. Had the right course been pursued toward him in the commencement of his preaching, he might now be of some use in this cause. His brethren injured him by making too much of him and by leaving him to bear but few of the burdens of life, until he has thought that his labors were of the greatest consequence. He has been willing that brethren in Vermont should bear his burdens while he was relieved from care. He has not had a suitable amount of exercise to give tone and strength to his muscles, and for the good of his health.",
