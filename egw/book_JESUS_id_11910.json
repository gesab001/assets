{"word": "Paul then endeavored to inform his Thessalonian brethren concerning the true state of the dead. He speaks of them as asleep,--in a state of unconsciousness: \"I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. . . . . For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LP", "page": 111}
