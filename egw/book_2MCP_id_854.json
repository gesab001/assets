{"word": "A Blessing to the Sick.--The pleasant disposition, the beautiful character, the Lord will use to bring blessing to the sick. The truths of the Word of God possess a sanctifying, transforming power. If received into the heart and carried into the life, they will prove a savor of life unto life. Let those employed in our institutions be such as will let the light of truth shine forth in their daily words and actions. It is only such that Christ can accept as workers together with Him.--MS 69, 1909. (MM 173.)", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 619}
