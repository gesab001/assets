{"word": "At this camp meeting the very work that should be done has been done. The children's meetings, or Bible kindergarten, has done a good work. The lessons given are repeated by the children in their homes, and the mothers show their interest by preparing the children neatly for the school. Most are children of parents not of our faith. The seeds of Bible truth have dropped into the soil of the heart. It is no easy exercise, but it is doing good. Impressions are being made upon the hearts of parents and children. The good these meetings have done the great day of God will reveal. This is a large field to cultivate. Let this work be carried on. Where can the talents be better used? These workers are sowing for a harvest. . . . Men, women, and children are anxious to know what they shall do to inherit eternal life.--Letter 2, 1899. \n                                                                           584", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 583}
