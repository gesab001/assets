{"word": "Paul suffered for the truth's sake, and yet we hear no complaints from his lips. As he reviews his life of toil and care and sacrifice, he says, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\" The shout of victory from God's faithful servant comes down the line to our time: \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . . . Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 326}
