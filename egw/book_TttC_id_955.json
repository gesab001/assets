    "word": "Luther's prayer was heard. His courage and faith returned as he met his enemies. Meek as a lamb he stood, surrounded by the great men of the earth, who, like angry wolves, fastened their eyes upon him, hoping to awe him with their power and greatness. But he had taken hold of the strength of God and feared not. His words were spoken with such majesty and power that his enemies could do nothing against him. God was speaking through Luther, and He had brought together emperors and professed wise men that He might publicly bring to nought their wisdom, and that they all might see the strength and firmness of feeble man when leaning upon God, his eternal Rock. \n                                                                           375",
