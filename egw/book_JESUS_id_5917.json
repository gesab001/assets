{"word": "With unutterable love, Jesus welcomes his faithful ones to the \\93joy of their Lord.\\94 The Saviour's joy is in seeing, in the kingdom of glory, the souls that have been saved by his agony and humiliation. And the redeemed will be sharers in this joy, as they behold, among the blessed, those who have been won to Christ through their prayers, their labors, and loving sacrifice. As they gather about the great white throne, gladness unspeakable will fill their hearts, when they behold those whom they have won for Christ, and see that one has gained others, and these still others, all brought into the haven of rest, there to lay their crowns at Jesus\\92 feet, and praise him through the endless cycles of eternity.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC88", "page": 647}
