    "word": "Chap. 105 - RESPONSE FROM BATTLE CREEK CHURCH \n\n\n     WE ESTEEM IT A PRIVILEGE AS WELL AS A DUTY TO RESPOND TO THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS OF SISTER WHITE. WE HAVE BEEN FAVORED WITH AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY YEARS WITH THE LABORS OF THESE SERVANTS OF THE LORD [BROTHER AND SISTER WHITE]. WE HAVE \n                                                                           610\nKNOWN SOMETHING OF THEIR SACRIFICES IN THE PAST, AND HAVE BEEN WITNESSES OF THE BLESSING OF GOD THAT HAS ATTENDED THEIR PLAIN, SEARCHING, FAITHFUL TESTIMONY. WE HAVE LONG BEEN CONVINCED THAT THE TEACHINGS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THESE VISIONS WERE INDISPENSABLE TO THE WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARING FOR TRANSLATION INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. IN NO OTHER WAY CAN SECRET SINS BE REBUKED AND BASE MEN WHO CREEP \"IN UNAWARES\" INTO THE FLOCK OF GOD BE EXPOSED AND BAFFLED IN THEIR EVIL DESIGNS. LONG EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US THAT SUCH A GIFT IS OF INESTIMABLE VALUE TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD. WE BELIEVE ALSO THAT GOD HAS CALLED BROTHER WHITE TO BEAR A PLAIN TESTIMONY IN REPROVING WRONGS THUS MADE MANIFEST, AND THAT IN THIS WORK HE SHOULD HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THOSE WHO TRULY FEAR GOD.",
