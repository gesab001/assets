{"word": "Warning National Leaders.--The rulers of the nations need to plant their feet upon the platform of eternal truth. They should not be allowed, because of ignorance, to build their houses on the sand. These men are not to be worshiped as gods. They are accountable to God for their course of action. To Him they must answer if they become a savor of death unto death to those who are under their jurisdiction.--Letter 187, 1903.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 561}
