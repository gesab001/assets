{"word": "Jesus said: \"This is life eternal, that they might know \n                                                                           187\nthee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\" (John 17:3). All that was done and said had this one object in view--to rivet truth in their minds that they might attain unto everlasting life. Jesus did not come to astonish men with some great announcement of some special time when some great event would occur, but He came to instruct and save the lost. He did not come to arouse and gratify curiosity; for He knew that this would but increase the appetite for the curious and the marvelous. It was His aim to impart knowledge whereby men might increase in spiritual strength, and advance in the way of obedience and true holiness. He gave only such instruction as could be appropriated to the needs of their daily life, only such truth as could be given to others for the same appropriation.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 186}
