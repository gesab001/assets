    "word": "God's servants are to preach His word to the people. Under the Holy Spirit's working they will come into order as stars in the hand of Christ, to shine forth with His brightness. Let those who claim to be Christ's ministers arise and shine; for their light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon them. Let them understand that Christ expects them to do the same work as He has done. Let them leave the churches that know the truth, and go forth to establish new churches, to present the word of truth to those who are in ignorance of God's warning message. \n\n                                               -",
