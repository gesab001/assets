{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     The work of God calls for young men who are not self-sufficient and boastful,\\97young men who study their Bibles and are honest and God-fearing. Volunteers are needed who will respect gray hairs, and honor those whom God honors, and who will not feel insulted when counseled by men of experience. Such men will be earnest workers; for they are \n382\nactuated by love to God, and interest in their fellow-men. They approach the Lord's standard of manhood, and with the divine blessing on their capabilities they may reach a high degree of mental and moral excellence. To be a man that God can approve and use in his cause, is honor enough for any human being. Office, wealth, position, sink into insignificance in comparison.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 381}
