{"word": "Ministers should not be burdened down with doing the work of the Sabbath school.--God's cause has not advanced as it should have done, for the very reason that ministers and leading men have felt that they must do everything themselves. They have tugged and toiled to keep the wheel rolling, and are weighed down with responsibilities and burdens in the various departments of church-work, in the Sabbath-school, and in every other branch of the cause. They think they must do all this or it will not be done; and truly it would not be done, because they have failed to take others into their counsel and to train them to work.--RH July 24, 1883.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 273}
