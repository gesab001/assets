{"word": "The words of Christ placed the teachings of nature in a new aspect, and made them a new revelation. He could speak of the things which his own hands had made; for they had qualities and properties that were peculiarly his own. In nature, as in the sacred pages of the Old Testament Scriptures, divine, momentous truths are revealed; and in his teaching, Jesus laid these open before the people, bound up with the beauty of natural things. But no mention was made of the contrast between the earth's present state, before their eyes, and the Eden glories which sinless eyes looked upon.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 64}
