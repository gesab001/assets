{"word": "If anyone shall seek to draw the workers into debate or controversy on political or other questions, take no heed to either persuasion or challenge. Carry forward the work of God firmly and strongly, but in the meekness of Christ and as quietly as possible. Let no human boasting be heard. Let no sign of self-sufficiency be made. Let it be seen that God has called us to handle sacred trusts; preach the Word, be diligent, earnest, and fervent.--6T 122.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "VSS", "page": 243}
