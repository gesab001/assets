{"word": "Why is this not so? Where is the trouble? It is with the parents who let their children come up without bearing any burdens in the family. When these children go out to school, they say, \"Ma says she doesn't want me to work.\" Such mothers are foolish. They spoil their children and then send them to the school to spoil it. . . .

Blend the physical labor with the mental, and the powers of the mind will develop far better.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 126}
