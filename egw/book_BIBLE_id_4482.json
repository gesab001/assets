{"word": "Infidel geologists claim that the world is very much older than the Bible record makes it. They reject the testimony of God\\92s Word because of those things which are to them evidences from the earth itself that it has existed tens of thousands of years. And many who profess to believe the Bible are at a loss to account for wonderful things which are found in the earth, with the view that Creation week was only seven literal days, and that the world is now only about six thousand years old. These, to free themselves from difficulties thrown in their way by infidel geologists, adopt the view that the six days of Creation were six vast, indefinite periods, and the day of God\\92s rest was another indefinite period; making senseless the fourth commandment of God\\92s holy law. Some eagerly receive this position; for it destroys the force of the fourth commandment, and they feel a freedom from its claims upon them.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "BLJ", "page": 154}
