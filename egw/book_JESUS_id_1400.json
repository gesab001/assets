{"word": "Study the fashions less, and the character of Jesus more. The greatest and holiest of men was also the meekest. In his character, majesty and humility were blended. He could summon the hosts of heaven at will; the command of worlds was in his power; yet for our sake he became poor, that we, through his poverty, might be made rich.

Christ noticed the devotion to dress, and he cautioned, yea, he commanded, his followers not to bestow too much thought upon it. \\93Why take ye thought for raiment?
