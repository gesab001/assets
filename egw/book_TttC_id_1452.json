    "word": "\"WHEN WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS TASK, WE LOOKED UP, AND THE WHOLE TRAIN WAS TRANSFORMED. INSTEAD OF THE LOW, ILL-VENTILATED CARS ON WHICH WE HAD BEEN RIDING, THERE WERE BROAD, HIGH, WELL-VENTILATED CARS, WITH LARGE, CLEAR WINDOWS, THE WHOLE TRIMMED AND GILDED IN A MOST SPLENDID MANNER, MORE ELEGANT \n                                                                           602\nTHAN ANY PALACE OR HOTEL CAR I EVER SAW. THE TRACK WAS LEVEL, SMOOTH, AND FIRM. THE TRAIN WAS FILLING UP WITH PASSENGERS WHOSE COUNTENANCES WERE CHEERFUL AND HAPPY, YET WORE AN EXPRESSION OF ASSURANCE AND SOLEMNITY. ALL SEEMED TO EXPRESS THE GREATEST SATISFACTION AT THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN WROUGHT, AND THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE IN THE SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OF THE TRAIN. BROTHER AND SISTER WHITE WERE ON BOARD THIS TIME, THEIR COUNTENANCES LIT UP WITH HOLY JOY. AS THE TRAIN WAS STARTING, I WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT I AWOKE, WITH THE IMPRESSION ON MY MIND THAT THAT DREAM REFERRED TO THE CHURCH AT BATTLE CREEK AND MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE CAUSE THERE. MY MIND WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR IN REGARD TO MY DUTY TO GO TO BATTLE CREEK AND LEND A HELPING HAND IN THE WORK THERE. GLAD AM I NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE TO SEE THE BLESSING OF THE LORD ACCOMPANYING THE ARDUOUS LABORS OF BROTHER AND SISTER WHITE IN SETTING THINGS IN ORDER. \n\n\n                                       \"J.
