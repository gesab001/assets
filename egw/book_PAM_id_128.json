{"word": "Ethics and the Opposite Sex\n \n\n     Acquire moral stamina by saying, \"I will not dishonor my Redeemer.\"--You ask me if you shall make a public confession. I say, No. Do not dishonor the Master by making public the fact that one ministering in the Word could be guilty of such sin as you have committed. It would be a disgrace to the ministry. Do not give publicity to this matter by any means. It would do injustice to the whole cause of God. It would create impure thoughts in the minds of many even to hear these things repeated. Defile not the lips even by communicating this to your wife, to make her ashamed and bow her head in sorrow. Go to God and to the brethren who know this terrible chapter in your experience and say what you have to say, then let prayer be offered to God in your behalf. Cultivate sobriety. Walk carefully and prayerfully before God. Acquire moral stamina by saying, \"I will not dishonor my Redeemer.\"--TSB 128.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 59}
