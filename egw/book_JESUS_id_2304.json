{"word": "Distinguished From the World.--Let the editors of all our papers seek to attract the attention of their readers to the Book of books, and to those books and periodicals which present the word of God in its true bearings. As the Holy Spirit controls the writers for our papers, more of God's word and less of man's ideas will be presented. As our editors sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn from Him who is infinite in wisdom, they will understand by living spiritual experience what it is to eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God. All who teach the word must have this experience.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CW", "page": 122}
