{"word": "Many of the youth say, I have no time to study my lesson. But what are they doing? Some are crowding in every moment to earn a few cents more, when this time pressed into work, if given to the study of the Bible, would, if they practiced its lessons, save them more than the amount gained by overwork. It would save much that is expended in needless ornaments. and preserve vigor of mind to understand the mystery of godliness. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" But these very youth who profess to be Christians gratify the desires of the carnal heart in following their own inclinations; and God-given probationary time, granted them to become acquainted with the precious truths of the Bible, is devoted to the reading of fictitious tales.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 21}
