{"word": "The Life-giver is soon to come . . . to break the fetters of the tomb. He is to bring forth the captives. . . . The last thoughts they had were of the grave and the tomb, but now they proclaim, \"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\" The pangs of death were the last things they felt. . . . When they awake the pain is all gone. \"O grave, where is thy victory?\" Here they stand, and the finishing touch of immortality is put upon them, and they go up to meet their Lord in the air. The gates of the city of God swing back upon their hinges, . . . and the ransomed of God walk in through the cherubims and seraphims. Christ bids them welcome and puts upon them His benediction. \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" What is that joy? He sees of the travail of his soul, and is satisfied. . . . Here is one who in the night season we pleaded with God on his behalf. There is one that we talked with on his dying bed, and he hung his helpless soul upon Jesus. Here is one who was a poor drunkard. We tried to get his eyes fixed upon Him who is mighty to save, and we told him that Christ could give him the victory. There are the crowns of immortal glory upon their heads.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 349}
