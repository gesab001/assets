{"word": "Teachers Cooperate in Recreation.--I see some things here in Switzerland [NOTE: WRITTEN WHILE THE AUTHOR WAS VISITING EUROPE, 1885-1887.] that I think are worthy of imitation. The teachers of the schools often go out with their pupils while they are at play and teach them how to amuse themselves and are at hand to repress any disorder or wrong. Sometimes they take their scholars out and have a long walk with them. I like this; I think there is less opportunity for the children to yield to temptation. The teachers seem to enter into the sports of the children and to regulate them.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 197}
