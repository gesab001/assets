{"word": "This prayer [of John 17] is a lesson regarding the intercession that the Saviour would carry on within the veil, when His great sacrifice in behalf of men, the offering of Himself, should have been completed. Our Mediator gave His disciples this illustration of His ministration in the heavenly sanctuary in behalf of all who will come to Him in meekness and humility, emptied of all selfishness, and believing in His power to save.--Manuscript 29, 1906 (SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1145).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "7ABC", "page": 478}
