{"word": "From these scriptures it is evident that it is not God\\92s will that you should be distrustful, and torture your soul with the fear that God will not accept you because you are sinful and unworthy. . . . Present your case before Him, pleading the merits of the blood shed for you upon Calvary\\92s cross. Satan will accuse you of being a great sinner, and you must admit this, but you can say: \\93I know I am a sinner, and that is the reason I need a Saviour. Jesus came into the world to save sinners. \\91The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.\\92...I have no merit or goodness whereby I may claim salvation, but I present before God the all-atoning blood of the spotless Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is my only plea. The name of Jesus gives me access to the Father. His ear, His heart, is open to my faintest pleading, and He supplies my deepest necessities.\\94", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 289}
