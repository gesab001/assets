    "word": "The sign, or seal, of God is revealed in the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, the Lord's memorial of creation. \"The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.\" Exodus 31:12, 13. Here the Sabbath is clearly designated as a sign between God and His people.",
