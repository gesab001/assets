    "word": "The Lord desires His people in the North to maintain a kindly attitude toward the colored brethren and sisters. We should not be hasty in finding fault with them. We cannot expect them to be in all respects like those who have enjoyed greater advantages. We should remember the disadvantages under which the colored people have lived. Far different from the surroundings of the white race have been their surroundings. The Northern people have lived in a clearer, purer moral atmosphere than have the colored people of the South.  We cannot expect that, in all things, they will be as firm and clear in their ideas of morality. Were Christ on earth today, He would teach the Negro race in a way that would surprise us. He calls upon us to remember that even those who have had great advantages in many things often feel hurt \n                                                                           224\nif their errors are unduly noticed and if words of counsel and admonition are spoken in an unsympathetic manner.",
