{"word": "The intercession of Christ in our behalf is that of presenting His divine merits in the offering of Himself to the Father as our substitute and surety; for He ascended up on high to make an atonement for our transgressions. \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world\" (1 John 2:1, 2). \"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins\" (1 John 4:10). \"He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them\" (Hebrews 7:25).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FW", "page": 105}
