{"word": "Tragedy of a Prayerless Home.--I know of nothing that causes me so great sadness as a prayerless home. I do not feel safe in such a house for a single night; and were it not for the hope of helping the parents to realize their necessity and their sad neglect, I would not remain. The children show the result of this neglect, for the fear of God is not before them.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 518}
