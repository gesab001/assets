{"word": "A Fitting Prayer.--Make your work pleasant with songs of praise. If you would have a clean record in the books of heaven, never fret or scold. Let your daily prayer be, \"Lord, teach me to do my best. Teach me how to do better work. Give me energy and cheerfulness.\" . . . Bring Christ into all that you do. Then your lives will be filled with brightness and thanksgiving. . . . Let us do our best, moving forward cheerfully in the service of the Lord, with our hearts filled with His joy.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 148}
