{"word": "Parents New in the Message Need Instruction.-- Those who bear the last message of mercy to the world should feel it their duty to instruct parents in regard to home religion. Their great reformatory movement must begin in presenting to fathers and mothers and children the principles of the law of God. As the claims of the law are presented, and men and women are convicted of their duty to render obedience, show them the responsibility of their decision, not only for themselves but for their children. Show that obedience to God's Word is our only safeguard against the evils that are sweeping the world to destruction.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 556}
