{"word": "Take Time for Prayer.--When I have felt roiled and was tempted to speak words that I would be ashamed of, \n                                                                           255\nI would keep silent and pass right out of the room and ask God to give me patience to teach these children. Then I could go back and talk with them, and tell them they must not do this wrong again. We can take such a position in this matter that we shall not provoke the children to wrath. We should speak kindly and patiently, remembering all the time how wayward we are and how we want to be treated by our heavenly Father.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 254}
