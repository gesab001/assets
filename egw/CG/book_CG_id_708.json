{"word": "Before you cause your child physical pain, you will, if you are a Christian father or mother, reveal the love you have for your erring one. As you bow before God with your child, you will present before the sympathizing Redeemer His own words, \"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.\" Mark 10:14. That prayer will bring angels to your side. Your child will not forget these experiences, and the blessing of God will rest upon such instruction, leading him to Christ. When children realize that their parents are trying to help them, they will bend their energies in the right direction.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 253}
