{"word": "Teach Respect to Parental and Divine Authority.-- Children . . . should be trained, educated, and disciplined until they become obedient to their parents, giving respect to their authority. In this way respect for divine authority will be implanted in their hearts, and the family training will be like a preparatory training for the family in heaven. The training of childhood and youth should be of such a character that children will be prepared to take up their religious duties, and thus become fitted to enter into the courts above.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 224}
