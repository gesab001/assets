{"word": "A Point Clarified.--The question has often been asked me if I believe it wrong to wear plain linen collars. [NOTE: SEE TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH, VOL. 1, PP. 135, 136.] My answer has always been No. Some have taken the extreme meaning of what I have written about collars, and have maintained that it is wrong to wear one of any description. I was shown expensively wrought collars, and expensive and unnecessary ribbons and laces, which some Sabbathkeepers have worn, and still wear for the sake of show and fashion. In mentioning collars, I did not design to be understood that nothing like a collar should be worn, or in mentioning ribbons, that no ribbons at all should be worn.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 422}
