{"word": "Be As Faithful at Home As at Worship.--Parents, as teachers of your loved ones the truth should have a controlling power over your conscience and your understanding, presiding over word and deed. Be as faithful in your home life as you are in the worship of God. Give a right character to all within the home. Angels of God are present, noting how the younger members of the Lord's family are treated. The religion of the home will surely be brought into the church.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 552}
