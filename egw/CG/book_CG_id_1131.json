{"word": "Parents, Not Children, to Dictate Here.--Teach them to deny appetite, to be grateful for the plain, simple diet God gives them. It is not for you to allow them to dictate to you what they should eat, but you should dictate what is best for them. It is a sin for you to allow your children to murmur and complain about good wholesome food, just because it does not suit their depraved appetites.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 391}
