{"word": "To Maintain the Highest Standards.--The character of the work done in our church schools should be of the very highest order. Jesus Christ, the Restorer, is the only remedy for a wrong education; and the lessons taught in His Word should ever be kept before the youth in the most attractive form. The school discipline should supplement the home training, and both at home and at school simplicity and godliness should be maintained.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 310}
