{"word": "Heaven Is Worth Everything!--Heaven is worth everything to us. We must not run any risk in this matter. We must take no venture here. We must know that our steps are ordered by the Lord. May God help us in the great work of overcoming. He has crowns for those that overcome. He has white robes for the righteous. He has an eternal world of glory for those who seek for glory, honor, and immortality. Everyone who enters the City of God will enter it as a conqueror. He will not enter it as a condemned criminal, but as a son of God. And the welcome given to everyone who enters there will be, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Matthew 25:34.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 567}
