{"word": "Take a Firm, Decided Stand.--Parents generally put too much confidence in their children; for often when the parents are confiding in them, they are in concealed iniquity. Parents, watch your children with a jealous care. Exhort, reprove, counsel them when you rise up, and when you sit down; when you go out, and when you come in; \"line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little.\" Subdue your children when they are young. With many parents this is sadly neglected. They do not take as firm and decided a stand as they should in regard to their children.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 185}
