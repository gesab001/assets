{"word": "Repress First Appearance of Evil.--Parents, you should commence your first lesson of discipline when your children are babes in your arms. Teach them to yield their will to yours. This can be done by bearing an even hand and manifesting firmness. Parents should have perfect control over their own spirits and, with mildness and yet firmness, bend the will of the child until it shall expect nothing else but to yield to their wishes. \n                                                                           231", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 230}
