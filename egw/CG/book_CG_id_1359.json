{"word": "Thoughts Must Be Controlled. [NOTE: THESE ARE FURTHER EXTRACTS FROM A LETTER TO THE SELF-WILLED YOUTH WHO WAS PRACTICING SECRET VICE.]--You should control your thoughts. This will not be an easy task; you cannot accomplish it without close and even severe effort. . . . If you indulge in vain imaginations, permitting your mind to dwell upon impure subjects, you are, in a degree, as guilty before God as if your thoughts were carried into action. All that prevents the action is the lack of opportunity. Day and night dreaming and castle-building are bad and exceedingly dangerous habits. When once established, it is next to impossible to break up such habits and direct the thoughts to pure, holy, elevated themes. You will have to become a faithful sentinel over your eyes, ears, and all your senses if you would control your mind and prevent vain and corrupt thoughts from staining your soul. The power of grace alone can accomplish this most desirable work. \n                                                                           465", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 464}
