{"word": "Do Not Weaken, but Direct the Child's Will.--Save all the strength of the will, for the human being needs it all; but give it proper direction. Treat it wisely and tenderly, as a sacred treasure. Do not hammer it in pieces, but by precept and true example wisely fashion and mold it until the child comes to years of responsibility.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 210}
