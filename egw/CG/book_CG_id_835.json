{"word": "It Is a Training That Directs and Develops.--There is a time for training children and a time for educating youth, and it is essential that in school both of these be combined in a great degree. Children may be trained for the service of sin or for the service of righteousness. The early education of youth shapes their characters both in their secular and in their religious life.

The training which Solomon enjoins is to direct, educate, and develop.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 297}
