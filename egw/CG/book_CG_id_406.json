{"word": "Maintain Strict Principles.--In all the details of life the strictest principles of honesty are to be maintained. . . . Deviation from perfect fairness in business deal may appear as a small thing in the estimation of some, but our Saviour did not thus regard it. His words on this point are plain and explicit: \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\" A man who will overreach his neighbor on a small scale will overreach in a larger scale if the temptation is brought to bear upon him. A false representation in a small matter is as much dishonesty in the sight of God as falsity in a larger matter.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 154}
