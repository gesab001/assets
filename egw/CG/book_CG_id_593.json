{"word": "One victory gained over yourself will be of great value and encouragement to your children. You may stand on vantage ground, saying, I am God's husbandry; I am God's building. I place myself under His hand to be fashioned after the divine similitude, that I may be a co-worker with God in fashioning the minds and characters of my children so that it will be easier for them to walk in the way of the Lord. . . . Fathers and mothers, when you can control yourselves, you will gain great victories in controlling your children.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 217}
