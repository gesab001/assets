{"word": "How to Teach Reverence.--Parents can and should interest their children in the varied knowledge found in the sacred pages. But if they would interest their sons and daughters in the Word of God, they must be interested in it themselves. They must be familiar with its teachings and, as God commanded Israel, speak of it \"when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\" \n                                                                           100\nDeuteronomy 11:19. Those who desire their children to love and reverence God must talk of His goodness, His majesty, and His power, as revealed in His Word and in the works of creation.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 99}
