{"word": "All Children to Have Educational Privileges.-- The church is asleep and does not realize the magnitude of this matter of educating the children and youth. \"Why,\" says one, \"what is the need of being so particular to educate our youth thoroughly? It seems to me that if you take a few who have decided to follow a literary calling or some other calling that requires a certain discipline, and give due attention to them, that is all that is necessary. It is not required that the whole mass of our youth be so well trained. Will not this answer every essential requirement?\" I answer, No, most decidedly not. . . . All our youth should be permitted to have the blessings and privileges of an education at our schools, that they may be inspired to become laborers together with God. They all need an education, that they may be fitted for usefulness, qualified for places of responsibility in both private and public life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 332}
