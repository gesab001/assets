{"word": "I was referred to the many precious promises on record for those who seek their Saviour early. Ecclesiastes 12:1: \"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.\" Proverbs 8:17: \"I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me.\" The great Shepherd of Israel is still saying, \"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" Teach your children that youth is the best time to seek the Lord.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 491}
