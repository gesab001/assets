{"word": "Instruct Them Patiently and Cheerfully.--Mothers should take their daughters into the kitchen with them when very young, and teach them the art of cooking. The mother cannot expect her daughters to understand the mysteries of housekeeping without education. She should instruct them patiently, lovingly, and make the work as agreeable as she can by her cheerful countenance and encouraging words of approval.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 374}
