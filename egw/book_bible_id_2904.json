{"word": "Round three: Knowledge\nBenefits from associating with Christ\n     Every moment of our lives is intensely real, and charged with solemn responsibilities. Ignorance will be no excuse for lack of \n18\nspiritual understanding and attainment; for we are exhorted to add to virtue, knowledge. Many are very ignorant of Bible truth, and they do not realize the duty and necessity of becoming intelligent Christians. The disciples learned of Jesus, and men perceived the benefits of His association and service, as they saw the change in these men. The uncultured fishermen became men of refinement and ability; and the lessons that they were privileged to learn are written for our admonition and instruction. We are invited to become learners in the school of Christ. We need to acquire all the knowledge possible. We cannot afford to be ignorant of the things that pertain to our eternal welfare. If all would cease gossip and evil communication, devoting the time to contemplation of Christ and the plan of salvation, they would add the knowledge essential to a growth in grace. We are to add knowledge from \\93whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report.\\94 God wants us to understand why He has placed us in the world, and given us the sacred burden of life to bear. He would have us develop the faculties of mind and body, that we may be a blessing to those around us, and that His glory may be reflected from us to the world. It is not His will that our powers should be bound up in torpid stupidity and ignorance. \\93God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.\\94", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PCP", "page": 17}
