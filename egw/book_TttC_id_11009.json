    "word": "True workers walk and work by faith. Sometimes they grow weary with watching the slow advance of the work when the battle wages strong between the powers of good and evil.

Through the mist with which Satan has surrounded them, they will see the shining of the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness.",
