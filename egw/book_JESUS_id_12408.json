{"word": "The same principle appeared in his teaching; the unknown was illustrated by the known. Jesus taught by illustrations and parables drawn from nature and from the familiar events of every-day life. The inspired record says, \"All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.\" Matthew 13:34, 35. In this way he associated natural things with spiritual, linking the things of nature and the life-experience of his hearers with the sublime, spiritual truths of the written word. And his lessons were repeated whenever their eyes rested on the objects which had been associated with eternal truth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SpTEd", "page": 67}
