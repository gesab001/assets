    "word": "It is God that causes the sun to rise in the heavens. He opens the windows of heaven and gives rain. He causes the grass to grow upon the mountains. \"He giveth snow like wool: He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.\" \"When He uttereth His voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; . . . He maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures.\" Psalm 147:16; Jeremiah 10:13.",
