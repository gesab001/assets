Then Jesus looked upon His redeemed saints; their countenances were radiant with glory; and as He fixed His loving eyes upon them, He said, with His rich, musical voice, \"I behold the travail of My soul, and am satisfied.

There shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.\" . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 352}
