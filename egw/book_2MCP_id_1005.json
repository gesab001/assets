{"word": "Refinement of Heart Learned in Christ's School.-- Real refinement of thought and manner is better learned in the school of the Divine Teacher than by any observance of set rules. His love pervading the heart gives to the character those refining touches that fashion it in the semblance of His own. This education imparts a heaven-born dignity and sense of propriety. It gives a sweetness of disposition and a gentleness of manner that can never be equaled by the superficial polish of fashionable society.--Ed 241 (1903).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 667}
