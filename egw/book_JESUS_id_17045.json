{"word": "But we shall not boast of our holiness. As we have clearer views of Christ's spotless and infinite purity we shall feel as did Daniel when he beheld the glory of the Lord and said, \"My comeliness was turned in me into corruption\" (Daniel 10:8). We cannot say, \"I am sinless\" till this vile body is changed and fashioned like unto His glorious body. But if we constantly seek to follow Jesus, the blessed hope is ours of standing before the throne of God without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, complete in Christ, robed in His righteousness and perfection.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 361}
