{"word": "There will be no probation after the coming of the Lord. Those who say that there will be are deceived and misled. Before Christ comes just such a state of things will exist as existed before the Flood. And after the Saviour appears in the clouds of heaven no one will be given another chance to gain salvation. All will have made their decisions.--Letter 45, 1891.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 237}
