{"word": "Says Peter, \"Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.\" Here is a lesson for us to learn; here is a work for us to do to control the mind, not letting it drift on forbidden themes, or spend its energies on trifling subjects. \"The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.\" We are not only required to pray, but to guard the words and actions, and even the thoughts--to \"watch unto prayer.\" If the mind is centered upon heavenly things, the conversation will run in the same channel. The heart will overflow at the contemplation of the Christian's hope, the exceeding great and precious promises left on record for our encouragement; and our rejoicing in view of the mercy and goodness of God need not be repressed; it is a joy that no man can take from us.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 367}
