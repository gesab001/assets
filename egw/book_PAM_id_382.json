{"word": "Preparing Candidates\n \n\n     Ministers should give each candidate plain instruction regarding baptism's meaning.--Our churches are becoming enfeebled by receiving for doctrines the commandments of men. Many are received into the church who are not converted. Men, women, and children are allowed to take part in the solemn rite of baptism without being fully instructed in regard to the meaning of this ordinance. Participation in this ordinance means much, and our ministers should be careful to give each candidate for baptism plain instruction regarding its meaning and its solemnity.--RH Oct. 6, 1904.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 163}
