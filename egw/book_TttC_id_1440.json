    "word": "\"I WAS IN A LARGE HOUSE WHERE THERE WAS A PULPIT SOMEWHAT LIKE THOSE WE USE IN OUR MEETINGHOUSES. ON IT STOOD MANY LAMPS WHICH WERE BURNING. THESE LAMPS NEEDED A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF OIL, AND QUITE A NUMBER OF US WERE ENGAGED IN CARRYING OIL AND FILLING THEM. BROTHER WHITE AND HIS COMPANION WERE BUSILY ENGAGED, AND I NOTICED THAT SISTER WHITE POURED IN MORE OIL THAN ANY OTHER. THEN BROTHER WHITE WENT TO A DOOR WHICH OPENED INTO A WAREHOUSE, WHERE THERE WERE \n                                                                           598\nMANY BARRELS OF OIL. HE OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT IN, AND SISTER WHITE FOLLOWED. JUST THEN A COMPANY OF MEN CAME ALONG, WITH A GREAT QUANTITY OF BLACK STUFF THAT LOOKED LIKE SOOT, AND HEAPED IT ALL UPON BROTHER AND SISTER WHITE, COMPLETELY COVERING THEM WITH IT. I FELT MUCH GRIEVED, AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY TO SEE THE END OF THESE THINGS. I COULD SEE BROTHER AND SISTER W. BOTH WORKING HARD TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THE SOOT, AND AFTER A LONG STRUGGLE THEY CAME OUT AS BRIGHT AS EVER, AND THE EVIL MEN AND THE SOOT DISAPPEARED. THEN BROTHER AND SISTER WHITE ENGAGED AGAIN MORE HEARTILY THAN EVER IN SUPPLYING THE LAMPS WITH OIL, BUT SISTER W. STILL HAD THE PRECEDENCE.",
