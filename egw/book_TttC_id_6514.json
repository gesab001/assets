    "word": "The gospel message does not win a single soul to Christ,  or make its way to a single heart, without wounding the head of Satan. Whenever a captive is wrenched from his grasp,  delivered from his oppression, the tyrant is defeated. The publishing houses, the presses, are instrumentalities in God's hand to send out to every tongue and nation the precious light  of truth. This light is reaching even to heathen lands, and is constantly making inroads upon superstition and every conceivable error.",
