{"word": "Jesus said, \\93Ye shall ask in My name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father Himself loveth you.\\94\\93I have chosen you: . . . that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name, He may give it you.\\94 John 16:26, 27; 15:16. But to pray in the name of Jesus is something more than a mere mention of that name at the beginning and the ending of a prayer. It is to pray in the mind and spirit of Jesus, while we believe His promises, rely upon His grace, and work His works.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 286}
