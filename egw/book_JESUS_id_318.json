{"word": "Chap. Forty-Three - Prenatal Influences\n\n     Women Should Be Qualified to Become Mothers.-- Women have need of great patience before they are qualified to become mothers.

The presence of Jesus is needed in the home; for the mother's ministries of love may shape the home into a Bethel. The husband and the wife are to co-operate. What a world we would have if all mothers would consecrate themselves on the altar of God, and would consecrate their offspring to God, both before and after its birth!", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AH", "page": 255}
