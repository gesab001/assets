{"word": "I saw that the nominal churches had fallen; that coldness and death reigns in their midst. If they would follow the Word it would humble them. But they get above the work of the Lord. It is too humbling for them to repeat the same simple story \n                                                                           37\nof God's goodness when they meet together; and they try to get something new; something great, and study to have their words exact to the ear, and please man, and God's Spirit has left them. When we follow the humble, Bible way, we shall have the movings of the Spirit of God. All will be in sweet harmony, if we follow the humble channel of truth, depending wholly upon God, and there will be no danger of being affected by the evil angels. It is when souls get above the Spirit of God, moving in their own strength, that the angels cease watching over them, and they are left to the buffetings of satan.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ExV54", "page": 36}
