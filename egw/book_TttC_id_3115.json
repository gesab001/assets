    "word": "Some of our ministers are taking advantage of the liberalities of our brethren to advantage themselves; and in so doing they are gradually losing their influence; their example in these things is destroying the confidence of their brethren in them. And they are effectually closing the door so that those who really need help and are worthy of it cannot obtain it. They also shut the door whereby help may be expected to sustain the cause. Many of the people are becoming disheartened as they see some of the ministers they employ manifesting so little interest for the prosperity of the cause of God. They do not see a devotion to the work. The people are neglected, and \n                                                                           629\nthe cause is languishing, because of the lack of well-directed and efficient labor which they have a right to expect from their ministers.",
