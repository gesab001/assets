{"word": "The belief of the Jews in regard to the relation of sin and suffering was held by Christ's disciples. While Jesus corrected their error. He did not explain the cause of the man's affliction, but told them what would be the result. Because of it the works of God would be made manifest. \"As long as I am in the world,\" He said, \"I am the light of the world.\" Then having anointed the eyes of the blind man, He sent him to wash in the pool of Siloam, and the man's sight was \n                                                                           22\nrestored. Thus Jesus answered the question of the disciples in a practical way, as He usually answered questions put to Him from curiosity. The disciples were not called upon to discuss the question as to who had sinned or had not sinned, but to understand the power and mercy of God in giving sight to the blind.-- The Desire of Ages, pp. 470, 471.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "WM", "page": 21}
