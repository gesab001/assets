{"word": "Study Christ's definition of a true missionary, \"Whosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Mark 8:34. Following Christ, as spoken of in these words, is not a pretense, a farce. Jesus expects His disciples to follow closely in His footsteps, enduring what He endured, suffering what He suffered, overcoming as He overcame. He is anxiously waiting to see His professed followers revealing the spirit of self-sacrifice.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CH", "page": 511}
