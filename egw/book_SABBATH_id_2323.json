{"word": "The reproach resting upon the cause in regard to Sister A rests heavily upon you. You made much of her exercises and experience. She was weak, yet could in a measure fill her place in her family and keep her children together; but she had been from her home but a short time before her reason was dethroned. The backslidden state of the professed Sabbathkeepers in ----- led you to influence Sister A to leave her family who needed her care, and come to ----- that her influence might help the Sabbathkeepers there. An unhealthy excitement marked her course. Some of the inexperienced were deluded. The weak mind of Sister A was overtaxed, and disease fastened upon the brain. And the cause of God is deeply wounded and reproached on account of this. Brother A has been wronged; he must now suffer under a living trouble, and his children must be scattered. Those whose influence led to these sad consequences, have a work to do to relieve the mind of Brother A, and by a faithful and full acknowledgment to him of the sin of the course pursued, and the wrong done him, counteract the evil as far as possible.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1T", "page": 315}
