{"word": "We speak with Jesus Christ as we walk by the way, and He says, \"I am at thy right hand.\" We may walk in daily companionship with Christ. When we breathe out our desire, it may be inaudible to any human ear, but that word cannot die away into silence nor can it be lost, though the activities of business are going on. Nothing can drown the soul's desire. It rises above the din of the street, above the noise of machinery, to the heavenly courts. It is God to whom we are speaking, and the prayer is heard. Ask then; \"Ask, and it shall be given you.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 69}
