{"word": "129\n \n \n     Be a lamplighter, not just a torchbearer.--In the place of having one mammoth camp meeting, have several small camp meetings. And when companies are raised up in the places where these meetings are held, let a place of worship be built for them. We cannot do otherwise here, so that labor shall not be lost. To do otherwise is too much like carrying a torch through a district in the night. The places where the torchbearer goes are light, but there are not many tapers kindled from his torch, to become true workers in giving light to others.--15MR 250.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 129}
