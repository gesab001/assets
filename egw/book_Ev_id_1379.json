{"word": "The Western Cities \n\n     The Cities of California.--There is work to be done in California,--a work that has been strangely neglected. Let this work be delayed no longer. As doors open for the presentation of truth, let us be ready to enter. Some work has been done in the large city of San Francisco, but as we study the field we see plainly that only a beginning has been made. As soon as possible, well-organized efforts should be put forth in different sections of this city, and also in Oakland. The wickedness of San Francisco is not realized. Our work in this city must broaden and deepen. God sees in it many souls to be saved.--Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 110. (1902)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 403}
