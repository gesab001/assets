{"word": "The Lord Wants to Disturb Minds.--Christ sees men so absorbed in worldly cares and business perplexities that they have no time to become acquainted with Him. To them heaven is a strange place, for they have lost it out of their reckoning. Not familiar with heavenly things, they tire of hearing about them. They dislike to have their minds disturbed concerning their needs of salvation, preferring to engage in amusements. But the Lord wants to disturb their minds, that they may be led to take hold of eternal realities. He is in earnest with them. Very, very soon they will all know Him, whether they desire to or not.--MS 105, 1901.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 128}
