{"word": "And I saw if there was any one on earth who could consistently testify under oath, it is the Christian. He lives in the light of God's countenance. He grows strong in his strength. And when matters of importance must be decided by law, there is no one who can so well appeal to God as the Christian. I was bid by the angel to notice that God sware by himself. Genesis 22:16; Hebrews 6:13, 17. He sware to Abraham, Genesis 26:3, to Isaac, Psalm 105:9; Jeremiah 11:5, and to David, Psalm 132:11; Acts 2:30. God required of the children of Israel an oath between man and man. Exodus 22:10, 11. Jesus submitted to the oath in the hour of his trial. The high priest said unto him, \"I adjure \n                                                                           44\nthee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said.\" If Jesus meant the judicial oath in his teachings to his disciples, he would have reproved the high priest, and there enforced his teachings for the good of his followers present.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "4bSG", "page": 43}
