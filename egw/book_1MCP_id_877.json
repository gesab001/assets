{"word": "Those who know how to pray, who know what are the invitations of the gospel of Christ, who know the immutability of His promises, show dishonor to God when they lay their burden upon finite men. It is right, always, to counsel together. It is right to converse together. It is right to make the difficulties that present themselves in any enterprise plain before your brethren and your minister. But do not so greatly dishonor God as to depend on man for wisdom. Seek God for the wisdom that cometh from above. Ask your fellow laborers to pray with you, \n\n\n                                                   263 \n\nand the Lord will fulfill His word, \"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them\" (Matthew 18:20).--MS 23, 1899.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 262}
