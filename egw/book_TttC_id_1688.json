    "word": "Your heart is on your earthly treasures, therefore you have no heart for the heavenly. These poor things which are seen --the earthly--eclipse the glory of the heavenly. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Your words \n                                                                           699\nwill declare, your acts will show, where your treasure is. If it is in this world, the little gain of earth, your anxieties will be manifested in that direction. If you are striving for the immortal inheritance with an earnestness, energy, and zeal proportionate to its value, then can you be a fair candidate for everlasting life, and heir of glory. You need a fresh conversion every day. Die daily to self, keep your tongue as with a bridle, control your words, cease your murmurings and complaints, let not one word of censure escape your lips. If this requires a great effort, make it; you will be repaid in so doing.",
