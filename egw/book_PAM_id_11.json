{"word": "Do not preach until you know what Christ is to you.--Will my brethren take heed that no glory is given to men? Will they acknowledge that Christ does the work upon the human heart, and not they themselves. Will my ministering brethren plead with God alone in secret prayer for His presence and His power? Dare not to preach another discourse until you know, by your own experience, what Christ is to you. With hearts made holy through faith in the righteousness of Christ, you can preach Christ, you can lift up the risen Saviour before your hearers; with hearts subdued and melted with the love of Jesus you can say, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\"--TM 154, 155.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 20}
