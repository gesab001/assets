{"word": "Who were Israelites indeed\\97Jew or Gentile, barbarian, Scythian, bond or free? Jesus \\93was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\\94 John 1:10, 11. But this Roman, a commander in authority, came to Jesus with a most earnest entreaty for one of his servants, sick of palsy, grievously tormented with pain. His faith in its simplicity was a pure, unselfish faith. He asks not of Jesus, \\93Show me a sign from heaven,\\94 but solicits Him to work a cure for his suffering servant. He tells Him he feels unworthy to have Him come under his roof. He who dwells in the high and lofty place, yet will He come and make His abode with the humble and contrite in heart. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 241}
