{"word": "Thank God that we have a great High Priest, who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. Christ has not entered into the holy place made with hands, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. By virtue of His own blood He entered in once for all into the holy place above, having obtained eternal redemption for us.--General Conference Bulletin, fourth quarter 1899.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 49}
