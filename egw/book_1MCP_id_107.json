{"word": "What Religion Does.--True religion ennobles the mind, refines the taste, sanctifies the judgment, and makes its possessor a partaker of the purity and the holiness of Heaven. It brings angels near and separates us more and more from the spirit and influence of the world. It enters into all the acts and relations of life and gives us the \"spirit of a sound mind,\" and the result is happiness and peace.--ST, Oct 23, 1884.
