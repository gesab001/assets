{"word": "Obedience to Nature's Laws Brings Health and Happiness.--Our children should be instructed that they may be intelligent in regard to their own physical organism. They can at an early age, by patient instruction, be made to understand that they should be made to obey the laws of their being if they would be free from pain and disease. They should understand that their lives cannot be useful if they are crippled by disease. Neither can they please God if they bring sickness upon themselves by the disregard of nature's laws.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 105}
