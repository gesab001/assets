{"word": "The Lord Jesus is our efficiency in all things; His Spirit is to be our inspiration; and as we place ourselves in His hands to be channels of light, our means of doing good will never be exhausted, for the resources of the power of Jesus Christ are to be at our command. We may draw upon His fullness and receive of that grace which has no limit. The Captain of our salvation at every step would teach us that almighty power is at the demand of living faith. He says, \"Without me ye can do nothing;\" but again declares that \"greater works than these shall ye do; because I go unto my Father.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "HP", "page": 319}
