{"word": "Partakers of Christ's Joy.--We see a retinue of angels on either side of the gate; and as we pass in, Jesus speaks, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom that is prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Here He tells you to be a partaker of His joy, and what is that? It is the joy of seeing of the travail of your soul, fathers. It is the joy of seeing that your efforts, mothers, are rewarded. Here are your children; the crown of life \n                                                                           568\nis upon their heads, and the angels of God immortalize the names of the mothers whose efforts have won their children to Jesus Christ.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 567}
