These would never march out valiantly against the enemy,--the world, the love of self, and the lusts of the flesh,--trusting their divine Leader to give them the victory. \n                                                                           156\nThe church needs faithful Calebs and Joshuas, who are ready to accept eternal life on God's simple condition of obedience.

Missionaries are wanted in cities and villages that are more certainly bound by idolatry than are the pagans of the East, who have never seen the light of truth. The true missionary spirit has deserted the churches that make so exalted a profession; their hearts are no longer aglow with love for souls and a desire to lead them into the fold of Christ. We want earnest workers. Are there none to respond to the cry that goes up from every quarter: \"Come over ...and help us\"?",
