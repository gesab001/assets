{"word": "\"Is it lawful for a man to put away \n his wife?\" Matthew 19:3. \n\n\n     Among the Jews a man was permitted to put away his wife for the most trivial offenses, and the woman was then at liberty to marry again. This practice led to great wretchedness and sin. In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus declared plainly that there could be no dissolution of the marriage tie, except for unfaithfulness to the marriage vow. \"Everyone,\" He said, \"that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.\" R.V.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MB", "page": 63}
