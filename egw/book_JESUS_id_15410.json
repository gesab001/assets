{"word": "When trees without fruit are cut down as cumberers of the ground, when multitudes of false brethren are distinguished from the true, then the hidden ones will be revealed to view, and with hosannas range under the banner of Christ. Those who have been timid and self-distrustful will declare themselves openly for Christ and His truth. The most weak and hesitating in the church will be as David--willing to do and dare. The deeper the night for God's people, the more brilliant the stars. Satan will sorely harass the faithful; \n                                                                           82\nbut, in the name of Jesus, they will come off more than conquerors. Then will the church of Christ appear \"fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "5T", "page": 81}
