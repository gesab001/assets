{"word": "It was thus that the foundation of the Christian church was laid. Many people had assembled where John was baptizing in Jordan. As Jesus walked  among them, the observing eye of John recognized him as the Saviour, and with kindling eye and earnest manner he cried, \\93Behold the Lamb of God.\\94 Two of John's disciples, whose attention was thus directed to Jesus, followed him. Seeing them following him, he turned and said, \\93What seek ye? They said unto him,\\94 \\93Master, where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see.\\94 And when they had come and seen where he dwelt, he opened to them the great plan  of salvation. The words which he there spoke to them were too precious to be  kept to themselves, and they immediately went and found their friends, and  brought them to Jesus.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 149}
