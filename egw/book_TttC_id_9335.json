It is a grievous offense to God that there has been so great neglect in this line when Providence has so abundantly supplied us with facilities with which to work. But though in the past we have come short of doing what we might have done for the youth and children, let us now repent and redeem the time.

If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.\" Isaiah 1:18, 19.",
