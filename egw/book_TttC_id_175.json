    "word": "Then all faces gathered paleness, and those that God had rejected gathered blackness. Then we all cried out: \"Who shall be able to stand? Is my robe spotless?\" The angels ceased to sing, and there was a time of awful silence, when Jesus spoke: \"Those who have clean hands and pure hearts shall be able to stand; My grace is sufficient for you.\" At this, our faces lighted up, and joy filled every heart. And the angels struck a note higher and sang again, while the cloud drew still nearer the earth. Then Jesus' silver trumpet sounded, as He descended on the cloud, wrapped in flames of fire. He gazed on the graves of the sleeping saints, then raised His eyes and hands to heaven, and cried: \"Awake! Awake! Awake! ye that sleep in the dust, and arise.\" Then there was a mighty earthquake. The graves opened, and the dead came up clothed with immortality. The 144,000 shouted, \"Alleluia!\" as they recognized their friends who had been torn from them by death, and in the same moment we were changed, and caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air.",
