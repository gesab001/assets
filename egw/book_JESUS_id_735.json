{"word": "Christ looked upon our world before He came to it, and He saw that Satan\\92s power was exercised upon the human family. And because of the transgression of Adam he claimed the whole human family. He pointed to their calamities and diseases and reflected them upon God. He said God would have no mercy upon them and they might as well be under his control. Jesus had enlisted to give His own life for the salvation of the human race. He laid aside His royal robe and royal crown that He might clothe humanity with divinity. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CTr", "page": 209}
