    "word": "The apostle Paul shows the only true use for riches, and bids Timothy charge the rich to do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; for in so doing they are laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come,--referring to the close of time,--that they may lay hold on eternal life. The teachings of Paul harmonize perfectly with the words of Christ: \"Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.\" Godliness with contentment is great gain. Here is the true secret of happiness, and real prosperity of soul and body.",
