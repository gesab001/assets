    "word": "Every member of the church should be instructed in a regular system of labor. All are required to do something for the Lord. They may interest persons to read; they may converse and pray with them. The minister who shall educate, discipline, and lead an army of efficient workers will have glorious conquests here, and a rich reward awaits him when, around the great white throne, he shall meet those saved through his influence. \n          Do something, do it soon, with all thy might; \n            An angel's wing would droop if long at rest; \n            And God Himself, inactive, were no longer blest.",
