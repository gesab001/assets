{"word": "The Pattern, Jesus Christ, must ever be kept before us. The Lord Jesus says, \"Follow me.\" He that would \"come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\" This was not done, but a new order of things was introduced into the office. The counsels of God were too \n\n148 \n\noften ruled out of your assemblies. How? With some by an unholy confederacy. \"We will stand together,\" they said. \"You give me your support, and I will give you my support.\" This was the principle that controlled some of the workers in the office. God calls it an unholy confederacy. His grace and His spirit had nothing to do with this human policy. . . .", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "PM", "page": 147}
