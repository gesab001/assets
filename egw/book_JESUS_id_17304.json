{"word": "When our hearts are sanctified by the truth, they will be in unity with the heart of Christ. Says the apostle, \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus\" (Philippians 2:5). Is self-seeking, self-exaltation pressing its way into your soul? Contemplate Jesus your Saviour. Think how He humbled Himself.

For the sake of fallen man He humbled Himself.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 298}
