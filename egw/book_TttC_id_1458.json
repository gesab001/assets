    "word": "\"BROTHER WHITE SEEMED GREATLY IMPROVED IN HEALTH, AND WAS CHEERFUL AND HAPPY, BUT LOOKED TIRED AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN WALKING SOME DISTANCE. SISTER WHITE HAD A LARGE CUP IN HER HAND, WHICH SHE DIPPED INTO THE SPRING, DRINKING OF THE WATER, AND THEN PASSING IT TO THE OTHERS. I THOUGHT THAT BROTHER WHITE WAS ADDRESSING THE COMPANY AND SAYING TO THEM: 'NOW YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS WATER.' HE THEN DRANK, AND IT INSTANTLY REVIVED HIM, AS IT DID ALL OTHERS WHO DRANK OF IT, CAUSING A LOOK OF VIGOR AND STRENGTH IN THEIR COUNTENANCES. I THOUGHT THAT WHILE BROTHER WHITE WAS TALKING AND TAKING NOW AND THEN A DRAFT OF WATER, HE PLACED HIS HANDS ON THE SIDE OF THE VAT AND PLUNGED IN THREE TIMES. EVERY TIME HE CAME UP HE WAS STRONGER THAN BEFORE, BUT HE KEPT TALKING ALL THE WHILE AND EXHORTING OTHERS TO COME AND BATHE IN 'THE FOUNTAIN,' AS HE THEN CALLED IT, AND DRINK OF ITS HEALING STREAM. HIS VOICE, AS WELL AS THAT OF SISTER WHITE, SEEMED MELODIOUS. I FELT A SPIRIT OF REJOICING THAT I HAD FOUND THE SPRING. SISTER \n                                                                           604\nWHITE WAS COMING TOWARD ME WITH A CUP OF THE WATER FOR ME TO DRINK, BUT I WAS SO REJOICED THAT I AWOKE BEFORE I DRANK OF THE WATER.",
