{"word": "AGAIN: WE ARE FOREWARNED THAT THERE WOULD BE FALSE PROPHETS IN THE LAST DAYS, AND THE BIBLE GIVES A TEST BY WHICH TO TRY THEIR TEACHINGS IN ORDER THAT WE MAY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TRUE AND THE FALSE. THE GRAND TEST IS THE LAW OF GOD, WHICH IS APPLIED BOTH TO THE PROPHESYINGS AND TO THE MORAL CHARACTER OF THE PROPHETS. IF THERE WERE TO BE NO TRUE PROPHESYINGS IN THE LAST DAYS, HOW MUCH EASIER TO HAVE STATED THE FACT, AND THUS CUT OFF ALL CHANCE FOR DECEPTION, THAN TO GIVE A TEST BY WHICH TO TRY THEM, AS IF THERE WOULD BE THE GENUINE AS WELL AS THE FALSE.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 138}
