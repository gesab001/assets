    "word": "By efforts put forth in wisdom and love, many a rich man may be awakened to a sense of his responsibility and his accountability to God. When it is made plain that the Lord expects them as His representatives to relieve suffering humanity, many will respond and will give of their means and their sympathy for the benefit of the poor. When their minds are thus drawn away from their own selfish interests, many will be led to surrender themselves to Christ. With their talents of influence and means they will gladly unite in the work of beneficence with the humble missionary who was God's agent in their conversion. By a right use of their earthly treasure they will lay up \"a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.\" They will secure for themselves the treasure that wisdom offers, even \"durable riches and righteousness.\" \n\n                                               -",
