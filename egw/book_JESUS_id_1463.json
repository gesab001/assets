{"word": "Results Not Measured by Apparent Success.--We are to be sincere, earnest Christians, doing faithfully the duties placed in our hands, and looking ever to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. Our reward is not dependent upon our seeming success, but upon the spirit in which our work is done. As canvassers or evangelists, you may not have had the success you prayed for, but remember that you do not know and cannot measure the result of faithful effort.--Manuscript 20, 1905.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "CM", "page": 114}
