{"word": "* * * * *\n\n     In every church there is need of the simplicity of living, abiding faith. The people are starving for the bread of life. The teachers of the word need the unction from the Holy One. Because they are not united to Christ by faith, their spiritual perceptions are not acute to discern the working of the Spirit of God. Earthliness, carnality, marks the experience of many, making them bodies of darkness rather than of light. Hence there are jealousies, envyings, and divisions. Many are trying to patch up an old experience, instead of turning to Christ in penitence and faith. There are some of this class who have an understanding of the theory of the truth, and desire to labor for others; but their efforts will be in vain, for their own souls are not aglow with the love of Jesus.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 105}
