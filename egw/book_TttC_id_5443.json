    "word": "The Saviour of the world offers to the erring the gift of eternal life.

He cries after the wanderer: Return unto Me, and I will return unto you.\" If the sinner still refuses to heed the voice of mercy which calls after him with tender, pitying love, his soul will be left in darkness.
