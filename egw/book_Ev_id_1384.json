{"word": "Bay City Suburbs; Oakland.--My soul is filled with remorse--I cannot word it in any other way--that such places as this [Petaluma] should be passed by. Once in a great while a minister has come to speak to the believers, but no effort has been made to place the truth before the people. Why Petaluma should have been neglected is beyond my comprehension. It is so near San Francisco, and yet it might be as far off as Africa as far as any effort to proclaim the truth in it is concerned.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 404}
