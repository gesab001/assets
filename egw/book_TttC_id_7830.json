    "word": "All who are born of God will become co-workers with Christ. Such are the salt of the earth. \"But if the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?\" If the religion we profess fails to renew our hearts and sanctify our lives, how shall it exert a saving power upon unbelievers? \"It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden underfoot of men.\" That religion which will not exert a regenerating power upon the world is of no value. We cannot trust it for our own salvation. The sooner we cast it away the better, for it is powerless and spurious.",
