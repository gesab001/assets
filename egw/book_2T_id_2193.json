    "word": "Chap. 31 - Contemplating Marriage\n\n     I was pointed back to last May, when the Lord visited -----, and was shown the case of Brother D. He was not prepared to take part in that work. His mind and heart were elsewhere. \n                                                                           226\nHe was contemplating marriage and could not listen to the invitation of Jesus: \"Come; for all things are now ready.\" His contemplated marriage engrossed his attention. He had no time or inclination to open the door of his heart to the gracious Visitor. Had he done this, Christ would have given him good counsel, which, if heeded, would have been of priceless value to him. He would have presented before him in its true light his danger of yielding to the dictates of a wayward inclination and setting aside the glory of God and the decisions of sober reason. He would have charged him to beware how he trod in the footsteps of those who had fallen and been ruined. But this brother did not consider that God had claims upon him; that he should make no move without consulting Him who had bought him. We are instructed that whatever we do, we should do all to His glory.",
