{"word": "Talk light; walk in the light. \"God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.\" Study not how to please self. Lose sight of self, and behold the multitudes perishing in their sins. Gather to your souls the courage that can come only from the Light of the world. Forgetting self, help the many who are within reach around you. Talk faith, and your faith will increase. . . . Walk so that your life will reflect rays of light to others. Confide in the love of Jesus, and you will have grace to save perishing souls. Your path will be as the path of the just--a \"shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\"--Signs of the Times, June 3, 1903.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 235}
