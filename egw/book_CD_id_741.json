In every line of cooking the question that should be considered is, \"How shall the food be prepared in the most natural and inexpensive manner?\" And there should be careful study that the fragments of food left over from the table be not wasted. Study how, that in some way these fragments of food shall not be lost. This skill, economy, and tact is a fortune. In the warmer parts of the season, prepare less food. Use more dry substance. There are many poor families, who, although they have scarcely enough to eat, can often be enlightened as to why they are poor; there are so many jots and tittles wasted.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 258}
