Yet have you not failed to manifest toward others the spirit which Christ has exercised toward you? Have you felt a burden for the one whom you saw venturing into forbidden paths?

Have you shown by words of tenderness and kindly acts that you love him and desire to save him?", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CCh", "page": 255}
