Realizing their utter helplessness, and deeply convicted of sin, they put no faith in mere outward ceremonies, but cast themselves upon Jesus who is all-righteous \n                                                                           205\nand all-compassionate. The Christian can only rise through humility.

After he has done all he can, Christ must impute to him his own righteousness.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 204}
