{"word": "When there shall be a \"restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began,\" the creation Sabbath, the day on which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph's tomb, will still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and earth will unite in praise, as \"from one sabbath to another\" the nations of the saved shall bow in joyful worship to God and the Lamb.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 364}
