{"word": "Let us not think that we can pass through this world doing just as we please and yet be accepted by God as followers of His Son. The gates of the City of God will never be thrown open to those who have not lifted the cross and followed after Christ in self-denial and self-sacrifice. We are never to lose sight of the fact that if ever we come into possession of the kingdom of glory, we must accept by faith the merits of Jesus Christ. . . .", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 247}
