    "word": "These cases mentioned were designed of God to be developed that all might see the effect of the deceitfulness of riches upon the heart.

It is impossible for men and women to keep the law of God and love money. The heart's affections should be placed upon heavenly things. Our treasure should be laid up in heaven, for where our treasure is, there will our heart be also.",
