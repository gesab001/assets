    "word": "I saw that God would do a still greater work in Maine if all who labor in the cause there are consecrated to Him and trust not to their own strength, but to the Strength of Israel. I was shown that Brother Andrews and yourself have labored hard and have not had the rest which you should have given yourselves in order to preserve health. You should labor with care and observe periods of rest. By so doing you will retain your physical and mental vigor, and render your labor much more efficient. Brother F, you are a nervous man and move much from impulse. Mental depression influences your labor very much. At times you feel a want of freedom and think it is because others are in darkness or wrong, or that something is the matter, you can hardly tell what, and you make a drive somewhere and upon somebody, which is liable to do great harm. If you would quiet yourself when in this restless, nervous condition, and rest and calmly wait on God and inquire if the trouble is not in yourself, you would save wounding your own soul and wounding the precious cause of God.",
