    "word": "Will any body of men bring upon themselves the displeasure of the Lord by framing a law for the observance \n\n\n                                     -88- \n\nof a spurious sabbath, and then compelling obedience to this law? Will they insult God by profaning His holy day, and assuming authority, as gods, to exalt the first day of the week to be observed by all?  {21MR 87.10} \n     How can men set aside the true Sabbath, when they know that God came to our world and from Sinai's mount in awful grandeur proclaimed His law to be observed in commemoration of the day He had ordained as a day of rest--a day ever to be kept as a memorial of God as the Creator of the heavens and of the earth? He made the world in six days, and rested on the seventh day, and was refreshed. He sanctified the seventh day because that in it He had rested. He instituted the Sabbath as a memorial pointing to the fact that He was the Creator of the world, the Monarch of the universe. The Lord has given to men the day that He has chosen to be observed by all the world and regarded as a sacred rest day.",
