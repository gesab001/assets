    "word": "Jesus, the Spotless and Pure, was treated as a sinner when He was found in the likeness of sinful flesh, in order that the believing and repentant sinner might be treated as righteous. As the light of truth should come to the soul, revealing the sacred, holy, immutable character of the law, the believer was to place his feet in the path of obedience. Thus was he to be justified and sanctified.",
