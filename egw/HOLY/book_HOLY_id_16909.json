    "word": "All who claim to love and serve God have a duty to perform. They are to keep themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit, and perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord. It is the failure to do these things that makes the religion of those who profess to be Christians vain. Our God is too pure and holy to tolerate any disorder, any uncleanness. The individual who poisons his breath with tobacco is defiling the temple of God, and him will God destroy. The will of God must be done on earth. Ignorance in regard to these things is sin.",
