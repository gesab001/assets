    "word": "The example of Christ is before us, ever to keep the law and the gospel closely connected. They cannot be separated. Let calmness and self-possession be cultivated and perseveringly maintained, for this was the character of Christ, while We hear the vehement expressions of false religionists who make bold pretensions, who talk loud and long, saying, \"I am holy, I am sinless,\" when they have not the least foundation for their faith. We hear no noisy protestations of faith, nor do we see tremendous bodily contortions and exercises in the Author of all truth.",
