    "word": "What are our young men doing? Jesus is waiting to bind their hearts up with His great heart of love, to bind their interests with His own. He says to them, Young men, flee youthful lusts. Will you obey His voice? You are surely not doing this now. The truth is an inherent power, and if brought into the sanctuary of the soul, will draw men and women to Christ. It will win its way to human hearts. To those who look to Him Christ by His Holy Spirit reveals the beauty of truth. He shows Himself to be the sin-pardoning Saviour.",
