    "word": "There is altogether too little made of the work of the Holy Spirit's influence upon the church. Altogether too much dependence is placed upon the individual human agencies to bring success into the church. Where there is genuine piety in a church, there will be a genuine faith in the manifestations of the Holy Spirit's efficiency. It is depending so largely upon man and his supposed capabilities and his education and his knowledge that eclipses the Lord God, who is All-power and can help, and will help, and longs to manifest Himself to every neglected, cast-down soul who feels that he is weak in moral power. He must rely upon the Word of God with unwavering confidence, and not be continually making the arm of flesh his dependence and his trust.",
