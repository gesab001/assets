    "word": "We see that which the Lord requires of us. Shall we not put our pride and our dignity where it shall not be so easily bruised and wounded? Shall we not lay it all at the feet of Christ? Shall we not allow our minds to be sharpened by the Holy Spirit, that we may not act like children in our association with one another, but as Christ's brave soldiers, going without the camp and bearing the reproach for His sake? \"A new commandment I give unto you,\" Christ says, \"That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another\" (John 13:34, 35). Shall we not, at the beginning of the year 1897, covenant with God that we will not be like the children of the wicked one, pettish, envious, jealous, and full of evil surmisings, but like the tree that is known by its good fruit? Then by our \n\n\n                                   -50- \n\nunity and love for one another all men will understand that we are Christians. Shall we not cherish love, rather than strife and malice and hatred? [John 15:7-14 and Ephesians 2:1-8 quoted.]",
