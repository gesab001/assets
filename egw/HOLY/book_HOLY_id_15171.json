    "word": "This is applicable to many who claim to believe the truth. Rather than give up their lustful practices, they venture on in a wrong line of education under Satan's deceiving sophistry.

Satan uses them as decoys to lure souls to unclean practices which defile the whole being. \"He that despised Moses' law [which was the law of God] died without mercy under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? \n\n\n                                    -178- \n\nFor we know Him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto Me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God\" [Hebrews 10:28-31]. --Letter 35, 1898. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C.
