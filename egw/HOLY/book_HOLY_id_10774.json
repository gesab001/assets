    "word": "I now praise God for His long and merciful forbearance. The message has been carried to many countries. It is a worldwide message. There is most diligent work to do to warn our cities. We have had opportunity to send the light to many thousands who have rejoiced  in the truth and sacrificed their time and their means to build up the sanitariums and churches in all parts of America. Schools have been established and new fields are opening, many in new countries. The work at times has moved slowly. . . . It is for the need of the Holy Spirit that many more places are not hearing the last message of warning. . . . Angels are waiting to fit up converted men and women to do this work if they will consecrate their whole heart, mind, and soul to the work. We have no time to lose.",
