    "word": "1-8. Shekinah Glory Revealed to Isaiah.--Christ Himself was the Lord of the temple. When He should leave it, its glory would depart--that glory once visible in the holy of holies over the mercy seat, where the high priest entered only once a year, on the great day of atonement, with the blood of the slain victim (typical of the blood of the Son of God shed for the sins of the world), and sprinkled it upon the altar. This was the Shekinah, the visible pavilion of Jehovah.",
