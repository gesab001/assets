    "word": "Many persons take a melancholy pleasure in feeling and talking as if the chief object of those with whom they are associated is to make them miserable. The sufferings of most such persons are self-created; they view everything from a false standpoint, and all things are perverted to their eyes. This is a terrible form of selfishness. Let us all forget self as much as possible, cultivate cheerfulness, seek to brighten the lives of others, and we shall then have less desire to complain of our own lot; we shall in fact lose sight of our selfish cares and gloom. \n                                                                           26",
