    "word": "The divine messenger tries to release himself from the grasp of Jacob. He pleads with him, \u201cLet me go, for the day breaketh.\u201d But Jacob has been pleading the promises of God; he has been urging his pledged word, which is as unfailing as his throne; and now, through humiliation, repentance, and self-surrender, this sinful, erring mortal can make terms with the heavenly messenger: \u201cI will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\u201d What boldness is here manifested! What lofty faith! what perseverance and holy trust! Had this been a boastful, presumptuous claim, Jacob would have been instantly destroyed. But his was the assurance of one who realizes his weakness and unworthiness, yet trusts the faithfulness of God to fulfill his promise. The mistake which had led to Jacob's sin in obtaining the birthright by fraud was now open before him. He had not trusted God and his promises as he should have done. He had become impatient, and had sought by his own efforts to bring about that \n132\nwhich God was abundantly able to perform in his own time and way.",
