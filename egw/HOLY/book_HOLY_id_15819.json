    "word": "God desires His ministers to stand in a high and holy position. Those who open the Word of God to others should ask themselves, before they enter the pulpit, whether they have been self-denying, whether their food has been simple, such as the stomach can digest without beclouding the brain. Please read the first chapter of Second Corinthians. This entire chapter is a lesson for all believers.",
