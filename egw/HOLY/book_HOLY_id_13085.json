    "word": "What are we doing? Are we voicing the message of the third angel? \"The third angel followed them [the first and second angels,] saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints: \n\n\n                         -6- \n\nhere are they that keep the commandments of God, and have the faith of Jesus.\"",
