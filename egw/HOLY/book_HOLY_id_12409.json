    "word": "The terms of the law are plainly specified. If you love God with your whole heart and soul and strength and mind, and your neighbor as yourself, you are making sure of life eternal; for Christ has said of those who keep His commandments, \"Ye shall live.\" Will you do the very work you must do in order to be saved? If you are careful, prompt, and conscientious in your homelife; if in your prayers you claim the Lord's promises, and expect an answer; if you discharge your duties faithfully, you will not be left to stumble on in darkness. The Lord of heaven will be present with you; by His Holy Spirit He will guide you. Every one who is to receive the overcomer's reward must first overcome every sin; and not until he overcomes through divine grace, can he entertain hope of entering the haven of eternal bliss.",
