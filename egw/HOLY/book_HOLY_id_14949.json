    "word": "MR No. 1267 - Evil Counsels Followed at the Review and Herald and the General Conference\n\n     (Written October 12, 1895, at Granville, NSW.) \n\n     The reproofs that have been coming to the men who have walked away from God into false paths have not been for anything that has come suddenly.

Men controlled by the Holy Spirit, familiar with the principles of the law of God, could not engage in it if they had been looking to God and trusting in God. But men, human men, have had a settled determination to carry out their own devisings as if the Lord had authorized them to do this work. Men were working upon principles that God has condemned, which God will not accept, but in the great day of God He will say, \"Who has required this work at your hands?\"",
