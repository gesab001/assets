    "word": "I ask you who stand as leaders in this work to read prayerfully chapters four to eleven of the book of Deuteronomy, for there is instruction that all need who would understand God's dealings with His people. And I wish to impress upon all who read these chapters that they mean much to every soul who carries responsibilities in connection with sanitarium work. \"Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy \n                                                                           4\nGod,\" the Lord declares, \"and the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself above all nations that are upon the earth.\" All the directions He has given are to be carefully observed, from the greatest to that which may seem the least.",
