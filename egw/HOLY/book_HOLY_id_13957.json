    "word": "The forbearance of the Lord is wonderful; He putteth constraint upon His own attributes. Omnipotence exerted over Omnipotence. Why hath God kept silence? Why hath He forborne so long in looking for centuries upon a people who despised His goodness and forbearance and patience. He sees His holy law prostrated, broken, trampled under foot, by a rebellious confederate people, who give themselves to work evil, cooperating with evil angels. The whole apostasy of evil angels has conspired with evil men, and gathered in strong armies to destroy the champions of God and the truth. The Lord will come out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, and the earth shall disclose her blood, and no more cover her slain.",
