    "word": "Every thought of this kind is the result of the Holy Spirit's working on the human mind. And if the advocates of these new themes and doctrines are sustained by the Word, if their spirit and actions make them witnesses for God, if the true light shines through them in clear, bright beams, if they reveal a patient, kind, forbearing spirit, the efforts made by the adversaries of truth, as in Christ's day, will be powerless. If these misapply truth, as they surely will, if they misinterpret and wrest the Scriptures in order to sustain error, if they make personal threats that they may stir your passions to retaliate, as they certainly will do, keep your words pure and calm. Remember that Jesus is by your side to help you to reveal His Spirit and not your own natural temperament.",
