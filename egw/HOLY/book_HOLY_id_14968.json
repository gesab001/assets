    "word": "God declares, \"Them that honor Me, I will honor.\" God's revealed will has been superseded by the speculations and opinions of finite men who have refused the Holy Spirit's working and called His work fanaticism. How often have you changed the working of the Sentinel? Will you attend to matters in your own line, and let God manage this organ? The Word of God has not been taken into your council meetings; for had this been followed you would have had your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. You would have walked in \n\n\n                                 -229- \n\nstraight paths. But men have foolishly trusted to finite wisdom. They have adopted theories and plans that are opposed to the Word of God, and have greatly marred His work. Yet they act like blind men. They work desperately to gather all the responsibilities they can grasp, while they are no more able to manage them than are children.",
