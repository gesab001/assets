    "word": "Let those in every far-off country work unselfishly in the fear and love of God to advance the work; as missionaries for God, they can do much for it if they are connected with Him. They should draw nigh to God with full assurance of faith, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or doubting. God will make known unto them His pleasure; but all who do not work with an eye single to the glory of God, making Him their dependence and trust, who lean rather upon human wisdom, will make blunders. It is in doing the work of God that the richest experience is to be gained. Here is where you get wisdom, and find the promises of God verified.--Special Testimonies to Ministers and Workers (Series A, No. 9, 1897), page 35. \n                                                                           516",
