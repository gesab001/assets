    "word": "Lynn, Massachusetts, Sunday, December 7, 1890 \n\n     I have reason to be thankful to the Lord for His goodness, His mercy, and His love to me. I slept well last night. I offered up my petition to the Lord for His grace, His Holy Spirit. I wrote several pages. I spoke in the afternoon upon Christ's riding into Jerusalem. There were quite a number of First-day Adventists present. After I ceased speaking many were introduced to me. One lady spoke to me and asked me if I knew her. I told her I did not. She said her name is now Gallusia; it used to be Eunice Parkes. She was our close neighbor. We were well acquainted with her in our girlhood. She wished me to call upon her. I am trying to visit and write too, which keeps my time fully employed.--Ms. 50, 1890, p. 5 (Diary 16, p. 366).",
