    "word": "Jesus asks us to consecrate ourselves to Him. He has placed signal honor upon the human race; for He says, \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\" Shall we not, then, give to Christ that which He has died to redeem? If you will do this, He will quicken your conscience, renew your heart, sanctify your affections, purify your thoughts, and set all your powers at work for Him. Every motive and every thought will be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ.  {7BC 909.10}  \n     Those who are sons of God will represent Christ in character. Their works will be perfumed by the infinite tenderness, compassion, love, and purity of the Son of God. And the more completely mind and body are yielded to the Holy Spirit, the greater will be the fragrance of our offering to Him (RH Nov. 24, 1896).  {7BC 909.11}  \n\n2 Thessalonians\n\n\n                                 Chapter 2 \n\n     1-4 (see EGW on 1 John 2:18). The Man of Sin and the Second Advent.--In the days of the apostle Paul, the Thessalonian brethren were laboring under the erroneous impression that the Lord would return in their day, and Paul wrote to correct this false impression, stating what events must transpire before the advent could take place. He declared: \"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.\"",
