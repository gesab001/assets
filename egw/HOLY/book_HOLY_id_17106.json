    "word": "Those who are able to relieve the sick of their temporal necessities will often find ready access to hearts. Grateful for the loving ministry performed in their behalf, many will gladly listen to words of spiritual comfort and consolation. Their hearts will be susceptible to the influence of the Holy Spirit as the consecrated medical missionary opens the Scriptures of truth and brings to their attention the special warning message for this time. Many will decide to yield their all to the Lord.",
