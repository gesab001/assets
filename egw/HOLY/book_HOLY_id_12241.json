    "word": "Of all the gifts which God has given to man, none is more noble or a greater blessing than the, gift of speech, if it is sanctified by the Holy Spirit. It is with the tongue we convince and persuade; with it we offer prayer and praise to God; and with it we convey rich thoughts of the Redeemer's love. By this work, the canvasser can scatter the seeds of truth, causing the light from the word of God to shine into many minds.",
