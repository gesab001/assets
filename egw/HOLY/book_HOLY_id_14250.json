    "word": "[Revelation 2:1-6, quoted.] \n     \"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent\" (Revelation 2:5). They are not to give heed to seducing spirits. They are not to remove one pin from the foundation of truth that the Lord has built up from point to point by the ministration of the Holy Spirit. If one point is yielded, there is no surety that other points will not be discarded; and point by point, the structure of truth will be assailed and discarded.",
