    "word": "NONE SHOULD WAIT IN IDLE EXPECTANCY FOR THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS GIVEN FOR SERVICE. AS CHURCH-MEMBERS GO FORTH AT GOD'S BIDDING, THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES TO GIVE EFFICIENCY AND POWER. \"Every truly converted soul will be intensely desirous to bring others from the darkness of error into the marvelous light of the righteousness of Christ. The great outpouring of the Spirit of God, which lightens the whole earth with his glory, will not come until we have an enlightened people who know by experience what it means to be laborers together with God. When we have entire whole-hearted consecration to the service of Christ, God will recognize the fact by an outpouring of His Spirit without measure; but this will not be while the largest portion of the church are not laborers together with God.\"--\"Review and Herald.\"",
