    "word": "\"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\" (1 John 2:4). A great awakening must come to the church. If we only knew, if we only understood, how quickly the spirit of the message would go from church to church. How willingly would the possessions of believers be given to support the work of God.
