    "word": "Many are closing their hearts against the Holy Spirit of God. Many who once understood the workings of the Spirit of God, Christ does not own today. O that Christ would stir the hearts of those who have once walked in the light, but who now walk in darkness; who have once known what it meant to have the grace of God in their hearts, but who are now destitute of that grace. They have had the light of the Spirit of God, but in their blindness they have quenched \n\n78. \n\nthat light, and they are now under the condemnation of God.",
