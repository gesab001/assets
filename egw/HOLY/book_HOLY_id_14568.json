    "word": "Christ had on one occasion sought to prepare the minds of His disciples for the scenes of suffering that were before Him. He told them that He should be betrayed into the hands of His enemies, and be put to death, and should rise again. They did not comprehend what He was trying to teach them, but a shadow, as of some great sorrow, fell upon them. Yet even in this time of sadness the spirit of unholy rivalry found a place in their hearts. Jesus read their thoughts. They loitered behind, and He was in advance of them as they came to Capernaum. He called the disciples, and inquired in regard to their disputes by the way. And He took a little child and setting him in the midst of them, He said, \"Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven\" [Matthew 18:3, 4]. This lesson is for us. \n\n\n                                -177-",
