    "word": "Does this text mean that the human agent can remove one stain of sin from his soul? No. Then what does it mean to purify himself? It means to look upon the Lord's great moral standard of righteousness, the holy law of God, and see that he is a sinner in the light of that law. \"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.\" 1 John 3:4, 5. It is through faith in Jesus Christ that . . . the human agent is purified and cleansed. . . . \"Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not.\" Verse 6. God has power to keep the soul that is in Christ. . . . A mere profession of godliness is worthless. It is he that abideth in Christ that is a Christian. . . .",
