    "word": "Our work is clearly defined. As the Father sent His only begotten Son into our world, even so Christ sends us, His disciples, as His medical missionary workers. In fulfilling this high and holy mission, we are to do the will of God. No one man's mind or judgment is to be our criterion of what constitutes genuine medical missionary work. Altogether too much has been introduced in connection with this work. That which is attached to it largely destroys its sanctity and its power to fulfill the purpose which it is ordained of God to accomplish.",
