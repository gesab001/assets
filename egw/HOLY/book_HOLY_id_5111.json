    "word": "Thorough Mastery of Fundamentals \n\n     Never rest satisfied with a low standard. In attending school, be sure that you have in view a noble, holy object. Go because you desire to fit yourselves for service in some part of the Lord's vineyard. Do all that you can to attain this object. You can do more for yourselves than any one can do for you. And if you do all that you can for yourselves, what a burden you will lift from the principal and the teachers!",
