    "word": "At the General Conference in 1901, in an article entitled, Instruction Regarding the School Work, read before the delegates in April 22, it was pointed out that all our medical students were not to receive their training at the one medical College at Battle Creek. Of our schools that were introducing educational reform, Sister White read: (G.C.B. 455-1901) \"We are thankful that an interest is being shown in the work of establishing our schools on a right foundation, as they should have been established years ago. If the proper education is given to students, it is a positive necessity to establish our schools at a distance from the cities, (777) where the students can do manual work. . . . Altho there be a few students at first, do not be discouraged. The school will win its way. Introduce the medical missionary work. Some of the students are to be educated as nurses, some as physicians. It is not necessary for our students to go to Ann Arbor for a medical education. They may obtain at our schools all the education that is essential to perform the work for this time. It will take some time to get a right understanding of the matter, but just as soon as we begin to work in the line of true reform, the Holy Spirit will lead us and guide us, if we are willing to be guided. . . All must place themselves under the influence of the Holy Spirit. When they place themselves under the influence of the Holy Spirit they will accommodate themselves to Bible lines. When the Word of God takes possession of the minds of the teachers, then they are fitted to deal with the education of others. . . The Word of God is to stand as the foundation of all education. It is to be made the basis of all the schools that we establish.\"",
