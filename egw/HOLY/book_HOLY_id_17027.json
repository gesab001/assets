    "word": "From our own personal experience we can speak of the truth that has made us what we are, - Seventh-day Adventists. Truth felt within is most precious, but truth confirmed by the testimony of the word and by the Holy Spirit's power is of the highest value. We can confidently say, The truth that has come to us through the Holy Spirit's working is not a lie. The evidences given for the last half century bear the evidence of the Spirit's power. In the word of God we have found the truth that substantiates our faith. We have watched the influence of the heresies that have come in, and we have seen them come to naught. God has given us sacred, holy truths. Let us hold them fast. I am instructed to say that we are now to present these truths, in plainness and simplicity, to the people of God. \n\n\n                    (Stamped) \n\n\n                               Ellen G.
