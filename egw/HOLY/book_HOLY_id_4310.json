    "word": "Oh, who will describe to you the lamentations that will arise when at the boundary line which parts time and eternity the righteous Judge will lift up His voice and declare, \"It is too late.\" Long have the wide gates of heaven stood open and the heavenly messengers have invited and entreated \"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely\" (Revelation 22:17). \"To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart.\" But at length the mandate goes forth, \"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still\" (Revelation 22:11).",
