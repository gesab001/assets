    "word": "Every servant of God is to be guided by the Holy Spirit. It is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. Our path, however rugged it may be, is marked out for us by the Lord; and in it we must walk. We must believe in Christ as a personal, sympathizing Saviour. He loves us and gave himself for us. He doeth all things well. . . .",
