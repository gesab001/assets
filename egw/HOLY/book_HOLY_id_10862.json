    "word": "Those who desire to find pardon for past transgressions must come to Christ just as they are, saying, \"Lord, though I have been bought with a price, and am Thy property, I have in the past refused to give myself to Thee. I now acknowledge that I am not my own, that I cannot do as I please with myself. Take me as I am, a poor, sinful creature, and cleanse and purify me from all sin by taking my sin Thine own dear self. I do not deserve this, but Thou art the only one who can save me. Take away my sin and give me Thy righteousness. I do not want to remain in sin one more day. Impart to me Thy righteousness, and keep me from all transgression of Thy holy law.\"",
