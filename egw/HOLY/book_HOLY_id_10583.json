    "word": "Let us give careful heed to these warnings and reproofs. Though addressed to ancient Israel, they are no less applicable to the people of God today. And we should consider the words of the apostle in which he appeals to his brethren, by the mercies of God, to present their bodies, \"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\" This is true sanctification. It is not merely a theory, an emotion, or a form of words, but a living, active principle, entering into the every-day life. It requires that our habits of eating, drinking, and dressing, be such as to secure the preservation of physical, mental and moral health, that we may present to the Lord our bodies--not an offering corrupted by wrong habits, but--\"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\"",
