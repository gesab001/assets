    "word": "Many religious teachers say that Christ, by His death, freed us from the law; but not all take this view.... The law of God, from its very nature, is unchangeable. It is a revelation of the will and character of its Author. God is love, and His law is love. Its two great principles are love to God and man. \"Love is the fulfilling of the law.\" The character of God is righteousness and truth, and such is the nature of His law. The psalmist says, \"Thy law is the truth\"; \"all thy commandments are righteousness.\" And the apostle Paul declares, \"The law is holy, and the commandments holy, and just, and good.\" Such a law, an expression of the mind and will of God, must be as enduring as its Author.",
