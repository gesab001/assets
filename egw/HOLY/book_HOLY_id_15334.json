    "word": "What testimony does John bear? \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not\" (1 John 3:1). We have to continue to receive Christ and to confess Christ as our personal Saviour. We must day by day be kept by the power of God. We must in all humility of mind acknowledge in spirit and our actions that we are not \"sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves.\" (2 Corinthians 3:5). We cannot vindicate ourselves before God, or justify ourselves. The Holy Spirit alone can guide us into all truth.",
