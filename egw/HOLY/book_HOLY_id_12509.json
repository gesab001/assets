They have not an eye single to the glory of God. Their own glory is prominent. They seek to glorify themselves, and yet call themselves Christians. Holiness of heart and purity of life were the great subjects of the teachings of Christ. In his sermon on the mount, after specifying what they must do in order to be blest, and what they must not do, he says, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect. Perfection, holiness --nothing short of this would give them success in carrying out the principles he had given them. Without this holiness, the human heart is selfish, sinful, vile, and vicious. Holiness will lead its possessor to be fruitful, and abound in all good works. He will never become weary in well-doing, neither look for promotion here in this world. He will look forward to be promoted by the Majesty of Heaven when he shall exalt his sanctified and holy ones to his throne. Then shall he say unto them, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Then he enumerates the works of self-denial and mercy, compassion, and righteousness, they had wrought. Holiness of heart will produce right actions. It is the absence of holiness, of spirituality, which has led to unrighteous acts, to envy, hatred, jealousy, evil surmisings, and every hateful and abominable sin. \n                                                                           10",
