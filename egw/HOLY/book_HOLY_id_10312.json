    "word": "The Study of the Books of Daniel \n           and the Revelation [COMPILED FROM \n           VARIOUS PUBLICATIONS, AND FROM \n           MANUSCRIPTS OF LARGE CIRCULATION.] \n\n\n     God's Spirit has illuminated every page of Holy Writ, but there are those upon whom it makes little impression, because it is imperfectly understood. When the shaking comes, by the introduction of false theories, these surface readers, anchored nowhere, are like shifting sand. They slide into any position to suit the tenor of their feelings of bitterness. . . . Daniel and Revelation must be studied, as well as the other prophecies of the Old and New Testaments. Let there be light, yes, light, in your dwellings. For this we need to pray. The Holy Spirit, shining upon the sacred page, will open our understanding, that we may know what is truth. . . .",
