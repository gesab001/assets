    "word": "I beg of you, Sister Butler, as God has given you health, to praise His holy name. You have not only done your own soul injury but the soul of your husband in suggesting doubts, criticizing, in evil speaking, in suspicioning evil, \n                                                                           191\nin gathering up that which appears to you to be faults and errors in others, and talking of these. You and Brother Butler have taken credit for having great penetration and discernment, when it is registered in the heavenly record as thinking evil, speaking evil, and harboring prejudice and evil-surmisings. This is not savoring of the spirit of Christ, but it is another spirit. Sister Butler, if you were indeed living in the light, you would have light to impart to others. You confuse your husband's mind, bewilder his judgment, and he has woven into his experience your ideas and your feelings. This has been brought into his work to a greater or less extent. The leaven of suspicion has made you both unkind in thoughts, and uncharitable in feelings; and this is not pleasing to the Lord.",
