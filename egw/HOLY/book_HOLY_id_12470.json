    "word": "Our experience must broaden and deepen; for by grace the strength of God is to be made perfect in our weakness. Our will must be placed firmly, decidedly, intelligently, on the side of God's will. There must be no presumption, no slothful work. It becomes us to pass the time of our sojourning here in fear, not in distrust of the grace of God, but in fear that self will gain the supremacy. We are not to fear that \n                                                                           8\nthere will be any failure on the part of God, but fear lest because of our own sinful inclination any of us should come short of the promise. Let the standard be set high, and let there be an earnest striving to reach it in our daily lives, till our souls burn with holy desire. We need to talk faith, for it is very feeble; but in talking faith, we must speak of that faith that works by love and purifies the soul.",
