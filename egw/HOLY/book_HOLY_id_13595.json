    "word": "The true sign is placed upon every one who accepts the Sabbath, to keep it holy unto the Lord. The claims of the Sabbath if obeyed, will sanctify us, soul, body and spirit. In coming out from the world and being separated, in accepting the Sabbath of creation which God has sanctified and blessed, we give evidence of genuine conversion. We wear God's sign. We are stamped with the mark of His government.--Ms 68, 1899, pp. 5, 6. (Diary, April 14-24, 1899.)",
