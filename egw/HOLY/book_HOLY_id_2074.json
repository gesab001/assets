ONLY A FEW OF THE EVENTS OF THE FUTURE WERE SEEN AT THAT TIME. LATER      VIEWS HAVE BEEN MORE FULL. SEE ALSO APPENDIX.] \n\n\n     As God has shown me the travels of the Advent \n                                                                           14\npeople to the Holy City and the rich reward to be given those who wait the return of their Lord from the wedding, it may be my duty to give you a short sketch of what God has revealed to me. The dear saints have many trials to pass through. But our light afflictions, which are but for a moment, will work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory--while we look not at the things which are seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. I have tried to bring back a good report and a few grapes from the heavenly Canaan, for which many would stone me, as the congregation bade stone Caleb and Joshua for their report. (Numbers 14:10.) But I declare to you, my brethren and sisters in the Lord, it is a goodly land, and we are well able to go up and possess it.",
