    "word": "All blessings come to us by virtue of our union with Christ. He, the Lord of hosts, \"hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, and without blame before Him in love.\" He has chosen all who will receive and believe and practice the truth,--chosen them to be united to Him by adoption, to be members of the royal family. He has made an atonement for sin, and all who by faith receives Him as their Saviour become sons of God.",
