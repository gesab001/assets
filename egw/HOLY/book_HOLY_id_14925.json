    "word": "God will not hold him guiltless that does not set the Lord ever before him. He will walk contrary to those who walk contrary to Him. He will visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Him; and will show mercy unto thousands of them that love Him and keep His commandments. The heart's inclinations are true when they remain under the restraint of the holy precepts of Jehovah.",
