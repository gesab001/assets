    "word": "When Christ said that His disciples should do greater works than He had done, He did not mean that they would make any more exalted exertion of their powers; He meant that their work should have greater magnitude. He did not refer merely to miracle working, but to all that would transpire under the working of the Holy Spirit. The scenes of His suffering and death, to be witnessed by the large numbers in attendance at the Passover, would be spread from Jerusalem to all parts of the world. The apostles, used as His representatives, would make a decided impression on all minds. Being humble men would not diminish their influence, but increase it. The minds of their hearers would be carried from the men to the Majesty of heaven who, though unseen, was still working and performing miracles upon the suffering and diseased.",
