    "word": "Belle, it is not now too late for wrongs to be righted. It is not now too late to make your calling and your election sure. You may now begin to work upon the plan of addition. Add to your faith virtue, and knowledge, and temperance, and patience, and every Christian grace. Everything else will perish in the great day of conflagration, but the gold of holy character is enduring. It knows no decay. It will stand the test of the fires of the last day. My dear child, I wish you to remember that \"God \n                                                                           44\nshall bring every work into judgement, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\" Ecclesiastes 12:14.",
