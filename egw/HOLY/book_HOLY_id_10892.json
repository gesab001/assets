    "word": "What is it that constitutes the wretchedness, the nakedness of those who feel rich and increased with goods?--It is the want of the righteousness of Christ. In their own righteousness they are represented as clothed with filthy rags, and yet in this condition they flatter themselves that they are clothed upon with Christ's righteousness. Could deception be greater? As is represented by the prophet, they may be crying, \"The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are we\" (see Jeremiah 7:4), while their hearts are filled with unholy traffic and unrighteous barter.",
