    "word": "Treatment of Erring Pupils \n\n     In Sabbath school work we shall be called upon to deal with those who make mistakes, who fall into sin and error. Christ has given us lessons in His word that are very plain in regard to the treatment of the erring; but many have failed to practice these lessons. They have not studied and treasured them in the heart, so that the Holy Spirit could enlighten the darkened understanding, and melt and break the stony heart of both teacher and pupil. The Holy Spirit will make the heart sensitive, sympathetic, and rid it of pride and selfishness.",
