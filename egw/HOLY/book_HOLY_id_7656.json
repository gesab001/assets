    "word": "8 (see EGW on Genesis 6:3). Simple Godliness Not Shallowness.--John bears testimony of Christ, the giver of the Word, saying, \"For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.\" In the simplest language John sets before us true practical godliness. This simplicity does not show shallowness, but depth. John is speaking to real men and women, and the Holy Spirit directed him to write in such a way that they would be brought in contact with a real, living God. He shows us what God is doing, and what man must do to meet God's requirements. John does not present the truth hesitatingly, but in a decided manner. He speaks positively [1 John 1:1-7 quoted] (ST Jan. 11, 1899).",
