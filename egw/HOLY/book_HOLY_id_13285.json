    "word": "Post 1844 Truths Unchangeable \n\n\n     The truths given us after the passing of the time in 1844 are just as certain and unchangeable as when the Lord gave them to us in answer to our urgent prayers. The visions that the Lord has given me are so remarkable that we know that what we have accepted is the truth. This was demonstrated by the Holy Spirit. Light, precious light from God, established the main points of our faith as we hold them today. Letter 50, 1906, pp. 1, 2. (To Elder W. W. Simpson, January 30, 1906.)",
