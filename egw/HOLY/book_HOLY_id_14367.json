    "word": "MR No. 878 - Ellen White's Work with W. W. Prescott\n\n     Questions Asked Led Ellen White to Present What She Might Not Otherwise Have Presented--I had a long talk with Professor [W. W.] Prescott last Thursday or Friday in regard to school education. This will come out soon. I have a great work to do and must have the Holy Spirit's guidance. Professor Prescott drew me out as your father [James White] used to do, and many things I could say and did say that I otherwise might not have spoken. Then he said I must write it.--Letter 144, 1896, pp. 1, 2. (To \"Children,\" February 16, 1896.)",
