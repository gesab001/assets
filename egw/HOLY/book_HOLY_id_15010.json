    "word": "The observance of the Sabbath is a line of demarkation between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. It is God's great memorial of the \n\n\n                                      -32- \n\nfact that in six days He created the heavens and the earth, and \"on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.\" It is His memorial to preserve among the nations a clear, definite, unmistakable knowledge of the only true God, an evidence that He is a God above all gods. For this reason He set apart the day on which He rested after creating the world, a day in which no common work should be done. God has given men six days in the week in which to labor and do all their work; the one day wherein He rested after creating the world and all things that are therein was to be His own holy day, when men should worship Him, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. This portion of time is especially set apart for rest and for worship, that men may look upon the heavens and the earth, and honor, worship, praise, and exalt the God who created all things by Jesus Christ.",
