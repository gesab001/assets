    "word": "But God never leaves the world without witnesses for Him. Those who loved and feared Him at the time of the first great apostasy after the flood, humbled themselves, and cried unto Him. \"O God,\" they pleaded, \"interpose Thyself between Thy cause and the plans and methods of men.\" \"And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower [the great idol-building], which the children of men builded.\" (Genesis 11.) He defeated the purpose of the towerbuilders, and overthrew the memorial of their rebellion. God bears long with the perversity of men, giving them ample opportunity for repentance; but He marks all their devices to resist the authority of His just and holy law. As an evidence of His displeasure over the building of this tower, He confounded the language of the builders, so that none could understand the words of his fellow-worker.--Ms 94, 1903, pp. 1, 2.
