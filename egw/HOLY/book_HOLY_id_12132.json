    "word": "This blessed hope of the second appearing of Christ needs to be presented often to the people, with its solemn realities; looking for the soon appearing of our Lord Jesus to come in his glory, will lead to the regarding of earthly things as emptiness and nothingness. All worldly honor or distinction is of no value, for the true believer lives above the world; his steps are advancing heavenward. He is a pilgrim and stranger. His citizenship is above. He is gathering the sunbeams of the righteousness of Christ into his soul, that he may be a burning and shining light in the moral darkness that has enshrouded the world. What vigorous faith, what lively hope, what fervent love, what holy, consecrated zeal for God is seen in him, and what a decided distinction between him and the world! \"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\" \"Watch ye therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.\" \"Therefore be ye ready also; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.\" \"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments.\"           Ellen G. White. \n     Melbourne, Australia, Feb. 18, 1892.",
