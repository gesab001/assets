    "word": "Norwich, Connecticut, Sunday, November 30, 1890 \n\n     I spoke in the afternoon. The house of worship was full. I have seldom addressed a more intelligent audience. I spoke from Luke 19, of Christ's riding into Jerusalem. The attention of everyone was riveted. I had special strength given me from the Lord, and His Holy Spirit impressed the hearts of the hearers. There was deep feeling in the congregation. My heart was filled with gratitude to my Saviour that I was sustained by His Holy Spirit in speaking to the people.--Ms. 49, 1890, p. 4 (Diary 16, p. 350).",
