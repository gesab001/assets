    "word": "Let the leaders in our institutions labor to show that their work is wrought in God; that they are workmen who need not to be ashamed; that their words and works are untainted with earthliness and sensualism. They should feel their solemn responsibility to give the youth a worthy example, one corresponding to their position of trust and their holy profession of faith. They are sowing seed which will blossom and bear fruit. All coarseness and trifling should be put away; it is the fruit borne upon a corrupt tree. Brethren and sisters, you are educators. The lessons you give to believers and unbelievers by your words and example, will be a savor of life unto life, or of death unto death.",
