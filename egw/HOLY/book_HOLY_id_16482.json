The \n                                                                           1642\nHoly Spirit has often been in your midst, but these men, whose hearts should have been open to receive the heavenly messengers, were closed to its entreaties. They have ridiculed, mocked, and derided God's servants who have borne to them the message of mercy from heaven. Some have trifled with the precious things of God which are light and truth and grace. Had these men no fear that the sin of blasphemy might be committed by them. They would certainly fear were they not blinded by the enemy. Poor foolish, deluded souls. They know not the things that make for their peace. God has said, \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.\" \n\n/M.V.H. (7) Jan. 27, '97./",
