    "word": "A Daily Christian Experience Essential \n\n     The evidence of true value and worth in men who are in responsible positions is the fact that they have a daily Christian experience in the things of God. They find music in the words spoken by Christ. \"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me: and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with Me from the beginning.\" If men will receive the ministration of the Holy Spirit--the richest gift God can bestow-they will impart blessings to all who are connected with them.",
