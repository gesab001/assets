Such was William Farel. The son of pious parents, and educated to accept with implicit faith the teachings of the church, he might, with the apostle Paul, have declared concerning himself, \u201cAfter the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.\u201d [Acts 26:5.] A devoted Romanist, he burned with zeal to destroy all who should dare to oppose the church. \u201cI would gnash my teeth like a furious wolf,\u201d he afterward said, referring to this period of his life, \u201cwhen I heard any one speaking against the pope.\u201d He had been untiring in his adoration of the saints, in company with Lefevre making the round of the churches of Paris, worshiping at the altars, and adorning with gifts the holy shrines. But these observances could not bring peace of soul. Conviction of sin fastened upon him, which all the acts of penance that he practiced, failed to banish. As a voice from Heaven, he listened to the reformer's words: \u201cSalvation is of grace. The Innocent One is condemned, and the criminal is acquitted.\u201d \u201cIt is the cross of Christ alone that openeth the gates of Heaven, and shutteth the gates of hell.\u201d",
