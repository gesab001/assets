The experience that they do not desire for themselves they are not anxious to see their pupils gain. That which has been given them in blessing has been cast aside as a dangerous element. The offered visits of the Holy Spirit are met with the words of Felix to Paul, \"Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.\" Acts 24:25. Other blessings they desire; but that which God is more willing to give than a father is to give good gifts to his children; that which is offered abundantly, according to the infinite fullness of God, and which, if received, would bring all other blessings in its train--what words shall I use sufficiently to express what has been done with reference to it? The heavenly Messenger has been repulsed by the determined will. Teachers have virtually said, \"Thus far shalt Thou go with my students, but no farther. We need no enthusiasm in our school, no excitement. We are much better satisfied to work with the students ourselves.\" Thus despite has been done to God's gracious Messenger.",
