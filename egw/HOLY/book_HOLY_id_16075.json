    "word": "Now, brethren, I beseech of you that have been seeking for light, that have not filled your souls with the passion of prejudices, I beseech of you right here to lose sight of every man; I beseech of you to seek God. Do not let them mystify you, don't let them turn light into darkness. But I beseech of you to press to the mark of the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus. It is the Holy Spirit you need, the conviction of sin; and may God let it rest upon you today. I thank Him for His light and for His Spirit. I thank Him for His grace, and I mean to hang my helpless soul upon Him. I stand nearly alone; but the God of Israel alone can work.",
