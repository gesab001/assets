    "word": "The feast is now spread. The last invitation to be given is to go forth to all nations to the end of the world. This is our work. The messengers are now in a more special sense to call, \u201cHearken diligently.\u201d The message is to go forth from the lips of human intelligences. He who came to our world to proclaim the message was the Lord Himself. Then tell the people that Christ came in human form, that His humanity might touch humanity, and that His divinity might lay hold upon divinity. His servants are to be linked together. \u201cYe are labourers together with God,\u201d He says. \u201cYe are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d If His workers will be worked by the Holy Spirit, a great work can be done. \u201cCompel them to come in\u201d are the words addressed to the messengers, \u201cthat my house may be filled.\u201d The Lord means that we shall be in earnest. If we are wholly consecrated to God, the Holy Spirit will work with us.",
