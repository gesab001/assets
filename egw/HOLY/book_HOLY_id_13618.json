    "word": "MR No. 219 - Miscellaneous Items\n\n     The humble-though-ignorant are Christ's most hopeful disciples. The uneducated heathen in all their cruelty are regarded in a more favorable light than are those who have had great light, who have had evidence upon evidence, but who, when the Lord in His mercy reproves them for the sins they are cherishing as virtues, are offended, and (mark the words) like the disciples of Christ's day, go back and walk no more with Him. Christ recognizes every act in the savage that reflects His own mercy and compassion. When the Holy Spirit puts Christ's Spirit into the savage, and he befriends God's servants, the quickening of the heart's sympathy is contrary to his nature, contrary to his education. Christ implants His grace in the heart of the savage, and he ministers to the necessity of the missionary even before he has heard or comprehended the words of truth and life.",
