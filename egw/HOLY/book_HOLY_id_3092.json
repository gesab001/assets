    "word": "The Holy Spirit will be given to those who seek for its power and grace and will help our infirmities when we would have an audience with God. Heaven is open to our petitions, and we are invited to come \"boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need\" (Hebrews 4:16). We are to come in faith, believing that we shall obtain the very things we ask of Him.",
