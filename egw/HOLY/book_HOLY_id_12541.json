    "word": "Let every one professing the name of Christ, act a part in sending forth the message, \"The end of all things is at hand,\" \"prepare to meet thy God.\" Our publications should go everywhere. The circulation of our periodicals should be greatly increased. The third angel's message is to be given through gospel literature, and through the living teacher. You who believe the truth for this time, wake up. It is our duty now to employ every possible means to help in the proclamation of the truth. When you are riding on the cars, visiting, conversing with your neighbors,_-wherever you are, let your light shine forth. Hand out the papers and tracts to those with whom you associate, and speak a word in season, praying that the Holy Ghost will make the seed productive in some hearts. This work will be blessed of God.",
