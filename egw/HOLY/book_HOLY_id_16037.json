    "word": "This is a conference where advancement will be made, but O, the want of workers. How my heart aches as I think of it. Calls for help come from every quarter.

He can himself make a selection in his divine wisdom that will put our wisdom in the shade, but whatever God does we want to accept willingly. It is a solemn time; we are trying to the best of our ability to impress the people with the weight of their responsibility. Oh for the baptism of the Holy Spirit to come upon the workers that they may represent Jesus Christ in all their labors. Oh why is there so great weakness now when we need strength and power to save souls that are perishing around us. There is a world to be reached, a world to be tested, and who shall be able to stand?",
