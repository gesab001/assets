    "word": "Chap. 60 - Witnessing for Christ\n\n     All who are on the Lord's side are to confess Christ. \"Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord.\" The faith of the genuine believer will be made manifest in purity and holiness of character. Faith works by love and purifies the soul, and with faith there will be corresponding obedience, a faithful doing of the words of Christ. Christianity is always intensely practical, adapting itself to all the circumstances of actual life. \"Ye are My witnesses.\" To whom?--To the world; for you are to bear about with you a holy influence. Christ is to abide in your soul, and you are to talk of Him and make manifest the charms of His character.",
