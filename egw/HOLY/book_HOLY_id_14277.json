    "word": "Let Thy blessing rest, we pray Thee, upon Dores; let it rest upon Ella; and we ask Thee that Thou wouldst take charge of them, that Thy Holy Spirit would rest upon them. May they have an eye single to Thy glory, and may they bear in mind Thy words, \"He that will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Oh, when oppressed, when weighed down, open the clear light that the sunshine of Thy glory may shine upon them, and that they indeed may reflect Thy light to the world. The light that Thou shalt give them, may they impart.",
