    "word": "I felt like weeping when I read Sister Sanderson's letter. I thank the Lord, my sister, that you are resolved to open your heart to the Saviour. I would not speak one word to discourage you. I will try to help you in every way that I can. My heart is drawn out to pray for you, not to depress you. My prayer is, \"Lord, increase Sister Sanderson's faith. Let the operation of the Holy Spirit be felt on her mind. Take her into a sacred nearness to Thine heart of infinite love.\"",
