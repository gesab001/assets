    "word": "If we believe the Word of God, our greatest aim and object should be to educate and train young men and women to go forth and do missionary work. Thus they can use the truth that has been so faithfully presented to them. As they visit families, the precious truths they have heard, the drill they have had on Bible themes, will be brought to their minds. As they read and explain the Word, \"the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\" In this way not only will those who know not the truth be encouraged, but those who are telling the preciousness of Christ will be greatly blessed. \n\n\n                                     Mrs. E.
