    "word": "It is not enough for us to know and respect the words of the Scriptures. We must enter into the understanding of them, studying them earnestly. . . . Christians will reveal the degree to which they do this by the healthiness of their spiritual character. We must know the practical application of the Word to our own individual character-building. We are to be holy temples, in which God can live and walk and work. Never must we strive to lift ourselves above the servants whom God has chosen to do His work and to honor His holy name. \"All ye are brethren.\" Let us apply this Word to our individual selves, comparing scripture with scripture.",
