    "word": "I was sick all the time that I was in San Diego. I was worn out when I left home, and I must have caught cold on the way down. I coughed a great deal, sometimes so hard that it seemed as if my breath would go. I kept closely to my room, for I did not wish to expose anyone else. I am thankful to say that I am gradually recovering. The Lord is giving me physical and mental strength, and for this I praise His holy name.",
