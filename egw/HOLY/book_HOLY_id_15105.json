    "word": "When so much misery results from marriage, why will not the youth be wise? Why will they continue to feel that they do not need the counsel of older and more experienced persons? In business, men and women manifest great caution. Before engaging in any important enterprise they prepare themselves for their work. They devote time and money and much careful study to the subject, lest \n\n\n                                   -314- \n\nthey shall make a failure. How much greater caution should be exercised in entering the marriage relation, a relation which affects future generations and future life? But this holy relation is entered upon with jest and levity, with impulse and passion, with blindness and want of calm consideration.",
