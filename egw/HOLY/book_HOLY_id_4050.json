    "word": "Forbearance Under Wrong \nWe cannot afford to let our spirits chafe over any real or supposed wrong done to ourselves. Self is the \n26\nenemy we most need to fear. No form of vice has a more baleful effect upon the character than has human passion not under the control of the Holy Spirit. No other victory we can gain will be so precious as the victory gained over self.",
