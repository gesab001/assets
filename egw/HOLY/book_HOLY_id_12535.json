    "word": "Shall we not give diligent heed to the lessons that I have read? There is an individual work for us to do in union with Christ. We are to put on Christ, put on His qualities of character, to represent Him in all our words and actions. When we are willing thus to follow on to know the Lord, walking in humility before Him, and being taught of Him daily, the Holy Spirit will work through us, giving us power to represent to the world a better way.",
