    "word": "Christ gave His life for our children and for us, because He desired us to form characters after the divine similitude, that we may enter in through the gates into the holy city, and hear from the divine lips the benediction, \"Well done, good and faithful servant, . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\" (Matthew 25:23). Do you not want to hear these words? Strive with all the power God has given you to gain the crown of everlasting life, that you may cast it at the feet of the Redeemer, and touching the golden harp, fill all heaven with rich music. God help you to gain eternal life, that you may see His face.--Ms. 31, 1901. (MR 900.3)",
