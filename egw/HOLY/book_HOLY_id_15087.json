    "word": "MR No. 1341 - The Dangers of Mind-Cure; Neither Husband nor Wife to Control the Mind of the Other; an Appeal for Conversion\n\n     (Written Oct. 6, 1901, from St. Helena, California, to Dr. Sanderson.) \n\n     I beseech you by the mercies of God that you take your position for the right without reference to the will or judgment of your wife. You have allowed her mind to be a controlling power in your life. Yet you do not see this or many other things you ought to see because you are not prepared to see them in the light of the Spirit of God. For years your wife has refused to submit herself to the influence of the Holy Spirit. She has never been transformed in character. She has a strong mind and a powerful influence over you which confuses your judgment, making you in some respects a weak man. While you allow her to lead you on, while you consent to merge your individuality in hers, anything I may say to you or write to you will be as idle tales.",
