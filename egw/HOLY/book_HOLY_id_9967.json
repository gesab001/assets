    "word": "That the efforts of God's workers may be successful, they must receive the grace and efficiency that He alone can give. \"Ask, and ye shall receive\" (John 16:24), is the promise. Then why not take time to ask, to open the mind to the impressions of the Holy Spirit, that the soul may be revived by a fresh supply of life? Christ Himself was much in prayer.

As we bow before God in humble prayer, He places a live coal from His altar upon our lips, sanctifying them to the work of giving Bible truth to the people.",
