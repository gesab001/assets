    "word": "The refuge of lies will fail. God will strike a blow to deliver His oppressed people. He will raise up humble men to do His will. He who rules \n\n\n                              -232- \n\namong the nations calls upon those at the heart of the work to \"be still, and know that I am God.\" Men will find ere long that they cannot trample on God's holy precepts without incurring the punishment. The Lord will not be slow to punish those who have had great light and yet have betrayed Him. His eye has been reading the transactions that have been stealing through the unconsecrated elements in councils and board meetings in our institutions. \"Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment,\" He says, \"in meteyard, in weight, and in measure\" [Leviticus 19:35]. \"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches, and honor, and life\" [Proverbs 22:4]. \"Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee\" [Hebrews 13:5].",
