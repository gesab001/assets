    "word": "There is no more important work that can be done than the educating and training of these youth and children. The teachers who work in this part of the Lord's vineyard need to learn first how to be self-possessed, keeping their own temper and feelings under control, in subjection to the Holy Spirit of God. They should give evidence of having not a one-sided experience, but a well-balanced mind, a symmetrical character so that they can be trusted because they are conscientious Christians, themselves under the chief Teacher.--FE 266, 267.",
