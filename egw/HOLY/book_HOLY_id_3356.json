    "word": "The Holy Spirit works with those who will be worked, moulds those who will be moulded, fashions those who will be fashioned. Give yourselves the culture of spiritual thoughts and holy communings. You have seen but the first rays of the early dawn of His glory. As you follow on to know the Lord, you will know that the \"path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\" [Proverbs 4:18, R. V.] \n\n\n                                               [275]",
