    "word": "On Friday the clothing of the children is to be looked after. During the week, they should be all laid out by their own hands under the direction of the mother, so that they can dress quietly, without any confusion or rushing about, and hasty speeches. Then come to the table without levity. Boisterous noise and contention should not be allowed any day of the week; but on the Sabbath all should observe quietness. No \n\n\n                                    -81- \n\nloud-toned commands should be heard at any time; but on the Sabbath it is entirely out of place. This is God's holy day, the day He has set apart to commemorate His creative works, a day He has sanctified and hallowed.--Ms 57, 1897, p. 7, 8. (Remember the Sabbath Day to Keep It Holy,\" undated.)",
