    "word": "Let the sweetness of Thy Holy Spirit come into the hearts of Thy ministers, that Thy melting, merciful love, may be manifest in their life. I ask Thee to dispel everything that would prevent them from working for the salvation of souls. Put it into their hearts and minds to make a covenant with Thee by sacrifice. Even now, may the melting love of Christ come into our midst. May we hear the words, \"Thou art Mine, I have begotten thee unto Myself.\"",
