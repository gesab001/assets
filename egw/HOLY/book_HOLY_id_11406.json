    "word": "I am instructed by the Holy Spirit to say, \"All who believe the truth are to be the Lord's messengers.\" As disciples they are to learn continually of Christ, how to lift up their thoughts, to enlarge their expectations, and to have the loftiest conceptions of His excellence and grace, that the endowment of His Holy Spirit may compensate for the loss of His personal presence.
