    "word": "If ye, then, being human and evil, \"know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?\" Luke 11:13. The Holy Spirit, the representative of Himself, is the greatest of all gifts. All \"good things\" are comprised in this. The Creator Himself can give us nothing greater, nothing better. When we beseech the Lord to pity us in our distress, and to guide us by His Holy Spirit, He will never turn away our prayer. It is possible even for a parent to turn away from his hungry child, but God can never reject the cry of the needy and longing heart. With what wonderful tenderness He has described \n                                                                           133\nHis love! To those who in days of darkness feel that God is unmindful of them, this is the message from the Father's heart: \"Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands.\" Isaiah 49:14-16.",
