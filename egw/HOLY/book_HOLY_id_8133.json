    "word": "Chap. 24 - The Holy Spirit in the Schools.\n-\n\n     I ask you who are living at the very heart of the work to review the experience of years, and see if the \"well done\" can truthfully be spoken to you. I ask the teachers in the school to consider carefully, prayerfully, have you individually watched for your own soul as one who is cooperating with God for its purification from all sin and for its entire sanctification unto God? Can you by precept and example teach the youth sanctification, not devotion to the arch deceiver, \n                                                                           203\nbut sanctification through the truth, unto holiness, obedience to God?",
