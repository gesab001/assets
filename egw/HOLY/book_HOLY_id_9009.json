    "word": "The holy salutation mentioned in the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by the apostle Paul, should ever be regarded in its true character. It is a holy kiss. It should be regarded as a sign of fellowship to Christian friends, when parting, and meeting again after a separation for weeks or months. In 1 Thessalonians 5:26, Paul says:--\"Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.\" And in the same chapter he says:-- \"Abstain from all appearance of evil.\" Verse 22. There can be no appearance of evil when the holy kiss is given at a proper time and place.",
