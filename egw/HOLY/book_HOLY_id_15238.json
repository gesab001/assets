    "word": "God's Word declares that the saints are to judge the world. But men and women who are not obedient to the law of God will never be entrusted with the judgment of the world. They have no respect for a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" They do not conform to that law which is holy, just, and good. Therefore they are not saints--holy ones. God could not trust them to act as His representatives in the judgment. God gives all an opportunity in this life to develop character. All may fill their appointed place in His great plan.",
