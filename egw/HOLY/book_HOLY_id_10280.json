    "word": "Witnesses of the Cross \n\n     After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the disciples, clothed with the divine panoply, went forth as witnesses, to tell the wonderful story of the manger and the cross. They were humble men, but they went forth with the truth. After the death of their Lord they were a helpless, disappointed, discouraged company--as sheep without a shepherd; but now they go forth as witnesses \n                                                                           67\nfor the truth, with no weapons but the word and Spirit of God, to triumph over all opposition.",
