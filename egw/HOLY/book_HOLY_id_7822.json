    "word": "The apostle urged upon the Galatians, as their only safe course, to leave the false guides by whom they had been misled, and to return to the faith which they had received from the Source of truth and wisdom. Those false teachers were hypocritical, unregenerate men; unholy in heart, and corrupt in life. Their religion consisted in a round of ceremonies, by the performance of which they expected to receive the favor of God. They had no relish for a doctrine which taught, \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Such a religion required too great a sacrifice. Hence they clung to their errors, deceiving themselves, and deceiving others.",
