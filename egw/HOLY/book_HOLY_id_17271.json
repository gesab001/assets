    "word": "This morning I could not sleep after midnight. I awoke bearing this message to our leading men, Break every yoke that would hinder or limit the power of the Third Angel's message.

Let your requirements ever be dictated by the Holy Spirit of God. When the officers of the General Conference allow such restrictions to be made, they give evidence that they need clearer spiritual eyesight, that the heavenly anointing is not upon them.",
