    "word": "We have a whole far-reaching history. Christ's prayer is: \"Sanctify them through thy truth\"--that is, make the human agent holy through the sanctification of Thy Word. The human agent is not to take Christ's place, or to receive the glory that was to be His living ministration. He was to behold and bear witness to the Light, pointing out the way, a witness attesting to the glory--a voice in the desert, \"Behold the Lamb of God.\" That you may understand more clearly, John [the Baptist] says he was not that Light, but was appointed for this office, to bear witness of that Light.",
