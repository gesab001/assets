    "word": "At the last Conference many professed to see where they had made mistakes in their life and teaching. Have you \n                                                                           16\nbegun to act upon the light you then received? Are you practicing the better plan, educating both by precept and example, that the world may understand what it means to be a follower of Christ? Or do you still go on teaching in precisely the same way as you have taught in the past? Are you acquiring new facts, getting fresh ideas concerning the plan of salvation, are you acting upon those truths which you have already received, lest they leak out of your mind as water out of a broken vessel? Those who would become efficient laborers in the cause must put into exercise that which they already know of truth, disciplining the mind to practice line upon line and precept upon precept. The Lord desires that his messengers should find their inspiration by closely studying his holy Word, by sinking the shaft deep into the mines of truth. He would  have those who minister in the sacred desk able to present things new and old from the treasures of his truth. He would have them able to lift up the world's Redeemer, to magnify his love before the people, to touch the heart, to press the truth upon the conscience, and to give full proof of their ministry in souls sanctified to the Master. O, how my heart aches as I think upon the condition of ministers and people; for I know that many are satisfied to speak smooth things to the people, and those who listen go away not bettered by what they have heard. And even when earnest appeals are made, the emotions of the hearers are stirred, their consciences are roused; but after a little the precious impression is lost, and the people sink back into coldness and indifference.",
