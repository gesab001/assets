    "word": "The Israelites placed over their doors a signature of blood to show that they were God's property. So the children of God in this age will bear the signature God has appointed. They will place themselves in harmony with God's holy law. A mark is placed upon every one of God's people just as verily as a mark was placed over the doors of the Hebrew dwellings, to preserve the people from the general ruin. God declares, \"I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them\" (Ezekiel 20:12). . . . There is no need for us to be deceived. . . .",
