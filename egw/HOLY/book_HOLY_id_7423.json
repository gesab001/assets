    "word": "22. God Did Not Want Spoil of Corrupt People.--[1 Samuel 15:22 quoted.] God required of His people obedience rather than sacrifice. All the riches of the earth were His. The cattle upon a thousand hills belonged to Him. He did not require the spoil of a corrupt people, upon whom His curse rested, even to their utter extinction, to be presented to Him to prefigure the holy Saviour, as a lamb without blemish (1SP 365).",
