    "word": "The land to which we are traveling is in every sense far more attractive than was the land of Canaan to the children of Israel. . . . What stayed their progress just in sight of the goodly land?. . . . It was their own willful unbelief that turned them back. They were unwilling to risk anything upon the promises of God. . . . The history of the children of Israel is written as a warning to us \"upon whom the ends of the world are come.\" We are standing, as it were, upon the very borders of the heavenly Canaan. We may, if we will, look over on the other side and behold the attractions of the goodly land. If we have faith in the promises of God we shall show in conversation and in deportment that we are not living for this world, but are making it our first business to prepare for that holy land.",
