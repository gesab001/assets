    "word": "Lying lips are an abomination to Him. He declares that into the holy city \"there shall in no wise enter . . . any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie.\" Let truth telling be held with no loose hand or uncertain grasp. Let it become a part of the life. Playing fast and loose with truth, and dissembling to suit one's own selfish plans, means shipwreck of faith. . . . He who utters untruths sells his soul in a cheap market. His falsehoods may seem to serve in emergencies; he may thus seem to make business advancement that he could not gain by fair dealing; but he finally reaches the place where he can trust no one. Himself a falsifier, he has no confidence in the word of others.",
