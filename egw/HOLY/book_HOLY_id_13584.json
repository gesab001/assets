    "word": "\"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name; which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\"  This is the only true mind-cure, the only thing that can save the perishing soul. Human beings, with all their defects, all their wilful stubbornness, may come to Christ in humility, contrition, and sincere repentance, and receive pardon. Christ will take away their sins, and impute to them His righteousness. The Holy Spirit takes the things of Christ and presents them to the earnest suppliant, and the salvation of the soul is ensured.--Letter 148, 1901. \n\n\n                                     -340-",
