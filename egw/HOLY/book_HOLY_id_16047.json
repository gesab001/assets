    "word": "The work of the Holy Spirit on the heart is to break down and expel this self-love, this lofty approval of self and this accusing spirit. The soul temple must be emptied and cleansed from its moral defilement, that Jesus may find room to abide in the soul as an honored Guest, that [He] the pure, true Witness may be the power exercised in a holy life. Then Christ is revealed in the heart by faith and precious victories are gained.",
