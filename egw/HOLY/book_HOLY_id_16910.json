    "word": "God would have us ever refuse to plead against the truth. His frown is upon all that is false and unfair. This should be the position of every one who stands to minister in the service of their Master. For if one to whom God has entrusted holy responsibilities allows envy, evil surmising, prejudice, and jealousies to find place in the heart, he is guilty of breaking the law of God. And his words, his ideas, and his errors will extend just as far as his sphere of influence extends. God says to every man to whom He entrusts responsibilities, \"Put not your trust in man, neither make flesh your arm.\" Look to God. Trust in his infallible wisdom. Regard as a sin, the practice so common, even among Seventh-day Adventists, of becoming the echo of any man, however lofty his position. Listen to the voice of the great Shepherd, and you will never be led astray. Search the Scriptures for yourself, and be braced for duty and for trial by the truth of God's word. Let no friendship, no influence, no entreaty let not the smiles, the confidence, or the rewards of any man, induce you to swerve from the path in which the Lord would lead you. Let Christlike integrity and consistency control the actions of your life. The man who sits most at the feet of Jesus, and is taught by the Saviour's spirit, will be ready to cry out, \"I am weak and unworthy, But Christ is my strength and my righteousness.\"",
