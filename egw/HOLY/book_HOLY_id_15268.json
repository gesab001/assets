    "word": "I dare not place myself where I see so many who are unready to cooperate with God in the sacred, holy work for this time, who are in no way fitted for the position of trust which they occupy. Standing before a congregation, I see face after face of those whom I know will be lost unless they change square about. And \n\n\n                                     -142- \n\nthen my soul is in distress as to how I can best reach them. I go from the meeting with my heart so burdened that I cannot close my eyes in sleep. I entreat the Lord to help the men in responsible positions to reason from cause to effect. I see beneath the surface the intents and purposes that will lead to certain results. They see not, and I keep silent, for fear lest the changes that would be made should I speak would have results which would not advance but retard the work of God.",
