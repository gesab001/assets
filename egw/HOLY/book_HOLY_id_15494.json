    "word": "But those souls who are perverting their God-given capabilities by their words and works are scattering from the truth. They are not building up souls in the most holy faith. They are not making straight paths for their feet lest the lame be turned out of the way. They draw back from self-denial and self-sacrifice. They find fault with God and His Word in finding fault with those whom God has sent with His messages of mercy. What have these complainers, these accusers of the brethren, done to gather with Christ? What have they done to advance the work and cause of God in the earth? Have they not done only harm to the messengers and the message God has sent them? They are in the position of those who might have done good service for the Master, but who have missed opportunity after opportunity until their senses are blunted, their perceptions confused. They call evil good, and good evil; light they call darkness and darkness light, because, says Christ, they knew not the time of their visitation.",
