    "word": "Elder Jones, I am much pained by your incautious statements. You speak rashly. You are not sanctified by the truth you handle. Your spirit needs to be refined. Then Christlike words will flow from a heart imbued with the Holy Spirit. You are too self-confident, too sure that everything you say possesses a power which will obtain assent to it from those who hear.",
