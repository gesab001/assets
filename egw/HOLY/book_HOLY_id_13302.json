    "word": "I feel a deep anxiety that Boston shall hear the word of the Lord and the reasons of our faith. Ask the Lord to raise up laborers to enter the field.

Cannot you who minister in word and doctrine prepare the way for this truth to reach souls? O, how I long to see the Holy Spirit's working on human minds. Letter 25, 1905, p. 1 (To A. E. Place, January 17, 1905.)",
