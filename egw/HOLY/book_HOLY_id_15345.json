    "word": "Study the Lord's plan in regard to Adam. He was created pure, holy, and healthy. Adam was given something to do. He was to use the organs God had given him. He could not have been idle.

At all times the machinery of the body continues its work; the heart throbs, doing its regular, appointed task, like a steam engine forcing its crimson current unceasingly to all parts of the body. Action, action is seen pervading the whole living machinery. Each organ must do its appointed work. If physical inaction is continued, there will be less and less activity of the brain.",
