    "word": "Some have been, and are still refusing to put on the wedding garment. They still wear their citizen's dress, and despise the garment woven in the loom of heaven, which is \"Christ our Righteousness.\" \"And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.\" Who are friends of Christ today? Do you feel an intense desire for the robe of Christ's righteousness? Are you sensible of the filthy rags of your own righteousness? Then let the truth come into your practical life. If you are friends of Christ, show it in words, in spirit; manifest love to Jesus, and love for the souls for whom Christ has died. The sentiments of truth are the elements that constitute a symmetrical Christian character. We are far, far from being Christians, which is to be Christlike. We need the Holy Spirit's efficiency. God lives and reigns. \n\n\n                      - 25 - \n\nThe very reason that the Holy Spirit's manifestations were not accepted as precious tokens from God, is that there was not a receiving of the grace of God. The Spirit of the Lord has been upon his messengers whom he has sent with light, precious light; but there were so many who had turned their faces away from the Sun of Righteousness that they saw not its bright beams. The Lord says of them, \"They have turned their back unto me, and not their face.\" There is need of seeking the Lord most earnestly.",
