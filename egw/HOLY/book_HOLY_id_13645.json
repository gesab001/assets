    "word": "Christ fulfilled still another feature of the type. \"His visage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men; so shall He \n\n\n                                    -244- \n\nsprinkle many nations.\" In the Temple service, when the animal brought as a sacrifice was slain, the high priest, clothed in white robes, caught in his hand the blood that gushed forth, and cast it in the direction of the tabernacle or Temple. This was done seven times, as an expression of perfection. So Christ, the great antitype, Himself both high priest and victim, clothed with His own spotless robes of righteousness, after giving His life for the world, cast the virtue of His offering, a crimson current, in the direction of the Holy Place, reconciling man to God through the blood of the cross.--Ms 101, 1897, pp. 11, 12.
