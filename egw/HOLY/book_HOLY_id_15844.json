    "word": "One reason that there are not more conversions now is because you yourselves need to be converted. Just as soon as you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit you will see of the salvation of God. Let the breaking-up plow do its work in the heart. We desire to see everyone drawing strength from Christ by eating His flesh and drinking His blood. May God help you. May He cleanse you from all unrighteousness, and let His light shine upon you. May we see the salvation of God before this meeting closes.-- Manuscript 77, 1902 (MR 900.35). \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. November 1, 1985. Entire Ms.",
