    "word": "Notwithstanding these inspired declarations, how many professed Christians are enfeebling their powers in the pursuit of gain or the worship of fashion; how many are debasing their godlike manhood by gluttony, by wine drinking, by forbidden pleasure. . . .

His powers belong to Christ, who has bought him with the price of blood.--The Great Controversy, pp. 473-475.",
