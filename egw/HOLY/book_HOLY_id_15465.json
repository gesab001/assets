    "word": "We need now men who are acquainted with Jesus; men of faith, men of experience, men who will work for souls as they that must give an account. We have speakers but very few laborers. Teach the members of the church to be workers. Oh, that God would let His convicting, converting power come upon Sabbathkeepers, for many of them by experience know not if there be any Holy Ghost. Self has filled so large a place in their experience they know but little else than its gratification. May the Lord help us to do work--close, faithful efficient work--for the Master, for all our work will bear the inspection of the Chief Shepherd. He will understand just how we have done our work. He will say, \"Well done,\" to those only who have done well.",
