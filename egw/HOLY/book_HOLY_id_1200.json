    "word": "Unity Must Precede the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit\nNotice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect unity, when they were no longer striving for the highest place, that the Spirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All differences had been put away. And the testimony borne of them after the Spirit had been given is the same.
