    "word": "The church needs you, and you need to soften and subdue your own feelings for Christ's sake. He wants you to have His Holy Spirit to work you. Then you may impart life and comfort to the church. Let your words be well chosen that you may be a real blessing to the church. Do not afflict your souls over the inconsistencies of others. Take yourselves in hand, and be consistent in all things.--Letter 125, Aug. 24, 1900, to Brother and Sister James, new believers in Australia.",
