    "word": "Luther was as yet but partially converted from the errors of Romanism. But as he compared the Holy Oracles with the papal decrees and constitutions, he was filled with wonder. \u201cI am reading,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe decretals of the popes, and . . . . I know not whether the pope is antichrist himself, or whether he is his apostle; so misrepresented and even crucified does Christ appear in them.\u201d Yet at this time Luther was still a supporter of the Roman Church, and had no thought that he would ever separate from her communion.",
