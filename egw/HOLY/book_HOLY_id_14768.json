    "word": "We will have to learn the benefits of trials, and not be discouraged under them. The heart must be disciplined, faith must be cultivated, the power of the soul's endurance must be tested. The simplicity of faith and perfect confidence in God needs to be encouraged in your hearts. You must be constantly looking and talking on the bright side, and while the work of self-discipline must be carried on by every individual Christian, it must be in such a manner as to exalt and ennoble, and not to contract and center on little things. Your thoughts should be a growth of holy principles. Do not center your minds on your poor selves, and do not make a brother an offender for a word. Do not judge him by your own finite measurement. Let the voice of simple, trustful, earnest prayer be heard in your dwelling. When our sisters visit one another let them never speak words of criticism of their brethren. Let your minds dwell upon the attributes and experiences of the love of Jesus. The fullness of that love will prove a soother of little bruises, inconveniences, and disagreeable occurrences. \n                      \"O what peace we often forfeit, \n                       O what needless pain we bear, \n                       All because we do not carry \n                       Everything to God in prayer.\" \n\n\n                                     -147- \n\nHow much sweet peace we lose because we keep poring over the disagreeable items in ourselves and in our brethren. We must look away from the disagreeable to Jesus. We must love Him more, obtain more of His attractive beauty and grace of character, and cease filling the mind with the contemplation of others' mistakes and others' errors. No one is perfect but Jesus. Think of Him and be charmed away from yourself and from every disagreeable thing; for beholding our defects faith is weakened. Faith in God and His promises is lost sight of.",
