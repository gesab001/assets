    "word": "Sowing Seeds of Doubt and Unbelief-In past ages there have been those who have exercised their capabilities and powers in doing a work, by the help of the Holy Spirit, which constituted them laborers together with God.  But there have also been those who have criticized their work, and rejected the messages which they bore.  So it is today.  There are those in responsible positions who, by their words and actions, sow seeds of doubt and unbelief.  These seeds are called tares by our Lord; and those who sow it are under the guidance of evil angels.  They are at work both openly and secretly, seeking to counteract the work which God has appointed his divine agencies to perform through human agencies.  All who do this work see with defective and perverted eyesight.  Their imagination is inspired by satanic agencies, and they see many things in a false light.  Unless they repent, they will soon, like Esau, find no place for repentance, though they seek it carefully with tears.--Letter 87, 1896, p. 6 (Aug. 25, 1896, to O. A. Olsen).",
