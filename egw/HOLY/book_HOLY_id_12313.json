    "word": "\"Nothing can, or ever will, give character to the work in the presentation of truth to help the people just where they are, so well as Samaritan work.

A different order of things needs to be established among us as a people, and in doing this class of work, there would be created an entirely different atmosphere surrounding the souls of the workers; for the Holy Spirit communicates to all those who are doing God's service,, and those who are worked by the Holy Spirit will be a power for God in lifting up, strengthening, and saving the souls that are ready to perish.\"",
