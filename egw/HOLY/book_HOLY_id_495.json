    "word": "Jesus Christ came off conqueror in the wilderness of temptation. When upon Jordan\u2019s banks, He offered such a prayer to heaven as heaven had never listened to before. His prayer penetrated through the darkness around Him and reached the highest heavens. The heavens were opened and the Holy Spirit, in appearance like a dove of burnished gold, descended upon Him, and from the lips of the Infinite One was heard these words, \u201cThis is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\u201d We have not understood how much this was saying to us. You are \u201caccepted in the beloved.\u201d. . .",
