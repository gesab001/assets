    "word": "The Lord says, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.\" Matthew 26:41. \"Watch\" lest your studies accumulate to such proportions and become of such absorbing interest to you that your mind is overburdened and the desire for godliness is crushed out of your soul. With many students the motive and aim which caused them to enter school have gradually been lost sight of, and an unholy ambition to secure a high-class education has led them to sacrifice the truth. Their intense interest to secure a high place among men has caused them to leave the will of their heavenly Father out of their calculations; but true knowledge leads to holiness of life through sanctification of the truth.",
