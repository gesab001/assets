    "word": "Our Sanitarium is to be established in harmony with God's appointment. Those who act a part in connection with this institution are to be themselves buildings for the Lord. Writing by the Holy Spirit, the apostle said, \"Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.\" God requires symmetry of character. His workers are ever to remember that self is to be hid in God. They are not to look to the men of the world for their strength, supposing that to gain a crumb of praise from them is something worth relating, even though those who give this praise are trampling God's commandments under their feet. When the great men of the world speak a word in toleration of the author of Christianity, what they say is repeated as though worthy of being immortalized. But words are cheap. They cost nothing. The Lord is honored only by those who love and obey His commandments. \n\n                                               -",
