    "word": "Present Truth in the Meekness and Love of Christ \n\n     Be careful messengers. Do not be anxious to hear and accept new theories; for often they are such as should never be presented before any congregation. Speak no boastful, self-exalting words. Let the word of God come forth from lips that are sanctified by the truth. Every minister is to preach the truth as it is in Jesus. He should be assured of that which he affirms, and should handle the word of God under the direction of the Holy Spirit of God. Walk and work carefully before God, my brethren, that no soul may be led into deception by your example. It had been better for you never to have been born, than that you should lead one soul astray.",
