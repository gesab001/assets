    "word": "The Lord calls upon his shepherds to feed the flock of God with pure provender. He would have us present the truth in the simplicity line upon line, precept upon precept, here is a little and there a little. When this work is done faithfully many will be convicted and converted by the Holy Spirit. There is need of workers who will come close to unbelievers, not waiting for unbelievers to come close to them, workers who will search for the lost sheep, who will do personal labor, and who will give clear, definite instruction.",
