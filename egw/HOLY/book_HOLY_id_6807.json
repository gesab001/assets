    "word": "While exalting the \"sure word of prophecy\" as a safe guide in times of peril, the apostle solemnly warned the church against the torch of false prophecy, which would be uplifted by \"false teachers,\" who would privily bring in \"damnable heresies, even denying the Lord\" (2 Peter 2:1). These false teachers, arising in the church and accounted true by many of their brethren in the faith, the apostle compared to \"wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.\" \"The latter end is worse with them,\" he declared, \"than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.\" . . .",
