    "word": "\"Children are to be trained to become missionaries, and but few understand distinctly what they must do to be saved. . . . The Holy Spirit of God will impress the lessons upon the receptive minds of children, that they may grasp the ideas of Bible truths in their simplicity, and the Lord will give an experience to these children in missionary lines. He will suggest to them lines of thought which the teachers themselves do not have. The children who are properly instructed will be witnesses for the truth.\"--P.C. Dec. 15, 1897.",
