    "word": "Just as surely as the Lord has in His providence placed men in positions of holy trust, so surely will He qualify these men for their positions. If they will maintain their consecration to God, study His Word prayerfully, pray, and watch unto prayer, He will give them of His Holy Spirit to do the sacred, important work, day by day, hour by hour, and minute by minute. The Lord will work on human hearts if the men who are intrusted with sacred things will give themselves unreservedly to Him and become Bible Christians.",
