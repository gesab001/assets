    "word": "74\nWILL BEAR HUMANITY THROUGHOUT ETERNITY.\u2014Christ ascended to heaven, bearing a sanctified, holy humanity. He took this humanity with Him into the heavenly courts, and through the eternal ages He will bear it, as the One who has redeemed every human being in the city of God, the One who has pleaded before the Father, \u201cI have graven them upon the palms of my hands.\u201d The palms of His hands bear the marks of the wounds that He received. If we are wounded and bruised, if we meet with difficulties that are hard to manage, let us remember how much Christ suffered for us. Let us sit together with our brethren in heavenly places in Christ. Let us bring heaven\u2019s blessing into our hearts.",
