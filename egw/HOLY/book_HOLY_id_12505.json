    "word": "Christ's followers are required to come out from the world and be separate, and touch not the unclean, and they shall be sons and daughters of the Lord. If the conditions are not complied with on their part, they will not, cannot, realize the fulfillment of the promise of being children of the most high God, members of the royal family. A profession of Christianity is nothing in the sight of God; but true, humble, willing obedience to his requirements designates them as the children of his adoption, the recipients of his grace, the partakers of his great salvation. Such will be peculiar, a spectacle unto the world, to angels, and to men. Their peculiar, holy character will be discernible, and will \n                                                                           4\ndistinctly separate them from the world, from its affections and lust.",
