    "word": "Teachers Are Truly Missionaries\n     Divine Touch Needed.--The teachers and students in our school need the divine touch. If a missionary spirit was encouraged, even though it took some hours from the program of study, if there was more faith and spiritual zeal, more of the realization that God can do more for teachers and students than He has done, because in the past His way has been restricted, much of heaven's blessing would be given. There are holy chords yet to be touched. Teachers as well as students need to show greater teachableness.",
