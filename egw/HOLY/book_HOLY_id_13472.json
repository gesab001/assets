    "word": "We need the Holy Spirit of God, and we may have it if we will not exalt our poor finite selves. Our work is to open the door of the heart and let Jesus come in. He is knocking for entrance, and there are some poor souls who are inquiring how they shall find Jesus. Why, dear souls, Jesus has been hunting for you, and He stands at your door knocking. He says, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to \n\n\n                                    -162- \n\nhim, and will sup with him, and he with Me\" [Revelation 3:20]. Doubting souls, unbelieving souls, will you open the door? Jesus is standing at the door of your heart. Let Him in, the Heavenly Guest.",
