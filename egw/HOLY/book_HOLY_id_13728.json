    "word": "The beams of light were shining forth from the open door of the temple of God in heaven, and our attention was called to the ark of God in that temple, containing the tables of stone, upon which were engraved the law of God. We saw, in tracing down the commandments, that the fourth commandment-- \n\n\n                                    -403- \n\nplaced in the very bosom of the decalogue--had been perverted; that we had ignorantly been keeping the first day of the week, a common working day, as sacred, when the fourth commandment stated that the seventh day was the Sabbath ordained and set apart by God Himself for man to keep holy. He sanctified the day and man was to show special honor to God in observing the day He had given him. This commandment is the great truth which unites the two dispensations, the Mosaic and the Christian, and the light upon the sanctuary shows their relation to each other.",
