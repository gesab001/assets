    "word": "The soul of the prophet, emptied of self, was filled with the light of the Divine. . . . He bore witness to the Saviour's glory. . . . In this glory of Christ, all His followers are to share. . . . We can receive of heaven's light only as we are willing to be emptied of self. We can discern the character of God, and accept Christ by faith, only as we consent to the bringing into captivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ. To all who do this, the Holy Spirit is given without measure. In Christ \"dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him.\" Colossians 2:9, 10.",
