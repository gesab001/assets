    "word": "The Holy Spirit always leads to the written word. The Holy Spirit is a person; for He beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God. When this witness is borne, it carries with it its own evidence. At such times we believe and are sure that we are the children of God. What strong evidence of the power of truth we can give to believers and unbelievers when we can voice the words of John, \"We have known and \n\n\n                                     -69- \n\nbelieved the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\"",
