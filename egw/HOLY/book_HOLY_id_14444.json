    "word": "Keep the soul right. Let this be the language of the soul: I believe in God, in His providence, in the Bible, and in truth and clearness of purpose. I cannot, I will not, swerve one jot from my duty and the claims that the Lord has upon me. I cannot, I dare not, sacrifice in the least degree my vital interest in holy things in order to gain relief from the pressure of temporal embarrassment. I will wait any time; walk humbly with God; walk in meekness, in humility, in simplicity of soul till the Lord gives me success and victory in His own time and way. My motto must be, God is my strength, my wisdom, my all. \"Without me,\" says Christ, \"ye can do nothing.\" \n\n\n                                    -108- \n\nThen do not try to meet the world's standard; you want the treasures of heaven. You want the crown of life that fadeth not away. If the Lord prepares the way before you, then you may walk in safe paths, and you will have the peace of Christ. Satan will have no power over a soul who is emptied of self and imbued with the Spirit of Jesus Christ.",
