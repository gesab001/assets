    "word": "Elder B-----t appeared to be a very holy man. Had much to say upon charity. Speaking of faith he said, \"All we have to do is believe, then whatever we ask of God will be given.\" Bro. White answered, \"Blessings are promised on conditions. John 15:7: If ye abide \n                                                                           47\nin me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be given unto you. Your theory of faith is empty as a flour barrel with both heads out. And as regards true charity, she is a very delicate personage, never stepping out of the path of Bible truth.\"",
