    "word": "John the Baptist was a reformer. To him was committed a great work for the people of his time. And in preparation for that work, all his habits were carefully regulated, even from his birth. The angel Gabriel was sent from heaven to instruct the parents of John in the principles of health reform. He \u201cshall drink neither wine nor strong drink,\u201d said the heavenly messenger; \u201cand he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.\u201d [Luke 1:15.]",
