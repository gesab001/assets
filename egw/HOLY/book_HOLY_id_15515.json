    "word": "I am alarmed for our ministers who are hardening their consciences \n\n                                     -387- \n\nby continuing a course of sin. I fear that they will continue to fall under temptation until the word shall go forth: \"He that is holy let him be holy still, and he that is filthy let him be filthy still.\" I tell you that there must be a thorough revival among us. There must be a converted ministry. There must be confessions, repentance, and conversions.",
