    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., October 30, 1889 \n\n     Wednesday morning. Attended the early morning meeting. The room was full. I was pleased to see so great interest manifested. I spoke in regard to the necessity of our ministers being fitted up day by day with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, before going forth to their labors. Christ has promised it, why should they not have it? Lay hold by faith.",
