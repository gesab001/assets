    "word": "I lay down my pen and lift up my soul in prayer, that the Lord would breathe upon his backsliding people, which are as dry bones, and they shall live. The end is near, stealing upon us stealthily, so imperceptibly, no noiselessly, like the muffled tread of the thief in the night to surprise the sleepers off guard and unready. May the Lord grant to bring his Holy Spirit to bear upon the hearts of all who are now at ease, that they may no longer sleep as others but watch and be sober.",
