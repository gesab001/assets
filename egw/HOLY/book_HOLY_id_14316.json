    "word": "Holy Spirit Will Renew Memory--Your memory will be renewed by the Holy Spirit. Can you forget what Jesus has done for you at this time, and on that occasion when everything looked so discouraging?--You were taken away from yourself: your deepest, sweetest thoughts were upon your precious Saviour, His care, His assurance, His love. How your desires went out to Him, how your affections centered upon Him. All your hopes rested upon Him, all your expectations were associated with Him. He loves you still: He has the balm that can heal every wound, and you can repose in Him without a single drawback.--Letter 33, 1892, p. 1. (To S. N. Haskell, Sept. 1892.)",
