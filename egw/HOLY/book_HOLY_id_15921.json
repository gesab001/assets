    "word": "O that you would sit as a humble learner at the feet of Christ! Then you would reveal a character that God could approve. What a change there would be in the atmosphere surrounding your soul! You need so much the softening, subduing influence of the Holy Spirit. It is for your present and eternal good that you become soundly converted, through the sanctifying influence of the truth as it is in Jesus. Examine and prove yourself. Do not let any man deceive you. However highly a man may appreciate you, he can not read your heart. Pray now, without delay, that you may not be deceived yourself or be deceived by others.",
