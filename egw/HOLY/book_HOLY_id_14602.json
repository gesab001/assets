    "word": "MR No. 1052 - Relation of Gospel Ministry to Medical Missionary Work\n\n(Written April 15, 1903, from Sanitarium, California, to Dr. J. H. Kellogg) \n\n\n     God works by means of instruments, or second causes. He uses the gospel ministry, medical missionary work, and the publications containing present truth, to impress hearts. All are made effectual by means of faith. As the truth is heard or read, the Holy Spirit sends it home to those who hear and read with an earnest desire to know what is right. The gospel ministry, medical missionary work, and our publications are God's agencies. One is not to supersede the other. But you have sought to make the medical missionary work the whole body, instead of the arm and the hand.",
