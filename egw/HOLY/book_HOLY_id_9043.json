    "word": "Offer Something Better--Don't Attack.--It is of little use to try to reform others by attacking what we may regard as wrong habits. Such effort often results in more harm than good. In His talk with the Samaritan woman, instead of disparaging Jacob's well, Christ presented something better. \"If thou knewest the gift of God,\" He said, \"and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.\" John 4:10. He turned the conversation to the treasure He had to bestow, offering the woman something better than she possessed, even living water, the joy and hope of the gospel. This is an illustration of the way in which we are to work. We must offer men something better than that which they possess, even the peace of Christ, which passeth all understanding. We must tell them of God's holy law, the transcript of His character, and an expression of that which He wishes them to become. Show them how infinitely superior to the fleeting joys and pleasures of the world is the imperishable glory of heaven. Tell them of the freedom and rest to be found in the Saviour. \"Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst\" (verse 14), He declared.",
