    "word": "I leave this matter as it now stands; for I am pained beyond measure because our brother's spiritual views are not founded on a solid basis. The man can never be relied upon in the future, unless heart and soul, mind and strength, are entirely changed, revamped. As matters now stand, I can not see how there can be Christian unity between the medical missionary work as led by those in error, and the gospel ministry. There can be no unity without a decided change in the one who has stood as leader of our medical work. If he yields fully, and is born again through the agency of the Holy Spirit, he may have imputed to him the character of Christ. But I can not see any safety in his continuing to bear the responsibilities he has borne, in the supposition that all his ideas are sound, when I know for a certainty that the conditions now existing reveal another state of affairs.",
