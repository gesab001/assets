    "word": "Some have looked upon the medical missionary work with suspicion because of its constantly increasing success. Unless these are baptized with the Holy Spirit they will continue to entertain their jealous feelings, whatever power God may reveal in advancing the truth. They will lose the spiritual blessings they might have had and will bring the divine judgments upon themselves. The truth which is a savor of life unto life, if received, becomes, when rejected, a means of hardening the heart.--Letter 233, 1899. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nMay 9, 1991. Entire Letter.",
