    "word": "25 (1 John 2:1, 2). The Office of the Mirror.--Here is a mirror into which we are to look, and search out every defect of character. But suppose that you look into this mirror and see many defects in your character, and then go away and say, \"I am righteous\"; will you be righteous? In your own eyes you will be righteous and holy. But how will it be at the bar of God? God has given us a rule, and we are to comply with its requirements; if we dare to do otherwise, to trample this under our feet, and then stand up before God and say, \"I am holy, I am holy,\" we shall be lost in the great day of accounts.",
