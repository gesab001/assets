    "word": "The youth who are instructed by those teachers who are not learning in the school of Christ, will seldom rise higher than their teachers. If they should try to rise, they would be repressed and taught to keep their place as subordinates to the will and word of their teachers. Such teachers are accountable to God for the good that they might have done in impressing the minds of their students, but which they did not do because they wished to show themselves wise in clinging to old habits and customs. It is stated in the Old Testament of one, He \"hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel;\" \"therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.\" Christ saw \n                                                                           167\nthat the only hope for the Jews was for them to be decidedly changed, but they would not receive the light, and let the Holy Spirit of God mold and fashion them into a vessel unto honor, and the character they possessed wrought their own ruin.",
