    "word": "Privileges and Duties of Believers \n\n     Every converted soul should labor for unity of spirit and action with the One who prayed that He and His disciples might be one. The followers of Christ do His cause decided injury when they follow the customs and habits of the world. Truth that is not lived, that is not imparted to others, loses its lifegiving power, its healing virtue. Every one must learn to work, and to stand in his place as a burden bearer. Every addition to the church should be one more agency for the carrying out of the great plan of redemption. The entire church, acting as one, blending in perfect union, is to be a living, active missionary agency, moved and controlled by the Holy Spirit. \n\n\n                                     -164-",
