    "word": "But I tell you to build your holy faith on it, because it is the everlasting word of Jehovah. As John has a view of the people of God, he says \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God.\" \"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament\" [Revelation 11:19]. Everyone has his eye directed to the sanctuary where the commandments of God are. Right over the ark of His testament is the mercy seat. Written over the throne of God is His bow of promise. Why, the commandment keeping people, they shall not \n\n\n              -103- \n\nperish, but have everlasting life. Here is the bow of promise. God has covenanted and He will be with His people. How dare any give the trumpet an uncertain sound, as they do when they say Sunday is the Sabbath, when God has not given them one syllable to say so? But He says, \"I will not alter nor change the thing that has gone out of My mouth.\"--Ms. 11, 1893.",
