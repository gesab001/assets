    "word": "\u201cHallowed be Thy name.\u201d Matthew 6:9. \nTo hallow the name of the Lord requires that the words in which we speak of the Supreme Being be uttered with reverence. \u201cHoly and reverend is His name.\u201d Psalm 111:9. We are never in any manner to treat lightly the titles or appellations of the Deity. In prayer we enter the audience chamber of the Most High; and we should come before Him with holy awe. The angels veil their faces in His presence. The cherubim and the bright and holy seraphim approach His throne with solemn reverence. How much more should we, finite, sinful beings, come in a reverent manner before the Lord, our Maker!",
