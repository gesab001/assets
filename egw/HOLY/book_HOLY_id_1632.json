    "word": "There are and ever will be those who do not move wisely, who will, if words of doubt or unbelief are spoken, throw off conviction and choose to follow their own will, and because of their deficiencies Christ has been reproached. Poor, finite mortals have judged the rich and precious outpouring of the Spirit and passed sentence upon it as the Jews passed sentence on the work of Christ. \n                                                                           360\nLest it be understood in every institution in America that it is not commissioned to you to direct the work of the Holy Spirit and to tell how it shall represent itself. You have been guilty in doing this. May the Lord forgive you, is my prayer. Instead of being repressed and driven back, as it has been, the Holy Spirit should be welcomed and its presence encouraged.",
