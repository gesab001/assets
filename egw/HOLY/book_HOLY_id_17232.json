    "word": "Those whom the truth makes free are free indeed. We are not to be under bondage to any man or confederacy of men. We need the guidance of \n\n\n                               -291- \n\nthe Holy Spirit. We have followed man's wisdom long enough. And we can avoid the consequences of following this wisdom, if we choose to follow the Lord now, just now. We need a wisdom greater than the wisdom of man to strengthen the things that remain, that are ready to die.",
