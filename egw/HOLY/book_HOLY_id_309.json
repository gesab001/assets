    "word": "Cares, riches, pleasures, all are used by Satan in playing the game of life for the human soul. The warning is given, \u201cLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\u201d 1 John 2:15, 16. He who reads the hearts of men as an open book says, \u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life.\u201d Luke 21:34. And the apostle Paul by the Holy Spirit writes, \u201cThey that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which, while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\u201d 1 Timothy 6:9, 10.",
