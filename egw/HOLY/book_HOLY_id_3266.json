    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     Jesus prayed for his disciples, \u201cThat they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.\u201d [John 17:21.] Just before, he said, \u201cSanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\u201d [John 17:17.] And he had given them the promise, \u201cWhen he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth.\u201d [John 16:13.] Through the Holy Spirit, Christ will open more clearly to those who will believe on him that which he has inspired holy men to write concerning the truth. And it is thus that the unity for which Christ prayed is to be effected. We are to receive sanctification through obedience to the word and the Spirit of truth.",
