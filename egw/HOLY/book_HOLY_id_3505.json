    "word": "God's faithful witnesses, slain by the blasphemous power that \u201cascendeth out of the bottomless pit,\u201d were not long to remain silent. \u201cAfter three days and a half, the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.\u201d [Revelation 11:11.] It was in 1793 that the decree which prohibited the Bible passed the \n287\nFrench Assembly. Three years and a half later a resolution rescinding the decree, and granting toleration to the Scriptures, was adopted by the same body. The world stood aghast at the enormity of guilt which had resulted from a rejection of the Sacred Oracles, and men recognized the necessity of faith in God and his Word as the foundation of virtue and morality. Saith the Lord, \u201cWhom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.\u201d [Isaiah 37:23.] \u201cTherefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.\u201d [Jeremiah 16:21.]",
