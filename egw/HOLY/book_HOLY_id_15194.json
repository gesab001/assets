    "word": "Here the two parties are plainly brought to view--those who love and fear God, and those who fear Him not. You have been given an exhibition of the two parties. One party is obedient to the holy commandments given by God at the creation of the world and recapitulated from Mount Sinai; the other is disobedient and unholy. God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh day, sanctifying it as a day of rest for the performance of spiritual duties. He set it apart from all other days, establishing it as a memorial of the work of creation. It was to be devoted to Him in spiritual service. This day is a day of God's special appointment. Exodus 31:12-18 gives the charge concerning this day more definitely, and specifies the Sabbath as a sign between God and His people, that they may know by their obedience to the commandments that He is the Lord who sanctifies them.",
