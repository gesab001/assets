    "word": "Christ, the true foundation, is a living stone; His life is imparted to all that are built upon Him. \"Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house.\" \"Each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord.\" 1 Peter 2:5, R.V.; Ephesians 2:21, R.V. The stones became one with the foundation; for a common life dwells in all. That building no tempest can overthrow; for-- \n\n\n     \"That which shares the life of God, \n        With Him surviveth all.\"",
