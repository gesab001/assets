    "word": "The Holy Spirit, that melts and subdues the human heart will lead men to do the works of Christ. They will heed the injunction, \"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not.\" Christ gave Himself for us, and His followers are required to give themselves, with their talents of means and ability, to Him. What more could the Lord do for man than that which He has done? And shall we not render unto \n                                                                           211\nHim all that we have and are, practicing self-sacrifice, and self-denial? If we are the disciples of Christ, it will be made manifest to the world through our love for those for whom He died.",
