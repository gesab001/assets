    "word": "Holy Spirit to be Left Untrammeled. \n\n     Read these scriptures to the people. Read carefully, solemnly, and the Holy Spirit will be by your side, to impress minds as you read them. But do not fail to read with the true sense of the word in your own heart. If God has ever spoken by me, these scriptures mean very much to those who shall hear them.",
