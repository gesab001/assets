    "word": "Communion with Christ--how unspeakably precious! Such communion it is our privilege to enjoy. . . . When the early disciples heard the words of Christ, they felt their need of Him. They sought, they found, they followed Him. They were with Him in the house, at the table, in the closet, in the field. They were with Him as pupils with a teacher, daily receiving from His lips lessons of holy truth. They looked to Him as servants to their master. . . . They served Him cheerfully, gladly.",
