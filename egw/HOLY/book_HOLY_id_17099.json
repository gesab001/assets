    "word": "My brethren and sisters, your talent of means is needed. The Lord grant that you may use it at this time to His name\u2019s glory. Just as long as we drift with the current of the world, we need neither canvas nor oar; our labors begin when we turn to stem the tide. Now, just now, let your works of self-denial testify that you are stemming the current of selfishness. It is the duty of every soul who names the name of Christ to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints. My brethren, yoke up with Christ. He left the royal courts and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might make all humanity partakers of the divine nature, and enable them to escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. He practiced self-denial that He might save perishing souls; his followers are to work His works. Shall we not let the Spirit of Christ take possession of our hearts, that we may be cleansed from every taint of selfishness?\n49\nWhen we allow our lives to be controlled by the Holy Spirit of God, we shall with willing hearts bring our gifts and offerings to Him, that He may use them where they are most needed.",
