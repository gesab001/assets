    "word": "The seed sown by Christ in His mission work with His disciples needed no other evidence than that the words spoken by the disciples found entrance to their minds and hearts, and through these mighty agencies the world was to be convinced of sin. Bear in mind, when heavenly influences came into the heart, all found a field ready to be harvested. Particular fields of labor were opened to be worked, and all found [that] wherever they went in Christ's name, the Holy Spirit opened the hearts and doors for \n\n\n                                    -201- \n\nthe disciples. All were of one mind, and all felt that their resources must be taxed to the utmost of their ability. A work was before them to preach Christ and Him crucified through the whole world. One subject was the theme for all who should work the works of Christ, as His representatives to as many as would believe on Him. They were of one heart and one mind, and daily they were adding new territories as their fields of labor.",
