    "word": "We have little time left in which to perfect the character that God is looking for in His people. Let us make the very best use of our opportunities and capabilities. Let us pledge before God and before our brethren that we will be faithful in the use of our opportunities to do good, and in the use of our words, that the Holy Spirit may work through us to make right impressions upon human minds. God will help all who will make an effort to purify themselves through obedience to the truth.",
