    "word": "\u201cGive, and it shall be given unto you;\u201d for the word of God is \u201ca fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.\u201d The heart that has once tasted the love of Christ, cries out continually for a deeper draught, and as you impart, you will receive in richer and more abundant measure. Every revelation of God to the soul increases the capacity to know and to love. The continual cry of the heart is, \u201cMore of Thee,\u201d and ever the Spirit\u2019s answer is, \u201cMuch more.\u201d For our God delights to do \u201cexceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.\u201d To Jesus, who emptied Himself for the salvation of lost humanity, the Holy Spirit was given without measure. So it will be given to every follower of Christ when the whole heart is surrendered for His indwelling. Our Lord Himself has given the command, \u201cBe filled with the Spirit,\u201d and this command is also a promise of its fulfillment. It was the good pleasure of the Father that in Christ should \u201call the fullness dwell;\u201d and \u201cin him ye are made full.\u201d",
