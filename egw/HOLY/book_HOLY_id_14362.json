    "word": "While Christ unfolded the iniquity and sorrow that must come to His disciples, the persecutions, and the trials they must bear, and the rejection of their testimony, He did not design that they should cloud their lives by looking on the dark side. He assured them that they would not be left alone, but be sustained by His Holy Spirit, which would guide them into all truth. \"The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,\" He said, \"whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you\" (John 14:26). \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak: and He will shew you things to come\" (John 16:12, 13).",
