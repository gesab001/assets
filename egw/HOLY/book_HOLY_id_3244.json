    "word": "There are some who will accept the truth on its merits, even though the one who presents it to them does not rightly represent it in his own character. One who is unsanctified in heart may, to a certain extent, know the truth, although he fails to practice it; he may bring forward sound evidence in its favor, and those whose hearts the Lord has been moving upon by his Holy Spirit, who have been led to hunger and thirst for truth, will, through the influence of the same Spirit, be impressed with the validity of the truth.",
