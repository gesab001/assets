    "word": "Standing under the broad shield of Omnipotence, we do not feel that we are in the minority. God is a majority. . . . We are to consider that Christ has set us to be a light amid the moral darkness of the world. We are not to misinterpret the character of God, we are not to be fretful, to speak out what we think, to blame and criticize and censure others; but we are to let the Holy Spirit fashion the character after the similitude of Christ.",
