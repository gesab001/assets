    "word": "When Saul saw that Samuel came no more to instruct him, he knew that the Lord had rejected him for his wicked course, and his character seemed ever after to be marked with extremes. His servants . . . at times dared not approach him, for he seemed like an insane man, violent and abusive. He often seemed filled with remorse. He was melancholy, and often afraid where there was no danger. . . . He was always full of anxiety, and when in his gloomy moods he wished not to be disturbed, and at times would suffer none to approach him. . . . He would repeat prophetically sayings against himself with distracted energy, even in the presence of his lords and of the people.",
