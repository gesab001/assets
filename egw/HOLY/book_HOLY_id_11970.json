    "word": "The Scriptures were given to men, not in a continuous chain of unbroken utterances, but piece by piece through successive generations, as God in His providence saw a fitting opportunity to impress man at sundry times and divers places. Men wrote as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. There is \"first the bud, then the blossom, and next the fruit,\" \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear\" (Mark 4:28). This is exactly what the Bible utterances are to us.",
