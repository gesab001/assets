    "word": "While you were at Ann Arbor you gained wrong ideas in this respect. It would have been better if those sent from our schools to Ann Arbor had never had any connection with that institution. The education in drug medication and the false religious theories have brought forth a class of practitioners who need to unlearn much they have learned. They need to obtain an altogether different experience before they can say in word and in deed, We are medical missionaries. Till they obtain such an experience, the great Physician does not acknowledge them as medical missionaries. They come onto the platform of action unprepared for the high and holy work which needs to be done at this time.",
