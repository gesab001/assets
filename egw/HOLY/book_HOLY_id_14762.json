I think that if in this our day of test and trial each one of us would study the words Moses was commanded to speak to the people, there would not be in the temple courts those who are in positions of sacred responsibility, yet are weaving into the web of sacred things threads of selfishness, using common fire in the place of the sacred fire of God's own kindling.

Those things of apparently little consequence attract the mind and eye, and absorb the attention at the very time when the attention should be given to God. \n\n\n                                     -116-",
