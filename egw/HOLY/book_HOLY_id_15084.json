    "word": "You are living in hourly contact and conscious communion with the principles of truth and righteousness, and if there is not a corresponding rising in moral and intellectual power, if you do not cooperate with the divine influences, you will become hard and unimpressible. The light will become darkness to you. Your heart must be changed, its principles elevated, and your heart beat and your eye flash in response to the deep, holy principles which your own strenuous efforts may combine with the grace of God implanted in your nature. Your morals then will be sound, your principles firm. In this aim you may be ambitious, for you are drinking from the true source of wisdom and virtue. \n\n\n                                  -259- \n\nBehold in the cross of Christ the only safe and sure path for you to reach true elevation in this life, and the great reward of eternal life.",
