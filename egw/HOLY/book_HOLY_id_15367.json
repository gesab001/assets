    "word": "I am instructed to say to our people throughout the cities of the South, Let everything be done under the direction of the Lord. The work is nearing its close. We are nearer the end than when we first believed. Satan is doing his best to block the way to the progress of the message. He is putting forth efforts to bring about the enactment of a Sunday law, which [if enacted] will result in slavery in the Southern field and will close the door to the observance of the true Sabbath, which God has given to men to keep holy. The law which He came down from heaven to Mount Sinai to proclaim is to be observed \n\n\n                                     -396- \n\nby all who would identify themselves with the people of God. Please read and reread the fourth chapter of Deuteronomy. The whole chapter should be given careful study by those who would be numbered with God's covenant-keeping people.",
