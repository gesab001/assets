    "word": "4-14. The Omnipotence of Jesus.--[Hebrews 1:4-12 quoted.] In this language is represented the omnipotence of the Lord Jesus. He is introduced to the Bible student as the Creator of the world, and was its rightful Ruler. [Hebrews 1:13, 14 quoted.] \n                                                                           922\n {7BC 921.10}  \n     The first chapter of Hebrews contrasts the position of the angels and the position of Christ. God has spoken words concerning Christ that are not to be applied to the angels. They are \"sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation,\" but Christ, as Mediator, is the great Minister in the work of redemption. The Holy Spirit is His representative in our world, to execute the divine purpose of bringing to fallen man power from above, that he may be an overcomer. All who enter into a covenant with Jesus Christ become by adoption the children of God. They are cleansed by the regenerating power of the Word, and angels are commissioned to minister unto them (MS 57, 1907).",
