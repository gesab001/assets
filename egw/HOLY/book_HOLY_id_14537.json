    "word": "My dear Bro. and Sr. Baker, whom I love in the Lord, the Lord will guide you if you will only trust in Him. \n\n\n                               -30- \n\nHe has given you every encouragement to do this. Our youth must not be educated to make finite man their dependence. The first principles of holiness, (wholeness), to God are yet to be learned. God's will and God's way should be made our will and our way. There is not one rule for the supposed superior and another for the inferior; one way for the supposed lordly, and another for the more humble. Keeping the commandments of God means more than we are inclined to suppose. Of those who would find peace it is said, \"They shall keep the way of the Lord; then peace and holy joy will be theirs.\"-- Letter 8, 1895. (Written to Brother and Sister [W.L.H.] Baker, North American workers in Australia, probably from Sunnyside, Cooranbong, N.S.W.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. August 4, 1983",
