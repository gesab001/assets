    "word": "The Holy Spirits presence and power in the hearts of the professed people of God is their only hope in these last days of peril. Let not the impression be given to any minds that there is in human nature a power to work out its purity, and develop a beautiful character, for this is not true. This is Satan's fallacy, \"Without me,\" said Christ, \"Ye can do nothing.\" The completeness of man is in Christ Jesus. The reason why Seventh Day Adventists have not more power is that many of them have got above the simplicity of the work. They plan and execute without God. The Lord is ready to give us light; he is to shine before the world. \"There is no searching of his understanding.\" But men darken counsel by words without knowledge.",
