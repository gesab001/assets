    "word": "Students, you can make this school first class in success by being laborers together with your teachers to help other students, and by zealously uplifting yourself from a cheap, common low standard. Let each see what improvement he can make in conforming his conduct to Bible rules. Those who will seek to be themselves elevated and ennobled are co-operating with Jesus Christ by becoming refined in speech and in temper, under the control of the Holy Spirit. They are yoked up with Jesus Christ. They will not flounce about, and become unruly, and self-caring, studying their own selfish pleasures and satisfaction. They bound all their efforts with Jesus Christ as the messengers of His mercy and to be ministering to others of His grace.",
