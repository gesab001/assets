    "word": "Will you not bind yourself up with God. Waste not your physical and mental powers in inaction. Let your example be a constant reminder of what God requires from every steward of means and of ability. Faith and prayer will do everything for you. May the Lord move upon you by his Holy Spirit. Arise and shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.--Letter 79, 1898, pp. 4, 6, 8, 9. (To Harmon Lindsay, Oct. 3, 1898.)",
