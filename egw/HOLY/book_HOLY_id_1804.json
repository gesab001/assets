    "word": "After Some Hesitancy a Response.--I spoke in the afternoon [at Stanley, Virginia] from John 17:3. The Lord gave me much of His Holy Spirit. The house was full. I called those forward who wished to seek the Lord more earnestly and for those who wished to give themselves to the Lord a whole sacrifice. For a time not one made a move, but after a while many came forward and bore testimonies of confession. We had a precious season of prayer and all felt broken down, weeping and confessing their sins. Oh, that each may understand!  (diary, Nov. 9, 1890).--1SM 145, 146.",
