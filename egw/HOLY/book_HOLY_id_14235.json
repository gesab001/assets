    "word": "The true Christian draws his motives for action from his deep love for his Redeemer. His affection for his Master is true and holy. And it is the cheerful, lovable Christian of whom Christ says, \"Ye are my witnesses\" (Isaiah 43:10). Such a man is Christ's representative, for he reflects Christ in his daily life. It is when he recedes from the light that he cannot diffuse its bright beams to others.--Manuscript 16, 1897, p. 4. (\"Principles of Education,\" March 25, 1897.)",
