    "word": "There are many ways in which we can work to reach those not of our faith. If the work of temperance were carried forward by us as it was commenced thirty years ago, if we at our camp meetings held up before the hundreds and thousands who assemble on the ground the evils of intemperance in eating and drinking, and especially the evil of liquor-drinking, if these truths were presented in connection with the evidences of Christ's soon coming, there would be a shaking among the people. If we showed a zeal proportionate to the importance of the truths we are handling we would reach hundreds. We need to trim our lamps and receive in them the holy oil from the two olive branches. When the power of the Spirit of God rests upon us, there will be an altogether different showing for our labors from that now seen.",
