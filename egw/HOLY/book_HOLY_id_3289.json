    "word": "Jesus is the foundation, the author and the finisher, of our faith. Why are we so powerless? \n468\nJesus lives; and because he lives, we shall live also. He is to us a risen Saviour; not a shrouded Saviour in Joseph's new tomb, which was closed with a great stone and sealed with the Roman seal. Mourn not as those who are hopeless and helpless; never, under any circumstances, give way to despair; but from grateful hearts, from lips touched with holy fire, let the glad song ring out, \u201cJesus is risen; he lives to make intercession for us.\u201d Grasp this hope, and it will hold the soul like a sure, tried anchor. Believe, and thou shalt \u201csee the glory of God.\u201d [John 11:40.]",
