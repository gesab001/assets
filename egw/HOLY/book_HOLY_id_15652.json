    "word": "Here are the words of David, \"It is time for Thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law\" (Psalms 119:126). David refers to the last days, the very time when we are to know and be sanctified by the truth. We must cling to the truth. We must not let go the truth for friend or foe. There is a time coming when there will be great tribulation, such as never was or ever will be. Men will come claiming to be Christ. And here is a class that say, \"I am sinless, I am holy.\" I have never heard one claim that who was not a sinner. They are not doers of the Word.",
