    "word": "The importance of seeking a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures can hardly be estimated. \"Given by inspiration of God,\" able to make us \"wise unto salvation,\" rendering the man of God \"perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works\" (2 Timothy 3:15-17), the Bible has the highest claim to our reverent attention. We should not be satisfied with a superficial knowledge, but should seek to learn the full meaning of the words of truth, to drink deep of the spirit of the Holy Oracles.",
