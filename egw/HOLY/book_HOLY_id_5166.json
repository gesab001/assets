    "word": "A Perfect Guide \n\n     The Bible presents a perfect standard of character. This sacred book, inspired by God, and written by holy men, is a perfect guide under all circumstances of life. It sets forth distinctly the duties of both young and old. If made the guide of life, its teachings will lead the soul upward. It will elevate the mind, improve the character, and give peace and joy to the heart. But many of the young have chosen to be their own counselor and guide, and have taken their cases in their own hands. Such need to study more closely the teachings of the Bible. In its pages they will find revealed their duty to their parents and to their brethren in the faith. The fifth commandment reads, \"Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" Again we read, \"Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right.\"",
