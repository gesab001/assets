    "word": "Those who came forth after the resurrection of Jesus appeared to many, telling them that the sacrifice\n234\nfor man was completed, that Jesus, whom the Jews crucified, had risen from the dead; and in proof of their words they declared, \"We be risen with Him.\" They bore testimony that it was by His mighty power that they had been called forth from their graves. Notwithstanding the lying reports circulated, the resurrection of Christ could not be concealed by Satan, his angels, or the chief priests; for this holy company, brought forth from their graves, spread the wonderful, joyful news; also Jesus showed Himself to His sorrowing, heartbroken disciples, dispelling their fears and causing them joy and gladness.",
