They are to be judged according to the deeds done in the body.  You only need to pity and pray for them.  The Lord knows every dishonest transaction, and will award them according as their work shall be.  The Lord rewards every unselfish action.  Pray with heart and soul and voice, \"O God, impress more deeply upon my mind and heart the principles of thy holy law, which is the transcript of thy character.  Let me by faith grasp the exceeding great and precious promises, that I may not in my duty and work fail or be discouraged, but perfect holiness in thy fear.\"--Letter 178, 1899, p. 9 (Nov. 6, 1899).",
