We desired to reach home last evening, but made a mistake in regard to the train connections and left Mountain View on a train that went one hour after the one we should have taken. We were obliged to wait four hours in San Jose and one hour at Niles; and when we reached Oakland, the train for St. Helena was gone, so we were obliged to spend the night in Oakland\u2026.",
