LUTHER SAYS THAT \"THE BIBLE MUST BE STUDIED; TEACHERS MUST BE PROVIDED; SCHOOLS MUST BE ESTABLISHED.\" \"HE FELT THAT TO STRENGTHEN THE REFORMATION IT WAS REQUISITE TO WORK ON THE YOUNG, TO IMPROVE SCHOOLS, AND TO PROPAGATE THROUGH CHRISTENDOM THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY FOR A PROFOUND STUDY OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES. THIS, ACCORDINGLY, WAS ONE OF THE OBJECTS OF HIS LIFE; HE SAW IT IN PARTICULAR AT THE PERIOD WHICH WE HAVE REACHED, AND WROTE TO THE COUNCILORS OF ALL THE CITIES OF GERMANY CALLING ON THEM TO FOUND CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS.\"--D'AUBIGNE'S \"HISTORY OF THE REFORMATION,\" BK. 10, CHAP. 9.",
