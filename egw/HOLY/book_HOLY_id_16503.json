    "word": "Such missionary work will furnish the churches with a sure, solid foundation, a foundation having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. God will be glorified in his people. Christian missions will be built upon Jesus Christ. Under the supervision of God the work will go forward, and innumerable evidences will be given of the genuineness of the work. The workers will not seek to glorify themselves or any human being, but will praise God as the Designer and Organizer of every holy, ennobling work. They not only profess to be believers, but are believers. They are sanctified by the truth; for truth acted as well as preached has a purifying influence upon the character. \n                                                                           1722",
