    "word": "In our Publishing Institutions Christianity is sick, and needs a physician. Who shall heal her? There must be a reformation. Sentiments and practice that have been gaining a hold and strengthening must be put away forever. Righteous principles must be revived. Again and again the Holy Spirit has wrought among you, but by many it was dismissed as an unwelcome guest. Christ's work of purification is to begin at the heart, for the improvement of the whole character of the human agent. Amid the moral darkness, there must be a regenerative, reformative influence at work, in order that sacred things may be kept sacred. The Lord will not be trifled with. He will test and try his people; he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather his wheat into his garner. \n                                                 Ellen G. White.",
