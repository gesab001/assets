    "word": "We have a great work to perform for the Master. After Jesus has sacrificed so much in our behalf, giving His life for our salvation, shall we by our course of action make Him ashamed of us? . . . He desires to see us rise to the highest standard. When by living faith we lay hold of the power of a living Christ; when we plead His unfailing promises, and claim them as ours; when we seek for the power of the Holy Spirit, we are eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God.--Manuscript 77, June 7, 1902, a sermon given at the Petaluma, California, campground, \"Lessons From the Second Chapter of Peter.\"",
