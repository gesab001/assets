    "word": "Will not our ministers wrestle in earnest prayer for the holy unction, that they may not bring unimportant, unessential things into their labor at this important time? Let them not bring into their ministerial labors only that which can be heard in any of the denominational churches. Let them ever keep an uplifted Saviour before their hearers, in order to prevent their converts from attaching themselves to the man, to bear his mold, and copy his ways in their manner of conversation and conduct.",
