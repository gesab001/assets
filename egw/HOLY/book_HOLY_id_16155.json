    "word": "\"Well,\" says one, \"I will let go. I will step out, and someone else can come in my place.\" Better not do this unless you have fully decided that you will not maintain a close connection with God.

It will not do to depend on your finite wisdom, for you have a limited experience at best, and do not know half as much in regard to the safe and wise management of the work in your hands as you think you do.",
