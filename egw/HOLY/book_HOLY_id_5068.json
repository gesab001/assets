    "word": "Our Needs to Be Presented \n\n     We are to do special work for those who are in high positions of trust. The Lord calls upon those to whom He has entrusted His goods, to use in His service their talents of intellect and of means. Some will be impressed by the Holy Spirit to invest the Lord's means in a way that will advance His work. They will fulfill His purpose by helping to create centers of influence in our large cities. Our workers should represent before these men a plain statement of our needs. Let them know what we need in order to help the poor and needy, and to establish the work on a firm basis.--MS. 79, 1900.",
