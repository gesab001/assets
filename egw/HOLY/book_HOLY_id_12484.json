    "word": "The glorious, sanctifying truths of the Bible have been left in the outer court. The truths of eternal interest that should govern and control the life, are considered by many altogether too sublime for common life. But it is essential that the great and grand truth,--the imparting of the Holy Spirit, should be brought into contact with, and impregnate little things, and supply the powerful motive to holiness, and lay out in clear lines, broad principles for the regulation of the character and conduct of every day, revealing Christ to the world. The purification of the sinner through the atoning sacrifice of the Son of God, means much more than the finite minds of many can seem to grasp. This is because the words, the spirit, the mind, and heart are all bound down to earthliness and to sensuality, which is a controlling power in the bed-chamber, where there should be pure and holy aspirations after God. The Holy Spirit will not contaminate its purity by associating with impurity, and Christ says, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" Unless the Holy Spirit is with the worker, his efforts are without avail. Why! Have we not had the most ennobling, elevating truths? What more can we have than that we have had? And they are presented to us in the simplest form, that the ignorant and unlearned may grasp them.",
