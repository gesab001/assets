    "word": "Christ represents Himself as sustaining the same tender relation to us that a father sustains to his children. \"What man is there of you,\" He inquires, \"whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\" He is willing to give the Holy Spirit to everyone who asks in faith. Why are we so weak, so faithless? Why do we cherish defects of character? Why do we not always come to our heavenly Father, to ask in simple, childlike faith for the things that we need?",
