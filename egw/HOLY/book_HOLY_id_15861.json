    "word": "[Turning to Brother Harmon]: Brother Harmon, we know what it meant to push the triumphs of the cross in the early days of the message. Now, disease is upon you, but God is helping you.

We praise the Lord for His goodness, His lovingkindness.-- Ms 8, 1894 (MR 900.44). \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. July, 1986. Entire Ms.",
