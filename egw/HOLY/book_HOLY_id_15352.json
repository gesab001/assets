    "word": "MR No. 1494 - Ministering in Washington and Oregon; Deep Movings of the Holy Spirit\n\n     (Written June 27, 1884, from East Portland, Oregon, to Elder Uriah Smith.) \n\n\n     There is a matter that must have attention. There is a man by the name of J. V. Bunch laboring in the Missouri Conference. He is preaching. This man has no right to be engaged in this work at all. I fear he will leave a terrible stain upon the cause of God. I have been shown some things in regard to him which are of that character that make him unworthy of confidence as a Christian. I do not know whom to write to, but I thought you might know who are the proper ones to be entrusted with this matter. But something ought to be done.",
