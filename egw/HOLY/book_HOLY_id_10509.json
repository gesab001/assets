    "word": "There should be no strife, no envyings, no seeking for supremacy. The work is sacred and holy, and God forbid that you should give to those for whom you labour an example of coldness, selfishness, and avarice. If your work has been done in human wisdom, it will bear your mould, it is marred in your hands. Your work is of an exalted character, and should not be in any way so marred as to make it unacceptable and unattractive. Your discourses must be followed by a holy life. Precious lessons of love, confidence, respect for one another, must be given both in and out of the desk. You must live that which you teach. As labourers together with God, you must first come close to one another, for God's instruments must not work at cross purposes. Constantly educate yourselves to be one, as Christ was one with the Father, each improving his entrusted talents.",
