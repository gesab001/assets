    "word": "In the Word of God a high standard is presented for our attainment. If our natural temperaments are under control, if we are guided by the Holy Spirit, we shall follow a plain \"Thus saith the Lord.\" We shall seek diligently to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. We have no time to spend in trifling and frivolous matters.",
