    "word": "Here the Son comes into our world to practice self-denial, and although His own nation did not receive Him He was the infinite Son of God. He was working for the uplifting of the human race. How much does God value man? I point you to Calvary. [The] most ignominious death my Lord suffered that He might rescue you, yet He does not force any of you to serve Him. He does not force the will or conscience of any soul. God has given Jesus to our world and He wants us to search the Scriptures. He can put His Holy Spirit upon us and He says, \"I am at thy right hand \n\n\n                -106- \n\nto uphold thee\"--to walk with our hand in the hand of Jesus Christ, to love Him and to glorify Him. His love is without a parallel. No comparison can be made to that love. He was one with the Father and was suffered to die for us.",
