    "word": "The question is sometimes asked, \"Why, if we have the truth, do we not see a greater manifestation of the Spirit of God?\" God cannot reveal Himself till those who profess to be Christians are doers of His word in their private lives, till there is oneness with Christ, a sanctification of body, soul, and spirit. Then they will be fit temples for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.--Letter 139, 1898, pp. 2, 3, 12. (To A. T. Jones, Dec. 16, 1898.)",
