    "word": "At one time I had drawn all that I had in the bank here. But Sara had some money in the bank, and she allowed me to draw on her account to meet running expenses. I shall have to borrow some money somewhere unless I receive some soon. But though no money comes to me, I praise the Lord for His blessings.

The Lord is good, and we will honor Him by praising His holy name.",
