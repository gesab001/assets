    "word": "Christ has left His peace as His legacy to His church. \"These things have I spoken unto you,\" He said, \"being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid\" [John 14:25-27]. The comfort that Christ gave to His disciples in that trying hour was that they should be under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.",
