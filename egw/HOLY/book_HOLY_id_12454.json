    "word": "\"Let every soul bear in mind the words of Jesus. 'Without me ye can do nothing.' We are wholly dependent upon the Holy Spirit for fitness to do the Master's work; we must rely upon Him for Christian fortitude, perseverance, and grace. 'By their fruits ye shall know them.' Your words, your character, your conduct, your spirit reveal the character of the tree, for these are the fruits you bear. The sinful nature is to be kept under the control of the Spirit of God. The transforming grace of Christ will bring the will into harmony with the will of Christ. The more closely we are brought into unity with Christ, the more clearly we shall discern the defects of our character. It is marvelous how deceptive is the human heart, how easily self-deluded, how easily led into sin. Be jealous of yourself, never become puffed up, never flatter yourself or accept flattering from any man or women. When persons attempt to flatter you, tell them they are giving voice to the temptations of Satan.",
