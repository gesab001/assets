    "word": "If we only had devoted, spiritually-minded workers connected with our important institutions, who relied upon God more than upon themselves, we might certainly look for far greater prosperity than we have had hitherto. But where there is a decided want of humble trust, and of an entire dependence upon God, we are sure of nothing. Our great need today is men who are baptized with the Holy Spirit of God. Men who walk with God as did Enoch; men who are not so narrow in their outlook that they will bind about the work in place of enlarging it; men who will not say, \"Business is business, religion is religion.\" We need men who can take in the situation; men who are far seeing; men who can reason from cause to effect.",
