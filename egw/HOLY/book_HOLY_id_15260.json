    "word": "Men may understand this if they will study deeply. Pray for the Holy Spirit to melt and subdue the proud, self-sufficient heart. If you ever shed tears, weep now; for Christ's sake weep over your self-sufficient estimate of your own capabilities. When you come to God in lowliness of mind, with heart renewed and cleansed, you will bless and glorify Him that you have learned of Jesus His mercy, the truth which so many have had to learn through His judgment. Those who walk in pride and self-sufficiency God is able to abase. Man will learn that the heavens do rule, and how mighty is our wonder-working God. He will surely control matters after His order and will, if you will only place yourselves under His rule.",
