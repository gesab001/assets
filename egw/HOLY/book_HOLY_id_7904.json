    "word": "This rule forbids all oppression from parents and all disobedience from children. The Lord is full of lovingkindness, mercy, and truth. His law is holy, just, and good, and must be obeyed by parents and children. The rules which should regulate the lives of parents and children flow from a heart of infinite love, and God's rich blessing will rest upon those parents who administer His law in their homes, and upon the children who obey this law. The combined influence of mercy and justice is to be felt. \"Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.\" Households under this discipline will walk in the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.",
