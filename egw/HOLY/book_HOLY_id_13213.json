    "word": "Bro. Gage's religious experience was not sound. He moved from impulse, not from principle. His heart was not right with God, and he did not have the fear of God and his glory before him. He acted very much like a man engaged in common business. He had but very little sense of the sacredness of the work in which he was engaged. He had not practiced self-denial and economy, therefore he had no experience in this. At times he labored earnestly, and manifested a good interest in the work. Then again he would be careless of his time, and spend precious moments in unimportant conversation, hindering others from doing their duty, and setting an example to others of recklessness and unfaithfulness. The work of God is sacred and holy, and calls for men of lofty integrity. Men are wanted who have a sense of justice, even in the smallest matters, that will not allow them to make entries of their time that are not minute and correct. \n                                                                           30\nMen that will have a sense that they are handling means that belong to God, and who would not unjustly appropriate one cent to their own use. Men who will be just as faithful and exact, careful and diligent in their labor, in the absence of their employer, as in his presence, proving by their faithfulness that they are not eye-servants, not merely men-pleasers, but conscientious, faithful, true workmen, doing right, not for human praise, but because they love and choose the right from a high sense of their obligation to God.",
