    "word": "The people of God can be united only through the power of the Holy Ghost, and this is the union which will stand the test. Christ prayed that His people might be one as He and the Father were one; but can this union exist, can spiritual life be maintained, if you fail to associate with those of like precious faith in close Christian fellowship and devotion? If you think you can live a Christian life without taking advantage of Christian privileges, you are deceived by the enemy of your soul. I am terribly in earnest to cry aloud and spare not, and show my people their transgression and the house of Jacob their sins.",
