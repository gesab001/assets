    "word": "Nothing will move us if the mind is stayed on God. You must be calm. A disturbed mind cannot enjoy the peace of Christ Jesus. You are surrounded with token after token of the working of the Holy Spirit in behalf of God's cause. The enemy has worked through some to block your way, but the Lord has worked to make this of the greatest advantage to you. You have obtained an experience in preaching the Word and in laboring together with God. The Lord desires you to understand that He has preserved you as you have labored in the Southern field.",
