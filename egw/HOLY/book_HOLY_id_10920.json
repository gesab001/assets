    "word": "Let us believe the Word. He who thus eats the bread of heaven is nourished every day and will know what these words mean, \"Needeth not that any man teach you.\" We have lessons pure from the lips of Him who owns us, who has bought us with the price of His own blood. The precious Word of God is a solid foundation upon which to build. When men come to you with their suppositions, tell them that the Great Teacher has left you His Word, which is of incalculable value, that He has sent a Comforter in His own name, even the Holy Ghost. \"He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you\" (John 14:26). . . .",
