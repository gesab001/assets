    "word": "Pray, brethren, for the Holy Spirit. Give up your own will, every desire to dominate; expel pride from the natural stubborn heart. Then we will, as church members, love as brethren, kindly, courteously. The love of Christ in the heart will expel evil speech, and as you do good to others, you will meet with the approval of Christ. Abase yourselves in the sight of God, and the Lord will lift you up.",
