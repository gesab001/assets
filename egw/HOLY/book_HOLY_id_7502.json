    "word": "28-31. Nothing to Commend.--Christ did not condemn the first son for refusing the command. At the same time He did not commend him. The class who act the part of the son who said, \"I will not,\" deserve no credit for holding the position they do. This open frankness is not to be commended as a virtue. This openness of character, sanctified by truth and holiness will make bold witnesses for Christ; but used as it is by the sinner it is insulting and defiant, and approaches to blasphemy. Because a man is not a hypocrite he is none the less a sinner. When the appeals of the Holy Spirit come to the heart our only safety lies in responding to them without delay (MS 127, 1899).",
