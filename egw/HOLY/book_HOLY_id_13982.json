    "word": "We have a testing message for our world, and we should present the truth as it is in Jesus, and your life as hid with Christ in God. You do not present yourself, but the presence and preciousness of truth is so large, why it is so far-reaching, so deep, so broad, that self is lost sight of. It is not flowery discourses that we want, not a great flood of words that do not mean anything. Preach so that the people can catch hold of big ideas, and dig out the precious ore hid in the Scriptures. The Bible is its own interpreter. We are to hide ourselves in Jesus. It is not our education that is to do the work; let the Holy Spirit of God come to hearts. Some who do not understand the truth may be inclined to ridicule it. We know we have the arguments of truth to handle, and we shall have to meet ridicule and opposition, but can we afford to put on that armor of ridicule and sarcasm as we go to proclaim the sacred truth? We cannot afford to use these weapons. Speak out calmly and distinctly, for Christ's sake. We want our discourses mixed with faith. You want to put on the whole armor of God, and be clad with His Spirit, and have His righteousness to go before you, and the glory of the Lord to be your rereward. When you go forward in this way, just so surely will the whole universe of heaven be engaged with working upon the people, that [it] will astonish you, as you had it here. Just as soon as you have the meekness and lowliness of Christ, then the Lord Jesus has His heavenly intelligences working with human agents. A Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God alone giveth the increase.",
