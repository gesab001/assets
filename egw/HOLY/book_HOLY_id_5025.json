    "word": "Not a thread of selfishness is to be drawn into the web. But this has been done, and will continue to be done unless God's professing people receive the new heart that makes the actions holy. Unless they reform, unless their characters are changed, they will be left outside the City of God; for within its gates can enter nothing that defiles. Only those who are without spot or wrinkle or any such thing will pass in the grand review. Unholy ambition will prove the ruin of many souls. This is the word that I am instructed to give to all who claim to believe present truth.",
