    "word": "Why, my dear brother, Jesus lives to make intercession for you.... If we sin, \"we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous\" (1 John 2:1). The pitying love of God is extended to us in all our wants and in all our imperfections. Jesus loves you, and do respond to that love by cheerfully trusting in Him. Put away from you all sins which would grieve and wound the Saviour. Seek to imitate His holy life and spotless character. . . . But ample provisions have been made by the dear Saviour to purify, to cleanse from all sins, and by His grace to remedy the defects in our character by imputing unto us His righteousness.",
