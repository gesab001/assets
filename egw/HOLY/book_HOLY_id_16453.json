    "word": "The light which God has been pleased to give me upon matters relating to his work, I cannot now fail to understand too distinctly; for the things which I have been shown have become realities. I presented no false vision before the men in Battle Creek when I said that some were handling responsibilities which they were not fitted to undertake. When men like A.R. Henry and Harmon Lindsay refuse to be worked by the Holy Spirit, and yet consent to accept important responsibilities, Satan takes possession of their minds, and plans and devises for them. When these men entered upon this work, they did not foresee the results, but step by step has been taken under the generalship of Satanic agencies, who knew from the beginning what the results would be. \n                                                                           1578\nHad they kept in touch with the divine character, they would not have done the work they have done, but while at Minneapolis they both closed their eyes to the light, and padlocked their hearts against evidence, in order that the Holy Spirit might not find entrance; and their course has testified to the result.",
