    "word": "I thank God that the light has come to this place. Although it may seem that you are all alone here, yet you are not alone; for Christ is with you; you are in blessed company. You have the words coming down the line from prophets and apostles, to encourage you to steadfastness. Many of these holy men lost their lives for their faithfulness to God. If you suffer for the truth's sake, remember that this is no more than others have done before you. What trials and afflictions Paul endured, yet he says: \u201cOur light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.\u201d",
