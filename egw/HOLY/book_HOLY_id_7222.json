    "word": "Press Together! Press Together! \n\n     Suppose we try daily to have our hearts united in the bonds of Christian love. \"I have somewhat against thee,\" says the True Witness, \"because thou hast left thy first love\" (Revelation 2:4). And He says, \"Except thou repent,\" \"I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place\" (Revelation 2:5). Why?--Because in our separation from one another we are separated from Christ. We want to press together. Oh, how many times, when I have seemed to be in the presence of God and holy angels, I have heard the angel voice saying, \"Press together, press together, press together. Do not let Satan cast his hellish shadow between brethren. Press together; in unity there is strength.\"",
