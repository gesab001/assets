    "word": "The work of our personal salvation also depends upon our cooperation with the divine agencies. God has imparted to us moral powers and religious susceptibilities. He has given His Son as a propitiation for our sins, that we might be reconciled to God. Jesus lived a life of self-denial and sacrifice, that we might follow His example. He has given the Holy Spirit to be in Christ's stead in every place where help is needed. He employs the heavenly intelligences to bring divine power to combine with our human efforts. But we must accept the gift of God, we must repent, and believe in Christ. We must watch, we must pray, we must obey the requirements of God. We must practice self-denial and self-sacrifice for Christ's sake. We must grow up into Christ by constant connection with Him.

This is why the Lord forbade His people to form any alliance with the heathen, \"lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee\" (Exodus 34:12). He said, \"They will turn away thy son from following me\" (Deuteronomy 7:4). And the same principle applies to the association of Christians with the ungodly.",
