    "word": "\"Those who daily consecrate themselves to God, and endeavor to hold up the hands of those who bear responsibilities, will be blessed of Heaven. We are engaged in a great work, and Satan will use all his power to win to his side the very men and women who could cooperate with God in doing a precious work if they were cleansed, sanctified, and guided by the Holy Spirit, if they had warm, true hearts of tender love and gave due respect to those whom God has appointed to carry on a great and important work. The men engaged in the Master's service have often been wounded by those who think and speak evil and create feelings of distrust and jealousy which should not be tolerated or kept alive by unsanctified tongues.\"",
