    "word": "But God looked down upon our earth, and seeing that the time had come, Christ the King of glory was born a helpless babe in Bethlehem. He who is from everlasting, and who is enshrouded in light unapproachable, He who fills all heaven with the train of His glory, looks upon sin as the only hateful thing that there is in our world, and yet He consented that His only begotten Son, sinless and holy, should take the sin of the world upon Himself.",
