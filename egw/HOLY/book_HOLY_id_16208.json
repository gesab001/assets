Olsen\n\n                                                               Lt 19d, 1892 \n\n                      The Need for Love in the Church, \n            and an Appeal to Heed the Message to the Laodiceans \n\n\n          (Written September 1, 1892, from North Fitzroy, Victoria, to O. A. Olsen, president of the General Conference.) \n\n\n     We are certainly living amid the perils of the last days, and, while we may intellectually accept the theory of the truth, it will be of no saving value to us unless the prayer of Christ avails in our behalf, \"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\" The meaning of that prayer is, Make them holy through the knowledge of the Word. \"The light (Christ) shineth in darkness (the world), and the darkness comprehended it not.\" Instead of welcoming that which scatters the darkness, many comprehended it not and received it not.",
