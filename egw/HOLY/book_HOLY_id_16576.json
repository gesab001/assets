    "word": "If the Lord's workers take up lines of work which crowd out that which should be done by them in communicating light to the world, God does not receive through their labors the glory that should accrue to His holy name. When God calls a man to do a certain work in His cause He does not also lay upon him burdens that other men can and should bear. The Lord does not want the minds of His responsible men strained to the utmost point of endurance by taking up many lines of work. All these lines may be essential: but God apportions to every man his duty according to his wisdom. If the worker does not take up his appointed work, that which the Lord sees is the very thing he is fitted to do, he is neglecting duties which, if properly executed, would result in the promulgation of the truth, and would prepare men for the great crisis before us.",
