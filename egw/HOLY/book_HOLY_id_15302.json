    "word": "The youth of today have not obtained that education and training that will lead them to put on the whole armor of God, and be able to resist temptation, depending upon the Holy Spirit to strengthen and empower them to fight manfully the battles of the Lord. They have formed the habit of working to do something to uplift themselves, and thus they are left to their own strength. Their words, their spirit, their actions, are not after the likeness of Christ. Self, self, self, is revealed in everything they are connected with, and the Lord says of them: \"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of My mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not \n\n\n                                     -201- \n\nappear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.\"",
