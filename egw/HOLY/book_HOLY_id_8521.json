    "word": "\"He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.\" [Proverbs 28:13.] If those who hide and excuse their faults could see how Satan exults over them how he taunts Christ and holy angels with them, they would make haste to confess their sins and to put them away. Satan is continually seeking to deceive the followers of Christ with his fatal sophistry that their defective traits of character render it impossible for them to overcome. But Jesus pleads in their behalf his wounded hands, his bruised body; and he declares to all who would follow him, \"My grace is sufficient for thee.\" \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" [Matthew 11:29, 30.] Let none, then, regard their defects as incurable. God will give faith and grace to overcome them.",
