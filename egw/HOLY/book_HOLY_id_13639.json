    "word": "Oh, that now, while it is called today, you would turn to the Lord! Your every deed is making you either better or worse. If your actions are on Satan's side, they leave behind them an influence that continues to work its baleful results. Only the pure, the clean, and the holy can enter the city of God. \"Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,\" but turn to the Lord, that the path you travel may not leave desolation in its track.--Letter 15a, 1896, pp. 1-8. (To Burr Corliss, April 14, 1896.)",
