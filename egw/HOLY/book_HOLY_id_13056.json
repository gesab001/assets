    "word": "How few realize that Jesus, unseen, is walking by their side! How ashamed many would be to hear his voice speaking to them, and to know that he heard all their foolish, common talk! And how many hearts would burn with holy joy if they only knew that the Saviour was by their side, that the holy atmosphere of his presence was surrounding them, and they were feeding on the bread of life! How pleased the Saviour would be to hear his followers talking of his precious lessons of instruction, and to know that they had a relish for holy things! When the truth abides in the heart, there is no place for criticism of God's servants, or for picking flaws with the message he sends. That which is in the heart will flow from the lips. It cannot be repressed. The things that God has prepared for those that love him, will be the theme of conversation. The love of Christ is in the soul as a well of water, springing up into everlasting life, sending forth living streams, that bring life and gladness wherever they flow. \n                                                                -",
