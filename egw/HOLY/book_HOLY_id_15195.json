    "word": "Reformation that is not genuine is of no avail in the saving of the soul. Men must obey a \"Thus saith the Lord,\" by doing His commandments. The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, and man has no moral right to dishonor it by failing to do upon it the work which he should do. God has set this day apart for His honor and glory. No manner of worldly business should be done on it. This is God's time. For man to steal the Lord's day and use it for self-serving is exceedingly offensive to God. \"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me, . . . even this whole nation.\" Yes, the whole world is guilty before God of appropriating His holy day for self-pleasing. Men have insulted God by accepting as holy a common working day. Nothing can put the stamp of the man of sin so definitely upon the world as the acceptance of the spurious sabbath, while the day God has set apart is trampled under foot.",
