    "word": "We had in the forenoon a conversation with Brother Daniel Bourdeau. Elder Whitney, Elder Lane, W. C. White, and Brother Bourdeau's wife were present. I was compelled to bear a testimony of reproof, not pleasant for me but very grievous. May the Lord set home this testimony. I believe that Satan has been repulsed and that the Lord will give Brother Bourdeau the victory--the conviction through His Holy Spirit of his mistakes. We sought the Lord in earnest prayer. We presented the whole matter of our difficulties before Him who cannot err. He knoweth all our perplexities, and we believe He did hear us and will take this case of painful difficulties in His own hands.",
