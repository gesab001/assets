    "word": "Holy men of old looked forward to the advent of the Messiah in glory, as the consummation of their hope. Enoch, only the seventh in descent from them that dwelt in Eden, he \n14\nwho for three centuries on earth walked with his God, was permitted to behold from afar the coming of the Deliverer. \u201cBehold,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all.\u201d Jude 14, 15. The patriarch Job in the night of his affliction exclaimed with unshaken trust: \u201cI know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: . . . in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.\u201d Job 19:25-27.\u2014GC 299.",
