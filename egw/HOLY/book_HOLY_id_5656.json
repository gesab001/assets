    "word": "The sacred temple of the body must be kept pure and uncontaminated, that God\u2019s Holy Spirit may dwell therein. We need to guard faithfully the Lord\u2019s property, for any abuse of our powers shortens the time that our lives could be used for the glory of God. Bear in mind that we must consecrate all\u2014soul, body, and spirit\u2014to God. All is His purchased possession, and must be used intelligently, to the end that we may preserve the talent of life. By properly using our powers to their fullest extent in the most useful employment, by keeping every organ in health, by so preserving every organ that mind, sinew, and muscle shall work harmoniously, we may do the most precious service for God.",
