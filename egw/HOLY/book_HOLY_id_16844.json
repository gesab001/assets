    "word": "Let all who have any connection with the schools already established be firm and determined, in the strength of Him who has paid the ransom for their souls to be faithful servants in the cause of Christ, to help their fellow students to be faithful, pure, and holy in life and character. Let everyone who loves God seek to win those who have not confessed Christ to do this without delay. A silent, prayerful interest may be manifest every day. The very best experience in missionary lines may be gained by thus co-operating with Jesus, the missionary in chief to our world. Let every soul grow in excellence of character, in devotion, in purity, in holiness, exercising aright every God-given ability, that the enemies of our faith shall not triumph, that those in open rebellion against God shall not mold and fashion the characters of His children. Let the influence of the sons and daughters of God, united by the bonds of holy faith, be wholly on the Lord's side. Give evidence that you have a living connection with God, and that you are ambitious, for the Master's glory, to cultivate every grace of character. May the love of Christ constrain all to help their associates, by their love and sympathy, to walk in the heavenly way, the path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in.",
