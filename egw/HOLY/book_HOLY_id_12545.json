    "word": "In the plan of restoring in men the divine image, it was provided that the Holy Spirit should move upon human minds, and be as the presence of Christ, a molding agency upon the human character. Receiving the truth, men also become recipients of the grace of Christ, and devote their sanctified human ability to the work in which Christ was engaged,--men become laborers together with God. It is to make men agents for God, that divine truth is brought home to their understanding. Let us inquire of the church, Have you answered this purpose? Have you fulfilled the design of God in diffusing the light of divine truth, in scattering abroad the precious jewels of truth?",
