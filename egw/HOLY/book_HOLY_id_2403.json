    "word": "All Heaven Echoes the Note of Joy.--We must bear in mind the great joy manifested by the Shepherd at the recovery of the lost. He calls upon His neighbors, \"Rejoice with Me; for I have found My sheep which was lost.\" And all heaven echoes the note of joy. The Father Himself joys over the rescued one with singing. What a holy ecstasy of joy is expressed in this parable! That joy it is your privilege to share. --Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 125. (1900)",
