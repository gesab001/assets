    "word": "Those who live just prior to the second appearing of Christ, may expect a large measure of His Holy Spirit; but if they do not watch and pray, if God has ever spoken by me, some of our leading men are going over the same ground of refusing the message of mercy, as the Jews did in the time of Christ. If they turn away from the light, they will fail to meet the high and holy claims of God for this important time, they will fail to fulfill the sacred responsibility that He has entrusted to them.",
