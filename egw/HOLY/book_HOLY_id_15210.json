    "word": "Temperance. [Letter written from] \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, March 21, 1896. Dear Brother and Sister Durland: I have something to say to you upon the subject of temperance. If you are yourselves working earnestly in the line in which God demands all His messengers who are laboring in the harvest field to work, you will have very much greater influence on the side of truth and righteousness. But your indifference on this subject is not pleasing to God. You occupy a position of responsibility, and you need to be worked by the Holy Spirit.",
