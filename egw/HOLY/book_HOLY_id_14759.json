    "word": "Christ is to be all and in all to the believer. There must be none of self, and all of Christ, whose we are by creation and by redemption. The Holy Spirit takes the most attractive excellencies of the One who is altogether lovely, and presents them in such a way as to engage the attention and receive the best attention of the renewed heart. God designs that the Holy Spirit shall keep before the mind's eye scenes that will attract and absorb all there is of the new-born soul. We need not any external representations of the person of Christ. The imagination must take in the only begotten of the Father, \"full of grace and truth,\" the One altogether lovely, and the chiefest among ten thousand.",
