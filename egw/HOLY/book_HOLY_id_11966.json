    "word": "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, but how little is this promise appreciated. How seldom is [the Spirit's] power felt in the church; how little is His power spoken of before the people. The Saviour has said: \"Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me\" (Acts 1:8). With the reception of this gift, all other gifts would be ours; for we are to have this gift according to the plentitude of the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul according to the capacity to receive. Then let us not be satisfied with only a little of this blessing, only that amount which will keep us from the slumber of death, but let us diligently seek for the abundance of the grace of God.",
