    "word": "God's Spirit has illuminated every page of Holy Writ, but there are those upon whom it makes but little impression, because it is imperfectly understood. When the shaking comes, by the introduction of false theories, these surface readers, anchored nowhere, are like shifting sand. They slide into any position to suit the tenor of their feelings of bitterness. This is the way McCullagh has done. He has indulged his feelings against me, without intimating to me one word in regard to his difficulties.",
