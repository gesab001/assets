    "word": "MR No. 396 - Instruction From the Heavenly Sanctuary\n\n     From the Holy of Holies, there goes on the grand work of instruction. The angels of God are communicating to men. Christ officiates in the Sanctuary. We do not follow Him into the Sanctuary as we should. Christ and angels work in the hearts of the children of men. The church above united with the church below is warring the good warfare upon the earth. There must be a purifying of the soul here upon the earth, in harmony with Christ's cleansing of the Sanctuary in heaven. There we shall see more clearly as we are seen. We shall know as we are known.",
