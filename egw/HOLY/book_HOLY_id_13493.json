    "word": "There has been a spirit in the church at Hobart that is not in harmony with the Spirit of Christ, and those who cherish harshness, who have been free to condemn others, need to hear the voice of the Saviour, as He says, \"Behold, I \n\n\n                                     -275- \n\nstand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me\" [Revelation 3:20]. Will you open the door of your hearts, and let Jesus take possession? Will you suffer Jesus to cleanse the soul-temple of its rubbish? Will you permit the Holy Spirit to take possession of the human habitation? If you will do this, you will have humble thoughts of yourself. You will not exalt your ideas and opinions as supreme.",
