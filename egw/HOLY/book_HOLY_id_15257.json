    "word": "Let us hear the words of Paul: \"I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds, that ye may prove what is that \n\n\n                                     -107- \n\ngood, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.\" \"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.\" This lesson means you; will you heed it?",
