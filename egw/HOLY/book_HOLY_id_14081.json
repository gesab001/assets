    "word": "Through faith in Christ obedience to every principle of the law is made possible. Thus Paul learned that \"the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" For our benefit, he questions, \"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
