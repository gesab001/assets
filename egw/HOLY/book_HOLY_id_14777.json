    "word": "Christ prayed that His disciples might be one, even as He is one with the Father. Then every one who claims to be a child of God should make individual efforts to answer this prayer and labor for this oneness. When it exists, the followers of Christ will be a holy, powerful people, united in love. But if you let love die out of the soul, and accept the accusations of Satan's agents against the children of God, you become servants of sin and are helping the devil in his work.",
