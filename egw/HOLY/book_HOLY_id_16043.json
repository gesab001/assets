    "word": "We will not be able to meet the trials of this time without God. We are not to have the courage and fortitude of martyrs of old until brought into the position they were in. The Lord proportions His grace to meet every emergency. We are to receive daily supplies of grace for each daily emergency. Thus we grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, and if persecution comes upon us, if we must be enclosed in prison walls for the faith of Jesus and the keeping of God's holy law, \"As thy days, so shall thy strength be.\" Should there be a return of persecution there would be grace given to arouse every energy of the soul to show a true heroism. But there is a large amount of nominal Christianity which has not its origin in God, the Source of all power and might. God gives us not power to make us independent and self-sufficient. We must ever make God our only dependence. \n                                                                           461",
