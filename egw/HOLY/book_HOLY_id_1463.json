    "word": "The Medical Missionary's Example [REVIEW AND HERALD, JUNE 9, 1904.] \n\n\n     In the days of Christ there were no sanitariums in the Holy Land. But wherever the Great Physician went, He carried with Him the healing efficacy that was a cure for every disease, spiritual and physical. This He imparted to those who were under the afflicting power of the enemy. In every city, every town, every village through which He passed, with the solicitude of a loving father He laid His hands upon the afflicted ones, making them whole and speaking words of tenderest sympathy and compassion. How precious to them were His words! From Him flowed a stream of healing power which made the sick whole. He healed men and women with unhesitating willingness and with hearty joyfulness, for He was glad to be able to restore suffering ones to health.",
