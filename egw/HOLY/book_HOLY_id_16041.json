    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., Sabbath, October 19, 1889 \n\n     It is the holy Sabbath, and we greatly desire it shall be a most precious day to our souls. We know that the Lord is gracious, and of tender pity for our weaknesses. If not, we might despair, but we have reason for constant gratitude, encouragement, and hope, because Jesus has given His precious life for us that we might have His grace, His power and divine strength. It is not His pleasure that we should go forward \n                                                                           453\nin weakness and in inefficiency, when heaven is full of blessings for us. This thought should awaken in us gratitude and thanksgiving and praise that Christ is the center in heaven, the Lamb in the midst of the throne.",
