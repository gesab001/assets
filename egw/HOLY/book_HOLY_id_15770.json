We want to educate ourselves to talk of the truth, talk of heaven and heavenly things, converse of the Saviour's love, and then we shall be fitting up for a holy heaven. If Christ, when He shall come, should find us with all the defects of character we have today, there will be no such thing as our getting into the courts of heaven, and there will be no chance for us to reform then. Christ does not promise to transform our characters then, after He shall come. We must seek righteous characters now.",
