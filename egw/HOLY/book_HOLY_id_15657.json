    "word": "A lady came to me in the city of Oakland, threw her arms around my neck, and said, \"You are a child of God, but I am sanctified, I am holy; and we want you to come in with us.\" I turned to the Bible and showed her what is said. Then I said to her, \"Suppose you should go to your children and say to them, 'You need not keep the commandments of God, you are holy. All you need do is to say that you love Christ; you need not think you have anything to do, but simply say I love my father and mother.' What would be the results? Just as surely as you stand opposed to the law of God, you have no investigation to make. If your character is not in harmony with the law of God, it is not in harmony with heaven, however you may profess to be holy and sinless.\"",
