    "word": "No, this is not the way the Lord works. The one who thus thinks and thus acts is himself deficient in character. He has some strong points, and can work in certain lines; but in other lines he is weak. Other human agencies are needed whom the Holy Spirit shall guide to act their part in completing the work. No man is complete in or through any other man. It is not any one man's gift that accomplishes the work essential. It is the Holy Spirit that works the man. Human agents of diverse gifts are needed.",
