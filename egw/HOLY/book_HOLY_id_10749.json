    "word": "Has God, in showing mercy to the sinner, ceased to be just? Has He dishonored His holy law, and will He henceforth pass over the violation of it? God is true. He changes not. The conditions of salvation are ever the same. Life, eternal life, is for all who will obey God's law. Perfect obedience, revealed in thought, word, and deed, is as essential now as when the lawyer asked Christ, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" Jesus said to him, \"What is written in the law? how readest thou? . . . . this do, and thou shalt live\" (Luke 10:25-28).",
