    "word": "Day after day is passing into eternity, bringing us nearer the close of probation. Now we must pray as never before for the Holy Spirit to be more abundantly bestowed upon us, and we must look for His sanctifying influence to come upon the workers, that the people for whom they labor may know that they have been with Jesus and learned of Him. We need spiritual eyesight now as never before, that we may see afar off, and that we may discern the snares and gins of the enemy, and as faithful watchmen proclaim the danger. We need spiritual power that we may take in, as far as the human mind can, the great subjects of Christianity, and how far-reaching are its principles. There are many who need faith. They will have to fight the good fight of faith every day, yes, every hour.",
