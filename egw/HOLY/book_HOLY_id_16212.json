    "word": "We claim to be Christians under the control, not of our own feelings, but of the Spirit of God, devoted to the service of Christ, who has chosen us to be under the dictation of His Holy Spirit. He has offered to His Father a most wonderful prayer, that His disciples may be as He was, one with the Father. Now it is the duty of every one who believes in Christ as their personal Saviour, to answer that prayer. Angels and archangels are looking upon God's chosen ones with the most earnest interest to see what influence the truth is having upon mind and character, to see how much they appreciate the One who was crucified for them, that they might have eternal life. If the plainest injunctions and His commandments are lightly regarded, and the prayer of Christ just prior to His offering the great sacrifice, has been strangely neglected, what does it mean? We are truly a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.",
