    "word": "Need of the Holy Spirit. [Written from] Launceston, Tasmania, May 11, 1895. I have had opened before me your college at Lincoln, Nebraska. I saw an existing state of things, that was not wholesome or healthful. Minds were being wrought upon, making too much of little things, a world of an atom and an atom of a world. One would suppose that the love of Jesus had not a modifying, correcting influence over your own natural and cultivated traits of character. Anyone would suppose that you were grafts of a strange vine rather than being the branches of the living vine. Self has swelled to wonderful proportions. Little things have been treated as the largest and most essential things. Teachers have revealed that they have little growing knowledge of Jesus Christ. They need not only to take a term in the school of Christ, but to live in that school as learners continually.",
