    "word": "The Lord God of heaven has caused His Holy Spirit from time to time to move upon the students in the school [Battle Creek College], that they might acknowledge Him in all their ways, so that He might direct their paths. At times the manifestation of the Holy Spirit has been so decided that studies were forgotten, and the greatest Teacher the world ever knew made His voice heard, saying, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30).",
