    "word": "There Is Yet Hope--I am now bidden to say to you, \"You may now come to the Saviour. Your opportunity is here. At the General Conference [session] held in Battle Creek in 1901, the Lord, in the testimonies borne in the Tabernacle, pointed out the way that you were to follow, but you did not choose to follow. At one time, after the [General] Conference [session] held at South Lancaster [1899], you broke down and you did see yourself, but in none too strong a light. Had you then kept the repentance that needeth not to be repented of, you would have boldly taken your stand under the banner of Jesus Christ. But it is not natural for you to yield, and you cherished a stubborn determination to carry out your own will and way. You would not yield to the Holy Spirit's guidance. You kept yourself under your own control, devising first one plan and then another plan, and working against the Lord's plans. . . .",
