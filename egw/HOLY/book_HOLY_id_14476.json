    "word": "At the end of the 1,000 years Jesus, with the holy angels and all the saints, leaves the city, and while He is descending with them the wicked dead are raised, and then the very men that pierced Him [Revelation 1:7] will see Him afar off in all His glory, and all the holy angels and the saints with Him. They will see the prints of the nails in His hands and in His feet, and where they thrust the spear into His side, and they will wail because of Him. I saw that the prints of the nails and of the spear were His glory.",
