All that was lost by sin has been restored. \u201cThus saith the Lord . . . that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.\u201d [Isaiah 45:18.] God's original purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled as it is made the eternal abode of the redeemed. \u201cThe righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.\u201d [Psalm 37:29.]",
