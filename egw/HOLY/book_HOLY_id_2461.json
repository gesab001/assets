    "word": "It was not the will of God that the coming of Christ should be thus delayed. God did not design that His people, Israel, should wander forty years in the wilderness. He promised to lead them directly to the land of Canaan, and establish them there a holy, healthy, happy people. But those to whom it was first preached, went not in \"because of unbelief.\" Their hearts were filled with murmuring, rebellion, and hatred, and He could not fulfill His covenant with them.",
