    "word": "Flee to Christ as Soon as Sin Is Committed-- 1892.-- Many do not pray. They feel under condemnation for sin, and they think they must not come to God until they have done something to merit His favor or until God has forgotten about their transgressions. They say, \"I cannot hold up holy hands before God without wrath or doubting, and therefore I cannot come.\" So they remain away from Christ, and are committing sin all the time in so doing, for without Him you can do nothing but evil.",
