But while we would rejoice to find workers with literary ability, we rejoice to see some souls ministering who have had fewer advantages than others to obtain an education. Some are devoting themselves to the work in humility, and with an unreserved consecration to God. They may have only ordinary ability, yet under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, they may yoke up with Christ, and the record concerning them in heaven is, \"Laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" There will be manifest in their work a consecrated energy of character that will provoke others to zeal and good works.",
