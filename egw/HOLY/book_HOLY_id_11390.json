    "word": "In His breast, mercy may be said to have held her court. Hear His words of compassion, spoken to relieve the sin-sick culprit, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee\" (Matthew 9:3). . . . He brought healing to soul and body. In His life was enshrouded the love, the pity, the compassion, the joy, of heaven.
