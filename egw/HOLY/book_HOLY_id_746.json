    "word": "\"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" [John 17:3.] \"I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.\" [John 17:8.] Here is the work laid before us, to be representatives of Christ, as he in our world was the representative of the Father. We are to teach the words given us in the lessons of Christ. \"I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me.\" We have our work, and every instructor of the youth in any capacity is to receive in a good and honest heart what God has unfolded and recorded in his holy word in the lessons of Christ, meekly to accept the words of life. We are in the antitypical day of atonement, and not only are we to humble our hearts before God and confess our sins, but we are, by all our educating talent, to seek to instruct those with whom we are brought in contact, and to bring them by precept and example to know God and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. \n                                                                           158",
