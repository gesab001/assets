    "word": "Whatever may have been the feeling and conduct of others toward you, let not this have a shadow of influence upon you in your contact with them. Not one of us lives to himself. Each has God's entrusted talents to use, and consider well what is demanded of you in order to represent Christ in every place and under every circumstance. \n                                                                           1465\nSelf is to be hid with Christ in God. Without me, said Christ, ye can do nothing. But the Holy Spirit is given to help us in every time of need. Stand in humble dependence upon that power that will be given to all who seek for it and depend on it. Your capabilities will be a success in the service of Christ if you feel your own inefficiency and your dependence upon God.",
