    "word": "There are large numbers willing to devote their time to home missionary work if they see that it is pleasant and agreeable to them. They wait for something to do, and work to be brought to them; \n\n\n                      - 23 - \n\nbut they lose physical, mental, and moral efficiency in so doing. In every neighborhood, consecrated ability will do much in personal effort; but let not men prescribe for their brethren according to their ideas. Let the oppression of human minds forever cease, and let the Holy Spirit have a chance to work. Let all who can read and discern the signs of the times, know that Christ is nigh, even at the door. Let love for God and Christ grow daily, and let love for your brethren be without dissimulation. Let faith be in constant use. Believe God because he is God. Put your human, world-loving spirit under the molding of the Spirit of God. The question is asked, When the Lord cometh, will he find faith on the earth? Faith, then, has become almost extinct.",
