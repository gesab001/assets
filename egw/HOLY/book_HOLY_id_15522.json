    "word": "Let no one live to please himself. We are laborers together with God. We are to work in union with His Holy Spirit. God is the great first cause, the source of all power and grace and efficiency. Human agencies are to yoke up with Christ. \"Ye are God's husbandry.\" You are to work out that which God works in. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Your heart is to be cultivated by the Holy Spirit that it may bear fruit unto righteousness.",
