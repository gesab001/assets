    "word": "Heavenly Father, Thou hast said, \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" (Matthew 7:7) . Heavenly Father, we need Thy Holy Spirit. We do not want to work ourselves, only as we work in unity with God. We want to be in a position where the Holy Spirit of God shall be upon us with its reviving, sanctifying power. Wilt Thou manifest Thyself unto us this very morning! Wilt Thou sweep away every mist and every cloud of darkness!",
