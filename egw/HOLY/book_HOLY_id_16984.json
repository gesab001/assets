    "word": "If the world are to be convinced of sin as transgressors of God's law, the agency must be the Holy Spirit working through human instrumentalities. The church needs now to shake off her death-like slumber; for the Lord is waiting to bless His people who will recognize His blessing when it comes, and diffuse it in clear, strong rays of light. \"Then will I sprinkle clear water upon you, and ye shall be clean. . . .And I will put My Spirit upon you, and cause you to walk in My statutes.\" If the wilderness of the church is to become as a fruitful field, and the fruitful field to be as a forest, it is through the Holy Spirit of God poured out upon His people. The heavenly agencies have long been waiting for the human agents, the members of the church, to cooperate with them in the great work to be done. They are waiting for you. So vast is the field, so comprehensive the design, that every sanctified heart will be pressed into service as an agent of divine power.",
