    "word": "GENUINE AND COUNTERFEIT PRAYERS CONTRASTED.\u2014The poor publican who prayed, \u201cGod be merciful to me a sinner\u201d (Luke 18:13), regarded himself as a very wicked man, and others looked upon him in the same light; but he felt his need, and with his burden of guilt and shame he came before God, asking for His mercy. His heart was open for the Spirit of God to do its gracious work and set him free from the power of sin. The Pharisee\u2019s boastful, self-righteous prayer showed that his heart was closed against the influence of the Holy Spirit. Because of his distance from God, he had no sense of his own defilement, in contrast with the perfection of the divine holiness. He felt no need, and he received nothing.\u2014(Steps to Christ, 30, 31.)",
