    "word": "Every father and mother is answerable to the great Lawgiver for the children placed in their care. They are to guard their children with untiring watchfulness. Together parents and children are to walk in the way of the Lord, ruled and guided by His Holy Spirit. Obedience that the Lord has given to control in the home will prevent all disobedience on the part of the children and all oppression and cruelty on the part of the parents.",
