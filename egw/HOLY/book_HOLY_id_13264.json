    "word": "The work now being done with \"Object Lessons\" is a good beginning to the work that the Lord desires to see carried forward by His people, because it calls for sacrifices and gifts, and because it enables all to act a part. The Lord's plan has provided a way for all to do something. As you go forth to sell the book that He has declared should be sold, you will realize that to you is spoken the benediction, \"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you.\" 2 Corinthians 13:14.",
