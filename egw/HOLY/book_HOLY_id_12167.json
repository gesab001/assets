    "word": "Self-denying Sacrifice. \n\n     Many have been altogether too long in a sleepy condition. While some have worked intently, and have manifested unfailing energy, others have stood as spectators, and have been ready to make remarks of a critical character as to methods and results. This they are ready to do, though they have never exercised their minds in originating any plans whereby precious souls \n\n\n                         - 38 - \n\nmight be saved for Christ. They stand ready to find fault with those who do something. When these indolent souls awake, and show some signs of returning consciousness, they are disappointed if others do not at once find them pleasant places in the work. It is a great shock to them to find out that work cannot be done without pains-taking, self-denying, self-crucifying efforts. They expect success, and think that they must have the same order of success as did the apostles on the day of Pentecost. This success they will have when they go through the experience of humble, self-denying sacrifice as did the apostles. When they present as earnest supplications from broken, contrite, believing hearts as did the apostles, then the same proportion of success will attend their labors. \"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\" \"To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.\"",
