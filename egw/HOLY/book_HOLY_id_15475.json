    "word": "In my dream last Friday night a sentinel stood at the door of an important building and said to every one who came for entrance, Have you received the Holy Spirit? A measuring line was in his hand, and but very, very few were admitted into the building. Your size as a human being is nothing. Your size as the full stature of a man in Christ Jesus according to the knowledge you have had will give you an appointment to sit with Christ at the marriage supper of the Lamb, and you will never know the extent of the great advantage given you in the banquet prepared for you.",
