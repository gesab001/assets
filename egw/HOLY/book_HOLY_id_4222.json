    "word": "This expression, \"bought with a price,\" means everything to us. In consideration of the price paid for us, shall we not yield our bodies and souls up to Him who has bought us with His blood? Shall not that which He has redeemed be kept in as wholesome and pure and holy a condition as possible? . . . Our very flesh He has saved at an infinite cost, giving His own flesh for the life of the world.",
