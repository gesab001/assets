    "word": "When two or three are met together to unite their counsel, and to send up their petitions, the promise is for them, \"Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" [Luke 11:9]. \"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him\" [verse 13]. The Lord has promised that where two or three are met together in His name, there will He be in the midst. Those who meet together for prayer will receive an unction from the Holy One. There is great need of secret prayer, but there is also need of several Christians' meeting together, to unite with earnestness their petitions to God. In these small companies Jesus is present, and the love of souls is deepened in the heart and the Spirit puts forth His mighty energies, that human agents may be exercised in regard to saving those who are lost. Jesus ever sought to show how worthless were formal ceremonies, and strove to impress upon His disciples that the Holy Spirit must enlighten, renew, and sanctify the soul.--Ms. 52, 1894.",
