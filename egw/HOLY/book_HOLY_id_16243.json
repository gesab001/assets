At times you desired it, and were ready to reach out your hand to grasp it, to open the door of your heart to its transforming energy; but pride and stubbornness have held you back, Now you begin to see, and I entreat you to make no half-way work in this matter. Unless you move out decidedly now, unless the transforming power of truth shall do its work upon your heart, and you make thorough work for eternity, you will surely fall into the snare of Satan. I know you have been cheating the soul with excuses and subterfuges, you do not admit this, but it is so. For Christ's sake, for your soul's sake, come fully into the light. The glorious prize is full in view. The gates of heaven are open wide. \"These things saith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of David, He that openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth: I know thy works; behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it; for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept My word, and hast not denied My name.\"",
