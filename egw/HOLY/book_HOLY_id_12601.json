    "word": "Our anxiety should not be to please the people by smart speeches and oratory, in order to gain flattery and applause, but to have our labor such as can be approved by God. Our intense desire should be to give, by a well-ordered life and a godly conversation, discourses, solemn, earnest, and tender, with the unction of the Holy Spirit. Those \n\n\n                         [12] \n\nwho labor in this spirit are never satisfied with themselves.",
