    "word": "Preach the truth in its simplicity. Do not let your discourses embrace so much that weakness shall be seen in place of solid argument. Dwell decidedly on a few important points. Realize every moment that you must have the presence of the Holy Spirit; for He can do a work that you of yourself cannot do. Give your hearers pure wheat, thoroughly winnowed. Give them the very manna from heaven, and the Spirit will bear witness with your spirit that it is not you that speak, but that the Holy Spirit is speaking through you.",
