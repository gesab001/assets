    "word": "Our missions must be kept free from all wrong practices, all coarseness, all carelessness. Everything connected with them should be above reproach. Every one who has any part to act in them should be an example to believers. There is need that many moments be spent in secret prayer, in close communion with God. Thus only can victories be won. Every arrangement of the mission should be such as to garrison the soul against yielding to temptation. Every unholy passion must be kept under the control of sanctified reason, through the grace abundantly bestowed by God.",
