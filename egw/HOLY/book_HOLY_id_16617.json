    "word": "The great Head of the church has given talents to the company of believers. He has given his word to mould the character and his Spirit to bring all things to their remembrance. He desires his people to bring into their work the true abiding principles of missionary effort. Many of the Lord's servants are numbered with those of whom John wrote, \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.\" Those who are left to plant the standard in new places are to have a keen, sanctified interest in every plan which is related, directly or indirectly, to the great work of warning the world. Those who have stood in positions of trust, faithful men who have been led and guided by God, are to thank him for his moulding, fashioning power. They are to carry his work onward and upward to perfect accomplishment. They are to move with careful, prayerful consideration, lest they mar the influence of the work by changing the order which the Lord has said should be followed. As they advance step by step they are to mind the same things, to advance in the same lines, that the truth may ever be honored or lose its sacred, holy influence in the sight of the world.",
