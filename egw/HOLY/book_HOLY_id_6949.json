I saw that in striking against the visions they did not strike against the worm--the feeble instrument that God spake through--but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was a small thing to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to slight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God chose to show them their errors through visions, and they disregarded the teachings of God through visions, they would be left to take their own way, and run in the way of error, and think they were right, until they would find it out too late. Then in the time of trouble I heard them cry to God in agony, \"Why didst Thou not show us our wrong, that we might have got right and been ready for this time?\" Then an angel pointed to them and said, \"My Father taught, but you would not be taught. He spoke through visions, but you disregarded His voice, and He gave you up to your own ways, to be filled with your own doings.\"--Broadside, To Those Who Are Receiving the Seal of the Living God, Jan. 31, 1849. \n                                                                           41",
