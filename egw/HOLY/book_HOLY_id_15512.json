    "word": "Base animal passions had controlled them. Licentiousness and lust had been carefully cloaked from human eyes, but the Lord saw it, and their names were blotted out of the Book of Life. Many of these men claimed to be teachers of the truth, but their labor was not marked with holy endeavor. They had not confidence and boldness toward God. They could not lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting. And the words were pronounced to these sin-polluted souls, \"Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity.\" Now is the time to obtain the white robe of character. Now is the time to confess and forsake sin and come to God \n\n\n                                     -384- \n\nwith contrition of soul, that your sins may be blotted out and your names retained in the Lamb's Book of Life.",
