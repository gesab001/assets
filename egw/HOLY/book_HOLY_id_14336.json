    "word": "Daniells and Prescott in Danger of Voicing Misleading Sentiments (To A. G. Daniells and W. W. Prescott)--I am charged with a message to you both that you need to humble your hearts before God. Neither Elder Prescott nor \n\n\n                                     -363- \n\nElder Daniells is prepared to direct the work of the General Conference, for in some things they have dishonored the Lord God of Israel. [BASED ON THIS STATEMENT, A QUESTION MAY BE RAISED AS TO WHY ELDER A. G. DANIELLS WAS CONTINUED IN OFFICE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AFTER THIS STARTLING MESSAGE WAS GIVEN. IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED THAT THE ENTIRE TESTIMONY OF WHICH THIS IS A PART, AND OTHER LIKE MESSAGES OF COUNSEL AND REPROOF, LED THE PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE, WHO WAS EVER ALERT TO THE GUIDANCE OF THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY, TO REASSESS HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD AND HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AS LEADER OF THE CHURCH AND TO TAKE A COURSE WHICH ELLEN WHITE INDICATED CARRIED GOD'S APPROVAL. THE NEW EMPHASIS AND ATTITUDE BECAME APPARENT IN A STRONG THRUST IN CITY EVANGELISM. TWO YEARS LATER, AS ELLEN WHITE CHOSE A BOARD OF FIVE MEN TO CARRY THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CARE AND PRESERVATION OF HER WRITINGS AFTER HER DEATH, IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT SHE NAMED ELDER DANIELLS AS ONE TO SERVE IN THIS IMPORTANT CAPACITY.--WHITE TRUSTEES.] High, pure devotion to God is required of men placed in your position. Such a man was Daniel, who in his statesmanship maintained a clean and holy purpose. Such characters are needed now.",
