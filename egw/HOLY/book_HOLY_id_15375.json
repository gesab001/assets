    "word": "Brother Evans can do errands for God, can interest a congregation, but cannot travel extensively or be a thorough laborer. I was shown the case of Brother Bingham. He has a good gift, and can do good, fill in here and there, but his labors cannot tell unless he has corresponding works. He is not careful studying how he can best approach individuals, but broaches the subject abruptly, and injures his influence and the cause he loves. I saw that he should labor at home to set a holy, godly example, [and] be patient, kind, and tender to his relatives and friends, especially his wife and children. His good influence should tell in the neighborhood. He must not have a driving spirit, but a winning one. He cannot drive souls into the truth but he can win them much more successfully than he can drive. \n\n\n                                    ********",
