    "word": "The work of publication is to be developed in new lines and carried as it has never yet been carried. Wherever our large meetings are held, leaflets should be printed reporting the discourses given, and these leaflets should be widely circulated. I have been shown that we are not doing all that we should do for the spread of the knowledge of the present truth. If we will be guided by the Holy Spirit, the Lord will open to us many ways in which the truth may be made to shine brightly before the world.",
