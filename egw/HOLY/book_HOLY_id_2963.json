    "word": "The seraphim around the throne are so filled with reverential awe as they behold the glory of God, that they do not for an instant look upon themselves with admiration. Their praise is for the Lord of hosts. As they look into the future, when the whole earth shall be filled with His glory, the triumphant song is echoed from one to another in melodious chant, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts.\" They are fully satisfied to glorify God; abiding in His presence, beneath His smile of approbation, they wish for nothing more.",
