    "word": "Christ's Words to the Disciples Re-enforced After Pentecost--It was the Holy Spirit that brought from the lessons of Christ all things to their [the disciples'] remembrance, repeating them with a vividness that was more powerful than when they heard these precious truths with their natural senses. The words of the great Teacher were impressed upon the dormant energies of mind and soul. This new sense of the truths which Christ uttered was received into their minds and senses as a new revelation; and truth, pure, unadulterated truth, made a place for itself.",
