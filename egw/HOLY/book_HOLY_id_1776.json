    "word": "We must give the Lord a chance to do His work, His great work for the soul. Christ is our sufficiency. Each one of us must understand what it means to have the Word of God fulfilled in us. As Christ was in this world, so we are to be. If in this life we are like Him in character, we shall in heaven have His likeness. If there is no likeness between Christ and us in this world, there can be no friendship between Christ and us when He shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him. As religious teachers, we are under obligation to God to teach the students how to engage in medical missionary work. Those who do this work have many opportunities to sow the seeds of truth in a way that will be successful. The heart full of gratitude to God can pray, Teach me Thy way, O Lord, lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies, or rather, because of mine observers.--Ms 70, 1898.",
