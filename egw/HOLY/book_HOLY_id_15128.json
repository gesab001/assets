    "word": "I thank the Lord that I can still write. I am up and at work early in the morning, when the other members of my family are still sleeping. This morning I slept until four o'clock, which is an unusual thing for me. I have reason to be very grateful for the degree of health that I enjoy. I can go up and down stairs as readily as the young people, and my mind is clear.
