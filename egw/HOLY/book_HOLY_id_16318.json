    "word": "No man can serve God acceptably and let his light shine to the world unless he is loyal and true to the precepts given in God's holy word to guide and control our lives. The statutes of men are contrary to the principles of the law of God, both in the first four and in the last six commandments. These precepts are largely discarded by some who have a part to act in the cause of God. Manmade codes and inventions are many.",
