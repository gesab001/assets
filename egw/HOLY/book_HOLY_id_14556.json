    "word": "In the morning, and sometimes in the afternoon, children's meetings were held, and on some occasions nearly 400 children were present. These meetings were under the supervision of Sister Peck, with the assistance of a number of Sabbath school teachers. It was a pleasant sight to see all through the week a large number of children, neatly dressed, assembling to receive instruction. Meetings were held for the instruction of teachers in Sabbath school work. There were superintendents of Sunday Schools who came to obtain all the information possible. They said that new methods must be brought into their schools. This will give some idea of the influence of the meetings. A great work was done. We know that the Lord's host was on the encampment, and the Holy Spirit is still striving with hearts.",
