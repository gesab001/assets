    "word": "Canvassers Should Remember\nDo not, because you are among unbelievers, become careless in your words; for they are taking your measure. Study the instruction given to Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron. They \u201coffered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not.\u201d Taking common fire they placed it upon their censers. \u201cAnd there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and\n92\nthey died before the Lord. Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh Me, and before all the people I will be glorified.\u201d Leviticus 10:1-3. Canvassers should remember that they are working with the Lord to save souls, and that they are to bring no commonness or cheapness into His sacred service. Let the mind be filled with pure, holy thoughts, and let the words be well chosen. Hinder not the success of your work by uttering light, careless words.\u2014Manual for Canvassers, pages 23, 24.",
