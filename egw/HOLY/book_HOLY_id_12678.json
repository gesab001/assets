    "word": "As you labor for others, the divine power of the Spirit will work upon their souls; for they have been purchased by the blood of the only begotten Son of God. We can be successful in winning souls for whom Christ has died, only as we shall depend on the grace and power of God to do the work of convicting and converting the heart. While you are presenting to them the truth of God, unbelief and uncertainty will strive to hold the mind; but let the pledged word of God expel doubt from your hearts. Take God at His word, and work in faith. Satan will come with his suggestions to make you distrust the word of your heavenly Father; but consider, \"Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.\" Press your faith through the dark shadow of Satan, and lodge it upon the mercy seat, and let not one doubt be entertained. This is the only way in which you will gain an experience, and find the evidence so essential for your peace and confidence. As your experience grows, you will have increased ardor of soul, and warmer love for the service of God, because you have oneness of purpose with Jesus Christ. Your sympathies are begotten of the Holy Spirit. You wear the yoke with Christ, and are laborers together with God.",
