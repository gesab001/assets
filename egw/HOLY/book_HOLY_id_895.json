    "word": "Our camp-meetings have another object. . . . They are to promote spiritual life among our own people. . . . God has committed to our hands a most sacred work, and we need to meet together to receive instruction, that we may be fitted to perform this work. We need to understand what part we shall individually be called upon to act in building up the cause of God in the earth, in vindicating God's holy law, and in lifting up the Saviour as \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29. We need to meet together and receive the divine touch that we may understand our work in the home.--Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 32, 33. \n                                                                           195",
