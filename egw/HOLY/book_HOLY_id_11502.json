    "word": "Praise Better Than Complaint--It is better to praise the Lord than to complain. Let not our tongues utter words of which we shall be ashamed when Christ shall come in His glory with all the holy angels with Him. We must be clean in lips and in heart;  we must be sanctified and refined, even as Christ was.--Ms 95, 1909.",
