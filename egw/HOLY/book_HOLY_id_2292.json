    "word": "The question has been asked, Why have you made a specialty of laboring for the lowest, most debased class, passing by the men of discrimination and talent?

Controlled by the Holy Spirit, these men will move in a way that will clear away obstructions, so that the people may be warned of the soon coming of the Lord. . . .",
