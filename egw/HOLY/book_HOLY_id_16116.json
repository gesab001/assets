    "word": "Take not the position that men can be moved by the presentation of the love of God alone. You may build ever so fine a structure, but it is without foundation. Dig deep, lay the foundation on Christ alone--a crucified Redeemer who died for the transgressor that he should not perish but have eternal life. How? Only by coming back to his allegiance to God's holy law. \"Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Acts 20:21.",
