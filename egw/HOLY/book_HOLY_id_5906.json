    "word": "The God of heaven is true. There is not a motive in the depths of the heart, not a secret within us, not a design that God does not fully comprehend. But what is the standard of justice? God's law. God's law is placed in one scale, His holy immutable law whose claims are specified, taking, in the first four commandments, supreme love to God, and in the last six, love to our neighbor. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, . . . and thy neighbour as thyself.\" Luke 10:27. From this standard we will not subtract one atom. God requires all the heart, mind, soul, and strength, and \"love thy neighbour as thyself.\" This is placed in one scale, while every individual character has to pass the weighing test by being placed in the opposite scale. And by its just comparison every man's doom is irretrievably fixed. . . .",
