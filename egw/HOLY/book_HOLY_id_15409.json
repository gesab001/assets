    "word": "My confidence in God is unshaken, notwithstanding some are departing from the faith, and giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. My mind is clear and my heart is stayed upon God. I thank Him with heart and soul and voice this morning that He blesses me with His peace and grace. I can say with the psalmist, \"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name.\" He is good, and greatly to be praised. Soon He will come to deliver His saints.",
