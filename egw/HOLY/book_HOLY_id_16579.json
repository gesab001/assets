    "word": "Let there be no robber of God in tithes and offerings, no desecration of God's holy time. Man is not to do his own pleasure on God's day. He has six days in which to work at secular business, and God claims the seventh as His own. \"In it,\" He says, \"thou shalt not do any work.\" Exodus 20:10. The servant of God will call sacred that which the Lord calls sacred. Thus he will show that he has chosen the Lord as his leader. The Sabbath was made for man in Eden when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy. God has placed it in our charge. Let us keep it pure and holy.",
