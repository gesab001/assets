    "word": "It is your duty to war against oppressive thoughts and melancholy feelings, just as much as it is your duty to pray. It is your duty to counterwork the agencies of the enemy, to place a firm hold upon the bridle of your tongue as well as your thoughts. Of all the times in your life when you need a supply of grace, it is when the sensitive, inflamed digestive organs are at work and you are worried and tired out. You may look surprised at this, but it is a species of swearing to be constantly irritated and irritating others by your fault-finding and gloomy reflections. These fits of indigestion are trying, but hold fast to the bridle, that you shall not swear to those who are your best friends or to those who are your enemies.",
