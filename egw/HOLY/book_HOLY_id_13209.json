    "word": "None of us should be ashamed of work, however small and servile it may appear. Labor is ennobling. All who toil with head or hands are working men and working women. And all are doing their duty and honoring their religion as much while working at the wash-tub, or washing the dishes, as they are in going to meeting. While the hands are engaged in the most common labor, the mind may be elevated and ennobled by pure and holy thoughts. When any of the workers manifest a lack of respect for religious things, they should be separated from the work. Let none feel that the institution is dependent upon them.",
