    "word": "We have read an account of a noble prince who carried the picture of his father always near his heart and on important occasions when there was danger of forgetting him, he would take out the likeness and view it and say, \"Let me do nothing unbecoming so excellent a father.\" As Christians, God has claims upon us that we should never, never lose sight of for a moment; and as we are His children by adoption, how careful should we be that we retain His image and do nothing that will belittle or degrade our holy calling, for we rank among the royal family. God has made us as vessels unto honor, prepared unto every good work. \"This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.\" Isaiah 43:21. God's people are called a crown, a diadem. Satan would eagerly seize the Lord's treasure, but God has secured it so that Satan cannot obtain it. \"Thou shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.\" Isaiah 62:3. We are secure, perfectly secure from the enemy's subtlety while we have unwavering trust in God.\"",
