    "word": "Christ says, \"Every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth\" (Matthew 7:8). He who truly seeks for the precious grace of Christ will be sure not to be disappointed. This promise has been given to us by Him who will not deceive us. It is not stated as a maxim or a theory, but as a fact, as a law of the divine government. We can be assured that we shall receive the Holy Spirit if we individually try the experiment of testing God's word. God is true; His order is perfect. . . . Light and truth will shine forth according to the desire of the soul. O that all would hunger and thirst after righteousness, that they might be filled!",
