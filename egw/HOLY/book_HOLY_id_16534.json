    "word": "Edson and Emma, you must have Christ formed within, the hope of glory. Then that which before seemed to you but a meager supply will prove to be a rich feast. You will be satisfied yourselves, and you will have something to give to others. Walk humbly with Christ, daily learning the lesson of meekness and lowliness. Thus your heart will become a temple for the Holy Spirit, and nothing but God alone can fill a temple where God dwells.",
