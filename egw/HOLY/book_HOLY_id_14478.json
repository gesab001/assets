    "word": "Men may study and try to learn the living words of God, but unless the Holy Spirit shall unite with the human understanding, and the human unite with the divine by becoming partakers of the divine nature, they are blind and cannot see afar off, and have forgotten that they were purged from their old sins. But the touch of the Holy Spirit upon the human mind makes decided changes.",
