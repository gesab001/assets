    "word": "MR No. 1038 - Look to God, not to Men\n\n     Every soul that is sanctified by the Holy Spirit will look to God for himself. The human agent will not look to other human agents to be told his duty. The divine Guide will prepare his heart for divine light. The Holy Spirit's work is to write God's thoughts deeply in the heart of man. \"After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts\" [Jeremiah 31:33]. Such alone are Christ's living epistles, written, not with pen and ink, but by the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart.",
