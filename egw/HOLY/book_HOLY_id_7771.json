    "word": "I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful, and were looking to the time of the \u201crefreshing\u201d and \u201clatter rain\u201d to fit them to stand in the day of the Lord, and to live in his sight. O, how many I saw in the time of trouble without a shelter! They had neglected the needful preparation, therefore they could not receive the refreshing that all must have to fit them to live in the sight of a holy God. Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets, and do not purify their souls in obeying the whole truth, and are willing to believe that their condition is far better than it really is, will come up to the time of the falling of the plagues, and then see that they needed to be hewed and squared for the building. \n59\nBut there will be no time then to do it; and no Mediator to plead their cause before the Father. Before this time, the awfully solemn declaration has gone forth, \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\u201d I saw that none could share the \u201crefreshing,\u201d unless they obtain the victory over every besetment, all pride, selfishness, love of the world, and over every wrong word and action. We should, therefore, be drawing nearer and nearer to the Lord, and be earnestly seeking that preparation necessary to enable us to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord. Let all remember that God is holy, and none but holy beings can ever dwell in his presence.",
