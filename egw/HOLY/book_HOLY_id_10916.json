    "word": "When men connected with the work of God allow themselves to be bought and sold, when they violate truth to gain the favor and approval of men, God records them in His book as betrayers of sacred trust. Let every man stand in moral independence, resolved that his mind shall be molded by the Holy Spirit. God calls for minutemen, who are not ready to voice the words of men who, if converted could exert a good influence, but unconverted, are not to be depended upon. In an emergency they are sure to lead into false paths. The Lord would not have us imitate any man, but follow on step by step to know Him. . . .",
