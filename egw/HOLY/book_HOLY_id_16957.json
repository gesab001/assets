    "word": "The gospel will be revealed and verified. The experience of the day of Pentecost will surely be repeated. Some will receive the Holy Spirit of truth; yea, some who are now in uncertainty. The Lord has given His word. For years he has been sending messages of warnings, but by many they have been unheeded. Notwithstanding the repeated urgent warnings God has given, many have been turned away from their original faith, and are lost in the fog of error. They have refused to follow the light that God has given to point out the true path.",
