    "word": "Jesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their penitence and faith, and, claiming for them forgiveness, he lifts his wounded hands before the Father and the holy angels, saying, \u201cI know them by name. I have graven them on the palms of my hands. \u2018The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.\u201d [Psalm 51:17.] And to the accuser of his people he declares, \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?\u2019 [Zechariah 3:2.] Christ will clothe his faithful ones with his own righteousness, that he may present them to his Father \u201ca glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.\u201d [Ephesians 5:27.] Their names stand enrolled in the book \n485\nof life, and concerning them it is written, \u201cThey shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.\u201d [Revelation 3:4.]",
