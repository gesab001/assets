    "word": "The office of the Holy Spirit is distinctly specified in the words of Christ: \"When He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.\" It is the Holy Spirit that convicts of sin. If the sinner responds to the quickening influence of the Spirit, he will be brought to repentance, and aroused to the importance of obeying the divine requirements.",
