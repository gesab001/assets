    "word": "There is need of far more consecrated, God-fearing educators. Oh, how my heart has been pained to see that the precious light given in Battle Creek at the last General Conference [1893] was not so cherished that every lamp was kept trimmed and burning, because supplied with the oil of grace. All the revelations of God at the Conference, I acknowledge as from Him. I dare not say that work was excitement, and unwarranted enthusiasm. No, no. God drew near to you, and His Holy Spirit revealed to you that He had a heaven full of blessings, even light to lighten the world. But the enemy \n\n\n                                    -347- \n\nwas allowed to come in and lead minds, and he did just what he will continue to do, if permitted, till the close of time; he allured souls from their allegiance, and led them to turn from the precious light and the deep movings of the Spirit of God.--Letter 47, 1893, pp. 1, 2 (October 25, 1893).",
