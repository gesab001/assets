    "word": "Unnecessary traveling is done on the Sabbath, with many other things which might be left undone. \"Take heed,\" saith the Lord, \"to all thy ways, lest I remove My Holy Spirit because of the lax regard given to My precepts.\" \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" Bear in mind the charge to remember. Do not carelessly forget, \"Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work.\" In this time all the duties necessary to prepare for the Sabbath are to be done.--Letter 51, 1901.",
