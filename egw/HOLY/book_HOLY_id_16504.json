    "word": "Christian missionary work is of great value to the home churches. By it the members, who know and believe the truth, are inspired with holy, sanctified zeal to deny self, to lift the cross of Christ, and labor with self-sacrificing zeal to send the truth to places nigh and afar off. Christian missionary work has a reflex influence upon the churches, an influence uplifting and sanctifying, demonstrating the importance of Christ's teaching in the sixth chapter of John. Christian missionary work has a salutary influence upon unbelievers; for as the workers labor under divine superintendence, worldlings are led to see the greatness of the resources God has provided for those who serve him. God's truth, demonstrated by the working of grace in the heart, multiplies the agencies of Christian usefulness and makes a decided impression upon the world.",
