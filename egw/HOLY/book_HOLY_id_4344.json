    "word": "Chap. 13. - The Latter Rain\n\n              The Work of the Spirit Likened to Rain \n\n     \"He will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain.\" In the East the former rain falls at the sowing time. It is necessary in order that the seed may germinate. Under the influence of the fertilizing showers the tender shoot springs up. The latter rain, falling near the close of the season, ripens the grain and prepares it for the sickle. The Lord employs these operations of nature to represent the work of the Holy Spirit. [See Zechariah 10:1; Hosea 6:3; Joel 2:23, 28.]",
