    "word": "The Holy Spirit invites all genuine prayer. I have learned to know that, in all my intercessions, the Spirit intercedes for me and for all saints whose intercessions are according to the will of God, we shall pray in conformity to His revealed will, and in submission to His will which we know not. . . . Jesus is waiting to breathe upon all His disciples, and give them the inspiration of His sanctifying Spirit, and transfuse the vital influence from Himself to His people. . . . Their will must be submitted to His will, they must act with His Spirit that it may be no more they that live, but \n\n\n                                    -335- \n\nChrist that liveth in them. Jesus is seeking to impress upon them the thought that in giving His Holy Spirit He is giving to them the glory which the Father hath given Him.--Letter 11b, 1892.",
