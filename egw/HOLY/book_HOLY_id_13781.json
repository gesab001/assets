    "word": "MR No. 299 - The Amadon Family\n\n     Brother Amadon knows something of our early experiences. He was a member of my family. I am sure that he remembers many of the strait places through which we passed. I am glad that Brother Amadon is now engaged in the Southern work. You may strengthen one another in the most holy faith. Each one is to stand in his lot and place.--Letter 262, 1903, p. 4. (To our ministers and other workers in the Southern States,\" November 24, 1903.)",
