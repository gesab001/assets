    "word": "God has bought us, and He claims a throne in each heart. Our minds and bodies must be subordinated to Him; and the natural habits and appetites must be made subservient to the higher wants of the soul. But we can place no dependence upon ourselves in this work. We cannot with safety follow our own guidance. The Holy Spirit must renew and sanctify us. And in God's service there must be no halfway work. Those who profess to serve God and yet indulge their natural impulses will mislead other souls. Said Christ, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\" (Matthew 22:37). \"This do, and thou shalt live\" (Luke 10:28).--Manuscript Releases, vol. 18, pp. 47, 48.",
