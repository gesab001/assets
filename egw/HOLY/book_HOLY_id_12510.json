    "word": "The Seventh-day Adventists who profess to be looking for, and loving, the appearing of Christ, should not follow the course of worldlings. They are no criterion for commandment-keepers. Neither should they pattern after the first-day Adventists, who trample under foot the law of God, and who will not acknowledge its claims. This class should be no criterion for them. Commandment-keeping Adventist are occupying a peculiar, exalted position. John viewed them in holy vision, and described them. Here are they who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.",
