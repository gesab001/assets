    "word": "MR No. 1431 - Knowledge, Spurious and Genuine\n\n     There is a spurious knowledge, the knowledge of evil and sin, which has been brought into the world by the cunning of Satan. The pursuit of this knowledge is prompted by unsanctified desires, unholy aims. Its lessons are dearly bought, but many will not be convinced that they are better left unlearned. The sons and daughters of Adam are fully as inquisitive and presumptuous as was Eve. They venture, contrary to the will of God, to gain knowledge which results, as did Eve's, in the loss of Eden.",
