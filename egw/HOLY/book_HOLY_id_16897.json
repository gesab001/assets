    "word": "I am grateful to my heavenly Father for the preservation of my health for the close application to prepare a repetition of the experiences we have had in the past, as we have prepared testimonies in regard to our first labors and the matter is in print. We have a large amount of matter which the Lord has given me, which light and instruction should not be hid under a bushel or under a bed. The warnings and the messages that the Lord has graciously given me to correct the errors that would come in, and to set things in order, the people should have, for the enemy will continue to work to bring in false theories and to mingle with the truth strange suppositions. These appear as light to those who receive them, but they are deceptive theories that will be brought in as tares sown among the wheat. The Lord has for the last fifty years been instructing me when the seducing theories would arise that they were not to be received, and I must do as did Moses and Joshua: Repeat the errors of the past and the gracious working out of the Lord's will. I praise His holy name.",
