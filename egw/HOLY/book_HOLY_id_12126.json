    "word": "The true ambassador of Christ is not given to jesting, to trifling, idle talk, for the word of God condemns this: but he is cheerful, showing forth the praises of Him who has called him out of darkness into his marvelous light. Every minister who after his discourse will engage in frivolous conversation, counteracts all the influence of his words in the sacred desk. He does no honor to God or to the truth, but brings the most sacred things down upon a level with common things, and makes of no effect the truth of heavenly origin. Those who do not walk by the rule laid down by the word of God should \n\n\n                        - 24 - \n\nbe faithfully admonished, and if they fail to reform, should be deprived of their license or credentials. Otherwise the Conference that has sanctioned the labors of these men will share their guilt. It is a mercy to the unfaithful laborer himself to remove him from his position, for the rebuke of God is upon him. It is a duty enjoined by Heaven, that souls may not be contaminated by the unholy spiritual atmosphere which surrounds him. You should not cast him off as a reprobate, but let your dealing with him show him that he has mistaken his calling. The Lord has laid no such burden upon him, or if he has, the man has never taken it. He is not united to Christ; he knows not the influence of the Holy Spirit of God upon the soul; he has not fixed his eyes upon Jesus, and by beholding, become changed into his image.",
