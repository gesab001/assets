    "word": "Prayer and Faith. \n\n      When at Battle Creek, Mich., May 5, 1855, I saw that there was a great lack of faith in the servants of God, as well as the church. They were too easily discouraged; were too ready to doubt God; too willing to believe they had a hard lot, and that God had forsaken them. I saw that this was cruel. God had so loved them as to give his dearly beloved Son to die for them, and all Heaven was interested in their salvation; yet it was hard, after all that has been done for them, to believe and trust so kind and good a Father. He has said he was more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him, than earthly parents are to give good gifts to their children. I saw that the servants of God and the church were too easily discouraged. When they asked their Father in Heaven for things they thought they needed, and because it did not immediately come, their faith wavered, their courage fled, and a murmuring feeling took possession of them. This I saw displeased God.",
