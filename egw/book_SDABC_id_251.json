    "word": "Chapter 16 \n\n     23, 24. Garments of the High Priest.--As the high priest laid aside his pontifical dress, and officiated in the white linen dress of a common priest, so Christ emptied Himself, and took the form of a servant, and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. As the high priest, after performing his service in the holy of holies, came forth to the waiting congregation in his pontifical robes, so Christ will come the second time clothed \n                                                                           1112\nin glorious garments of the whitest white, \"such as no fuller on earth can whiten them.\" He will come in His own glory, and in the glory of His Father, as King of kings and Lord of lords, and all the angelic host will escort Him on His way (MS 113, 1899).",
