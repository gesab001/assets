    "word": "Love for lost souls brought Christ to Calvary's cross. Love for souls will lead us to self-denial and sacrifice, for the saving of that which is lost. And as Christ's followers give back to the Lord His own, they are accumulating treasure which will be theirs when they hear the words: \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,\" \"who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\" Matthew 25:21; Hebrews 12:2. The joy of seeing souls eternally saved will be the reward of all who follow in the steps of the Redeemer. \n\n                                               -",
