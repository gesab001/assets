{"word": "Let not one rasping word be spoken. Let all sharp speeches that you are disposed to make, be kept to your individual self. Be as true as steel to principle, wise as a serpent, but harmless as a dove. If your words are not to hurt anyone, you will have to speak only the words that you are sure will not be harsh and cold and severe. . . . Of all the people in the world, reformers should be the most unselfish, the kindest, the most courteous, learning Christ's ways and words and works.--Letter 11, 1894. \n                                                                           304", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 303}
