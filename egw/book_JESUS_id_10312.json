{"word": "The secrets of the Lord are with them that fear Him and keep His covenant. We need faith in God, that under the sanctifying power of God's Word, the principles of human brotherhood may be manifested. We need the Holy Spirit's guidance. Its power upon mind and heart will enable us to present the truths of God's Holy Word. Sound doctrines brought into actual contact with human souls will result in sound and elevating practices. The truth as it is in Jesus must be cherished. Then Christians will not be Christians in name only. The love of Christ will pervade their lives.--Ibid., Feb. 28, 1899.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 113}
