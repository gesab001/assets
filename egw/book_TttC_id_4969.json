    "word": "Those truly love their neighbor as themselves who realize their responsibilities and the claims that suffering humanity has upon them, and carry out the principles of God's law in their daily lives. \"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What is written in the law? \n                                                                           58\nhow readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. And He said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.\" Christ here shows the lawyer that to love God with all the heart and our neighbor as ourselves is the true fruit of piety. \"This do,\" said He, not merely believe but do, \"and thou shalt live.\" It is not alone the professed belief in the binding claims of God's law that makes the Christian, but also the carrying out of that law.",
