The sunlight lay on templed cities, marble palaces, fruitful fields and vineyards, gilding the dark cedars of Lebanon and the blue waters of Galilee. The eyes of Jesus, so lately greeted by gloom and desolation, gazed upon a scene of unsurpassed loveliness and prosperity.

If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 95}
