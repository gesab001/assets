{"word": "Were it not for the love freely given us of Christ, we should now be in hopeless despair, in spiritual midnight. Thank God every day that He gave us Jesus. Will you not accept His gift? Will you not be His witness? Time is short, and it becomes you to work while the day lasts, living an imperishable life, hiding your life with Christ in God. Then \"when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory\" (Colossians 3:4).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 59}
