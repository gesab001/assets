{"word": "Prior to and at the first advent of Christ, religious teachers set forth strange ideas that were so mingled with portions of truth that they were full of deceptive power, and led souls away from God, although they still preserved the appearance of being His true worshipers. We find a similar condition of society in these last days, and those who depart from the faith, mingle with their belief diversities of human opinion. The Bible is brought into criticism. Is it because the Scriptures are inconsistent and contradictory that ministers differ so widely in their interpretation? --No, the trouble is that men are doing today as they did in the time of Christ, and are teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Religious teachers are in the same condition as were the Pharisees of whom He said, \"Ye are both ignorant of the Scriptures and of the power of God\" (see Matthew 22:29). The very men to whom these words were spoken were presumed to teach and interpret the Scriptures to the people.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 164}
