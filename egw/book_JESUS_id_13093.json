And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?\" Had the voices of those happy children been silenced, the very pillars of the temple would have sounded the Saviour's praise. Jesus was ever a lover of children; he accepted their childish sympathy and their open, unaffected love. The grateful praise from their pure lips was music in his ears, and refreshed his spirits which were depressed by the hypocrisy of the Jews. On this occasion he had healed the maladies of the children, clasped them in his arms, received their kisses of grateful affection, and they had fallen asleep upon his breast while he was teaching the people. Wherever the Saviour went the benignity of his countenance, and his gentle, kindly manner won the love and confidence of children.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 26}
