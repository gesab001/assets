    "word": "You need to cultivate kindness and tenderness. You need to be pitiful and courteous. Your labors savor too much of severity and an exacting, dictatorial, overbearing spirit.

More love in your labors, and more kindly sympathy, would give you access to hearts and would win souls to Christ and the truth.",
