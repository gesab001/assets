    "word": "And I saw another field full of all kinds of flowers, and as I plucked them, I cried out: \"They will never fade.\" Next I saw a field of tall grass, most glorious to behold; it was living green, and had a reflection of silver and gold, as it waved proudly to the glory of King Jesus. Then we entered a field full of all kinds of beasts--the lion, the lamb, the leopard, and the wolf, all together in perfect union. We passed through the midst of them, and they followed on peaceably after. Then we entered a wood, not like the dark woods we have here; no, no; but light, and all over glorious; the branches of the trees waved to and fro, and we all cried out: \"We will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.\" We passed through the woods, for we were on our way to Mount Zion.",
