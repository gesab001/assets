{"word": "A Similar Work in Every Church \n\n     Sabbath, November 10, I visited San Francisco, and spoke to a church full of people who had ears to hear and \n                                                                           152\nhearts to understand. . . . After I had finished speaking, Elder Corliss invited all who wished to give themselves to Jesus to come forward. There was a quick and happy response, and I was told that nearly two hundred persons came forward. Men and women, youth and children, pressed into the front seats. The Lord would be pleased to have a work similar to this done in every church.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "1SM", "page": 151}
