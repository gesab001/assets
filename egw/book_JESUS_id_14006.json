{"word": "Number Three - Be Zealous and Repent.\n\n     Dear brethren and sisters, the Lord has shown me in vision some things concerning the church in its present lukewarm state, which I will relate to you. The church was presented before me in vision. Said the angel to the church, \"Jesus speaks to thee, 'Be zealous and repent.'\" This work I saw should be taken hold of in earnest. There is something to repent of. Worldly-mindedness, selfishness and covetousness, have been eating out the spirituality and life of God's people.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "4bSG", "page": 26}
