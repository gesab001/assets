    "word": "Your example has not been good. You have not come to the point to obey the words of Christ: \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Here are lessons that you have not learned. The denial of self has not been a part of your education. You have neglected to study the words of life. \"Search the Scriptures,\" said the heavenly Teacher. He knew that this was necessary for all in order for them to become Christ's true followers. You love to read storybooks, but do not find the word of God interesting. You should restrict your reading to the word of God \n                                                                           82\nand to books that are of a spiritual and useful character. In so doing you will close a door against temptation, and you will be blessed.",
