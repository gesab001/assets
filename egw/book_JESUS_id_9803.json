IT WASN'T JUST A MATTER OF PAYING A DEBT FOR THE SINS OF THE HUMAN FAMILY. JESUS\\92 LIFE DEMONSTRATED GOD'S IDEALS FOR HIS CREATURES. JESUS\\92 MINISTRY FOCUSED ON REVEALING WHAT MEN AND WOMEN COULD BECOME AS CHILDREN OF GOD, PARTICULARLY IF THEY WERE TAUGHT TO RESPOND TO HIS GRACE AT A YOUNG AGE.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PCP", "page": 9}
