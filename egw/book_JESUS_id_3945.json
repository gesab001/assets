{"word": "After Jesus had been nailed to the cross, it was raised and with great force thrust into the place which had been prepared for it in the ground, tearing the flesh and causing the most intense suffering. To make the death of Jesus as shameful as possible, two thieves were crucified with Him, one on each side. The thieves were taken by force, and after much resistance on their part, their arms were thrust back and nailed to their crosses. But Jesus meekly submitted. He needed no one to force His arms back upon the cross. While the thieves were cursing their executioners, the Saviour in agony prayed for His enemies, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\" It was not merely agony of body which Christ endured; the sins of the whole world were upon Him. \n                                                                           177", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 176}
