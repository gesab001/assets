    "word": "Items of Experience \n\n     The editors of our papers need the co-operation of our laborers in the field and of our people far and near. In our papers should be found communications from the workers in all parts of the world--articles giving living experiences. We do not need romance; but in the daily life there are real experiences that, if told in short articles and in simple words, would be more fascinating than romance, while at the same time they would be an invaluable aid to Christian experience and to practical missionary work. We want truth, solid truth, from consecrated men, women, and youth.",
