    "word": "A grand work is to be done by our people for the W. C. T. U. . . . We need the help that these women workers can give us; they need the help we can give them in a knowledge of the gospel Sabbath. By holding ourselves aloof from the workers in the W. C. T. U., our people have lost much; and the members of the W. C. T. U. have also been on losing ground. If every possible effort is now made to reach these people, prejudice will be removed, and souls will be reached whom our people have thought would never accept this present truth.",
