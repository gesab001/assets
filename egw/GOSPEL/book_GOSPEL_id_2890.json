    "word": "Not for Himself, but for others did He labor. He was the servant of all. It was His meat and drink to bring hope and strength to all with whom He came in contact. And as men and women listened to the truths that fell from His lips ... hope sprang up in their hearts. In His teaching there was an earnestness that sent His words home with convicting power.--Gospel Workers, p. 188.",
