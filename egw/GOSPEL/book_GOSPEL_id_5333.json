    "word": "I firmly believe that we shall see of the salvation of God if we will take Him at His word. The very gospel that we present to save perishing souls must be to us the gospel that saves our own souls. We must eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God. We must receive the word of God. To all intents and purposes, we must eat the word, live the word. It is the flesh of the Son of God. We must drink of His blood, the spiritual attributes of Jesus Christ, and constantly develop as the result of the nourishment which the soul receives in eating His flesh and drinking His blood. Then our lips will utter His praise. \n\n\n                                -3-",
