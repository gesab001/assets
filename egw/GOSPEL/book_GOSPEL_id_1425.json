    "word": "Luke is called \"the beloved physician.\" Paul heard of his skill as a physician, and he sought him out as one to whom the Lord had entrusted a special work. He secured his co-operation in his work. After a time he left him at Philippi. Here Luke continued to labor for several years, doing double service as a physician and a gospel minister. He was indeed a medical missionary. He did his part, and then besought the Lord to let His healing power rest upon the afflicted ones. His medical skill opened the way for the gospel message to find access to hearts. It opened many doors for him, giving him opportunity to preach the gospel among the heathen. . . .",
