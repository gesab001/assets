    "word": "The Lord would have the restraints broken that keep his work bound about by the wisdom of men. Those who unite with Christ are not to accept yokes which will prove a hindrance to them in their work with him. He says, \"Come unto me. . . and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. The true and living God is to be exalted. All nations are to hear the proclamation of the gospel message.",
