    "word": "Fierce Opposition \n\n     It is as true now as when Christ was upon earth that every inroad made by the gospel upon the enemy's dominion is met by fierce opposition from his vast armies. The conflict that is right upon us will be the most terrible ever witnessed. But though Satan is represented as being as strong as the strong man armed, his overthrow will be complete, and every one who unites with him in choosing apostasy rather than loyalty will perish with him. 6T 407.",
