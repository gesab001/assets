    "word": "Enoch walked with God. So may every laborer for Christ. You may say with the psalmist, \u201cI have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved\u201d (Psalm 16:8). While you feel that you have no sufficiency of yourself, your sufficiency will be in Jesus. If you expect all your counsel and wisdom to come from other people, mortal and finite like yourselves, you will receive only human help. If you go to God for help and wisdom, He will never disappoint your faith.\u2014Gospel Workers, pp. 417, 418.",
