Satan Tried to Make a Contract With Christ.-- [Luke 4:5-8 quoted.] This presumptuous blasphemy, and insult to Jehovah, excited the indignation of Christ, and led Him to exercise His divine authority, and command Satan in an authoritative, dignified manner to desist. Here Satan, in his pride and arrogance, declared himself to be the rightful and permanent ruler of the world, the possessor of all its glory, as though he had created the world and all the riches and glory contained in it. He endeavored to make a special contract with Christ, to make over to Him at once the whole of his claim, if He would worship him.  {5BC 1119.11}  \n     Here Satan showed Jesus the kingdoms of the world. They were presented in the most attractive light. He offered them to Jesus if He would there worship him. He told Jesus that he would relinquish his claims of the possessions of earth. Satan knew that his power must be limited, and finally taken away, if the plan of salvation should be carried out. He knew that if Jesus should die to redeem man, his power would end after a season, and he would be destroyed. Therefore it was his studied plan to prevent, if possible, the completion of the great work which had been commenced by the Son of God. If the plan of man's redemption should fail, he would retain the kingdom which he then claimed. And if he should succeed, he flattered himself that he would reign in opposition to the God of heaven (Redemption: or The First Advent of Christ, pp. 50, 51).  {5BC 1119.12}  \n     6. Two Parties and Two Banners.--Satan has called this world his territory. Here his seat is, and he holds in allegiance to himself all who refuse to keep God's commandments, who reject a plain, \"Thus saith the Lord.\" They stand under the enemy's banner; for there are but two parties in the world. All rank either under the banner of the obedient or under the banner of the disobedient (MS 41, 1898).  {5BC 1119.13}  \n     8. See EGW on Matthew 4:10.  {5BC 1119.14}  \n     13. See EGW on Matthew 4:11.  {5BC 1119.15}  \n     18, 19. (Matthew 7:29; 22:29; Mark 12:37). The Gospel to the Poor.-- Christ came to \n                                                                           1120\npreach the gospel to the poor. He reached the people where they were. He brought plain, simple truth to their comprehension. How simple His language! Even the poorest, the unlearned and ignorant, could understand Him. Not one needed go to a dictionary to obtain the meaning of the high-sounding titles or words that fell from the lips of the greatest Teacher the world ever knew. While the priests, the rulers, and the expounders of the law were considering themselves as the only teachers of the people, He told these learned rabbis that they were both ignorant of the Scriptures and of the power of God (RH July 19, 1887).  {5BC 1119.16}\n \n                             Chapter 5 \n\n     29 (Matthew 9:9, 10; Mark 2:14, 15). Matthew Honored Christ Before Friends.--In his grateful humility, Matthew desired to show his appreciation of the honor bestowed upon him, and, calling together those who had been his associates in business, in pleasure, and sin, he made a great feast for the Saviour. If Jesus would call him, who was so sinful and unworthy, He would surely accept his former companions who were, thought Matthew, far more deserving than himself. Matthew had a great longing that they should share the benefits of the mercies and grace of Christ. He desired them to know that Christ did not, as did the scribes and Pharisees, despise and hate the publicans and sinners. He wanted them to know Christ as the blessed Saviour.",
