    "word": "MR No. 293 - The Relation of Ministers and Physicians\n\n     It is as much required by God that His followers shall in the medical profession reveal the spirit of Christ in harmonizing in their work as that the ministers of the gospel shall harmonize in their labors for the salvation of souls. This independence to do every one as appears right in his own eyes is after satanic order, but not after Christ. There is need of thorough order and all after Christ, in the medical profession.--Letter 11c, 1892, p. 2. (To S. N. Haskell, February 11, 1892.)",
