    "word": "The reproach of Christ is upon us, His people. The gospel of Christ and His love and Him crucified was a stumbling block to the Jews, and it has been evidenced that it is a stumbling block to many who claim to believe present truth. They are forever coming against the Rock of offense. \"Man has been placed where God should be,\" are the words that have been spoken to me again and again. Christ has made one sufficient sacrifice, and has become the only Mediator and sole Priest between God and man. Let every man stand out of the way, and occupy his own place as wearing Christ's yoke.",
