    "word": "I am fully in favor of this resolution, because I know that medical missionary work is the gospel, in practice, and, as the Lord has declared, is never, never to be separated from the gospel ministry.

What we need is to seek earnestly for kindness and humility. Our hearts need to be cleansed from all that has led to separation, to the speaking of words which would not have been spoken if men had sincerely tried to see what the medical missionary work is really doing.",
