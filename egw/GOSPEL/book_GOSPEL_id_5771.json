    "word": "I was reading in Isaiah this morning that the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel to the meek. I desire the meekness of Christ; and yet, when I see men interposing their unsanctified decision in the way of the Lord's work I shall not be clear in holding my peace. I shall speak decidedly; I shall not be silent, although my mission and the work given me of God may not be recognized by some in your councils. But I dare not be silent, whether men will hear or forbear. I have had my commission, \"Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins.\" There are many things that God does not approve that pass current in Battle Creek.",
