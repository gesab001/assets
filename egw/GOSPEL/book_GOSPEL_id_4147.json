    "word": "Like every other one of God's good gifts entrusted to the keeping of humanity, marriage has been perverted by sin; but it is the purpose of the gospel to restore its purity and beauty. In both the Old and the New Testament the marriage relation is employed to represent the tender and sacred union that exists between Christ and His people, the redeemed ones whom He has purchased at the cost of Calvary. \"Fear not,\" He says; \"thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is His name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.\" \"Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you.\" Isaiah 54:4, 5; Jeremiah 3:14. In the \"Song of Songs\" we hear the bride's voice saying, \"My Beloved is mine, and I am His.\" And He who is to her \"the chiefest among ten thousand,\" speaks to His chosen one, \"Thou art all fair, My love; there is no spot in thee.\" Song of Solomon 2:16; 5:10; 4:7.",
