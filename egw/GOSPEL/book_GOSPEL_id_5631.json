    "word": "The matter of the Gospel Primer is not healed. This matter is presented to me again and again. A patchwork effort has been made to set things right, but this effort the Lord does not accept. Unless the men who took part in this work learn the meaning of true principle, unless they have eyes to see and ears to hear and hearts to understand, unless they realize that God's work is sacred in His sight, they might better sever their connection with the work. The reproach of God rests upon the effort made to keep back funds from the Southern field.",
