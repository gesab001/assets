    "word": "As God works in us to will, we are to cooperate with God, manifesting a determination like that of Daniel to do the will of God. Teachers of the word of God are not to keep back any part of the counsel of God, lest the people shall be ignorant of their duty, and not understand what is the will of God concerning them, and stumble and fall into perdition. But while the teacher of truth should be faithful in presenting the gospel, let him never pour out a mass of matter which the people cannot comprehend because it is new to them and hard to understand. Take one point at a time, and make that one point plain, speaking slowly and in distinct voice. Speak in such a way that the people shall see what is the relation of that one point to other truths of vital importance.",
