    "word": "The word of God is a great simplifier of life's complicated pursuits. To every earnest seeker, it imparts a divine wisdom. We should never forget that we have been redeemed by suffering. It is the precious blood of Christ that makes atonement for us. By toil and sacrifice and peril, by losses of worldly goods, and in agony of soul, the gospel has been borne to the world. God calls young men in the vigor and strength of their youth, to share with him self-denial, sacrifice, and suffering. If they accept the call, he will make them his instruments to save souls for whom he died. But he would have them count the cost, and enter upon their work with a full knowledge of the conditions upon which they serve a crucified Redeemer.",
