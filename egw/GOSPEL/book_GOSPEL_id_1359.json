To be \"instant in season\" is to be alert to the privileges of the house and hour of worship, and to the times when men are conversing on topics of religion. And to be instant \"out of season\" is to be ready, when at the fireside, in the field, by the wayside, in the market, to turn the minds of men, in a suitable manner, to the great themes of the Bible, with tender, fervent spirit urging upon them the claims of God. Many, many such opportunities are allowed to slip by unimproved, because men are persuaded that it is out of season. But who knows what might be the effect of a wise appeal to the conscience?-- Gospel Workers, pp. 186-187. (1915)",
