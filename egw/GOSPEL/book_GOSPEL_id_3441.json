    "word": "Some of the servants of God have given up their lives, to spend and be spent, for the cause of God, while their constitutions are gone, and they are almost worn out with mental labor, incessant care, toil, and privations, while others have not had, and would not take, the burden upon them. Yet just such ones think they have a hard time, because they never have experienced hardships. They never have been baptized into the suffering part, and never will be as long as they manifest so much weakness, and so little fortitude, and love their ease so well. Let these servants feel the woe upon them if they preach not the gospel, and it will be enough; but all do not feel this.",
