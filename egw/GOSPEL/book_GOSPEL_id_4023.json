    "word": "9 T.--163 \n     While working against gluttony and intemperance, we must recognize the condition to which the human family is subjected. God has made provision for those who live in the different countries of the world. Those who desire to be co-workers with God must consider carefully before they specify just what foods should and should not be eaten. We are to be brought into connection with the masses. Should health reform in its most extreme form be taught to those whose circumstances forbid its adoption, more harm than good would be done. As I preach the gospel to the poor, I am instructed to tell them to eat that food which is most nourishing. I can not say to them: \"You must not eat eggs, or milk, or cream. You must use no butter in the preparation of food.\" The gospel must be preached to the poor, but the time has not yet come to prescribe the strictest diet.",
