    "word": "I am very much pleased, Brother-----, to know that you are planning to connect with the Nashville Sanitarium. I believe that the Lord is in this matter, and I pray that he will bless you in taking up this responsibility. If you can help Dr. Hayward and those connected with him in designing and putting up the sanitarium building, we shall indeed be very grateful. I know that as soon as possible a sanitarium should be established near Nashville. Medical missionary work is indeed the helping hand of the gospel ministry, and opens the way for the entrance of the truth. The importance of this line of work can not be overestimated.",
