    "word": "To every church the instruction is given to gather in the ignorant and those who need help. The candlestick is to be brought from under the bushel and light given to all that are in the house. The Lord has men of opportunity in the world, and these will embrace the truth if proper labor is bestowed in their behalf. The Lord says, \"I will open ways in the highway and in the desert.\" Let not large means be consumed in a few places while we begrudge the needed means to other localities. When opportunities arrive such as has recently come to us, it is for us to see and understand that the Lord is opening the way, that souls may be converted and become sowers of the truth of the gospel. I present this instruction to you as a servant of the Lord, and repeat, Take advantage of the providence of God. Then give the churches a chance to economize on their tables, in their homes, in their church expenditures, and to follow Christ's example of faithful, untiring labor. Again I say, Secure the Chamberlain place if you can. The Lord grant that you may not be too late. \n                                Ellen G. White. \n\n\n                                     -440-",
