    "word": "It is essential that we study our Bibles more diligently, that we become more choice in our conversation, for this can be an influence for good. We need to see and sense the inefficiency of human accomplishments, our own impotence, and the dignity and glory of Christ Jesus. The Lord puts us under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, if we will walk humbly, trustingly, confidingly in Him. He leads us into all truth.

He the Alpha and the Omega delivers us into the mold of the gospel that we may take the perfect image of its Author.",
