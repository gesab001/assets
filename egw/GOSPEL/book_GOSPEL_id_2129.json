    "word": "Make the Health Food Work a Blessing\n     For all who are engaged in the health food business I have words of counsel. I have said that food stores and hygienic restaurants should be established in cities, and that they should be so conducted that they will be the means of reaching people with the gospel message for this time. All our restaurants are to be so conducted that there will not be an accumulation of debt. If debts accumulate, even though the patronage is large, there needs to be a careful, thorough investigation of the business, and such changes should be made as will put \n68\nit on a paying basis. A restaurant should not be maintained at a continual financial loss.",
