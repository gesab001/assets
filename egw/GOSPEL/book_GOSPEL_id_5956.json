    "word": "I have been shown that the evangelistic labors of the gospel minister are not to be directed by a fellow minister. The workers for God should inquire of Him, the fountain of wisdom, in regard to their labors. They are to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit of God. God is able to move upon their minds, and to guide them with judgment. \"The meek will He guide with judgment, and the meek will He teach His way.\" God will work with those who will listen to His voice.",
