    "word": "Satan is moving with his power from beneath to inspire men to form alliances and confederacies of evil against light and against the Word of God. Infidelity, papacy, and semi-papacy are coming in close and powerful companionship with professed Christianity. The low views of inspiration, the exalting of human ideas from men called wise, are placing human talent above the divine wisdom and forms, and science so-called above the power of vital godliness. These are the signs of the last days. Let every one who believes in Jesus Christ . . . use his talent of voice in exalting Jesus and presenting testimonies that will magnify, honor, and adore the Word of God. . . . The gospel makes itself known in its power in the consistent, holy, pure lives of those who are believers, hearers, and doers of the Word.",
