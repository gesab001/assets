    "word": "When the disciples returned from their first missionary tour, the Saviour asked them, \"Lacked ye anything?\" And the answer was given, \"Nay, Lord.\" The same power that supplied the needs of the first disciples will provide for the necessities of those who today go forth to labor earnestly to give the last gospel message to the world.
