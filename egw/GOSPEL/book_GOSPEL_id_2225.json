    "word": "\"Men and women are going forth more and more to carry the gospel message. We thank God for this, but we need a greater awakening. . . .

We will not say that we are destitute of laborers. We are glad that there are some; but there is a greater, a far greater work to be done in our cities.\" [IDEM, P. 98.]",
