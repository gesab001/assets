    "word": "Combine with Gospel Ministry \n\n     The gospel and the medical missionary work are to advance together. The gospel is to be bound up with the principles of true health reform. Christianity is to be brought into the practical life. Earnest, thorough, reformatory work is to be done. . . . We are to present the principles of health reform before the people, doing all in our power to lead men and women to see the necessity of these principles, and to practice them.--Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 379.",
