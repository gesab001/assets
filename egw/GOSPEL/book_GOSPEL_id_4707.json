    "word": "The Lord says, \"Enlarge your borders.\" The power of the Gospel is expansive. Men are to be devoted soul-savers, and should have something to show for their labors. If the workers fail to produce fruit, something may be wrong with the tree. The cost of working the vineyard must be made as little as possible, because there is a large territory to be worked. As men are employed in different places they should always be looked after to see what is the result of their labor. If the tree bears no fruit, it may be because it needs to be transplanted. If after proper labor it still has no fruit to bear, let it be removed; let the laborer be dismissed as an unprofitable servant in the work of soul saving, and encouraged to go into \n\n\n                      (5) \n\nsome business, by which he can earn means to act his part in sustaining laborers which can work successfully--persons with tact and wisdom, who, in the fear of God, will win souls to Christ.",
