    "word": "The message itself sheds light as to the time when this movement is to take place. It is declared to be a part of the \u201ceverlasting gospel;\u201d and it announces the opening of the Judgment. The message of salvation has been preached in all ages; but this message is a part of the gospel which could be proclaimed only in the last days, for only then \n356\nwould it be true that the hour of Judgment had come. The prophecies present a succession of events leading down to the opening of the Judgment. This is especially true of the book of Daniel. But that part of his prophecy which related to the last days, Daniel was bidden to close up and seal \u201cto the time of the end.\u201d Not till we reach this time could a message concerning the Judgment be proclaimed, based on a fulfillment of these prophecies. But at the time of the end, says the prophet, \u201cmany shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.\u201d [Daniel 12:4.]",
