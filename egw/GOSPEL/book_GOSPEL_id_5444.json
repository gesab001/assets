    "word": "In endeavoring to harmonize with worldly sentiments, Dr. Kellogg does not discern the influences that are exercised upon the commandment-keeping people of God. His spiritual eyesight is not clear. Not all of his work is approved by God. No one who has had the light of truth before him for years, and has not yielded to its influence, can be expected to be sensitive to the clear, gospel sentiments of the truth. There is constant danger that the obedient and the disobedient in the world and in the nominal churches will become so amalgamated that the line of demarkation between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not will become confused and indistinct.",
