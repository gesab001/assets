    "word": "A High Standard \n\n     In our sanitariums we must seek to uplift a high standard. The banner of truth, goodness, and usefulness must ever be raised. The blessed fruits of the gospel tree are to be manifested in thorough consecration, in holy lives. Every true worker for the Master is to be as a city set on a hill, that cannot be hid. The physicians and managers in our medical institutions must be guarded; otherwise they will surely deny the principles of truth and righteousness, which exalt the Lord of heaven. They must have God dwelling in their hearts, or they will set an example to others that will be to their injury.",
