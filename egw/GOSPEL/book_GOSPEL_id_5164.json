    "word": "Dr. Kellogg, you have not in all things been following the Lord's plan. The medical missionary work should be as the right arm of the body of truth, but this work has been made to absorb so much that to all intents and purposes it has become the body. God did not design that this work should eclipse the work of the third angel's message. This message is the gospel message for these last days, and in no case is it to be overshadowed by other interests, and made to appear an unessential consideration. . . .",
