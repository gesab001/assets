    "word": "As he pondered these things in his heart, Paul understood more and more the meaning of his call to be \"an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God\" (Ephesians 1:1). His call had come \"not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father\" (Galatians 1:1). The greatness of the work before him led him to give much study to the Holy Scriptures, in order that he might preach the gospel \"not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect\" (1 Corinthians 1:17), \"but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,\" that the faith of all who heard \"should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God\" (1 Corinthians 2:4, 5).--Review and Herald, March 30, 1911.",
