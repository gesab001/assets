    "word": "I entreat the heralds of the gospel of Christ never to become discouraged, never to regard the most hardened sinner as beyond the reach of the grace of God. The one apparently hopeless may accept the truth in the love of it. He who turns the hearts of men as the rivers of water are turned, can bring the most selfish, sin-hardened soul to Christ. Is anything too hard for God to do? \"My word,\" He declares, \"shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\" [Isaiah 55:11.]",
