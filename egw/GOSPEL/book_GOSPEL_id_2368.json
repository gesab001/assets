    "word": "The teaching of the Bible in regard to character building is very explicit. \"Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.\" Place yourself under His control, and then ask for His protecting power. He gave His life for you. Do not cause Him sorrow. Be guarded in all that you say and do. \n                                                                           43\nChrist wants you to be to other young men His representative, His delegated gospel medical missionary.",
