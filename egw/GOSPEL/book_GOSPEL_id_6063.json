    "word": "George's Terrace, February 6, 1894 \nMr. and Mrs. J. E. White \n\nDear Children: \n\n\n     Under the showers of the latter rain the inventions of man, the human machinery, will at times be swept away, the boundary of man's authority will be as broken reeds, and the Holy Spirit will speak through the living, human agent with convincing power. No one then will watch to see if the sentences are well rounded off, if the grammar is faultless. The living water will flow in God's own channels. But let us be careful now not to exalt the men, their sayings and doings; and let not anyone consider it a grand point to have a startling experience to relate; for here is a fruitful field where credence will be given to unworthy persons. Young men and women will be lifted up, and will regard themselves as wonderfully favored, called to do \n\n144. \n\nsome great thing. There will be conversions many, after a peculiar order but they will not bear the divine signature. Immorality will come in and extravagance and many will make ship-wreck of faith. Our only safety is in keeping fast hold of Jesus. Never are we to lose sight of Him. He says, \"Without Me you can do nothing.\" We must cultivate an abiding sense of our own inefficiency and helplessness and rely wholly on Jesus. This should keep us individually calm and steadfast in words and deportment. Excitement in the speaker is not power but weakness. Earnestness and energy are essential in presenting Bible truth, the gospel, which is the power of God unto salvation. . . .",
