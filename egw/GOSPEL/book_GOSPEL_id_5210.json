    "word": "MR No. 849 - Work for the Jews\n\n     We are to be interested in the salvation of those who belong to the nation that was broken off the vine center, that we [Gentiles] might be grafted in. Special efforts are to be made for the Jewish race. If they receive Christ as their Saviour, there is power in the gospel message that they may again be grafted in. They are children of the heavenly birth, and we are responsible for the proclamation of the gospel to them.--Ms. 111, 1906, pp. 3, 4. (\"A Warning Against Formalism,\" Oct. 22, 1906.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. April 27, 1981",
