    "word": "At this meeting, thousands have heard the gospel invitation, and have listened to truths that they never have heard before. During the whole meeting, there has not been any boisterous opposition, or loud contention from those whose hearts are opposed to the law of God. And throughout the city, we hear of no public opposition. This is an unusual experience; and we believe\n260\nthat the angels of God have been present to press back the powers of darkness.\u2014RH March 21, 1899.",
