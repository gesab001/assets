    "word": "\"A mistake has been made in putting young men forward to speak at our camp meetings, before large congregations, when they had not the vital truths to present that were appropriate for the occasion.  Precious time has been occupied by those who did not themselves know the true message for this time.  Pioneers in the cause -- men who had the bread of life to give to the people, men whose hearts and minds were filled with the vital truths needed by the hundreds and thousands of people assembled -- have sat and listened to young preachers who could not do justice to the occasion.  Not even half work was done in the presentation of the gospel message.\"",
