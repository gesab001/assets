    "word": "The solemn work of the gospel minister is to make all men see \"what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God.\" If one enters upon this work choosing the least self-sacrificing part of it, contenting himself with preaching, and leaving the work of ministering for some one else to do, he need not expect that his labors will be acceptable to God. Souls for whom Christ has died are perishing for want of well-directed personal labor; and when the minister is not willing to be a servant of the people, as Jesus has directed in his word, then he has mistaken his calling. Those who minister in the sacred desk should fall upon the Rock and be broken; then the Lord will put his superscription upon them, and fashion them as vessels unto honor. If those who engage in the work of the ministry were indeed laborers together with God, we should see a solid and beautiful work wrought in all countries for the saving of the souls for whom Christ has died.",
