    "word": "The simplicity of our faith is to be dwelt upon. Let the ministers teach the people how to give to others a knowledge of the saving truth for this time. The teachings of Christ are very simple but they are all essential. Let us heed His words, for we are exhorted to look to Him for guidance. We should ever bear in mind that we are to be taught of God. \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, . . . full of grace and truth. And of His fulness have all we received, and grace for grace\" (John 1:14, 16). The power of the gospel is to come upon the companies who are raised up to bear witness to the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.",
