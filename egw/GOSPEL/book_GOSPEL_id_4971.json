    "word": "We are glad that we held the convention when we did in Hobart. Willie gave one pound and I gave three pounds in order that food might be provided for those who should attend the convention, and who would have to come from Bismarck and other places. We did this in order to remove every obstacle and make it possible for the people to attend the convention. I would not have had the people deprived of the instruction that was given at that meeting if it had taken five times as many pounds as it did. The poor must have the gospel message preached to them. It is as necessary to them as to those who are in good circumstances.--Letter 59, 1895, pp. 1, 2, 8. (To Elder and Mrs. O. A. Olsen, May 12, 1895.)",
