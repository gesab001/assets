    "word": "The minister of the gospel is never exhorted to strive to be a smart preacher, a popular speaker; but is commanded to \"study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.\" (2 Timothy 2:15, 16). Will every messenger of God give heed to these words?--Ms 29, 1893.",
