    "word": "The treasures of the gospel are hidden, for many have eyes but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not; they have intellect but they discern not the hidden treasure. A man may pass over the place where treasure has been hidden. In his dire necessity he may sit down to rest, knowing not of the treasure hidden at the roots of the tree where he is resting. This represents the blindness of the Jews. They had eyes but they did not see. The treasure house of all knowledge was in their midst but they knew it not.",
