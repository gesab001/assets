    "word": "The \u201chonest and good heart\u201d of which the parable speaks, is not a heart without sin; for the gospel is to be preached to the lost. Christ said, \u201cI came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d Mark 2:17. He has an honest heart who yields to the conviction of the Holy Spirit. He confesses his guilt, and feels his need of the mercy and love of God. He has a sincere desire to know the truth, that he may obey it. The good heart is a believing heart, one that has faith in the word of God. Without faith it is impossible to receive the word. \u201cHe that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.\u201d Hebrews 11:6.  Ibid., pp. 58, 59.44",
