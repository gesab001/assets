    "word": "In making important decisions we should study every side of the question. We are ever to remember that we are given a place in the work to act as responsible agencies. Some would follow a worldly fashion in the drawing of their salaries; but the Lord does not view matters as these men view them. He views our duties and responsibilities in the light of Christ's self-denying example. The gospel must be so presented to the world that precept and example will harmonize.",
