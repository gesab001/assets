Dear Brother and Sister Kress: \n\n\n     I have received and read your letters. I will say that I have not received light that your connection with the Sanitarium at Takoma Park should be broken. This connection may be a special advantage to you in your missionary work in the cities, and you may also be a help to the health institution in Washington. As the Lord's servant, set apart to the gospel ministry, you should be fully qualified to speak the truth, pointing sinners to the great Healer of both soul and body.",
