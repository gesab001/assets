    "word": "God has given direction as to how to work is to be done. In our camp meetings we meet all classes of people, high and low, rich and poor. None are excluded. It is the Lord's desire that the very best of medical missionary physicians shall hold themselves in readiness to co-operate with the ministers of the gospel. They are to be one with Christ, men through whom God can work. The Lord desires His work to advance in a reformatory line. During our camp meetings genuine medical missionary work is to be done.",
