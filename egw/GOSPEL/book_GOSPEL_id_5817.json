    "word": "Listening to the words of Christ, we are safe. Whatever your calling, whatever your hope, listen! \"If any man will come after Me,\" He says, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Obeying these words, in entire dependence on the Saviour, go forth to give to the world an example of what it means to be a Christian. Yoke up with Christ. This is the only bond of the gospel. Learn daily  how to carry out more acceptably the instruction Christ has given. Live as become the subjects of His kingdom. To carry out the words, \"Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven,\"--- this is our life-work. \n\nM.H.",
