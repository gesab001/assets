    "word": "We feel now an intensity of burden for places that the last messages have not yet reached. There are the Eastern States left unwarned. What will we do to get the truth before cities and in the highways and the byways that have never heard the warning? Christ has pointed them out distinctly. Oh, that the Lord would work upon human hearts, and the truth [might] bear its weight with power and be felt in its purity! Now is our time and opportunity to let the light shine forth in clear, distinct rays from the Word of the Lord. Truth and \n\n\n                                    -19- \n\nrighteousness are to go before us to the people. The work is to be carried forward in earnest, sincere labor and in the pure gospel simplicity. How many restraints are continually raised up lest some means shall be called for in needy places! I am to lift up my voice of warning, for the work has not made a beginning in many places, but many hindrances have been suggested where the Lord designed only encouragement. Urgency should be given and these hindrances are to be removed. Men of faith are needed, who will not put up the bars, because there will be need of means to start the work.",
