    "word": "\"The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.\" Zephaniah 1:14. Let us be shod with the gospel shoes, ready to march at a moment's notice. Every hour, every minute, is precious. We have no time to spend in self-gratification. All around us there are souls perishing in sin. Every day there is something to do for our Lord and Master. Every day we are to point souls to the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.",
