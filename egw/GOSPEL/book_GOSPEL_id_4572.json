    "word": "Those who have had advantages for knowing the Word are to communicate the truth to others. God has placed upon us the solemn obligation of bearing fruit unto righteousness. In harmony with Christ we are to work for the salvation of souls. \"Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!\" \n                                       Ellen G. White.",
