    "word": "I have a message to bear in regard to the Southern field. We shall have to work this field. Its present condition is a continual rebuke to all who claim to be followers of Christ. The outlook is not pleasant. In some sections of this field the nominal churches have done a good work in gospel ministry and by establishing schools for the people. But as a whole, the field has scarcely been touched. If the words of the gospel commission had been studied and obeyed by our people, the South would have received its proportionate share of ministry. If those who have received light had walked in the light given them, they would have realized that they should cultivate this long-neglected vineyard.",
