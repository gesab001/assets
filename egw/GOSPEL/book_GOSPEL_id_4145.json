    "word": "It is thus that God's purpose in calling His people, from Abraham on the plains of Mesopotamia to us in this age, is to reach its fulfillment. He says, \"I will bless thee, . . . and thou shalt be a blessing.\" Genesis 12:2. The words of Christ through the gospel prophet, which are but re-echoed in the Sermon on the Mount, are for us in this last generation: \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" Isaiah 60:1. If upon your spirit the glory of the Lord is risen, if you have beheld His beauty who is \"the chiefest among ten thousand\" and the One \"altogether lovely,\" if your souls has become radiant in the presence of His glory, to you is this word from the Master sent. Have you stood with Christ on the mount of transfiguration? Down in the plain there are souls enslaved by Satan; they are waiting for the word of faith and prayer to set them free.",
