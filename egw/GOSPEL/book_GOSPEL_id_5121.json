    "word": "As Paul goes to Judea to bear the message of the gospel of Christ to those who were opposing the idea of Jesus' being the Saviour of the world, he wanted the Christian Gentiles to strive together with him in their prayers to God. How much better is this than to talk about the faults of one another! Brethren and sisters, when you are talking with one another, and someone begins to speak about the sins of some one else, listen not. Tell him that you must refuse to hear; for this is not your line of work. Instead of entering into a conversation that tends to tear down, try to speak a word of encouragement. Your talent of speech is to be sanctified unto God; it is to be cleansed from everything like faultfinding. Let us strive together with God's appointed workers in prayer to the Lord that He shall protect them and bless them, and that they may be delivered from them that do not believe.\" Thus the way will be opened for the reception of the gospel.",
