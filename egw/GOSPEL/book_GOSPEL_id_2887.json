    "word": "\"Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in,\" is Christ's command, \"that my house may be filled\" (Luke 14:23). He brings men into touch with those whom they seek to benefit. \"Bring the poor that are cast out to thy house,\" He says. \"When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him\" (Isaiah 58:7). \"They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover\" (Mark 16:18). Through direct contact, through personal ministry, the blessings of the gospel are to be communicated.--The Ministry of Healing, pp. 146-148.",
