    "word": "The lessons of self-denial, you have yet to learn. When you cultivate thoughts that nothing is too good for D. M. Canright, then it is time you ceased your work as a gospel minister. You are yet young and inexperienced. Deny yourself in little things as well as in great things, and avoid littleness as you would the leprosy. We can scarcely conceive of what contemptible meanness will grow upon a person if indulged. In all your plans of frugality, exclude meanness. Be ever watchful of the interest of those around you. You need to cultivate a tact of filling new positions, naturally adapting yourself to the new and opening providence of God. Make the most of your abilities in God, remembering that you must soon give an account of your stewardship.",
