    "word": "Letter 37, 1901\n     592. The poor say, when health reform is presented to them, \"What shall we eat? We cannot afford to buy the nut foods.\" As I preach the gospel to the poor, I am instructed to tell them to eat that food which is most nourishing. I cannot say to them, \"You must not eat eggs or milk or cream. You must use no butter in the preparation of food.\" The gospel must be preached to the poor, and the time has not yet come to prescribe the strictest diet. . . .",
