    "word": "You are not what God would have you to be, nor what you must be if you are ever saved in the kingdom of heaven. The converting power of God must come into your hearts and transform your characters before you can adorn the gospel of Christ with a well ordered life and a godly conversation. Then there will be no evil speaking, no evil surmising, no accusing of your brethren, no secret working to exalt self and disparage others. Christ will reign in your hearts by faith. Your eyes and tongue will be sanctified, and your ears will refuse to listen to evil reports or suggestions from believers or unbelievers. Your senses, your appetites and passions, will all be under the control of the Spirit of God. They will not be given up to the control of Satan for him to employ in working unrighteousness. \n\n\n                                     -183-",
