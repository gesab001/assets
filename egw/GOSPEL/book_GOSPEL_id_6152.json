    "word": "I present these matters now, because I am instructed to say to my brethren in the gospel ministry; By intemperance in eating \n\n\n                               -251- \n\nyou disqualify yourselves for seeing clearly the difference between the sacred and common fire. And by this intemperance you also reveal your disregard for all the warnings that the Lord has given you. His word to you is: \"Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of His servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon His God. Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.\"",
