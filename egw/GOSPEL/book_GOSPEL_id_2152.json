    "word": "In the presence of the king and leading men of Sweden, Olaf Patersen ably maintained the doctrines of the reformed faith against the Romish champions. He declared the Fathers to be below and not above Scripture, and that their interpretations were to be received only when in accordance with Holy Writ. He denied that the word of God is obscure when laying down the fundamental doctrines of the faith, and he presented the Bible's own testimony to its simplicity and clearness. Christ said, \u201cMy doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me,\u201d and Paul declared that should he preach any other gospel than that which he had received, he would be anathema. \u201cHow, then,\u201d said Dr. Olaf, \u201cshall others presume to enact dogmas at their pleasure, and impose them as things necessary to salvation?\u201d He showed that the decrees of the church are of no authority when in \n202\nopposition to the commands of God. And maintaining the great Protestant principle, \u201cThe Bible, and the Bible only as the rule of faith and practice,\u201d he gained a victory which decided the king in favor of the Protestant faith, and virtually established the Reformation in Sweden.",
