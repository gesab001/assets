    "word": "Now Christ takes the field and commences to press back this power of moral darkness. In Luke He announces what His work is to be. \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord\" (Luke 4:18, 19). Even while Christ announced His mission and \"all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth,\" Satan was on the ground. And there is no meeting but that he is there, and as the truth is being impressed on minds, Satan presents the difficulties.",
