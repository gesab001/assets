    "word": "Every part of the man--brain, bone, and muscle--is to be worked. The gospel economy is in every way suited and conformed to the condition of man, not in heaven but on earth, during his probationary test and trial. The Holy Spirit is to do its work upon mind and character, exerting an influence upon thoughts and actions. If received, cultivated, and appreciated, it will always be reformatory, refining, elevating, and ennobling. He who always aims for entire conformity to God's will, who does not follow his own natural inclinations, will allow the Holy Spirit to improve and mold and fashion his character upon a plan and model different from his own inherited and cultivated tendencies, changing him to another man. \n\n\n                                     -24-",
