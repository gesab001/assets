    "word": "MR No. 617 - No Respect of Persons with God\n\n     The love of God perfected in the human soul will be revealed by the sanctification of soul, body, and spirit. The love of God is fulfilled in him who loves God with all the heart and his neighbor as himself. This is the whole duty of man. The Gospel is satisfied when this victory is achieved. The Word of God labors from age to age to make men more practical. The Lord does not despise the day of small things, but He requires growth in every good work. Advancement must be made. And how many who commenced under difficulties and had to work under disappointment, have lived to see the work established.",
