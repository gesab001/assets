    "word": "I am bidden to bear a message to our people. In the name of the Lord I am bidden to warn our ministers not to mingle erroneous theories with the truth of God. Pure Bible truth is to stand forth in its nobility and sanctity. It is not to be classified and adjusted according to man's wisdom. The ministers of the gospel are to present truth in its simplicity, through the blessing of God making the Scriptures profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. \"Rightly dividing the word of truth\"--this is the word that should be spoken of all our ministers. But far, far from this, many of our ministers have departed from Christ's plans. The praise of men is coveted and they strain every faculty in an effort to hunt out and present wonderful things. The Lord bids me counsel them to walk humbly and prayerfully with Him. \n\n\n                                                                  page 8",
