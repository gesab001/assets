The importance of the work of the ministry is unmistakable; this is one of God's means for enlightening the world. But He has other means also. He uses the power of the press in printing papers and books containing the messages of truth. These are essential in the carrying forward of the gospel. Many who are hungry for the bread of life have not the privilege of hearing the word from God's delegated preachers. For this reason it is essential that our publications be widely circulated. The sheets that come from the groaning press to be prepared as tracts and bound up as books are to go forth to all parts of the earth. Thus the message will go where the living preacher can not go, and the attention of many will be called to the important events connected with the closing scenes of this world's history.",
