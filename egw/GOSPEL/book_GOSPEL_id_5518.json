    "word": "A physician who bears these heavy responsibilities needs the prayers of the gospel minister, and he should be linked soul, mind, and body, with the truth of God. Then he can speak a word in season to the afflicted; he can watch for souls as one who must give an account. Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life to him. The Scriptures come clearly to his mind, and he speaks as one who understands the value of the soul with whom he is dealing.",
