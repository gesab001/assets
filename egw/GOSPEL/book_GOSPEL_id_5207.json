    "word": "Christ revealed in the gospel was the propitiation for man's sins, the transgression of the law. His perfection of character was placed in man's behalf. The curse of the law Christ took upon Himself. It was the seeing to the end of that which was to be abolished, that which brought to light the plan of salvation in Christ--it was this that illuminated the face of Moses. If the typical sacrifices, which were to be done away, were glorious because Christ was revealed by them as the sin-pardoning Saviour, much more that which remains is glorious.",
