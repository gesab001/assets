    "word": "Those whom God has called to the ministry are to give evidence by the influence they exert, that they are fit for the holy calling in which they are found. Paul writes, \"Be thou an example of the believers.\" Then shall young ministers be excused for their lightness and trifling? Shall the church be expected to listen to their words, to receive their testimony, when their example misrepresents the character of Christ, and leads away from the path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in? What can we think of churches that will listen to the testimony of men who have no power in prayer, no fervency in their devotion, no freedom in personal labor for souls? The Lord has commanded, \"Be ye holy in all manner of conversation.\" \"Take heed unto \n                                                                           963\nthyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them; for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.\" The proof of the minister's call to preach the gospel is seen in his example and work. God desires men in the ministry who will esteem highly the things which he esteems, and preserve the sanctity of truth, and not do as did Nadab and Abihu. They discerned not the difference between the sacred and the common. Their senses were blunted with indulgence in wine, and they offered strange fire before the Lord. They did not realize the sacredness of the work in which they were engaged. There are some now who profess to be ministers of the Lord who talk of the things of God as they would talk of some business transaction. O, we need the heavenly enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. The churches will never become the light of the world unless they turn unto the Lord to serve him with full purpose of heart.",
