    "word": "All who are enrolled as citizens of the heavenly country are required that their behavior shall be such as the gospel of Christ can approve. And it is our privilege to claim the rights and privileges of subjects of the kingdom of heaven. But to everyone who accepts Christ as his personal Saviour, He says, \"Come out from among them [the world] and be ye separate.\" We are to conform to the Lord's requirements, and not disgrace our citizenship before the angels of heaven or before men. We are to render to God cheerful service. Christ does not speak to those who are no more to wrestle \n\n\n                                    -342- \n\nwith temptation; who are not in any danger of being drawn away from Christ and overcome by the wiles of Satan, when He says: \"Let your conversation be as becometh the gospel of Christ. . . . Stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; . . . For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake\" (Philippians 1:27, 29). There is to be no strife or vainglory, no selfishness or murmuring, no disputing, nothing impure or dishonest found in the characters of the followers of Christ.--Letter 58a, 1898, pp. 1-11.
