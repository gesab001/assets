Often they would update each other on the work and needs in various areas.  \nOctober 27, 1905\n     I am sending you a copy of a letter which I recently received from Brother F. R. Rogers, who for some years has been laboring in the Southern field in connection with the mission schools for Colored children. I send you his letter that you may see what requests come to me. I will send Brother Rogers the books he asks for. This shall be my donation to the Vicksburg school. I will also send some books to the Huntsville School. I am glad that I can do this much to help them.",
