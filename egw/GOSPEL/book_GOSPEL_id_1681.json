When burdens in this cause have to be borne, and when those who bear them are brought into strait places, they will feel the need of living near to God, that they may have confidence to commit their ways to him, and in faith claim that help which he alone can give. They will then be daily obtaining an experience in faith and trust, which is of the highest value to gospel ministers.\u2014Vol. 3, p. 234.",
