    "word": "Coming Delayed to Allow a Larger Span for Repentance--Who will say God will not do what He says He will do? \"Let God be true, but every man a liar\" (Romans 3:4). The Lord is coming in flaming fire to take vengeance on those sinners who know not God and obey not His gospel. And because, in His infinite mercy, He delays His coming to give the world a larger span for repentance, sinners flatter themselves [that] He will never come.",
