    "word": "Our buildings in Huntsville are being put up with as little expenditure of means as possible; and our workers have gone forward almost as far as they can with this work until means come in so that they can advance. The work there now demands that we have a modest but roomy sanitarium, where the sick can be taken in and treated. The colored race should have the benefits of such an institution as verily as should the white people. In this sanitarium colored nurses are to be trained for service in the field as gospel medical missionaries.",
