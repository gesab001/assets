    "word": "Chapter XIV. - The First Angel's Message.\n\n     The prophecy of the first angel's message, brought to view in Revelation 14, found its fulfillment in the Advent movement of 1840-1844. In both Europe and America, men of faith and prayer were deeply moved as their attention was called to the prophecies, and, tracing down the inspired record, they saw convincing evidence that the end of all things was at hand. The Spirit of God urged his servants, to give the warning. Far and wide spread the message of the everlasting gospel, \"Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his Judgment is come.\" [Revelation 14:7.]",
