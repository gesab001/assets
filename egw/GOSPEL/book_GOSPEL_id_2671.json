    "word": "Do not influence members to engage in business speculation.--I have been shown of God the sinfulness of the course you have been pursuing. You have engaged in mining and real-estate business, and while an acknowledged minister of the gospel, you have worked upon the minds of your brethren, and have influenced them to invest their means in real estate and in mining shares. You told them the investment would bring large returns; that they would more than treble their money, and could help the cause so much more. You represented that this was a golden opportunity which you did not want them to lose, and urged them to avail themselves of the advantages that God had placed right within their reach. With your powers of exaggeration you represented the matter in such a light that many were deceived, and some lost their money, which should have gone into the cause of God.--Testimonies on the Case of Elder E. P. Daniels (Ph 96) 71.",
