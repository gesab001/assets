    "word": "The religion of Christ is not what many have supposed it to be. Many have lost the holy principles of genuine Christlikeness. They make a pretense to follow Jesus, but self, dear self, is the mainspring of every action. They are not Christians, for Christ is dishonored by their misrepresentation of His example. They carry not with them the reviving hopes and helps of the gospel. These are kept in the outer court. They do not think it essential to blend the principles of Christ with their philosophy. They do not allow the Sun of Righteousness to give decided influence to their life-practice. Bible religion, reverence for God, homage to Christ, unswerving obedience to principle, are kept in the outer court. Christ has no personal contact with their lives. Their practice is far from the reality and sacredness of true religion.",
