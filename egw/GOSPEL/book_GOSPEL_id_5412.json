    "word": "MR No. 1237 - Testimony Concerning the Views of Prophecy Held by John Bell--Part II\n\n            (Written November 8, 1896, at Cooranbong, N.S.W.) \n     The proclamation of the first, second, and third angels' messages has been located by the Word of Inspiration. Not a peg or pin is to be removed. No human authority has any more right to change the location of these messages than to substitute the New Testament for the Old. The Old Testament is the gospel in figures and symbols. The New Testament is the substance. One is as essential as the other. The Old Testament presents lessons from the lips of Christ, and these lessons have not lost their force in any particular.",
