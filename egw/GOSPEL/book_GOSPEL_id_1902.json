    "word": "To those who urged that \u201cthe preaching of the gospel answers all the ends of the law,\u201d Wesley replied: \u201cThis we utterly deny. It does not answer the very first end of the law, namely, the convincing men of sin, the awakening those who are still asleep on the brink of hell.\u201d The apostle Paul declares that \u201cby the law is the knowledge of sin;\u201d \u201cand not until man is convicted of sin, will he truly feel his need of the atoning blood of Christ. . . . `They that be whole,\u2019 as our Lord himself observes, \u2018need not a physician, but they that are sick.\u2019 It is absurd, therefore, to offer a physician to them that are whole, or that at least imagine themselves so to be. You are first to convince them that they are sick; otherwise they will not thank you for your labor. It is equally absurd to offer Christ to them whose heart is whole, having never yet been broken.\u201d",
