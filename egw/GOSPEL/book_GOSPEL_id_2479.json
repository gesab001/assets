    "word": "Gospel Alone Can Cure Evils Cursing Society.-- The only remedy for the sins and sorrows of men is Christ. The gospel of His grace alone can cure the evils that curse society. The injustice of the rich toward the poor, the hatred of the poor toward the rich, alike have their root in selfishness, and this can be eradicated only through submission to Christ. He alone, for the selfish heart of sin, gives the new heart of love. Let the servants of Christ preach the gospel with the Spirit sent down from heaven and work as He did for the benefit of men. Then such results \n\n\n                                                   67 \n\nwill be manifest in the blessing and uplifting of mankind as are wholly impossible of accomplishment by human power.--COL 254 (1900).",
