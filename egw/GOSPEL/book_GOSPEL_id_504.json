    "word": "Integrity Preserved at All Costs--In our business connection with the work of God, and in handling sacred things, we cannot be too careful, to guard against a spirit of irreverence; never, for an instant, should the work of God be used deceitfully, to carry a point which we are anxious to see succeed.  Honor, integrity, and truth must be preserved at any cost to self.  Our every thought, word, and action should be subject to the will of Christ.--Gospel Workers, p. 447.",
