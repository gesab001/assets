    "word": "I was charged not to neglect or pass by those who were being wronged. I was especially charged to protect against any arbitrary or overbearing action toward the ministers of the gospel by those having official authority. Disagreeable though the duty may be, I am to reprove the oppressor, and plead for justice. I am to present the necessity of maintaining justice and equity in all our institutions.",
