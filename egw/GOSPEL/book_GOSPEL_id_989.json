    "word": "First the Tithe--Then Offerings \n\n     This matter of giving is not left to impulse. God has given us definite instruction in regard to it. He \n                                                                           81\nhas specified tithes and offerings as the measure of our obligation. And He desires us to give regularly and systematically. . . . Let each regularly examine his income, which is all a blessing from God, and set apart the tithe as a separate fund, to be sacredly the Lord's. This fund should not in any case be devoted to any other use; it is to be devoted solely to support the ministry of the gospel. After the tithe is set apart, let gifts and offerings be apportioned, \"as God hath prospered\" you.--R. & H., May 9, 1893.",
