    "word": "In every age the gospel ministry has tended to the same end. But every minute specification is not revealed in the Word of God. He desires us to use our reason and experience, by their help adopting methods and plans which, under the existing circumstances, are for the benefit of the church and the schools and the other institutions which have been established. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" If erroneous opinions are entertained, search the Scriptures with hearts which are humbled before God. Pray to the Lord, believing that He hears, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. If we will only believe, we shall receive the help we need.",
