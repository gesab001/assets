The apostle regarded himself as \"debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians,\" [Romans 1:14] as well as to the Jews; but he never lost sight of the decided advantages possessed by the Jews over others, \"chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.\" [Romans 3:2.] \"The gospel,\" he declared, \"is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.\" [Romans 1:16, 17.] It is of this gospel of Christ, equally efficacious for Jew and Gentile, that Paul in his epistle to the Romans declared he was not ashamed.",
