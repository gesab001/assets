    "word": "The word of encouragement is given, \"Be not weary in well doing,\" \"always abounding in the work of the Lord.\" There is a world to be saved, a work to be done that can be accomplished only by the proclamation of the gospel message. \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Should we not thank the Lord with heart and soul for His unspeakable gift? Should we not be willing to devote every capability and talent to the work of representing Christ before the world? . . .",
