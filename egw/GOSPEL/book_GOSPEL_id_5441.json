    "word": "The law of God, with its binding claims and its solemn injunctions, should be clearly and distinctly set forth just as it is given in the decalogue. We should make efforts to call together large congregations to hear the words of the gospel minister. And those who preach the word of the Lord should speak the truth. They should bring their hearers, as it were, to the foot of Sinai, to listen to the words spoken by God amidst scenes of awful grandeur. These words are as changeless and eternal as the throne of Jehovah.",
