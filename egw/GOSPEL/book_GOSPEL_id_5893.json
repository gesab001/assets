The cities in the East should now receive special attention.\" \"It is the Lord's plan that physicians well versed in the Bible truths shall unite with ministers laboring in the cities and aid in giving as a whole the harmonious message of warning that should be given to the world. Some of the very best qualified men in our institutions should be chosen for this work. To some it may seem unwise to take men qualified for the position of head physician and put them to labor in the cities and choose men to take their places in the institution; but we need to take a broader view of the work, and to consider that the Lord is calling for a special line of work to be done in the cities,--a work which requires the efforts of men of clear perception and who in the power of the Holy Spirit can present before large congregations the principles of health reform. The presenting of Bible principles by intelligent physicians will have great weight with many people. The efficiency and power of one who can combine in his influence the work of a physician and of the gospel minister who can estimate? This work commends itself to the good judgment of the people. If Dr. Kress will labor as a medical evangelist under the Lord's direction and go forward in humility, a good work will be accomplished.\" \n                                                                           168",
