    "word": "\"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good.\" The gospel of Christ is to be preached in its true bearings, as that which saves to the uttermost all who believe. The doing of loving deeds is a helping hand which opens the door for the living word, making the wilderness and the solitary place to rejoice and blossom as the rose.--Manuscript 58, 1901. \n\nEllen G.
