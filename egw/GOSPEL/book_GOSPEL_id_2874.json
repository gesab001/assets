    "word": "Christians are to be light bearers, saying to all with whom they come in contact, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" They are to be examples of piety, representing Christ in word, in spirit, in action. Their actions are to be a copy of the actions of the Saviour. Thus they are to show the superiority of Christ's principles over the principles of the world. They are to work upon a higher plane of action than do those who are not Christians. They are to bring the ennobling influence of the gospel into every phase of life. Their purity and usefulness are to be a source of illumination to others.",
