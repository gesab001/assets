    "word": "Beginning Work as Medical Missionaries \n\n     Men and women are to study how they can best reach the people. Then let them go forth as consecrated, spiritual workers. Let them in some city hire a place in which to live, and at once begin their work. They will find enough suffering ones to whom they can present themselves as medical missionaries. In some places the medical missionary will be better received if he has credentials to show that he has been set apart for gospel work. MS.-33-1901.",
