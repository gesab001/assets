    "word": "The apostle James declares that the wisdom from above is \u201cfirst pure.\u201d Had he encountered those who take the precious name of Jesus upon lips defiled by tobacco, those whose breath and person are contaminated by its foul odor, and who pollute the air of heaven, and force all about them to inhale the poison,\u2014had the apostle come in contact with a practice so opposed to the purity of the gospel, would he not have denounced it as \u201cearthly, sensual, devilish\u201d? Slaves of tobacco, claiming the blessing of entire sanctification, \n475\ntalk of their hope of Heaven; but God's Word plainly declares that \u201cthere shall in nowise enter into it anything that defileth.\u201d [Revelation 21:27.]",
