    "word": "The sympathy that Christ ever expressed for the physical needs of His hearers won from many a response to the truths He sought to teach. Was not the gospel message of deepest importance to that company of five thousand people who for hours had followed Him and hung upon His words? Many had never before heard truths such as they listened to on that occasion. Yet Christ's desire to teach them spiritual truths did not make Him indifferent to their physical needs.--R.H., Jan. 18, 1912. \n                                                                           300",
