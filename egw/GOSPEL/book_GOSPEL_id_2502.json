    "word": "In His talk with the Samaritan woman, instead of disparaging Jacob's well, Christ presented something better. \"If thou knewest the gift of God,\" He said, \"and who it is that saith to thee, Give Me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water\" (John 4:10). He turned the conversation to the treasure He had to bestow, offering the woman something better than she possessed, even living water, the joy and hope of the gospel.--MH 156, 157 (1905).",
