    "word": "Section Fourteen - Teaching Health Principles\n\n                    The Gospel of Health \n\n     The principles of health reform are found in the word of God. The gospel of health is to be firmly linked with the ministry of the word. It is the Lord's design that the restoring influence of health reform shall be a part of the last great effort to proclaim the gospel message. Our physicians are to be God's workers. They are to be men whose powers have been sanctified and transformed by the grace of Christ. Their influence is to be knit up with the truth that is to be given to the world. In perfect and complete unity with the gospel ministry the work of health reform will reveal its God-given power. Under the influence of the gospel great reforms will be made by medical missionary work.--MS. 172, 1899.",
