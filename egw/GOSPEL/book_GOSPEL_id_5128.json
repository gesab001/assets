But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that we have preached unto you, let him be accursed\" (Galatians 1:6-8). \"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by \n\n\n                                   -356- \n\nthe hearing of faith? Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? . . . He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?\" (Galatians 3:1-3, 5).",
