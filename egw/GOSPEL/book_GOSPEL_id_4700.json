    "word": "It is as much required of God that his followers who are in the medical profession shall reveal the spirit of Christ in harmonizing their work as that the ministers of the gospel shall harmonize in their labors for the salvation of souls. This independence to do every man as seemeth good in his own eyes is after the satanic order, but not after Christ. One sets himself up in a certain place and begins to practise; another does the same in another place; and there is no more unity one with the other than between the strands of ropes of straw. This thing I have been shown is a disgrace to Seventh-day Adventists and a dishonor to the cause of God.",
