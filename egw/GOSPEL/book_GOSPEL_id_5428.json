    "word": "The spirit of men has striven for the mastery against God. The man who trusts in man will receive the spirit and sentiments of men as wiser and safer than God's. But those who trust in God, who can, like Moses, come into the mount with God, will be kept by the power of God, calm and composed above the influence of the boisterous accusations and the shocks that ruffle and discompose the minds of men. Nothing can sway from right principles the men who will make the Word of God their guide. Ever before their minds is the question, \"What is written in the law?\" \"How readest thou?\" \"What hath God said?\" No word from men or from ministers in the highest position can make them set their feet in questionable paths. In earnest prayer with God they have shod their feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.",
