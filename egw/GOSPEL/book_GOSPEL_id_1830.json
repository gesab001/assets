    "word": "Steadfast to the gospel, the Bohemians waited through the night of their persecution, in the darkest hour still turning their eyes toward the horizon like men who watch for the morning. \u201cTheir lot was cast in evil days, but they remembered the words first uttered by Huss, and repeated by Jerome, that a century must revolve before the day should break. These were to the Hussites what the words of Joseph were to the tribes in the house of bondage: \u2018I die, and God will surely visit you, and bring you out.\u2019\u201d About the year 1470 persecution ceased, and there followed a period of comparative prosperity. When \u201cthe end of the century arrived, it found two hundred churches of the \u2018United Brethren\u2019 in Bohemia and Moravia. So goodly was the remnant which, escaping the destructive fury of fire and sword, was permitted to see the dawning of that day which Huss had foretold.\u201d",
