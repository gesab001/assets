    "word": "My attention has been called to the instruction the Lord has been pleased to give in \"Gospel Workers.\" I have arisen at three o'clock, A.M., and have read the matter in the little book entitled \"Conference Presidents,\" p. 232. The same things have been presented to me again and again. Will our brethren take heed to these things? Or will they turn aside from the light? The president of the General Conference should act upon the light given, not contrary to this light. If men close their eyes to the testimonies God has been pleased to give, and think it wisdom to walk in the fire of the sparks of their own kindling, it will spoil the church. Such men are not qualified to become either ministers or presidents of conferences; they have not taken counsel from the Source of all wisdom. \n\n\n                     - 12 -",
