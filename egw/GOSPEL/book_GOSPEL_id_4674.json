    "word": "If we will take God at His word, we shall see of His salvation. The gospel that we present to save perishing souls must be the very gospel that saves our own souls. We must receive the word of God. We must eat the Word, live the Word, it is the flesh and the blood of the Son of God. We must eat His flesh and drink His blood,--receive by faith the spiritual attributes of Christ.",
