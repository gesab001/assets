    "word": "All our medical workers are earnestly to use their capabilities in the right way, that there may go forth the impression that the ministry of the Word and the medical missionary work are, in reality, one united work. Some will need to be watched lest their natural propensities overrule, causing them to manifest self instead of the Christlikeness that should always be prominent. When such persons labor not in accordance with the will and way of God, when in business transactions they fail of elevating the gospel standard, their associates are not to keep silent; they are to strive to change the evil lest they become co-workers in that which will do great injury to the cause and work of God.",
