    "word": "\"Your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,\" you will be prepared to walk from house to house, carrying the truth to the people. Sometimes you will find it very trying to do work of this kind; but if \n                                                                           91\nyou go forth in faith, the Lord will go before you, and His light will shine upon your pathway. As you enter the homes of your neighbors to sell or to give away our literature, and in humility to teach them the truth, you will be accompanied by the light of heaven. Learn to sing the simplest of songs. These will help you in house-to-house labor, and hearts will be touched by the influence of the Holy Spirit. . . . We may enjoy the companionship of the heavenly angels. We may not discern their forms, but by faith we may know that they are with us.--Review and Herald, Nov. 11, 1902.",
