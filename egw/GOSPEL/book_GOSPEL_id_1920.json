    "word": "Saith the Lord: \u201cMy people shall never be ashamed.\u201d [Joel 2:26.] \u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\u201d [Psalm 30:5.] When on his resurrection day these disciples met the Saviour, and their hearts burned within them as they listened to his words; when they looked upon the head and hands and feet that had been bruised for them; when, before his ascension, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, \n351\nand, lifting up his hands in blessing, bade them, \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel,\u201d adding, \u201cLo, I am with you alway;\u201d [Mark 16:15; Matthew 28:20.] when on the day of Pentecost the promised Comforter descended, and the power from on high was given, and the souls of the believers thrilled with the conscious presence of their ascended Lord,\u2014then, even though, like his, their pathway led through sacrifice and martyrdom, would they have exchanged the ministry of the gospel of his grace, with the \u201ccrown of righteousness\u201d to be received at his coming, for the glory of an earthly throne, which had been the hope of their earlier discipleship? He who is \u201cable to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,\u201d had granted them, with the fellowship of His sufferings, the communion of his joy,\u2014the joy of \u201cbringing many sons unto glory,\u201d joy unspeakable, \u201can eternal weight of glory,\u201d to which, says Paul, \u201cour light affliction, which is but for a moment,\u201d is \u201cnot worthy to be compared.\u201d",
