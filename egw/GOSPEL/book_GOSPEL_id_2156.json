    "word": "The apostle Paul, in his dying charge to Timothy, says: \u201cThe things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\u201d The instruction given to Timothy contains lessons to be learned by all the servants of Christ. Every one who anticipates engaging in the solemn work of the ministry should give heed to the apostle's charge to his son in the gospel as the latter was entering upon his work: \u201cLet no man despise thy youth.\u201d Timothy might pursue so wise a course that he would gain the confidence of all with whom he should be associated. The ground of this confidence the apostle specifies: \u201cBut be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\u201d The work of a student was enjoined upon him. \u201cTill I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.\u201d",
