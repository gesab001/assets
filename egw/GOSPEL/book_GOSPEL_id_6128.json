    "word": "Physicians' Charges. \n\n     There are occupations in which it is impossible to work reform; for they are thoroughly bad, and all that can be said to those persons who persist in engaging in them is, \"Depart ye, ye thieves.\" But the profession of medicine is an elevated, noble calling, and there is a remedy for all the evils which have become attached to this branch of work. Christ may be represented in the character and action of every physician, and all who claim to expect to become physicians should expect to work unselfishly, as He worked, requiring a fair price for their services, and exacting no more, although they see that they could obtain more by following the selfish customs of the world. It is just as consistent for the minister of the gospel to demand an excessive salary for visiting the sick, comforting the desponding, bringing peace and joy to the oppressed, as for the physician to make large charges for his professional visits.",
