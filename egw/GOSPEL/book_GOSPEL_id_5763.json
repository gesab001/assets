    "word": "The salvation that Christ made such a sacrifice to gain for man is that which is alone of value; for it is that which saves from sin, the cause of all the misery and woe in our world. The mercy of God is that which constantly draws the sinner to Jesus. If he responds, coming in penitence with confession, in faith laying hold of the hope set before him in the gospel. God will accept him; for \"the broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.\" Thus the law of God is not weakened by the gospel, but the power of sin is broken, and the scepter of mercy is extended to the penitent sinner.",
