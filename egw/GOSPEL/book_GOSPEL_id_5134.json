    "word": "I ask Thee to pity every trembling soul in this congregation. I ask Thee, my Saviour, that Thou wilt awaken in the heart of every minister of the gospel, of every teacher, and of every one who professes to be Thy child, a desire for Thy Holy Spirit, that they may be endued with power, and that as they go from house to house, they may proclaim Thy truth. Let Thy message \n\n\n                                    -414- \n\ncome to us, that we may arouse our sensibilities, that we may realize the value of souls. We want that every one here today shall be saved. May the light that shines from the throne of God shine into the chambers of the mind and into the soul-temple.",
