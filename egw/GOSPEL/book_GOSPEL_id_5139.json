    "word": "We need an army of workers to give the warning message to the world. Every town from Cooranbong to Queensland is to be worked. We are to press onward and still onward. We desire the youth to obtain an education which will enable them to educate others. The gospel of Christ lies at the foundation of all true education and progress. To diffuse light is the great work we are now to do. The truth that Christ is a personal Saviour is to be taught so clearly that souls will submit to be led and taught by God, and in their turn win other souls to Christ.--Letter 34, 1900, pp. 6, 12, 13. (To \"My Brethren and Sisters in Australia,\" February 24, 1900.)",
