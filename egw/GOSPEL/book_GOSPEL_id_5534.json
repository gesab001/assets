    "word": "If all who claim to be children of God would respond to the earnest prayer of Christ, if they would refuse to give up the determination to answer that prayer as true disciples, they would become one with Christ and one with their brethren. Then Christianity would be a power in the world, to convict souls and convert them to Christ. By the unity and love of the believers, the world would be given evidence of the power of the gospel. The believers would be bound up with Christ in God, and thus they would testify to the world that God has sent His Son into the world to refine, ennoble, and sanctify the church.",
