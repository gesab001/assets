    "word": "I was thankful to see that the testimony of warning and encouragement given to Brother Faulkhead more than two years ago had been fully heeded, and that he had separated himself from the secret society of which he was a member. Jesus had spoken to him as He spoke to the fishermen, saying, \"Follow Me,\" when they left their nets and followed Him.  He called to him as He had called to Matthew sitting at the receipt of customs, and said, \"Follow Me.\" The Lord had a work for this brother to do in His cause, and he heeded the word of invitation, and came to the gospel feast that was prepared for him. When I saw his deficiency in the work, I regretted that for years he had been bound up in the lodges of the secret society, and at the same time I rejoiced that his talents were now devoted to doing the very work that the Lord had pointed out as the work he should do.",
