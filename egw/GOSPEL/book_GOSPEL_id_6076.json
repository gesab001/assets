    "word": "The gospel of Christ has been dishonored by being handled with sin-stained hands. Professed Christians act and speak in a way that is no honor to God. What men and women need now is thorough conversion. Every part of their intelligence should go out to meet Christ, and every part of their spiritual nature should yearn for more of Him. The Father seeketh such to worship him - those who worship Him in spirit and truth and in the beauty of holiness. Let us separate from the contaminating influences of the world, and hold communication with the Saviour. Let us bring ourselves, in thought, word, and deed, into conformity with the will of Christ. The Redeemer is seeking for those whose highest aim is to serve and glorify God.",
