H. Kellogg.] \n\n\n     I received your letter yesterday. Thank you for your advice and counsel. I have not been as well as before I was poisoned by the ill-ventilated meeting rooms for worship, because I have not had time to rest. I have had many letters to write to our people in Australia on matters that deserve immediate attention. In three days before the Australian mail my hand penned 75 pages of letter paper which were copied, and ten which were not copied.",
