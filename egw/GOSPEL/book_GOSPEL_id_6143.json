    "word": "It is acting the part of a thief and a robber to step into another man's field of labor and destroy his harvest. Paul the greatest preacher among believers, did not desire to go upon another man's ground. His desire was to preach the gospel to those who had never heard it. He writes, \"Yea, so have I striven to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation; but as it is written, To whom He was not spoken of, they shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand.\" And of Christ, it is written, \"So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at \n\n\n                              -195- \n\nhim; for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard shall they consider.\"",
