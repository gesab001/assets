    "word": "In all my travels I have never seen a more beautiful place for a sanitarium than the Melrose property. It was secured by the providence of God, and the sanitarium there may do a great work in healing the sick and in teaching them the gospel of salvation. If the instruction that God has given is followed, there will be brought into the truth through the instrumentality of this sanitarium, men and women who can engage in evangelistic work.",
