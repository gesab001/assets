    "word": "O, how much less we are doing as a people than we should be doing! Even those in responsible positions do not realize their privileges and duties. And how weak seem my words, how inadequate to set before God's people what He requires of them. I am distressed as I see the work developing, and note how difficult it is to support the agencies appointed for the diffusion of the light of the gospel. The Lord demands more of His people than they are doing.",
