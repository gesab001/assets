    "word": "I am very anxious that you shall not feel that God has given you the work of a director. You are a physician, not a manager. It is possible for a \n\n\n                                    -92- \n\nphysician to assume far more responsibility than he should. Do not cast aside my words as of no consequence, as some physicians have done. Remember that a refusal to receive light does not alter facts. The truth will stand and will be vindicated. I hope and pray that you will link up with your brethren. Never feel that it is your prerogative to disparage the ministers of the gospel and exalt physicians as infallible. This has been done repeatedly. God help you to avoid this fatal mistake.",
