    "word": "Before returning to Australia, Mrs. White attended the second New Zealand camp meeting, held Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, 1893, in a sheltered suburb of Wellington. There were in attendance double the number that had been present at the Napier meeting. Elder O. A. Olsen, president of the General Conference, arrived during the early days of the meeting, and his labors and timely instruction were of untold value. He brought cheering reports from the great mission fields that he had recently visited; and he appealed to the young people to fit themselves for service in the closing work of the gospel.",
