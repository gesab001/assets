    "word": "Medical missionary work is the pioneer work. It is to be connected with the gospel ministry. It is the gospel in practice, the gospel practically carried out. I have been made so sorry to see that our people have not taken hold of this work as they should. They have not gone out into the places round about to see what they could do to help the suffering. Dr. Kellogg has been carrying too heavy a load, and our own people have been standing by, warring against him. His work has been made heavier and harder because of the lack of sympathy shown by those who ought to have seen the importance of the work he was doing.",
