    "word": "Jesus Christ is the world's greatest Teacher. I have tested and proved the blessed evidence of this. He has made me His messenger, to communicate great spiritual truths to many thousands. . . . How greatly I desire so to present His instruction that many will be led to Him. I never question His leading, and I know that I am sustained by the One who bade His disciples go forth and proclaim the gospel message, \"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:20).",
