    "word": "Let every man now study the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah. What is the great work before us? The proclamation of the gospel, with its life-saving principles, to every nation and kindred and tongue and people. Let no one remain in idleness because he cannot do the same class of work that the most experienced of God's servants are doing. Because you cannot be in the highest place, will you do nothing? Because you cannot trade upon pounds, will you refuse to trade upon the one pound? Because you have not five talents, will you \n\n\n                                 -100- \n\nput your one talent in a napkin and hide it in the earth? Because you cannot work for the multitude, will you refuse to work for individuals?",
