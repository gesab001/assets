    "word": "These truths, as presented in Revelation 14 in connection with \u201cthe everlasting gospel,\u201d will distinguish the church of Christ at the time of His appearing. For as the result of the threefold message it is announced: \u201cHere are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d And this message is the last to be given before the coming of the Lord. Immediately following its proclamation the Son of man is seen by the prophet, coming in glory to reap the harvest of the earth.\u2014GC 453, 454.",
