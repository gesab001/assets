    "word": "The Lesson of Ancient Kingdoms.--The prosperity of a nation is dependent upon the virtue and intelligence of its citizens. To secure these blessings, habits of strict temperance are indispensable. The history of ancient kingdoms is replete with lessons of warning for us.

It remains to be seen whether our own republic will be admonished by their example, and avoid their fate.--Gospel Workers, page 388.",
