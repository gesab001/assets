    "word": "Satan, the originator of evil, is now revealing his power in the children of men. This is his hour, and the power of darkness. Apparently he controls the world. The gospel messenger will find that there is a power moving the world to greater and still greater opposition to Christ and His message. The last great conflict between the forces of good and evil is spoken of as \"a time of trouble such as never was.\" The violence which fills the earth will exceed that which existed before the destruction of the old world.",
