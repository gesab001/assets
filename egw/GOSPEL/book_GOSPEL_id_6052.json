    "word": "You are both to be led and taught of God. If you individually seek Him daily, you will have the Holy Spirit's guidance. I can see that you greatly need divine wisdom to enable you to serve in two positions of responsibility,--as a skillful physician, and also as a preacher of the gospel. There must be a daily conversion in order to blend successfully the work for body and soul. I can not tell you in detail just how this should be done, but I know that you can do an important work in the ministry of the Word, in instructing the souls for whom you labor to believe in Jesus Christ. Encourage the suffering ones to receive treatment from the great Physician, for the healing of both body and soul.",
