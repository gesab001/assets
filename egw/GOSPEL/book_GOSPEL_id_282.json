    "word": "Words of Counsel to Ministers Regarding Family Management.--You have a duty to do at home which you cannot shun and yet be true to God and to your God-given trust. . . . The gospel field is the world. You wish to sow the field with gospel truth, waiting for God to water the seed sown that it may bring forth fruit. You have entrusted to you a little plot of ground; but your own dooryard is left to grow up with brambles and thorns, while you are engaged in weeding others' gardens. This is not a small work, but one of great moment. You are preaching the gospel to others; practice it yourself at home.",
