    "word": "The object of God in bringing the College into existence, has been lost sight of. Ministers of the gospel have so far shown their want of wisdom from above, as to unite a worldly element with the College; they have joined with the enemies of God and the truth, in providing entertainments for the students. In thus misleading the youth, they have done a work for Satan. That work, with all its results, they must meet again at the bar of God. Those who pursue such a course, show that they cannot be trusted. After the evil work has been done, they may confess their error; but can they as easily gather up the influence they have exerted? Will the well-done be spoken to those who have been false to their trust? These unfaithful men have not built upon the Eternal Rock. Their foundation will prove to be sliding sand. \"Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoso will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.\"",
