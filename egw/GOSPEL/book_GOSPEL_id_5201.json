    "word": "The twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew gives an outline of what is to come upon the world. We are living amid the perils of the last days. Those who are perishing in sin must be warned. The Lord calls upon everyone to whom He has entrusted the talent of means to act as His helping hand by giving their money for the advancement of His work. Our money is a treasure lent us by the Lord, and it is to be invested in the work of giving to the world the last message of mercy. My brother, you can act a part in this work. You can help to sustain the Lord's work in New York City. Remember that those who spend in self-gratification the money that should be used to open doors for gospel work, suffer an eternal loss.--Letter 90, 1902, pp. 1,3. (To Brother Johnson, May 23, 1902.)",
