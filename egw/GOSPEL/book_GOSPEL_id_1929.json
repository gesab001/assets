    "word": "This coming is foretold also by the prophet Malachi. \u201cThe Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d [Malachi 3:1.] The coming of the Lord to his temple was sudden, unexpected, to his people. They were not looking for him there. They expected him to come to earth, \u201cin flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel.\u201d [2 Thessalonians 1:8.]",
