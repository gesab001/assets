    "word": "Workers,--gospel medical missionaries--are needed now. We cannot afford to spend years in preparation. Soon doors now open to the truth will be forever closed. Carry the message now. Do not wait, allowing the enemy to take possession of fields now open before you. Let little companies go forth to do the work to which Christ appointed His disciples. Let them labor as evangelists, scattering our publications, talking of the truth to those they meet, praying for the sick, and if need by, treating them, not with drugs, but with nature's remedies. Let the workers remember always that they are dependent on God. Let them not trust in human beings for wisdom, but in the One who declares, \"All power is given unto Me in (112) heaven and in earth.\" Thus we labored in the early history of the message.\" \n\n                                               -",
