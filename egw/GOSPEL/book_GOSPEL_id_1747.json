    "word": "The Support of the Gospel \n\n     The Lord has made the proclamation of the gospel dependent upon the labors and the voluntary gifts of all His people. The one who proclaims the message of mercy to fallen men has another work also,--to set before the people the duty of sustaining the work of God with their means. He must teach them that a portion of their income belongs to God, and is to be sacredly devoted to His work. This lesson he should present by both precept and example; he should beware that he does not by his own course lessen the force of his teaching.",
