WHILE THE INSTRUCTION CALLS FOR SUPPLICANTS TO KNEEL IN BOTH PUBLIC WORSHIP AND PRIVATE DEVOTIONS, ELLEN WHITE'S CLEAR-CUT COUNSEL AND HER EXAMPLE INDICATE THAT KNEELING IS NOT REQUIRED IN EVERY INSTANCE WHEN THE HEART AND VOICE ARE LIFTED IN PRAYER. THE MATERIALS PRESENTED ARE DRAWN FROM A WIDE SPAN OF ELLEN WHITE'S MINISTRY.-- WHITE TRUSTEES.",
