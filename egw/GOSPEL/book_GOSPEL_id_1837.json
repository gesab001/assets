    "word": "Luther was not to make his perilous journey alone. Besides the imperial messenger, three of his firmest friends determined to accompany him. Melancthon earnestly desired to join them. His heart was knit to Luther's, and he yearned to follow him, if need be, to prison or to death. But his entreaties were denied. Should Luther perish, the hopes of the Reformation must center upon his youthful co-laborer. Said the reformer as he parted from Melancthon, \u201cIf I do not return, and my enemies put me to death, continue to teach; stand fast in the truth. Labor in my stead; . . . if thy life be spared, my death will matter little.\u201d Students and citizens who had gathered to witness Luther's departure were deeply moved. A multitude whose hearts had been touched by the gospel, bade him farewell with weeping. Thus the reformer and his companions set out from Wittenberg.",
