    "word": "Those who are true to the divine Leader will hold fast to the simplicity of the gospel, and will put away the masterly sentiments and sophistries that are coming in to deceive. Those who would be saved from the wily, deceptive influences of the foe must now break every yoke, and take their position for Christ and for truth. They must reject all fictitious sentiments, which, if accepted, will spoil their faith and their experience. Unless they obtain this freedom, they will go on step by step in the downward path, until they deny Him who has bought them with the price of His blood. \n                                                                           46",
