    "word": "None but God can subdue the pride of man's heart. We cannot save ourselves. We cannot regenerate ourselves. In the heavenly courts there will be no song sung, \"To me that loved myself, and washed myself, redeemed myself, unto me be glory and honor, blessing and praise.\" But this is the keynote of the song that is sung by many here in this world. They do not know what it means to be meek and lowly in heart, and they do not mean to know this if they can avoid it. The whole gospel is comprised in learning of Christ His meekness and lowliness.",
