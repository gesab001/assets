May the Lord give you increased faith and courage in Him. Do not depend on any man to be brains for you. Think and put every God-given ability to the tax. Expect that the Lord will work in and by and through you. Do not lose your zeal. Do not submerge your identity in any human being. You may be safely one with God. You may hide your entire self in Him. Be no man's shadow. \u201cOur gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost.\u201d The word and the Spirit agree. The instrument and the agent co-operate together. The truth is represented as the sword of the Spirit. No tame message must come from our lips. \u201cThe word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword.\u201d This makes the Word a power.",
