    "word": "The gospel was first proclaimed in Eden. \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel\" [Genesis 3:15]. But through ages of sin the image of God was almost obliterated from the earth. Satan said, Humanity cannot keep the law of God. I can take their minds and mold and fashion them so that they will not regard the law of God.",
