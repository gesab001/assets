    "word": "Let us diligently cultivate the pure principles of the gospel of Christ,\u2014the religion, not of self-esteem, but of love, meekness, and lowliness of heart. Then we shall love our brethren, and esteem them better than ourselves. Our minds will not dwell on the dark side of their character; we shall not feast on scandal and flying reports. But \u201cwhatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise,\u201d we shall \u201cthink on these things.\u201d [Philippians 4:8.]",
