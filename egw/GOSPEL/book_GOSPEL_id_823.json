    "word": "Ultimate Aim of Health-Food Work \n\n                                             MS 10, 1906 \n     418. When conducted in such a manner that the gospel of Christ is brought to the attention of the people, the health-food work can be profitably engaged in. But I lift my voice in warning against efforts that accomplish nothing more than the production of foods to supply the physical needs. It is a serious mistake to employ so much time, and so much of the talents of men and women, in manufacturing foods, while no special effort is made at the same time to supply the multitudes with the bread of life. Great dangers attend a work that has not for its object the revelation of the way of eternal life. \n     [FOR COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF HEALTH FOOD AND RESTAURANT WORK SEE 7T 110-131; C.H. 471-496]",
