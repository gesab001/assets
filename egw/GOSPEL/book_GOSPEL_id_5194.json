    "word": "The Old Testament, containing the prophecies of the coming of Christ, is now made of small account. The cry now is, \"The Christ, the Christ! The gospel, the gospel!\" But the gospel is taught all the way through the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. The gospel is revealed in all the prophecies of the first advent of Christ as the Saviour of men. Every act of the old dispensation to turn men away from sin or to bring them forgiveness was done with reference to the Saviour who was to come. He was the steppingstone by which man was to be exalted.",
