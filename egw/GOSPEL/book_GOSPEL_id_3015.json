    "word": "THIS SECTION BRINGS TOGETHER IN THREE CHAPTERS THE VITAL TRUTHS RELATING TO FAITH AND WORKS. THE FIRST CHAPTER IS DEVOTED TO TYPICAL STATEMENTS MADE BY ELLEN WHITE FROM 1850 TO 1888 SHOWING HER CLEAR-CUT STAND IN A BALANCED PRESENTATION OF JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. THE THIRD CHAPTER BRINGS TO VIEW HER CONSISTENT DECLARATIONS, SHOWING A UNITY OF TEACHING ALL THROUGH HER MINISTRY. ONLY A FEW TYPICAL STATEMENTS ARE INCLUDED TO REMIND US OF HER WORK IN PRESENTING THIS VITAL TRUTH, WHICH IS THE VERY HEART OF THE GOSPEL. CHAPTER TWO, HISTORICAL IN NATURE, PRESENTS HER REVIEW OF THE EXPERIENCE AT THE MINNEAPOLIS GENERAL CONFERENCE AND THE WORK ON HER PART, RELATED TO THIS EXPERIENCE, IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED THAT CONFERENCE. THIS CHAPTER IS INTRODUCED BY A SOMEWHAT EXTENDED STATEMENT GIVING A BACKGROUND FOR HER HISTORICAL REVIEW.--WHITE TRUSTEES.",
