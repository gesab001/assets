    "word": "Let no man be treated as lord and dictator over the gospel ministry or the gospel medical missionary work. The Lord is testing and proving everyone, to see if in humility men will perform the divine will, taking Christ for their counselor, carefully studying His character, and walking as He walked. To everyone who gives himself unreservedly to Christ is assigned a post where he may engage in acceptable service.",
