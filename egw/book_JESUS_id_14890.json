{"word": "Like faithless Thomas, you have considered it a virtue to doubt unless you could have unmistakable evidence, removing from your mind all cause for doubt. Did Jesus commend the unbelieving Thomas while granting him the evidence which he declared he would have before he believed? Jesus said unto him: \"Be not faithless, but believing.\" Thomas answered: \"My Lord and my God.\" He is now compelled to believe; there is no room to doubt. Jesus then said: \"Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\" You were represented to me as uniting with the rebel leader and his host to annoy, perplex, dishearten, discourage, and overthrow those who are battling for the right, who are standing under the bloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel. Your influence, I was shown, has turned souls from keeping the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. You have employed your talents and your skill to manufacture weapons to place in the hands of the enemies of God, to fight those who are trying to obey God in keeping His commandments. While angels have been commissioned to strengthen the things that remain, to withstand and counteract your influence, they have looked with the deepest grief upon your work to dishearten \n                                                                           105\nand destroy. You have caused pure, sinless, holy angels to weep.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2T", "page": 104}
