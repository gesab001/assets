{"word": "Digging for Deeper Gems of Truth \n\n     The student of the Sabbath school should be in earnest, should dig deep and search with the greatest care for the precious gems of truth contained in the weekly lessons. The privileges and opportunities which they now have of becoming intelligent in regard to the Scriptures should not be neglected. God would have those who profess to be His followers thoroughly furnished with proof of the doctrines of His word. When and where can this be better obtained than in youth at the Sabbath school? Parents should in no case treat this matter indifferently.-- Review and Herald, Nov. 28, 1878.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CSW", "page": 22}
