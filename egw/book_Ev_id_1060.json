{"word": "The Christian's Oath of Allegiance.--As Christians submit to the solemn rite of baptism, He registers the vow that they make to be true to Him. This vow is their oath of allegiance. They are baptized in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Thus they are united with the three great powers of heaven. They pledge themselves to renounce the world and to observe the laws of the kingdom of God. Henceforth they are to walk in newness of life. No longer are they to follow the traditions of men. No \n                                                                           308\nlonger are they to follow dishonest methods. They are to obey the statutes of the kingdom of heaven. They are to seek God's honor. If they will be true to their vow, they will be furnished with grace and power that will enable them to fulfill all righteousness. \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.--Letter 129, 1903.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 307}
