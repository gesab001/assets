{"word": "Look unto Jesus who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Let us not do as we have done, make ourselves miserable over some supposed future tomorrow's burden. Carry your duties of today cheerfully. Today's faith, today's trust in Jesus, we must have. Today I may look and live. Today I will put my trust in God. Today I will rest in quietude and peace kept by the power of God. Say, \"The Lord will be glorified by my being cheerful and happy in His assurance of His love--today.\"", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 180}
