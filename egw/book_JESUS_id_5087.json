{"word": "I saw how this grace could be obtained. Go to your closet and there alone plead with God. \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me\" (Psalm 51:10). Be in earnest, be sincere. Fervent prayer availeth much. Jacob-like, wrestle in prayer. Agonize. Jesus in the garden sweat great drops of blood; you must make an effort. Do not leave your closet until you feel strong in God; then watch, and just as long as you watch and pray, you can keep these evil besetments under, and the grace of God can, and will, appear in you.", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 87}
