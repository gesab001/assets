    "word": "You are just as surely doing the work of Satan as is any one of his open agents. The doubts which you have introduced into many minds will bear fruit. Your harvest is ripening for the final gathering. Will you be proud of it then? \n                                                                           289\nYou may turn to the Lord; you may find rest in Him.

You must be a thoroughly converted, transformed man, or you will never have the precious gift of everlasting life. \n\n                                               -",
