{"word": "History of the World a Conflict Between Hate and Love.--Satan's enmity against Christ has been manifested against His followers. The same hatred of the principles of God's law, the same policy of deception by which error is made to appear as truth, by which human laws \n\n\n                                                   525 \n\nare substituted for the law of God and men are led to worship the creature rather than the Creator, may be traced in all the history of the past. Satan's efforts to misrepresent the character of God, to cause men to cherish a false conception of the Creator and thus to regard Him with fear and hate rather than with love; his endeavors to set aside the divine law, leading the people to think themselves free from its requirements; and his persecution of those who dare to resist his deceptions, have been steadfastly pursued in all ages. They may be traced in the history of patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, of martyrs and reformers.--GC x (1888).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 524}
