{"word": "Labor Unions in the Cities \n\n     Satan is busily at work in our crowded cities. His work is to be seen in the confusion, the strife and discord between labor and capital, and the hypocrisy that has come into the churches. . . . The lust of the flesh, the pride of the eyes, the display of selfishness, the misuse of power, the cruelty and the force used to cause men to unite with confederacies and unions--binding themselves up in bundles for the burning of the great fires of the last days--all these are the working of satanic agencies.--Ev 26 (1903).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 116}
