    "word": "Brother and Sister G should unite their influence in saying: \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" It is a misfortune to borrow the trouble of next week to embitter the present week. When real trouble comes, God will fit every meek and lowly one to bear it. When His providence permits it to come, He will provide help to endure it. Fretting and murmuring cloud and stain the soul, and shut out the bright sunlight from the pathway of others.",
