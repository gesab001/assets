    "word": "I cannot hold my peace and let the flock of God be misled. But I beseech you not to let a drive be made against our brother, for this would not be right. Stand in defense of the truth; exalt the truth. God has given the erring one every encouragement to turn fully to Him. Our brother has been following his perverted judgment, and his soul has been lifted up unto vanity; but he should not be personally attacked, because it is not the right thing to do to open these opposition charges before the world. Keep to the affirmative of truth, as did Paul in his charge to Timothy: \"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears\" [2 Timothy 4:2, 3].",
