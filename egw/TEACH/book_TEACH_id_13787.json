This is the very work that is devolving on the teacher. It is to try to educate, educate, educate, by precept and example; and if we can get a church in working order, and if we can teach them how to work in this very line, you will find that these workers will have a special interest. \"Why, yes,\" they will say, \"I have acted a part in that work; I have done something in that, and I have an interest to do more.\" Just according to the several ability which God has committed to them can they work intelligently, and work in Christ. \n                                                                           147",
