    "word": "Christ chose the foolish things of the world\u2014those whom the world pronounced unlearned and ignorant\u2014to confound the wise men of the world. The disciples were unlearned in the traditions of the rabbis, but with Christ as their example and teacher, they were gaining an education of the highest order; for they had before them a divine Example. Christ was presenting to them truths of the highest character.",
