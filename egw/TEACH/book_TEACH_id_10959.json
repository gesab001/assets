This matter has not yet been patiently and perseveringly worked out. Those who neglect this branch of study, which comprehends so much, will make hazardous work in attempting to teach the youth. They are not qualified to direct in our schools, because the way of the Lord must be learned in order to be practiced.\" --P. C. \"Our School Work.\"",
