Ballenger wrote to Ellen White in Australia in 1899 about setting up a type of colony in the South comprised of a collection of Adventist families in order to aid the Southern blacks. The families would purchase a plot of land and develop it while teaching blacks agricultural methods and the Adventist message. The missionaries, however, would have to pledge five years of service in order to join the colony.\nJune 5, 1899\nDear Brother__________:\n     I remember you distinctly, and I have rejoiced to see you growing in grace and working in the Lord\u2019s vineyard.
