    "word": "To place young men and young women in such a field who have not developed a deep, earnest, love for God and the souls for whom Christ has died, is making a mistake which will result in the loss of many precious souls. The teacher needs to be susceptible to the influences of the Spirit of God. Not one who will become impatient and irritated, should be an educator. Teachers must consider that they are dealing with children, not men and women. They are children who have everything to learn, and it is much more difficult for some to learn than others. The dull scholar needs much more encouragement than he receives. If teachers are placed over these varied minds who naturally love to order and dictate and magnify themselves in their authority, who will deal with partiality, having favorites to whom they will show preferences, while others are treated with exactitude and severity, it will create a state of confusion and insubordination. Teachers who have not been blessed with a pleasant and well balanced experience may be placed to take charge of children and youth, but a great wrong is done to those whom they instruct. Those who accept such persons as teachers are responsible for the evil resulting from their course of teaching, and in giving a wrong mold to young human minds. It may be compared to a field untilled, and when tares are sowed with the wheat, a crop of thistles and weeds \n\n\n                              -111- \n\nand briars is the result of this defective education.",
