    "word": "I am instructed to say to the men in our institutions, Be free men. Christ has made you free; then take your stand as God's property, not to be bought or sold under any circumstances. The Lord calls for volunteers, just as He called the fishermen to leave their nets and follow Him, and just as He called Matthew from the receipt of customs. He calls upon them to unite with Him, the greatest Teacher the world has ever known, and to learn from Him how to work for the salvation of souls. \"Follow Me,\" he says, and many will obey the call. God has His men of opportunity, who will leave all and follow Him. The Lord would not have these men bring into their work the practises they have followed in the past; they are to learn of Christ His methods and plans.",
