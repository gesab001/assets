    "word": "Chap. 6 - Days of Conflict\n\n     The Jewish teachers made many rules for the people, and required them to do many things that God had not commanded. Even the children had to learn and obey these rules. But Jesus did not try to learn what the rabbis taught. He was careful not to speak disrespectfully of these teachers, but He studied the Scriptures, and obeyed the laws of God.",
