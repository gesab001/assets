    "word": "Trivial characters must be changed. They must be converted, and receive the new heart that God has promised. In this work they must go to the word of God for guidance. \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" Teachers, as well as students, need to learn each day from the word of God, which is the man of our counsel. It never makes a mistake. Its teaching will perfect in each individual a character that God can approve. It is the voice of God speaking to the soul.",
