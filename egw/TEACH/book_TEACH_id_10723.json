    "word": "Should not our God be served most faithfully? We are called upon as teachers to rise up with firm purpose of heart, \n\n\n                              -10- \n\nand discipline ourselves with sternness and rigor to habits of order and thoroughness. All that our hands find to do is to be well done. We have been bought with a price, even the blood of the Son of God, and all that we do is to honor and glorify our Redeemer. We are to work in partnership with Christ as verily as Christ works in partnership with the Father. We are to lay aside every weight, \"and the sin that doth so easily beset,\" that we may follow our Lord with full purpose of heart.",
