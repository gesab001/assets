    "word": "But the wilful ones say, \"I will not move a step till I see all things plainly. \"When they close the understanding lest they shall see, they say, \"Explain.\" This brings questions with no spirit to receive if they are answered satisfactorily but when they see they cannot turn down with (one) question, they will start another, and still another, not admitting the rays of light that do shine upon them. Will God teach such ones? No. They had light enough to take the first step and if they had put away that pride of will which makes them cruel to themselves, they would, in taking the first step (have) taken the second; but when light is rejected the Lord will not work a miracle to make that man believe. If he will walk by faith he has light enough to move at God's bidding to see where God is working and to work with Him.",
