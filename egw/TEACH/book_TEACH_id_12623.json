    "word": "Need for Deeper Consecration by Teachers -- The school in Battle Creek has overgrown the qualifications of its educators. Professor Prescott is absent much of the time. If he were present his experience would help the underteachers, but even if he were there all the time, there is gathering in all the time more responsibility than can be successfully carried. When there is deeper consecration with the instructors of youth, God will work with their efforts. -- Ms. 45, 1893, p. 3. (\"Educational Advantages Not to be Centered in Battle Creek,\" n.d.)",
