    "word": "Why did Paul thus connect mechanical labor with the preaching of the gospel?  Was not the laborer worthy of his hire?  Why did he not labor all his time in preaching?  Why waste time and strength in making tents?  But  Paul did not regard the time spent in making tents lost by any means. As he worked with Aquila, he kept in touch with the great Teacher. He  gave Aquila needed instruction in spiritual things, and he also educated the believers in unity. While working at his trade he gave an example in diligence and thoroughness. He was diligent in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. He and Aquila and Priscilla had more than one prayer-and-praise meeting with those associated\n75\nwith them in tent-making. This was a testimony to the value of the truth they were presenting.--AU Gleaner, June 16, 1909.",
