    "word": "In choosing men and women for His service, God does not ask whether they possess worldly wealth, learning, or eloquence. He asks, \"Do they walk in such humility that I can teach them My way? Can I put My words into their lips? Will they represent Me?\" God can use every person just in proportion as He can put His Spirit into the soul temple. The work that He will accept is the work that reflects His image. His followers are to bear, as their credentials to the world, the ineffaceable characteristics of His immortal principles.",
