No one should study or work that he may be considered a superior teacher, or a person of unusual ability, but that he \n                                                                           122\nmay lead souls to Christ. There will come temptations to weave self into all that is done, but the work will be marred if this is done, for it will lead to making dry, lengthy remarks that will fail to interest or benefit the minds of the children.--TSS 35.",
