    "word": "At first the angels could not rejoice; for their Commander concealed nothing from them, but opened before them the plan of salvation. Jesus told them that He would . . . leave all His glory in heaven, appear upon earth as a man, humble Himself as a man, . . . and that finally, after His mission as a teacher would be accomplished, He would be delivered into the hands of men, and endure almost every cruelty and suffering that Satan and his angels could inspire men to inflict; that He would die the cruelest of deaths, hung up between the heavens and the earth as a guilty sinner; that He should suffer dreadful hours of agony, which even\n60\nangels could not look upon, but would veil their faces from the sight. . . .",
