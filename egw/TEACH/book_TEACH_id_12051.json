    "word": "Do you not appreciate the desire of your teachers that you shall become a student of whom they may be proud? But only in the strength which Jesus Christ gives you can you resist eating of the forbidden tree of knowledge.

One evil thought which you may instill into another's mind, one evil action in which you may educate him, may be the ruin of that soul. If you should attend any school to do that kind of work I would say, Separate him from the school, for he is Satan's agent, be he the son of a minister or of a layman. \n\n\n                                    -201-",
