    "word": "Just What Man Needs \n\n     God has not made the reception of the gospel to depend upon human reasoning. The gospel is adapted for spiritual food, to satisfy man's spiritual appetite. In every case it is just what man needs. Those who have felt it necessary to have the students in our schools study many authors are themselves the most ignorant on the great themes of the Bible. The teachers themselves need to take up the Book of all books, and learn from the Scriptures that the gospel has power to prove its own divinity to the humble, contrite mind.",
