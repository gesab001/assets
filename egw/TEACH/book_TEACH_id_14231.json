    "word": "(502) The worker who considers himself in a position of such high responsibility that he allows the members of the churches to look to him to voice their decisions and control their actions, is educating men and women to wear a human yoke. They are not learning of the divine teacher. To the one who is being led to have such an experience I would say, \"Go to Christ; ask Him to give you an experience; learn to emulate His faultless character, and do not look for experience of guidance to any human being, who is as liable to err as yourself.",
