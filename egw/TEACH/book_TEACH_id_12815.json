    "word": "Men have been given the work of judging whether or not a book was of value, who were not sufficiently intelligent in regard to the matter to be entrusted with this work. They needed to realize their ignorance, to become educated. They needed to wear Christ's yoke, and learn of Him who is meek and lowly in heart. They needed to heed the injunction, \"Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it\" [Deuteronomy 11:8]. \"Lay up these words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. \n\n\n                                -182- \n\nAnd ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up\" [verses 18, 19].",
