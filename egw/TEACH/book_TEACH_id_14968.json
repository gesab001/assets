    "word": "The Lord calls for steps in advance. Because the teachers may never have been trained to physical, manual labor, they are not easily persuaded in regard to the very best methods to secure for the youth an all-round education, and even the very ones who have been most reluctant to come into line in this matter, had they been given in their youth the physical, mental, and moral education combined, might have saved themselves several attacks of illness, and their brain, bone, and muscle would at this time be in a more healthy condition because all of the Lord's machine would be proportionately taxed. Precious lessons from the best instructors should be secured in spiritual lines, in agricultural employments, and also in carpenter's trade and in the printing business. The Lord would have these mechanical industries brought in and taught by competent men.",
