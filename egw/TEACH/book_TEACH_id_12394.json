    "word": "The Lord instructed me that some connected with the institution would not see the necessity of uniting agricultural work with the instruction given in the school. In all our educational institutions physical and mental work should have been combined. In vigorous physical exercise, the animal passions find a healthy outlet and are kept in proper bounds. Healthful exercise in the open air will strengthen the muscles, encourage a proper circulation of blood, help to preserve the body from disease, and will be a great help in spirituality. For many years it has been presented to me that teachers and students should unite in this work. This was done anciently in the schools of the prophets.--Ms 40, 1903, p. 11.
