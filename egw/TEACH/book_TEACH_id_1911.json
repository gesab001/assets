    "word": "Essential Qualifications \n\n     Those whose duty it is to select teachers should be guarded, and not urge those into the school who are not fitted to exert a good influence. How is the teacher's behavior? Is he punctual? Is he cleanly and neat? This should have attention; for these qualities are essential in a teacher. How can he enjoin these necessary acquirements upon the class unless they have an example of punctuality, of neatness, composure, and order? If the teacher is not in his place, and the class are left to amuse themselves, and the teacher comes rushing in breathless, behind time, the influence is leading to nonpunctuality and disorder.--TSS 95, 96.",
