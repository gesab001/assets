    "word": "WE LEARN FROM A PREVIOUS VERSE THAT WHEN CHRIST ASCENDED UP ON HIGH, HE GAVE GIFTS UNTO MEN. AMONG THESE GIFTS ARE ENUMERATED APOSTLES, PROPHETS, EVANGELISTS, PASTORS, AND TEACHERS. THE OBJECT FOR WHICH THEY WERE GIVEN WAS THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS IN UNITY AND KNOWLEDGE. SOME WHO PROFESS TO BE PASTORS AND TEACHERS AT THE PRESENT DAY HOLD THAT THESE GIFTS FULLY ACCOMPLISHED THEIR OBJECT SOME EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO, \n                                                                           140\nAND CONSEQUENTLY CEASED. WHY NOT THEN THROW ASIDE THEIR TITLES OF PASTORS AND TEACHERS? IF THE OFFICE OF PROPHET IS BY THIS TEXT LIMITED TO THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH, SO IS THAT OF THE EVANGELIST--AND ALL THE REST; FOR NO DISTINCTION IS MADE.",
