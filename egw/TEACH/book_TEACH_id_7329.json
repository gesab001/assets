    "word": "The truths which this parable teaches were made a living reality in his own life. In both his physical and his spiritual nature, he followed the divine order of growth, illustrated by the plant, as he wishes all youth to do. Although he was the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, he became a babe in Bethlehem, and for a time represented the helpless infant in its mother's care. In childhood he did the works of an obedient child. He spoke and acted with the wisdom of a child, and not of a man, honoring his parents, and carrying out their wishes in helpful ways, according to the ability of a child. But at each stage of his development he was perfect, with the simple, natural grace of a sinless life. The sacred record says of his childhood, \" The child \n                                                                           69\ngrew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.\" And of his youth it is recorded, \"Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\" Luke 2:40, 52.",
