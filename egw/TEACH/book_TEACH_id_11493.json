    "word": "There are many honest souls who are in darkness; they have confused ideas as to what the Scriptures teach; and if the lessons of Christ the truths of the Bible, in their simplicity, are placed before them, they will recognize the light and rejoice in it. Their perplexities will vanish before the light of the truth as dew before the morning sun. Their conceptions of Bible truth will be expanded, and the revelation of God in Christ will come to them, showing them the depth, breadth, and height of divine and spiritual mystery that they did not discern before, that cannot be explained, but only exemplified in Christlike character.",
