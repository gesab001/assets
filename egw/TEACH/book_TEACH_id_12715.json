    "word": "How many there are who need to become fools in their own estimation in order that they may be wise. God bestows on the humble and contrite one a wisdom that He does not give to the worldly-wise and prudent, those who are so self-sufficient that they know not the things that make for their peace. He reveals His wisdom to babes. He lays in the dust all human pride, but He recognizes the meek and the lowly, and exalts them with a true exaltation. How tenderly God regards the humble, contrite, self-denying follower of Christ, who is a daily learner in the school of the great Teacher.",
