    "word": "Brethren in the ministry, I feel called upon to say to you, Rebuke all who shall flatter or praise you. Lead the people to look to God and have faith in him, instead of attracting them to yourselves. You are in constant danger in this respect. Those who extol and favor you, you will, in your finite judgment, regard as your best friends, when they are the very ones who are subject to temptation, and who will become your tempters. If you are wrong, they will strengthen you in the wrong, and will, through their counsel and influence, lead you to do that which will harm your own soul, and result in weakness to the church. For Christ's sake \n259\nteach the people to look to God, and to him alone; teach them to receive light from him, to search the Scriptures for themselves, and know for themselves what is truth.",
