    "word": "When Christ was in our world, he had but few followers. His disciples were continually kept back from making the advancement that they might have made, from supplying their great lack of knowledge, and from becoming efficient workers by the customs and the maxims of the scribes and Pharisees. \n\n\n                                    -151- \n\nThe customs and traditions, which had come down from generation to generation through the rabbis, had been made all-essential, and were regarded as of more force than even the ten commandments. Thus the precepts and teachings of men were dwelt upon as of more value than the words of the living God.",
