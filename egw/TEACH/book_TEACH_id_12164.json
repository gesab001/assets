    "word": "The apostles, used as His representatives, would make a decided impression upon all minds. Being humble men would not diminish their influence, but increase it. The minds of their hearers would be carried from the men to the Majesty of heaven, who, though unseen, was still working. The teaching of the apostles, the special doctrines taught, their words of trust, would assure all that it was not by their own power that they did their works, but that they were continuing the same line carried forward by the Lord Jesus when He was with them. Humbling themselves, the apostles would declare that the man the Jews had crucified was the Prince of life, the Son of the living God, and that in His name, they did the works He had done.-- Ms 41, 1896, pp. 6, 7.
