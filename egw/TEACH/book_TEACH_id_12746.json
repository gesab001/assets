    "word": "Those whose characters are marred by a passionate disposition, should be in haste to seek the Lord. From their hearts the prayer should arise, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me\" [Psalms 51:10]. Give me a correct estimate of Jesus Christ and His merits.
