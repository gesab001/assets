    "word": "We must not treat the colored people as if God had no message for them. Become acquainted with the teachers. Encourage them in their work, and take a part with them in their labors when this is possible. The gospel in its simplicity is to be presented to this people. If you will labor in the spirit of Christ, conversions to the truth will be the result of this work.--Letter 154, 1907, pp. 1, 2, 3. (To J. S. Washburn, April 17, 1907.)",
