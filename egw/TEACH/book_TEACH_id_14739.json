    "word": "The one standing at the head of a school should in no case give the impression that commonness and familiarity are allowable. His lips and his hands are to express nothing that anyone can take advantage of. Let men keep their place, and let the girl students, be they black or white, keep their place. Never should any liberties in word or act be taken by a teacher.",
