    "word": "There are many ways in which God can punish, and punishment will surely follow wherever pride is indulged. \"Pride goeth before destruction.\" Let a man be lifted up by a sense of his own ability, and trust in his human strength, and he will surely be overcome by temptation. God will bring him down. He will teach him his utter weakness, that he may feel his need of divine aid. Let anyone glory in his wisdom or his talents, or in anything but Christ and him crucified, and he will learn that the Lord alone is to be exalted.",
