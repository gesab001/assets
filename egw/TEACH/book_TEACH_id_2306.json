    "word": "Increase by Use \n\n     The teacher should not think that all his time is to be spent in the study of books. By putting into practice what he learns, he will obtain more than he will by mere study. As he uses his knowledge he will receive more. Some who have but one talent feel that they can do nothing. They hide their talent in the earth, as it were; and because they receive no increase they murmur against God. But if they would use the ability given them, their talent would double. It is by a faithful use of talents that they are multiplied. As we use aright the advantages God gives us, He increases our capabilities for service.",
