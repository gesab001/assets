    "word": "Let the children feel that they are children of God, bought with a price. The Lord wants them to give their young hearts to Him. The teachers and the older students may help to bring these children to Christ. If you are ever ready to speak a word in season, the Spirit of God will carry your words to the heart. The Lord would be pleased to see the older students feel a large responsibility for the younger ones. God will use them as His instruments to influence other students to form right and correct habits that will keep them from doing wrong, even though they are not under the eye of the teacher.",
