    "word": "An earnest study of God's Word, resulting in transformation of character and in a fitness for service, will make the Fernando school a power for good. My brethren who are to be connected with this school, your strength lies not in the number of languages you may teach, or in telling how large a \"college\" you have. Keep silent on these points. Silence in regard to the great things you plan to do, will help you more than all the positive assertions and the promises that you might publish in your announcements. You need to publish nothing of the kind. By faithfulness in the school, you should demonstrate that you are working on foundation-principles, principles that will prepare the students for entrance through the pearly gates into the heavenly city. The saving of souls is worth far more than mere intellectual training. A pretentious display of human learning, the manifestation of pride of personal appearance, is worthless. The Lord values obedience to His will; for only by walking humbly and obediently before Him, can man glorify God.",
