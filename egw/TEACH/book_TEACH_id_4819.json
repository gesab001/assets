    "word": "The moral standing of a community is dependent upon the diffusion of Bible knowledge and the growth of true religion. Where the religious teachers bar the people from obtaining light from the Scriptures, unbelief, skepticism, and infidelity cannot but prevail. And with such examples as are given by these pastors, who are seeking to benefit themselves and not their flock, it is not strange that the people are self-indulgent, pleasure-loving, and sensual. But the Lord will cause the light of truth to shine forth amid the moral darkness; and those who receive the truth should be careful to correctly represent its sanctifying power upon their life and character, to show the contrast between the influence of truth and that of error.",
