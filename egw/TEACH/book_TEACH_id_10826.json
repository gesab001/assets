    "word": "The Lord calls upon his people to make offerings of self-denial. Let us all unite in making him a New Year's offering that will lift the heavy burden resting upon his institutions in Scandinavia. Let us give up something which we intended to purchase for personal comfort or pleasure. Let us teach the children to deny self, and become the Lord's helping hand in dispensing his blessings. Let us send in our offerings with thanksgiving, and with prayer that the Lord will bless the gifts, and multiply them as he did the food fed to the five thousand.",
