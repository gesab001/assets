    "word": "Endeavor to place yourself where you will not be confused by the representations and forbiddings of human agencies who would misinterpret the true meaning of the higher education. Lift up the Man of Calvary. By the work of teaching and by earnest prayer, endeavor to place the students where they will receive inspiration of heaven. Jesus Christ is to be presented before them as the Source of all light and knowledge. Let none dishonor Him by choosing to accept the world's interpretation of what the higher education means. Let us leave that to those who do not acknowledge the truths of the word of God as the source of all true knowledge.",
