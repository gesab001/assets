    "word": "John, I saw that James and you, as ministers of Jesus Christ, must watch your words, and your minds must dwell upon the truth. Whoever you are with, don't talk at random. Let your words be solemn. The day of the Lord is at hand. I was pointed to the life of John the Baptist. His life was without pleasure. It was sorrowful and self-denying. He proclaimed Christ's advent and then could not see and enjoy the power manifested by Christ. He knew that when Jesus should fully establish Himself as a Teacher, he must die. He was cruelly beheaded. I saw that the least disciple that followed Jesus, witnessed His miracles, heard the comforting words that fell from His lips, was greater than John the Baptist; that is, more exalted and honored, had more pleasure in his life.",
