    "word": "The Lord's workers cannot be too careful that their actions do not contradict their words; for a consistent life alone can command respect. If our practise harmonizes with our teachings, our works will have effect; but piety that is not based upon conscientious principles is as salt without savor. To speak, and do not, is as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. It is of no use for us to strive to inculcate principles which we do not conscientiously practise.--Sp. Test.",
