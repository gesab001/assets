    "word": "Converts Copy Their Minister\n \n\n     When ministers walk with God their converts partake of their spirit.--Converts seldom rise at once in spirituality above the level of their teachers. How important, then, that those teachers should habitually put their trust in God, and seek for the manifestations of His divine power upon their labors; that they should be meek, spiritually-minded, and in constant communion with Heaven. Then those who are converted under their labors will partake of their spirit, and emulate their graces.--RH Aug. 8, 1878.",
