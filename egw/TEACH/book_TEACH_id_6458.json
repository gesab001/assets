    "word": "The priests and Pharisees thought they were doing great things as teachers, by putting their own interpretation upon the Word of God; but Christ said of them, \"Ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God\" (Mark 12:24). He charged them with the guilt of \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men\" (chap. 7:7). Though they were the teachers of the oracles of God, though they were supposed to understand His Word, they were not doers of the Word. Satan had blinded their eyes that they should not see its true import.",
