    "word": "There are men who possess excellent faculties, but who have come to a standstill. They do not go forward unto victory. And all the ability with which God has endowed them will be of no value to them if it is unused. Many of these men are found among the grumblers. They grumble because, they say, they are not appreciated. But they do not appreciate themselves sufficiently to co-operate with the greatest Teacher the world has ever known.",
