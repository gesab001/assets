    "word": "Of Christ's teaching it is said, \"The common people heard him gladly\" (Mark 12:37). \"Never man spake like this man,\" declared the officers who were sent to take Him. His words comforted, strengthened, and blessed those who were hungering for that peace which He alone could give. O how tender and forbearing was Christ! how filled with pity and tenderness were His lessons to the poor, the afflicted, and the oppressed! . . . His illustrations were taken from the things of daily life, and . . . had in them a wonderful depth of meaning.
