    "word": "\"At every step that we advance, if our advance is one of safety, we must lean wholly upon a power out of and above ourselves. The Lord is infinite. He has all resources at His command, and if we trust in Him implicitly, and not in our own capabilities, we shall walk softly and reverently before Him, and have less and less confidence in human capabilities. Nothing of the natural, the human, must take the place of the Spirit of God. No man, however much he may desire it, can use the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is to use us. Self must be placed at the disposal of the Spirit of God. This must be recognized as the working agent, to mold the man, and to teach him all things.",
