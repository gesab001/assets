    "word": "His impressive parable of the good shepherd represents the responsibility of every minister and of every Christian who has accepted the position as teacher of children and youth and the teacher of old and young in opening to them the Scriptures. If one strays from the fold, he is not allowed with harsh words and with a whip, but with winning invitations to return. The ninety-and-nine that have not strayed do not call for the sympathy and tender pitying love of the shepherd. But the shepherd follows the sheep and lambs that have caused him the greatest anxiety and have engrossed his sympathies. The disinterested, faithful shepherd leaves all the rest of the sheep, and his whole heart and soul and energy are taxed to seek the one that is lost. And then the figure--praise God!--the shepherd returns with \n\n\n                                  -113- \n\nthe sheep, carrying him in his arms, rejoicing at every step. He says, \"Rejoice with me, I have found my sheep that was lost.\" I am so thankful we have in the parable the sheep found. And this is the very lesson the shepherd is to learn - success in bringing the sheep and lambs back.",
