He was one of the world's greatest \n                                                                           407\nteachers. He crossed the seas, and traveled far and near, until a large portion of the world had learned from his lips the story of the cross of Christ.

His whole soul was engaged in the work of the ministry; but he seated himself to the labor of his humble trade that he might not be burdensome to the churches that were pressed with poverty. Although he had planted many churches, he refused to be supported by them, fearing that his usefulness and success as a minister of Christ might be injured by suspicions that he was preaching the gospel for gain. He would remove from his enemies all occasion to misrepresent him, and thus to detract from the force of his message.",
