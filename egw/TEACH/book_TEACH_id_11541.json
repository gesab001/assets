    "word": "There must be more candid thought, more sanctified power in your preaching. You are not what you might be, and what God has made every provision that you should be. Diligent, earnest labor put forth on yourself will not be lost. Your labor will produce good fruit. You can afford to take time, put up your supplications to heaven for that grace which is needful for you, that you may be a successful warrior over your own lusts, and then you will be a winner of souls, and your example will not contradict your teachings. The self-denial and self-sacrifice that others have practiced should be imitated by you. Prayer, sacrifices, and sanctified labors are the conditions of our success, for we shall not be able to give full proof of our ministry unless we are connected with God. We too often regard ourselves as completely our own, the owners of our time, property, speech and other faculties. We are only stewards in trust of faculties and goods that \n\n\n                          [45] \n\nhave been given to us of the Master. He is the source of our power. Not only does God own us, but he alone has the right and is competent to determine what is the proper use of all his intrusted gifts, and he can guide and control them to the very best purpose, worthy of such endowments. The power of social influence is intrusted to us of God, but, oh, how sadly this power is perverted. I appeal to you to dig deep, to lay your foundations sure; draw water daily from the wells of salvation, and the Lord will make you as a spring of water to refresh others.",
