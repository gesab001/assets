    "word": "Teachers, what opportunities are yours? What a privilege is within your reach of molding the minds and characters of the youth under your charge! What a joy it will be to you to meet them around the great white throne, and know that you have done what you could to fit them for immortality! If your work stands the test of the great day, how like sweetest music will fall upon your ear the benediction of the Master, \n                                                                           91\n\"Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"",
