    "word": "How to Gain Respect \n\n     Let teachers feel that, whatever the character of the difficulty, they must meet it in the spirit of Jesus. Do not meet combativeness with combativeness. You will have to deal with willfulness, stubbornness, indolence, and frivolity; but under all emergencies manifest kindness and love, and by patience and self-control, keep your hold upon your pupils' affection, and let them have reason to know that your whole desire is to do them good. Show your scholars that you have confidence in them. Visit them at their homes, and invite them to your home. Let it be seen that you love them not only in word, but in deed and in truth.",
