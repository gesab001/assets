    "word": "\"Learn of me,\" said the greatest Teacher that the world has ever known. \"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" (Matthew 11:29). It is not enough for us to read the Word of God. The Scriptures are given for our instruction, and we are to search them carefully and diligently. We are to study the Word of God, comparing one portion with another. Scripture is the key that unlocks scripture. As we read and study and pray, there is beside us a divine Teacher, the Holy Spirit, enlightening our understanding, that we may comprehend the great truths of God's Word.--Pacific Union Recorder, Feb. 23, 1905.",
