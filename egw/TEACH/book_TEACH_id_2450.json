    "word": "Higher education is not gained by the study of a certain class of books that worldly teachers deem essential, but by the study of the word of God. This study will lead to obedience to His requirements and to a constant walking in the footsteps of Christ. There is no education higher than that to be found in the lessons that Christ gave. When these are discarded for the teachings of men, it is time that God's people became converted anew and learned from Christ the simplicity of true godliness. \n\n                                               -",
