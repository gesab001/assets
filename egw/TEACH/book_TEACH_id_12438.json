    "word": "There is no time to spend in frivolity. Deny self, and dress and live simply. Remember that there is a message to be borne to those who are in darkness, a work to be done for the Master. The Lord will bless all who will take part in the work of preparing a people to meet Him in peace. We should be terribly in earnest. Lay your plans before God. Tell Him that you desire to serve Him, give up your desires to Him, and He will teach you His way. --Letter 314, 1907, pp. 1-7. (To Elders Daniells and Evans, September 23, 1907.) \n\nReleased December 6, 1977.",
