    "word": "Men who are under the training of the Great Teacher, will understand the testimonies that he sends them. Those who will not hear and obey the words of Christ, will not hear and obey the message of Christ to them personally. Men will rise up against anything that rebukes their unChristlike course. Shall the testimonies of the Spirit of God be accounted as a thing of naught? Shall a man be put in the position of teacher whose course has been such as to make him an unsafe guide, both because he has not the Spirit of Christ, and because he says in his character, \"I know not the man,\" just as he willfully says, \"I know not the testimonies\"? Will you in Fresno accept of a man as your teacher who cannot understand these things, which you all now have an opportunity to read for yourselves? Spiritual things are spiritually discerned; and if he cannot discern the testimony of the spirit of himself, how can he discern the testimony of God's word, and be able to give to every man his portion of meat in due season? He may present clear and cutting things to the \n\n\n                              [8] \n\npeople, and yet not understand that it is to be brought into his own life, and interwoven with his character. He keeps the truth outside of his inner life, in the outer court.",
