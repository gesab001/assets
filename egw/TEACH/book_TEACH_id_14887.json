    "word": "This truth can in the highest sense be acted, and exemplified before the children. \"Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.\" Hebrews 5:2, 3. Let teachers bear this in mind, and never lose sight of it when they are inclined to have their feelings stirred against the children and youth for misbehaviour. Let them remember that the angels of God are looking upon them sorrowfully; for if the children do err and misbehave, then it is all the more essential that those who are placed over them as teachers should be able to teach them by precept and example. In no \n\n\n                                -110- \n\ncase are they to lose self-control, to manifest impatience, and harshness and want of sympathy and love, for these children are the property of Jesus Christ, and teachers must be very careful and God-fearing in regard to the spirit they cherish and the words they utter, for the children will catch the spirit manifest, be it good or evil. It is a heavy and a sacred responsibility.",
