    "word": "Brother V came to us, and we tried to do our duty to him. But when he returned to Switzerland, and when Elder Andrews visited that country, he did not do by Elder Andrews as we had done by him. He did not help Elder Andrews as we had a right to expect he would. He created suspicion and jealousy of Elder Andrews. He did not give the correct translation of his teachings, but made some of his remarks to be regarded with disfavor because they were made stronger than Elder Andrews designed to give them.--Letter 2a, 1878, p. 6. (To \"Dear Brethren in Switzerland,\" August 29, 1878.)",
