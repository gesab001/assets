    "word": "Some men seem afraid to take God at His word as though it would be presumption in them. They pray for the Lord to teach us and yet are afraid to credit the pledged word of God and believe we have been taught of Him. So long as we come to our heavenly Father humbly and with a spirit to be taught, willing and anxious to learn, why should we doubt God's fulfillment of His own promise? . . . When you have sought to know His will, your part in the operation with God is to believe that you will be led and guided and blessed in the doing of His will. . . . It is Christ who is guiding His people today, showing them where and how to work. \n                                                                           68",
