    "word": "I have been instructed that these places must be worked. Those who understand the reasons for our faith are not to excuse themselves from earnest, interested labor. \"Go work today in My vineyard,\" the Master says. None will be excused from doing their utmost to extend the knowledge of the truth. The word has come to me, \"God's people are not to be only consumers, but producers as well.\" We have a great and grand truth to proclaim. We are not to lose our spirituality in doing nothing; we are to labor to save perishing souls from ruin. All heaven is at work to save the souls ready to die. Will we cooperate with the great Master Worker and heavenly beings? Will we go out into the wilderness of sin and draw souls to Christ? The great Shepherd of the sheep will teach us how to work, how to hunt for souls, and the Holy Spirit will be our efficiency.",
