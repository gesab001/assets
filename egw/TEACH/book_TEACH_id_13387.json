    "word": "There are many things that need to be practiced in our camp meetings to give a correct idea of health reform. Our teachings on health reform should be demonstrated in every respect. A letter came to me a short time since concerning the idea of bringing in peanuts, candies, and ice cream for financial reasons. The light that the Lord has given over and over again on this subject is very plain. This practice was forbidden. The gain is not to be considered, but the influence of spoiling the stomach with these indulgences has proved a large objection religiously. It is contrary to health reform and is giving young children and grown-up children lessons in self-indulgence that the Lord forbids. There is need to give practical lessons in self-denial rather than lessons in self-indulgence. I am instructed to ever keep before the youth and older persons as well that the laying out of money for these sweets for the indulgence of appetite is not to be encouraged at all.",
