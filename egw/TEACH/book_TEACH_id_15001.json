    "word": "A school should be established near Nashville. If every way of advance for the work in Nashville is closed up, will God be glorified? Has not enough of this been done in the past? Shall we have a second edition of what has been? Let the work of selling \"Christ's Object Lessons\" be taken up in this city. Endeavor to interest the merchants in what you are trying to do. Tell them that the proceeds from the sale of the book you are selling are used for missionary purposes. Go to the large schools in and near Nashville, and tell the teachers about the work you are trying to do. Tell them that the book you are selling contains truth that they need in their schools.",
