    "word": "The Lord has warned me that there will come a great apostasy. There will come a falling away in spirituality. Many will turn away their ears from hearing the truth, and will accept fables. Our sanitariums are to be conducted by wise, God-fearing men, who will teach sound doctrines and show why we believe the truth and why we should practice strict temperance in all things, studying how to avoid all harmful practices and influences. Virtue and holiness shall be practiced.",
