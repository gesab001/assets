    "word": "The Lord understands every sacrifice we make for Him to contribute to the necessities of His cause, without ostentation or display. Hide self in Jesus. Our great Teacher has plainly defined the way we should walk. The inward spiritual perception of the truth as it is in Jesus will never exalt the human agent in his own estimate of self. The Spirit of God leads the human heart to realize that sanctification of the Spirit brings self-abasement and lowliness.",
