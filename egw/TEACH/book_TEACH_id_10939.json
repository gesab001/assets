    "word": "Influence of popular schools. \n\n\n     \"From the teachers in the public schools they receive ideas that are opposed to the truth. \n                                                                           12\nBut further than this, they receive a wrong education by associating with children who have no training; who are left to obtain a street education. Satan uses these children to educate children who are more carefully brought up. Before Sabbath-keeping parents know what evil is being done, the lessons of depravity are learned, the souls of their children are corrupted. . . . I would rather that children grow up in a degree of ignorance of school education as it is today, and employ some other means to teach them.\"--P. C.",
