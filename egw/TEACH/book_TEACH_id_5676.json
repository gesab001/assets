    "word": "To Sit at Jesus' Feet Versus Leaning on Human Understanding.--Christ must be blended with all our thoughts, our feelings, our affections. He must be exemplified in the minutest details of everyday service in the work that He has given us to do. When, in the place of leaning upon human understanding or conforming to \n\n\n                                                 783 \n\nworldly maxims, we sit at the feet of Jesus, eagerly drinking in His words, learning of Him, and saying, \"Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\" our natural independence, our self-confidence, our strong self-will, will be exchanged for a childlike, submissive, teachable spirit. When we are in right relation to God, we shall recognize Christ's authority to direct us and His claim to our unquestioning obedience.--Lt 186, 1902. (HC 99.)",
