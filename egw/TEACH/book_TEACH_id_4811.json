    "word": "I have been shown how reading matter on present truth is sometimes  treated by many people in Europe and in other countries. A person receives a  tract or paper. He reads a little in it, finds something that does not agree  with his former views, and throws it aside. But the few words he did read are  not forgotten. Unwelcome though they are, they remain in the mind until an  interest is awakened to read further on the subject. Again the paper is taken  up; again the reader finds something in it that is opposed to his long-cherished opinions and customs, and he angrily flings it aside. But the  rejected messenger says nothing to increase his opposition or arouse his  combativeness; and when the force of his anger dies away, and the paper is  again brought out, it tells the same simple, straightforward story, and he  finds in it precious gems. Angels of God are near to impress the unspoken  word upon his heart; and, although loath to do so, he at last yields, and  light takes possession of his soul. Those who are thus unwillingly converted,  often prove to be among the most substantial believers; and their experience  teaches them to labor perseveringly for others.",
