    "word": "You could not make a greater mistake than to take the voice of man. Those who will not hear truth, when it crosses their pet theories, will often place themselves out of the reach of hearing when they should be the very ones to hear. The same thing is acted over today as it was in the days of Christ. The Pharisees then turned a deaf ear to the instructions of the divine Teacher. But it is our duty and privilege to be learners in the school of Christ. We want to learn of Him who is meek and lowly in heart, who said, \"Come unto Me. . . . and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Matthew 11:28-30.",
