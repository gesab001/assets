    "word": "57\n \n     Recognize Talent--Those who are placed in responsible positions should feel it their duty to recognize talent.  They should learn how to use men, and how to advise them.  If mistakes are made, they should not withdraw themselves, thinking it easier to do the work themselves than to educate others.  Those who are learning should be patiently instructed, precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little.  Every effort should be made, by precept and example, to teach them right methods.",
