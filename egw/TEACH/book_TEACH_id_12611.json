    "word": "Counsel will be needed daily. Do not set students at work for hours on one lesson. Give them a change. The system, the mind, and the brain power of some will be injured by this kind of one-lesson plan. There should be change in the studies. Now, one teacher may think he sees a benefit to be derived. He does not know assuredly that the plans are the precise plans that must be followed. Be sure, teachers, that new plans are not invented to become a hindrance in the place of an advancement. And when you shall leave the school in other experienced hands you are not in any way to bind them to follow out your exact plan of recitations or of study. That which one mind will suppose to be the best plan may not be the best plan for others to follow. . . . Therefore those who shall serve in the place of another teacher should not suppose that his mind is to specify as to the studies of the students. \n\n\n                                 -304-",
