    "word": "I am glad and thankful for this step taken by Brother Smouse. If the work is made dangerous in one place, go to another and labor, but move discreetly, so that the work shall not be destroyed. Our responsible men stand in need of the Holy Spirit's power. To send men who are rash and inconsiderate into the Southern field will be to create a prejudice and hatred that will come from the opposing whites and blacks. Ministers who teach the blacks will report a tissue of lies concerning the work of God which will give the Southern people a supposed excuse to create mobs, and thus the field will be closed. Said Christ, \"Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves\" [Matthew 10:16].--Letter 136, 1898. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nFebruary 28, 1991. Entire Letter.",
