    "word": "For a long time Dr. Kellogg has not been humbly accepting \n\n                                      -364- \n\nChrist as his teacher, and, unknown to himself, has been taught by the master of sophistries. And the enemy has used him as a channel through which to exert a strong controlling influence upon the physicians associated with him. But the Lord will break the spell that is upon these men if they will allow the yoke that has been placed upon them to be broken.",
