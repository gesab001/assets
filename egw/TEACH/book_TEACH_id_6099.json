    "word": "Sabbath school teachers should keep growing even if their minister does not.--Let not the teacher in Sabbath school follow the example of those who do not grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, even though those who minister in the sacred desk have given them such an example. He who would be accepted as a laborer together with God must not be found imitating the tone, manners, or ideas of any other man. He must learn of God, and be endowed with heavenly wisdom. God has given the gift of reason and intellect to one worker the same as He has to another; and according to your ability, you are to put your talents out to the exchangers. The Lord would not have any worker a mere shadow of another whom he admires. The teacher must grow up into the measure of the stature of Christ, not to the measure of some finite erring mortal. You are to \"grow in grace,\" and where is grace to be found?--Only in Christ, the divine Pattern.--CSW 105, 106.",
