    "word": "In the home, in the school, in the church, men, women, and youth are to prepare to give the message to the world. \n                                                                           549\nOur schools are to be more and more efficacious and self-reliant from a human standpoint, more like the schools of the prophets. The teachers should walk very near to God. The Lord calls for strong, devoted, self-sacrificing young men and women who will press to the front and who, after a short time spent in school, will go forth prepared to give the message to the world.",
