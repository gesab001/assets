    "word": "About a week after returning from the camp meeting, I visited the Pacific Union College, where a special meeting was then being held by the teachers of the church schools in this conference. Sara and I left our home for the College on Friday morning, taking the longer route, because the short one is rocky, and at this time of the year very dusty. The long road is about ten miles, four miles farther round than the short route, but it is an excellent road, ascending the mountain gradually. We suffered little annoyance from the dust, but it is a drive of two and a half hours, and a continual ascent, and on reaching the school I felt very weary.",
