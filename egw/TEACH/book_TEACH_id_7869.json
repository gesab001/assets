    "word": "God's people should be governed by different principles than worldlings, who seek to gauge all their course of action according to fashion. In every instance should God-fearing parents train their children for a life of usefulness. They should not permit their principles of government to be tainted with the extravagant notions prevailing in this age, that they must conform to the fashions and be governed by the opinions of worldlings. They should not permit their children to choose their own associates. Teach them that it is your duty to choose for them. Prepare them to bear burdens when young. If your children have been unaccustomed to labor, they will soon become weary. They will complain of side-ache, pain in the shoulders, and tired limbs, and parents will be in danger through sympathy, of doing their work themselves, rather than have their children suffer a little. Let the burden upon the children be very light a first, and then increase the labors a little more every day, until they can do a proper amount of labor without becoming so weary. Inactivity is the greatest cause of side-ache and shoulder-ache among children. \n                                                                           137",
