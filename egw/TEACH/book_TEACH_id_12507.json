    "word": "The devil is seeking them; and what is the reason?--their souls are precious in the sight of God. There is a dignity and coldness in ourselves, so that we cannot place ourselves in a position where we can feel for them. One who has sinned is humiliated in his [own] sight on account of it. But suppose that you crowd the humiliation in strong pressure upon the one who has done wrong, then what? You drive him to desperation, you discourage him; and how is it with a discouraged youth or adult?--he becomes stubborn, unyielding, difficult. Oh, that the Spirit and power of Christ may come into our midst, and that every teacher, and everyone who has a part to act in the work, may let the softening influence of the Holy Spirit into his heart.",
