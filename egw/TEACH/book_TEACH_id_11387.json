    "word": "Conference Schools.--Wherever there are a few Sabbath-schools, let the parents unite together in providing a place for a day school where the children of the various Sabbath-schools can come together. Let them employ a Christian teacher, who, as a consecrated missionary, shall educate the children in such a way as to lead them to become missionaries themselves. Work while it is day, for the night cometh in which no man can work. Parents must gird on the armor, and by their own example, they must teach their children to be missionaries. Let the parents put \n\n\n                         -15- \n\nforth unselfish efforts, and the Lord will work with their efforts as they perseveringly teach their children to bear responsibilities. As the children practise the Bible lessons, they will receive an education of the highest value. Wherever there are Sabbath-keepers, there is a missionary field.",
