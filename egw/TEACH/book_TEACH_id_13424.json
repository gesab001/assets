    "word": "I am instructed to ask those who profess to receive Christ as their personal Saviour, Why do you pass by the words of the Great Teacher, and send your letters to human beings for words of comfort? Why do you rely upon human help when you have the large, full, grand promises, \"He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. ... This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live forever\"? He may die, yet the life of Christ in him is eternal, and he will be raised up at the last day. \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\"",
