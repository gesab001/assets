    "word": "Whatever is done under the sanctified stimulus of Christian obligation, because you are stewards in trust of talents to use to be a blessing to yourself and to others, gives you substantial satisfaction, for all is done to the glory of God. \n\n\n                                 -75- \n\nI can not find an instance in the life of Christ where he devoted time to play and amusement. He was the great Educator for the present and future life. I have not been able to find one instance where he educated his disciples to engage in amusement of football or pugilistic games to obtain physical exercise, or in theatrical performances; and yet, Christ was our pattern in all things. Christ, the world's Redeemer, gave to every man his work, and bade them, \"Occupy till I come.\" And doing his work, the heart warms to such an enterprise, and all the powers of the soul are enlisted in a work assigned of the Lord and Master. It is a high and important work. The Christian teacher and student is enabled to become steward of the grace of Christ and be always in earnest.",
