    "word": "Christ reads their thoughts, and their thoughts were that he did not make the law as prominent as they had done. He takes up their thoughts and says, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. . . . Whosoever therefore shall break \n                                                                           338\none of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven\" [verses 17, 19]. And He makes it still more plain: \"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven\" [verse 20]. Now, they had built over that law, and around it, exactions, and they had burdened it with their own laws and ideas emanating from human, finite beings, until there could no one observe that law, even the letter of it, as they interpreted it; it was impossible.",
