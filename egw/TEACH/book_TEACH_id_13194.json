    "word": "Please look back over your past life and faithfully consider your course in the light of God's Word. Have you made your past wrongs right? You have not cherished that strict conscientiousness in regard to your obligations to your parents that the Bible enjoins. The mother that gave you birth and cared for you in your infancy, you have treated with neglect. You have not regarded her wishes, but have brought pain and sadness to her heart by carrying out your own desires and plans. You have been far from happy. Has the truth you profess sanctified your heart, and softened and subdued your soul? I was shown that the young man of whom I write has a close work to do for himself before he will be fitted to teach the truth to others.",
