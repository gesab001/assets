    "word": "Says the apostle, \"The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears: and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\" On every side we see men easily led captive by the delusive imaginations of those who make void the Word of God; but when the truth is brought before them, they are filled with impatience and anger. But the exhortation of the apostle to the servant of God is, \"Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.\". . .",
