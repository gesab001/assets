    "word": "Let us give more time to the study of the Bible. We do not understand the word as we should. The book of Revelation opens with an injunction to us to understand the instruction that it contains. \"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy,\" God declares, \"and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\" When we as a people understand what this book means to us, there will be seen among us a great revival. We do not understand fully the lessons that it teaches, notwithstanding the injunction given us to search and study it.",
