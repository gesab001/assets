    "word": "Our meetings are closed. We have been engaged in these meetings of the Institute for one month and this has been the most profitable series of meetings we have ever witnessed because the meetings were mostly educational, teaching the best manner of studying the Word, and interesting all in the class to be on hand with their answers. This has been an occasion long to be remembered, where there was an inculcation of ideas. This has been a season of educating that has been represented to me for many years as the proper manner to teach Bible truth.",
