    "word": "The Lord declares, \"Whoso covereth his sins shall not prosper.\" The all-seeing eye is upon each of us. Every secret thought and action are known to God. Darkness and night cannot hide them. If this thought does not lead you to arouse, and be watchful and faithful stewards, to guard the younger members of the family of God intrusted to you, then I may have to press the matter more decidedly upon you, whether you will hear or whether you will forbear. Whatever position you may take, I must be faithful. Not one of your children is in Christ; not one of them is in the truth; not one of them is in a position to represent our faith. The relation you sustain to your children places you under the most solemn obligation, an obligation which is plainly enjoined in the word of God. Parents may indulge their natural affection at the expense of God's holy commandment; you may allow what God has forbidden, you may neglect what he has enjoined; but you must meet your work in the judgment. You are not only to remonstrate with your children, but you are to command them to keep the way of the Lord. You must wake up, for duty imperfectly understood will be imperfectly performed; and unless you heed the true Counselor, and teach your \n\n\n                            [30] \n\nchildren to walk in the ways of the Lord, when it is too late you will see reason for great sorrow, and realize your fatal mistake.",
