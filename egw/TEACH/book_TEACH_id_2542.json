    "word": "Patient, conscientious teachers are needed to arouse hope and aspiration in the youth, to help them to realize the possibilities lying before them. Teachers are needed who will train their students to do service for the Master; who will carry them forward from one point to another in intellectual and spiritual attainment. Teachers should strive to realize the greatness of their work. They need enlarged views; for their work, in its importance, ranks with that of the Christian minister. With persevering faith they are to hold to the Infinite One, saying as did Jacob, \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\" Genesis 32:26. \n                                                                           499",
