    "word": "A primary school should be fitted up in Huntsville for the education of colored children. Provision should also be made for those who can be prepared to minister to their own race. For this work wise teachers are needed. And gifts of money are needed. Do not suppose that small offerings will not be appreciated. Larger gifts will also be needed. Self-sacrifice is called for at every step. It is a great work to prepare colored youth to teach their own race.--Letter 304, 1904, pp. 1-3. (To My Brethren Throughout America, Nov. 11, 1904.)",
