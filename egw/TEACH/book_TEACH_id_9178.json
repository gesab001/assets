    "word": "\u201cWithout Me,\u201d Christ says, \u201cye can do nothing.\u201d The worker is not to be left alone. The Spirit of God is given unto him, that he may will \n44\nand do of God's good pleasure, that he may make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. Then, teacher, follow the leadings of the Spirit. As the Spirit of God draws the hearts of the children and youth, you draw with tenderness and love, inviting them, and pleading with them to give their hearts to God.",
