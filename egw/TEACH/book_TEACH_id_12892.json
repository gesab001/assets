    "word": "All parts of God's vineyard are to be worked. There is need of wise men and wise women who will labor unitedly to accomplish the work committed to them. God will use them as His instruments in the conversion of souls. They will reap the harvest of the seed sown by the great Teacher. Let those who go forth into the great harvest field, some to sow and some to reap, ever remember that they are not to take to themselves the glory of the result of their work. God's appointed agencies have been at work before them, preparing the way for the sowing of the seed and the reaping of the harvest. \"I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye are entered into their labors.\" \n\n\n                                   -142-",
