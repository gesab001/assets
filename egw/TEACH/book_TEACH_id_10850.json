    "word": "We do not realize how cunningly Satan is at work to deceive, if possible, the very elect. Now is our time to work with vigilance. Our books and papers are to be brought before the notice of the people; the gospel of present truth is to be given to our cities without delay. We need to arouse to our duties. If we are making the life and teachings of Christ our study, every passing event will furnish a text for an impressive lesson. It was thus the Saviour preached the gospel in the highways and byways; and, as He preached, the little group that listened to His words would swell into a great company.",
