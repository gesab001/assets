    "word": "All who preach the word in verity and truth can afford to be fair in its presentation. We are not to be deceitful in any way, not handling the word of God deceitfully. We are to let the cross of Christ stand in prominence in all our teaching. We are not to hide the gospel, or cover the cross of Christ with ornamental roses, and thus make the preaching of it of no effect. Let no one shun the cross of self-denial.",
