    "word": "If the teachers in our schools would search the Scriptures for the purpose of understanding them for their individual selves, opening their hearts to the precious rays of light God has given in his word, if they would walk in the light God has given, they would be taught of God. They would practise the truth, and would labor in entirely different lines, bringing in less of the theories and sentiments of men who have never had a connection with God. They would honor finite wisdom far less, and would feel a deep soul-hunger for that wisdom which cometh from God.",
