    "word": "Every minister who has ability to be sent forth to work for God's cause in teaching the truth should be sustained. He should be stimulated to earnest and persevering exertion, while he needs to bear in mind that the way of a man is not in himself. Oh, that men of God, His servants chosen to a special work, may never lean to their own understanding! The capacity of men at best is limited. How little, after all, do they comprehend of the operations of the natural heart or the mysteries of providence! A very few steps trusting to self take them beyond their depth.",
