    "word": "This is a good school for children if you make it so; but if you do not make it so, why then it is worse than if they had not been here. We want to be in a position where we will honor and glorify God every day. Why are we here? What have we this institution for? To bring relief to the sick. This is according to our mission and just the work which should be carried on and the Lord wants every one of us to be in working order. And if we will come under discipline to God we will be as happy a people as you will wish to see. Why? We see the devil working on one side, and that is his side, and he can bring the most entrancing things of heaven that he is acquainted with. He brings these things into his work, but we can have a great deal more knowledge in these things than we possess and we can be the happiest people of any in the world. And right in this institution we can be continually at work on the right side. And do not let us look on the dark side. If you have children, here is a good place for you to learn how to bring them up and how to teach them and how to guide them. You can do this right here. But that is not enough. There are other places and other towns. We have seen these places being worked and we have felt thankful for it and we expect there is a work being done more or less, all around. What you want every one of you and every one of us is to keep the Saviour in view. Jesus told His disciples just before He left them, not to mourn about it, but he said \"Let not your hearts be troubled; ye believe in God believe also in me. (895) In my Father's house are many \n\n\n                                 -540- \n\nmansions; if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also.\"",
