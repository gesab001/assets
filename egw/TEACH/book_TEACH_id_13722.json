    "word": "God, the living God, souls are perishing, and Satan is working to call the attention of the people to nothingness and folly. Wilt Thou not go with this people as they leave this meeting, and teach them daily to lay hold of the merits of the precious Redeemer? Thou hast given so much for these souls; help them to make a covenant with Thee by sacrifice, that they may have a part in that life that measures with \n\n\n              -321- \n\nthe life of God.

There is a heaven for them to win, a hell for them to shun. Grant that they may be crowned in the kingdom of glory, never again to go out into a sin-cursed world, where all is renewed by Thy sacrifice, our blessed Redeemer.",
