    "word": "Every Child to Have Individuality.--A child may be so disciplined as to have, like the beast, no will of its own, his individuality being lost in that of his teacher. ... As far as possible every child should be trained to self-reliance. By calling into exercise the various faculties, he will learn where he is strongest and in what he is deficient. A wise instructor will give special attention to the development of the weaker traits, that the child may form a well-balanced, harmonious character.--RH, Jan 10, 1882. (FE 57.)",
