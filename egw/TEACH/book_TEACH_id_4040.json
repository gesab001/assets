    "word": "There are deep mysteries in the word of God, which will never be discovered by minds that are unaided by the Spirit of God. There are also unsearchable mysteries in the plan of redemption, which finite minds can never comprehend. Inexperienced youth might better tax their minds and exercise their ability to gain an understanding of matters that are revealed; for unless they possess more spiritual enlightenment than they now have, it would take a lifetime to learn the revealed will of God. When they have cherished the light they already have, and made a practical use of it, they will be able to take a step forward. God's providence is a continual school, in which he is ever \n136\nleading men to see the true aims of life. None are too young, and none too old, to learn in this school, by paying diligent heed to the lessons taught by the Divine Teacher. He is the True Shepherd, and he calls his sheep by name. By the wanderers his voice is heard, saying, \u201cThis is the way, walk ye in it.\u201d [Isaiah 30:21.]",
