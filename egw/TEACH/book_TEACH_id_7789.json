    "word": "NOTE 2. PAGE 225.--THAT A WRONG USE IS OFTEN MADE OF THE TEXT (MATTHEW 24:36), IS EVIDENT FROM THE CONTEXT. ONE QUESTION OF THE DISCIPLES WAS CONCERNING THE SIGN OF CHRIST'S COMING AND OF THE END OF THE WORLD. THIS QUESTION JESUS ANSWERED. IN VERSE 29 HE GAVE SIGNS, AND SAID, \"WHEN YE SHALL SEE ALL THESE THINGS, KNOW THAT IT IS NEAR, EVEN AT THE DOORS.\" VERSE 33. ONE SAYING OF THE SAVIOUR MUST NOT BE MADE TO DESTROY ANOTHER. THOUGH NO MAN KNOWETH THE DAY NOR THE HOUR, WE ARE INSTRUCTED AND REQUIRED (FOR IT IS IN THE IMPERATIVE) TO KNOW WHEN IT IS NEAR, EVEN AT THE DOORS. AND WE ARE FURTHER TAUGHT THAT IT WILL BE AS FATAL TO US TO DISREGARD HIS WARNING, AND REFUSE OR NEGLECT TO KNOW, AS IT WAS FOR THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE DAYS OF NOAH NOT TO KNOW WHEN THE FLOOD WAS COMING. VERSES 37-39. AND VERSES 44-51 SHOW IN WHAT LIGHT CHRIST, WHEN HE COMES, WILL REGARD AND \n                                                                           497\nREWARD THOSE WHOM HE FINDS WATCHING AND TEACHING HIS COMING, AND THOSE DENYING IT. \"BLESSED ARE THOSE SERVANTS, WHOM THE LORD WHEN HE COMETH SHALL FIND WATCHING.\" LUKE 12:37.",
