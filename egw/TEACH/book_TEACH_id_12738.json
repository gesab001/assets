Waggoner\n\n\n                                                   \"Elmshaven\" \n                                                   Sanitarium, California \n                                                   July 7, 1902 \n\n\n     Dear Brother Waggoner: To every man is given his work. No one mind can give a complete presentation of truth. The Lord has many servants whom He is leading and teaching, giving them wisdom and knowledge. Those who would be successful teachers of the gospel must be learners with those whom they teach.",
