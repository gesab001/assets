    "word": "It is an extremely delicate thing to tell people of their faults. The reprover is likely to find in those reproved, pride and stubbornness to assert themselves, and the will is arrayed in defiance and opposition. But for all this, advice should be given, and faults should be laid bare. Let the young cultivate a teachable spirit that they may be benefitted by the efforts of those who seek to help them. You may feel that you are doing your best, and that you have been reproved for very trifling matters, and you may be impatient that any one should feel that it is his duty to reprove you for such small matters; but this is the injunction given by the Apostle: \"Obey them that have rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they watch for our souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for this is unprofitable for you.\" These specific directions would not have been given, unless there were those who needed reproof and counsel.",
