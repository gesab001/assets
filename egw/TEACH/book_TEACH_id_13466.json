    "word": "This the Word of God explicitly teaches, but the Lord cannot work in us to will and to do of His good pleasure unless we crucify self, with the affections and lusts, at every step. If we try to work in our own way, we shall grievously fail. We need more of Christ and less of self. We need the work of the Spirit of God upon our hearts constantly transforming our characters, our ways, our manners.",
