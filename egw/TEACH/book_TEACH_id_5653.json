Many accept mere theories and speculations as scientific facts, and they think that God's Word is to be tested by the teachings of \"science falsely so called\" (1 Timothy 6:20). The Creator and His works are beyond their comprehension; and because they cannot explain these by natural laws, Bible history is regarded as unreliable. Those who doubt the reliability of the records of the Old and New Testaments too often go a step further and doubt the existence of God and attribute infinite power to nature. Having let go their anchor, they are left to beat about upon the rocks of infidelity.--GC 522 (1911).",
