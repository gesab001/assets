    "word": "We were pleasantly surprised to find the table very much the same as at our Sanitarium at Battle Creek. The dishes were simple and healthful, and prepared with a skill and nicety that made them inviting and palatable. There is great need of a more general knowledge of the science of healthful cookery. There is a wide field of usefulness open to intelligent, experienced cooks in teaching young ladies how to prepare plain, simple food in a palatable and healthful manner.",
