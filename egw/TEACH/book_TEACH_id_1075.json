    "word": "WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT!\n \n     In reviewing our past history, having traveled over every step of advance to our present standing, I can say, Praise God!

We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our past history.",
