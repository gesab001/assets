    "word": "Ministers to Direct Parishioners to God.--God alone is to be the guide of man's conscience. The truth is to be preached wherever an opening is found for it. The Word of God is to be explained to those who know not the truth. This is the work of God's ministers. They are not to teach men to look to them, or to seek to control the consciences of others. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways\" (James 1:5-8).--Lt 26, 1907.",
