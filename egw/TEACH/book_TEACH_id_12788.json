    "word": "In the night season I seemed to be urging our brethren and sisters to be sure and thorough in their presentation of the Lord. Errors will come into our ranks, that will be presented by some of the church members with much force and apparent truth. Leave not the people in uncertainty, but in kindness and in love for their souls present the truth as it is in Jesus. I \n\n\n                                  -48- \n\nwould urge upon our ministers the need of keeping their own souls warm with love for the lessons of the Word. Our teaching should be filled with expressions of the love of Christ. We are to communicate light and knowledge to our people. If we would do a growing work, we must be reconverted daily. All must act their part. Let parents fill their minds with Scriptural evidence regarding the truths they profess, and in the spirit of love teach the truths of the Word in their families.",
