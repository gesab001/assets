    "word": "The truths of the Word are sacred. Teach the seeker after truth the words of the Infinite One: \"A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.\" As the mind is awakened to yield to the teachings of Christ, Satan will seek in every possible way to bring him under the influence of men who have departed from the faith. Let every soul be wide-awake. The watchmen are not only to give warning to others, but they are to keep ever before them the truths of the Word. Not a word of discouragement is ever to fall from their lips.",
