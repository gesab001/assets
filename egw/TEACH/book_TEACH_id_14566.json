    "word": "Our young men need above all else, to be thoroughly instructed that they may teach the way of the Lord to perishing souls. \"The words that I speak unto you,\" says Christ, \"they are spirit, and they are life.\" Study the word. The strictest fidelity is to be cherished. The love of the truth, and a genuine desire for improvement in the understanding of the Word, will make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the service of God. As you learn, you should seek for opportunities to explain the truth to others.",
