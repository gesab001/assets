    "word": "In the words of the Saviour, \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,\" the work of the followers of Christ in every age was outlined. There is a promise for us in His assurance, \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\" Brethren, shall we not take up our work, not seeking to carry burdens which the Lord has not committed to us, but doing that to which we are called, with a spirit of thoroughness, earnestness, and willingness? If we do our work faithfully, the Lord will complete His part of the contract, fulfilling the promise of His presence, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Let us not allow our faith to waver, but putting our dependence in God, let us teach all things whatsoever He has commanded. Day by day we need to receive divine instruction. (427) I pray that every laborer may ask, and believe, and receive, the promise, \"Lo, I am with you alway.\"",
