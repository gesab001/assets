    "word": "There is another kind of education that is very different. Its fundamental principle, as stated by the greatest Teacher the world has ever known, is, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness\" (Matthew 6:33). Its aim is not selfish; its purpose is to honor God. . . . God is the source of all wisdom. He is infinitely wise and just and good. Apart from Christ, the wisest men that ever lived cannot comprehend Him. They may profess to be wise; they may glory in their attainments; but mere intellectual knowledge, aside from the great truths that center in Christ, is as nothingness. . . .",
