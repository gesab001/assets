    "word": "Let the teachers learn daily lessons in the school of Christ. \"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me,\" He says; \"for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Matthew 11:29. There is altogether too little of Christ and too much of self. But those who are under the dictation of the Spirit of God, under the rule of Christ, will be ensamples to the flock. When the Chief Shepherd shall appear, these will receive the crown of life that fadeth not away.",
