    "word": "How important that fathers and mothers should give their children, from their very babyhood, the right instruction. They are to teach them to obey the command, \"Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" And the children as they grow in years, are to appreciate the care that their parents have given them, and should find their greatest pleasure in helping father and mother.",
