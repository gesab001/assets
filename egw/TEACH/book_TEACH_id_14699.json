    "word": "The Establishment of Schools\n\n     No line of work will be of more telling advantage to the colored people in the\n68\nSouthern field than the establishment of small schools. Hundreds of mission schools must be established; for there is no method of giving the truth to these people so effectual and economical as these small schools. This line of work has been specially presented before me. But the work is almost at a standstill for the lack of money to provide facilities for the training of teachers, and for the building of schoolhouses, and for paying the wages of the teachers.",
