    "word": "Sometimes teachers are burdened, and do not know what to do, because students are inclined to act wild, frivolous, and headstrong. But if you older students will help to influence these younger ones, there will be seen a difference in their behavior. If they are wild, try to help them out of their wildness. Do not scold them, do not become provoked at them, but try to help them into the right road, and the blessing of God will rest upon you.",
