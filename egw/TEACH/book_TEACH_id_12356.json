    "word": "There are many who claim to believe the truth for this time, but who act contrary to the teachings of truth because they are not converted. These are not to be encouraged to act a part in our sanitariums; this sacred work is not to be trusted to men and women who are not soundly converted. We are, I fear, becoming lax on this point. There will be more sanitariums established if they are established along the lines of true education. This means that we shall not reject the instruction of the Lord and turn to the teachings of the wise men of the world in order to gain the so-called higher education. It is not in the order of the Lord that our students shall attach themselves to worldly educational institutions and be trained according to worldly methods.",
