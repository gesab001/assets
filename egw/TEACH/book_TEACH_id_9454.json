    "word": "Students Going to America\n     It is safer to educate students at home than to send them to America to receive an education; for in America they see and hear much that does them no good, which they would not see and hear were they to remain in their own country. Too many of the methods and habits and fashions have been transported from America to Africa, and the result is not favourable. The very best teachers should be sent from America to foreign countries to educate the young. \u2014 Letter 188, 1899.",
