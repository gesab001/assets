    "word": "What a God is our God! He rules over His kingdom with diligence and care, and He has built a hedge--the ten commandments--about His subjects, to preserve them from transgression. In requiring obedience to the laws of His kingdom, God gives His people health and happiness, peace and joy. He teaches them that the perfection of character He requires can be attained only by becoming familiar with His Word. The psalmist declares, \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple\" [Psalm 119:130].",
