Emphasize your belief in the great truths upon which Christian people generally will agree with you. As you advocate the truth of God, you are in every respect to be an example to the believers. \"Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.\" Try to follow closely the Lord's plans. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\"",
