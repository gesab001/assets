    "word": "I remember one woman who said, O, if the Lord would only show her in a dream that He would have mercy upon her and save her! Well, He did teach her, and she was taught in a dream, and then the first impression was, \"Is that dream any stronger than a 'Thus saith the Lord!?\" I want every one of you to take that, because I have found out that whenever I have been pleading for some special light, some strong evidence, I have found I had to wait a long time before I got it. I have found out that I had to take what the Lord said, and believe it as spoken to me. I am one of the daughters of Adam, one for whom Christ died, and have a right to lay hold upon the merits of the blood of a crucified and risen Saviour, because I am a sinner. \n\n\n                                      -108-",
