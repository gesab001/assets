    "word": "The love of God ever tends to the fear of God--fear to offend Him. Those who are truly converted will not venture heedlessly upon the borders of any evil, lest they grieve the Spirit of God and are left to their own way, to be filled with their own doings. The Word of God is the Guidebook; turn not from its pages to depend upon the human agent. That Book contains the warnings, the admonitions, from God, the rebuke of every evil, the clear definition of sin as the transgression of the law which is God's great standard of virtue and holiness. . . . Not one who will study the Word of God and apply its teachings will miss the way.--Letter 4, Dec. 23, 1893, to \"Dear Brethren and Sisters.\"",
