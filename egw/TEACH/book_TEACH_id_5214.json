    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     Laziness and indolence are not the fruit borne upon the Christian tree. No soul can practise prevarication or dishonesty in handling the Lord's goods, and stand guiltless before God. All who do this are in action denying Christ. While they profess to keep the commandments of God, and claim to teach them, they fail to maintain the principles of God's law.",
