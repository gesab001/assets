    "word": "The pope claims authority over the practice of many who do not recognize Christ as our only authority. He places himself in the position of God, and the weak and uninformed are kept from the knowledge that would reveal to them their privileges as children of God. We are to have no kings, no rulers, no popes among us. It is time for us diligently to heed the messages that have brought us out from the world.--Letter 212, 1903, p. 8. (To the teachers at Emmanuel Missionary College, September 23, 1903.)",
