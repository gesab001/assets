    "word": "In choosing man's food in Eden, the Lord showed what was the best diet; in the choice made for Israel He taught the same lesson. He brought the Israelites out of Egypt, and undertook their training, that they might be a people for His own possession. Through them He desired to bless and teach the world. He provided them with the food best adapted for this purpose, not flesh, but manna, \"the bread of heaven.\" It was only because of their discontent and their murmuring for the flesh-pots of Egypt that animal food was granted them, and this only for a short time. Its use brought disease and death to thousands.",
