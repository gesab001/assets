    "word": "Those not fulfilling their responsibility should be visited.--Let ministers and responsible men impress the individual members of the church that in\n155\norder to grow in spirituality they must take the burden of the work which the Lord has laid upon them--the burden of leading souls into the truth. Let them teach the people that they should have a strong desire to see those not in the faith converted to the truth. Let those who have opportunity do their God-given work. Those who are not fulfilling their responsibility should be visited, prayed with, and labored for, that they may become faithful stewards of the grace of Christ. Do not lead the people to depend upon you as ministers, but teach every one who shall embrace the truth that he has a work to do in using the talents God has given him to save the souls of those who are nigh him. In thus working, the people will have the cooperation of the angels of God. They will obtain a valuable experience which will increase their faith and give them a strong hold of God.--Ms 21a, 1894 (1NL 127, 128).",
