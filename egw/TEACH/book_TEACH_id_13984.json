    "word": "God is the ruler of his people; and he will teach those who give their minds to him, how to use their brains. As they employ their executive ability, they will grow in efficiency. The Lord's heritage is made up of vessels large and small, but each one has his individual work. The mind of one man, or the minds of two or three men, are not to be depended on as certain to be safe for all to follow. Let all look to God, trust in him, and believe fully in his power. Yoke up with Christ, and not with men; for men have no power to keep you from falling.",
