    "word": "The typical offerings pointed to Christ, and when the perfect sacrifice was made the sacrificial offerings were no longer acceptable to God. Type met antitype in the death of the only begotten Son of God. He came to make plain the immutable character \n\n\n                                     -197- \n\nof the law, to declare that disobedience and transgression could never be rewarded by God with eternal life. He came as a man to humanity, that humanity might touch humanity. But in no case did He come to lessen the obligations of men to be perfectly obedient. He did not destroy the validity of the Old Testament Scriptures. He fulfilled that which was predicted by God Himself. He did not come to set men free from the law; He came to open a way by which they might obey that law, and teach others to do the same.--Ms 14, 1897. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G.
