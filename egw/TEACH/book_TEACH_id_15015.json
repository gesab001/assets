    "word": "Teachers, take hold of the school work with diligence and patience. Realize that your's is not a common work. You are laboring for time and for eternity, molding the minds of the students for entrance into the higher school, the school above. Every right principle, every truth, learned in an earthly school will advance us just as much in the heavenly school. As Christ walked and talked with His disciples during His ministry on this earth, so He will teach us in the school above, leading us by the side of the river of living waters, and revealing to us the truths that in this life must remain hidden mysteries because of the limitations of the human mind, so marred by sin. In the heavenly school we shall have opportunity to attain, step by step, to the greatest heights of learning. There, as children of the heavenly King, we shall ever dwell with the members of the royal family; there we shall see the King in his Beauty, and behold his matchless charms.",
