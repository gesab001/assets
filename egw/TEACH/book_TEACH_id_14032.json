    "word": "These things are not trifles unworthy of our consideration. I wish to state especially that very much more can be done to save and educate the children of those who at present cannot get away from the cities. Church schools are to be established in these cities and in connection with these schools provision is to be made for the teaching of higher studies, where \n\n\n                                   - 12 - \n\nthese are called for. These schools can be managed in such a way, part joining part, and they will be a complete whole. The Lord has His methods, His plans and His wisdom.",
