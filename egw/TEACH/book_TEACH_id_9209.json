    "word": "How sad it is to think of the great amount of mechanical work that is done in the Sabbath-school, while there is little evidence that there is moral transformation in the souls of those who teach and who are taught! When the work of the Spirit of God is felt upon the heart, we shall see many earnestly seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. Then earthly things will find their proper, subordinate position, and heavenly things will be supreme in the affections of the children of God.\u2014S.S.W., August, 1892.",
