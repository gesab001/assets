    "word": "1, 2 (ch. 1:20; Psalm 19:1-4). God's Works Are His Teachers. --[Romans 12:1, 2 quoted.] What does God accomplish, and what does He demand of us individually in the work of saving ourselves? God works in us by the light of His truth, which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world. The Scriptures refer to the works of God as they are revealed in our world, as so many teachers whose voices have gone out through the whole earth, proclaiming the attributes of God. The mind must see the truth, and the will bend to its claims, when it is presented to us based upon scriptural evidence (MS 49, 1898).",
