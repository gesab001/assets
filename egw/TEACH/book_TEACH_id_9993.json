    "word": "Some souls who claim to be believers have slighted, and turned from, the Word of God. They have neglected the Bible, the wonderful Guidebook, the true Tester of all ideas, and claim that they have the Spirit to teach them, that this renders searching the Scriptures unnecessary. All such are heeding the sophistry of Satan, for the Spirit and the Word agree, say the Scriptures, \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them\" (Isaiah 8:20). He only is a free man whom the truth makes free. . . .",
