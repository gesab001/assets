    "word": "I begin to feel burden to bear my testimony in the East. In dreams I am before the people there, talking with great power and my testimony affecting hearts. What my future is I cannot tell. I wait and watch and pray and the Lord will teach. He will lead and guide me. I want to walk in all humility of mind and walk in His love and in His fear, laboring for souls as they [who] must give an account. My heart cries out daily for the living God. I want my heart stayed upon God continually.",
