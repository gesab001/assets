    "word": "In His work as a public teacher, Christ never lost sight of the children. When wearied with the bustle and confusion of the crowded city, tired of contact with crafty and hypocritical men, His spirit found rest and peace in the society of innocent little children.

His large heart of love could comprehend their trials and necessities, and find happiness in their simple joys; and He took them in His arms and blessed them. \n                                                                           180",
