    "word": "In the plan of redemption there are mysteries that the human mind cannot fathom,--things which human wisdom cannot explain, --but nature can teach us much concerning the mystery of godliness. Then let the minds of the young, as far as possible, learn from nature's book. Every shrub, every tree bearing fruit, all vegetation, is given for our benefit. The mysteries of the kingdom of God are to be read in the growth of the seed. . . . God designed that nature should be to man a lesson-book to guide him from the path of disobedience back to God. There is need of a close study of nature under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Lord is giving object-lessons, He is making holy truths familiar to the human mind, through the most simple things of nature.",
