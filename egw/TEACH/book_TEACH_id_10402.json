    "word": "Christ said to His disciples, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" (John 16:12). This is our condition. Would they not have been able to understand what He had to say to them, if they had been doers of His word--if they had improved point after point of the truth which He had presented to them? But although they could not then understand, He told them that He would send the Comforter, who would lead them into all truth. We should be in a position where we can comprehend the teaching, leading, and working of the Spirit of Christ. We must not measure God or His truth by our finite understanding, or by our preconceived opinions.",
