    "word": "Parents to Cooperate With Teachers.--A neglected field represents the neglected mind. Parents must come to view this master in a different light. They must feel it their duty to cooperate with the teacher, to encourage wise discipline, and to pray much for the one who is teaching their children. You will not help the children by fretting, censuring, or discouraging them; neither will you act a part to help them to rebel and to be disobedient and unkind and unlovable because of the spirit you develop.--MS 34, 1893.",
