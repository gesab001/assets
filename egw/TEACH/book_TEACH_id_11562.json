    "word": "I was shown that those who have been united with the Office for years, have received correct ideas in regard to how God would have things managed; it should not be according to a worldly policy. There should be no selfishness exhibited there. All engaged in the work should have a special care for the widow and fatherless, and labor unselfishly for their good, even disadvantaging themselves to advantage the needy and oppressed. Bro. White set the example the Lord had shown that all his people should imitate, in being interested in the cases of others, helping those who need help, without any profit to self, to love his \n                                                                           30\nneighbor as himself. Brn. Smith and Amadon have seen the course he has pursued. They have the same experience and views with himself. They have heard the commendation God has given of those who pursued this course, and the curse which God has pronounced upon those who are too much swallowed up in their own interests to have a care for their neighbors as themselves. Brn. Smith and Amadon have had a long experience in connection with the Office. The Lord has given much light in regard to the course his people should pursue in order to glorify him. They have witnessed the special work of God, and have received his teachings, showing our duty to those around us. They have been so long united with the cause of God that it has become, as it were, a part of them. They know no other interest, and to separate them from the work, would be like parting with their life. The voice of these brethren should be heard. Their judgment is nearer in accordance with the will of God than that of Bro. Aldrich. He has much to learn before God can entrust him with all that responsibility that his brethren have given him in the things mentioned.",
