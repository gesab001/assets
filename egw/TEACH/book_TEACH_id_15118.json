    "word": "Let parents unite in providing a place for the daily instruction of their children, choosing as teacher one who is apt to teach, and who as a consecrated servant of Christ will increase in knowledge while imparting instruction. The teacher who has consecrated self to the service of God will be able to do a definite work in missionary service, and will instruct the children in the same lines. Let fathers and mothers co-operate with the teacher, laboring earnestly for the salvation of their children. If parents will realize the importance of these small educating centers, co-operating to do the work that the Lord desires to be done at this time, the plans of the enemy for our children will be frustrated. \n\n\n                                 (Signed) Ellen G.
