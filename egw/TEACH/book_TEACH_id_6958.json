    "word": "13, 14 (chs. 15:9; 22:29). Humble Men Are Salt of Earth.--In His teachings, Christ likened His disciples to objects most familiar to them. He compared them to salt and to light. \"Ye are the salt of the earth,\" He said; \"ye are the light of the world.\" These words were spoken to a few poor, humble fishermen. Priests and rabbis were in that congregation of hearers, but these were not the ones addressed. With all their learning, with all their supposed instruction in the mysteries of the law, with all their claims of knowing God, they revealed that they knew Him not. To these leading men had been committed the oracles of God, but Christ declared them to be unsafe teachers. He said to them, Ye teach for doctrine the commandments of men. \"Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.\" Turning from these men to the humble fishermen, He said, \"Ye are the salt of the earth\" (RH Aug. 22, 1899).",
