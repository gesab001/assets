    "word": "Now let not anyone place himself as having great wisdom and ability. But if he have these talents he will not be the one to make them the most prominent, for it is those who have the most distrust of self, who have no special confidence in their own ability, whom God will use as His willing instruments. These will show by their conversation that they have been communing with God, and that they have been receiving of the lessons Christ has taught to all, who would teach them meekness and lowliness of heart. But with most exalted views of Jesus, filled with His love, the words of wisdom will flow forth from the soul in words that will stir their hearts. His works are made manifest, not by pompous words of self-praise, but in the very \n\n\n                                   -2- \n\nopposite, in meekness of wisdom. These have no words to demerit others, but a very humble opinion of themselves; because they have had a more clear and well-defined view of Jesus, of His holy character, His self-denial, His self-sacrifice, and His holy mission.",
