    "word": "Our workers should exercise their ingenuity in the preparation of healthful foods. None are to pry into Dr. Kellogg's secrets.

There are many products which, if properly prepared and combined, can be made into foods that will be a blessing to those who cannot afford to purchase the more expensive health foods. He who in the building of the tabernacle gave skill and understanding in all manner of cunning work, will now give skill and understanding in the combining of natural food products, thus showing His people how to secure a wholesome, healthful diet. The work of combining fruits, grains, and roots into wholesome foods, is the Lord's work.",
