    "word": "God's Teaching Agents in the Home School.--Parents should in a special sense regard themselves as agents of God to instruct their children, as did Abraham, to keep the way of the Lord. They need to search the Scriptures diligently, to know what is the way of the Lord, that they may teach it to their household. Micah says, \"What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" [Micah 6:8.] In order to be teachers, parents must be learners, gathering light constantly from the oracles of God and by precept and example bringing this precious light into the education of their children.",
