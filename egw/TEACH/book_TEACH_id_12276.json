    "word": "A work that has been strangely neglected must be done. We must bear witness of the light. Who can do this, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, in language pure, refined, simple, and clear as the running stream. Much cloud and darkness crowds upon us. Yield yourself, your individual self, to God, that you may be purified, cleansed, and sanctified, and you will be enabled to flash light amid the darkness of a sin-loving world. Study the word which is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. When you desire wisdom, go to the light of the world. Do not turn to any living soul; men are but erring mortals: in their human wisdom they may encourage where they should discourage, and discourage where they should encourage.--Letter 55, 1897, pp. 10-12. (\"To My Brethren and Sisters Who Shall Assemble in General Conference,\" January 10, 1897.)",
