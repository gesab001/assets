    "word": "Teach the great practical truths that must be stamped upon the soul. Teach the saving power of Jesus, \"In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of our sins.\"  It was at the cross that mercy and truth met together, that righteousness and peace kissed each other. Let every student and every worker study this again and again, that they, \"setting forth the Lord crucified among us,\" may make it a fresh subject to the people. Show that the life of Christ reveals a perfect character. Teach that, \"as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\"  Tell it over and over again. We may become the sons of God, members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. Let it be known that all who accept Jesus Christ and hold the beginning of their confidence firm to the end, will be heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ \"to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.\"",
