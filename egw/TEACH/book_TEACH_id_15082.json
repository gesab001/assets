    "word": "Brethren, there is one thing you can do. You can see that you yourselves are in a condition of repentance. You hearts need to be converted. The end is near; the time is short. Plead with God, clear the King's highway, and lift up the trailing standard on which is inscribed, \"The commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\" As you advance, step by step, proclaim, \"Here are they \n\n\n                                     -385- \n\nthat keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\" Moses declared, \"Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commands me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people . . . Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy sons and thy sons' sons.\" \n                                       (Signed) Ellen G. White.",
