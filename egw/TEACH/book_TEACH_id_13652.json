    "word": "Here is a promise in keeping the commandments of God and teaching them to our children. What does that mean? Everyone who obeys the commandments of God from the heart, everyone who follows in the path of obedience, God makes the promise unto them. The heavenly intelligences are ready to cooperate with them. \"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?\" The Lord has declared, \"That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.\" If not, how can God let His blessing and protecting care and guardianship be over you?",
