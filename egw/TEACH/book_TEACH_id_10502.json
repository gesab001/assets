    "word": "Let those who speak and write concerning the third angel's message, consider the fact that the Prince of Peace did not bring a railing accusation against the enemy, and let them learn the lesson they ought to have learned much earlier in their experience. They should wear Christ's yoke, they should practice the humility of Christ. The great Teacher says, \"Learn of me, [I am not boastful, I hide my glory,] for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" In learning of me, \"ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Let such work be done by our missionaries as will lead to that repentance that needs not to be repented of. We need to learn much more of the meekness of Christ in order to be a savor of life unto life. \n\n\n                          - 56 -",
