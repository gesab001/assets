    "word": "Has God given these light? Has He given them knowledge? Go yourself to the same source from whence they received that light. In God is strength, and power, and all blessing. We must carry the minds of all away from poor, defective self, and present Jesus as the fountain of all grace and all wisdom. We must teach young and old to search the Scriptures and obtain an experience for themselves, that they may be rooted and grounded in the truth. They are not to copy any man's peculiarities of speech, or of spirit, or his ways and manners of working, but are to be their own simple selves, looking to God to put His divine impress upon the character. We are pained to see the defects existing in men entrusted with weighty responsibilities being copied as virtues by those who look up to them. This makes us afraid. We say, Go to God for your own selves, and obtain His mold upon you.",
