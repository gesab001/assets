    "word": "Those who are joined to Christ, the Living Vine, will bear the very same kind of fruit as does the parent stock. Christ was the pattern minister. He was the greatest teacher the world ever knew. He gave to his followers, for them to repeat to us, lessons of the utmost importance concerning the salvation of the soul. It is by believing and receiving him that we secure our own salvation, and when we believe on him, we cannot keep it to ourselves; we shall tell others what Christ has done for us.",
