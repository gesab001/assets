    "word": "F. of F.--Vol. 2, pp. 121-122 \n     When the Lord brought His people from Egyptian bondage, He led them through the wilderness to prove them, and try them. He promised to be their God, and to take them to Himself as His peculiar treasure. He did not prohibit their eating meat, but withheld it from them in a great measure. He gave them food which He designed that they should have, which was healthy, and of which they could eat freely. He rained their bread from Heaven, and gave them purest water out of the flinty rock. He made a covenant with them, that if they would obey Him in all things, He would put no disease upon them. But the Israelites were not satisfied with the food which God gave them. They murmured against Moses and against God, and wished themselves back in Egypt, where they could sit by the flesh-pots. God in His anger gave them flesh to gratify their lustful appetite, and great numbers of them died in the act of eating the meat for which they had lusted. While it was yet between their teeth the curse of God came upon them. God here teaches His people that He is displeased with their permitting their appetite to control them. The Israelites at times would prefer slavery, and even death, rather than to be deprived of meat.",
