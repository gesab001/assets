    "word": "Wherever the work of selling\"Christ's Object Lessons\" has been taken hold of in earnest, the book has had a good circulation. And the lessons that have been learned by those who have engaged in this work have well repaid their efforts. Our people should all be encouraged to take a part in this missionary effort. Light has been given me that in every possible way instruction should be given to our people in the best methods of presenting this book to the people. We have been instructed that at our large gatherings, workers should be present who will teach our people how to sow the seeds of truth. This means more (459) than instruction how to sell the Signs of the Times and other periodicals. It includes such books as \"Christ's Object Lessons\" and \"Ministry of Healing.\" These are books which contain precious truths, and from which the reader can draw lessons of highest value.",
