Burden, Loma Linda, California \n\nDear Brother Burden: \n     I am at the Pacific Union College, attending a council meeting of the church school teachers. Yesterday, Sabbath, I spoke in the chapel. The room was filled. A larger place will have to be provided in which to hold meetings. I spoke from the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah. I had some very important instruction to give to those present regarding the necessity of our working intelligently, and the Lord gave me strength to speak.",
