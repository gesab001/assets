    "word": "I feel a decided interest in the work at Loma Linda, and I desire that it shall exert a powerful influence for the truth.

When people see that God blesses us, and gives success to our work as we make Him supreme, then they will be led to give consideration to the truths we teach. Many will be compelled to recognize that our methods are superior to those employed in the schools of the world, as they are commonly conducted.",
