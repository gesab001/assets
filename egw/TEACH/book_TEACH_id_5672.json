    "word": "The Importance of the Work of the Pastor-Counselor. --As the physician deals with physical disease, so does the pastor minister to the sin-sick soul. And his work is as much more important than that of the physician as eternal life is more valuable than temporal existence. The pastor meets with an endless variety of temperaments, and it is his duty to become acquainted with the members of the families that listen to his teachings in \n\n764 \n\norder to determine what means will best influence them in the right direction.--GW 388 (1915).",
