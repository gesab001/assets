    "word": "In a few places in the South, noble efforts have been put forth for the salvation of the colored people; but God asks that they be labored for more diligently. We can all pray for them; some of our missionaries can work among them; and many of us who have not done so in the past, can help with our means. We may not be able to do all that we desire; but if we will remember that the colored race is the purchased possession of Christ, bought by the shedding of His precious blood, this thought will teach us to deny self in order that they may have the privileges that Christ died to give them.",
