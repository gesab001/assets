    "word": "Those who have crowded into Battle Creek, and are being held there, see and hear many things that tend to weaken their faith, and engender unbelief. They would gain a more practical knowledge in an effort to impart to others that which they receive of the word of God. They should scatter out, and be working in all our cities, under the training of men who are sound in the faith. If those who teach these workers are true and loyal, a great work will be accomplished.",
