    "word": "\"They (children) have felt no compunctions of conscience in going about the streets on the Sabbath for their own amusement. Many go where they please, and do what they please, and their parents are so fearful of displeasing them that, imitating the management of Eli, they lay no commands upon them. These youth finally lose all respect for the Sabbath, and have no relish for religious meetings or for sacred and eternal things. . . . Most of the backsliding from God in that place has come in consequence of parents neglecting to train their children to a conscientious religious life. The condition of these children is lamentable. They profess to be Christians, but their parents have not taken upon themselves the burden of teaching them how to be Christians.\"--Test. 31, pp. 25-38.",
