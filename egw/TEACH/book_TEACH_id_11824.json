    "word": "And with clearness and power did Christ set forth the attributes of God. He is \"the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person,\" even \"the image of the invisible God.\" Yet He humbled Himself, taking the form of a servant.

And what we know of God through Him is the measure of our acquaintance with a practical knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.--Ms 43, 1897, p. 2. (\"Ministry,\" no date.)",
