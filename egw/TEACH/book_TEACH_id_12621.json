    "word": "MR No. 836 - True Dignity for a Teacher\n\n     I told Brother Bell he must do his work, which was to teach. That he must not stand to pick up every little flaw and mark every misdemeanor, but he could do much by talking kindly to the school, laying down the principles of action. He must maintain his position as a dignified teacher--not that dignity that will not heed the counsels of others, but that kindness, that courtesy that will win his way into the hearts of his students.",
