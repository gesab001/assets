    "word": "Long ago the teachers and students in our schools should have learned to take advantage of the opportunity to raise means by the sale of Christ's Object Lessons. In selling these books the students will serve the cause of God, and, while doing this, by the dissemination of precious light, they will learn invaluable lessons in Christian experience. All our schools should now come into line and earnestly endeavor to carry out the plan presented to us for the education of workers, for the relief of the schools, and for the winning of souls to the cause of Christ.",
