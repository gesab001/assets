    "word": "Christianity the Solace of the Poor.--There is a connection between the religion of Christ and poverty. Christianity is the solace of the poor. There is a false religion, endangering the souls of all who advance it, that teaches that selfish pleasure and enjoyment is the sum of happiness.

There came a time when the rich man would have given all he possessed to have exchanged places with Lazarus, once poor, and covered with sores.",
