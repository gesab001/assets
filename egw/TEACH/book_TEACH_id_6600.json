    "word": "These teachers do not feel the repression they would feel in the presence of older teachers.  Their hearts glow with the love of God.  The students catch the spirit, the windows of the heart are opened heavenward, and songs of gratitude ascend from hearts that burn with the love of God.  As the teachers and students seek to learn their duty, with an unfeigned desire to be conformed to the image of God, they gain power to conquer the stubbornness of a selfish will.",
