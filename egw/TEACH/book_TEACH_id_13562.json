    "word": "It is the privilege of every sinner to ask his teacher what sin really is. Give me a definition of sin. We have one in 1 John 3. \"Sin is the transgression of the law.\" Now this is the only definition of sin in the whole Bible. We are going to read it to you right out of the Book, so that you need not have the idea that it is not in the Bible, that it is another Bible that we preach to you. We will just read it out of the good Book, and we will begin at the beginning of the chapter. \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" That is our privilege.",
