    "word": "On the part of teachers and ministers and students there is altogether too great indifference and slothfulness in searching the Scriptures. They are content to grasp the surface truths. But there is a mine of truth to be worked. We are to dig until we find the veins of rich and precious ore. The earth itself with its golden lodes is not more promising than is the Word, the great garden of revealed truth; but its rich treasure will reward only the humble and contrite ones who search for it. The Holy Spirit will direct the searcher. A vast field, yet undiscovered, is to be worked, that precious truth may be found to enrich the receiver, that he may impart his treasure to others.",
