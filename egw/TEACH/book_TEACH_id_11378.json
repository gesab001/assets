    "word": "Defective Teachers.--The Lord works with every consecrated teacher; and it is for his own interest to realize this. Instructors who are under the discipline of God do not manufacture anything themselves. They receive grace and truth and light through the Holy Spirit to communicate to the children. They are under the greatest Teacher the world has ever known, and how unbecoming it would be for them to have an unkind spirit, a sharp, harsh voice, full of irritation. In this they would perpetuate their own defects in the children. \n\n\n                       -8-",
