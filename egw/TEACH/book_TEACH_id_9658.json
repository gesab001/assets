    "word": "We cannot with safety accept the opinions of any man, however learned, unless they are in harmony with the words of the Great Teacher. The opinions of erring men will be presented for our acceptance, but God's Word is our authority, and we are never to accept human teaching without the most conclusive evidence that it agrees with the teaching of God's Word. We are to know that we do know that we are standing on the platform of eternal truth--the Word of the living God.",
