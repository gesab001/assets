    "word": "Ever remember that there are those who teach for doctrine the commandments of men. They make void the law of God by their traditions, like the Pharisees whom Christ exposed, saying, \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.\" The precious gems of truth are buried beneath a mass of error. By the sophistry of religious teachers the meaning of the plain, clear word of God is hidden. The people are left in perplexity.",
