He drank eagerly at the fountain of wisdom, and then sought to lead others to that \"well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (John 4:14).

Yet even believers were unable to fully comprehend the sacred mysteries of divine truth unfolded in his discourses. He seemed to be constantly imbued with the Holy Spirit.
