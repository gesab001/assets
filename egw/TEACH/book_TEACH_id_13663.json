White at the opening of College Hall, Avondale, Australia, April 13, 1899.] \n\n\n     School work is a work of partnership. Those who have come to this school with an earnest desire to make of themselves all that it is possible, by the help of the Lord, may be assured that One who is mighty in power will link up with them and teach them the way of the Lord. But those who have come here for their own amusement, who do not put their minds to the task of securing a right education, will lose much. They will miss the mark entirely.",
