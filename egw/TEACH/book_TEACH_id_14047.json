    "word": "At times Christ reproached His disciples with the slowness of their comprehension. He placed in their possession truths of which they little suspected the value. He had been with them a long time, giving them lessons in clear lines, but their previous religious education, the erroneous interpretations which they had heard the Jewish teachers place on the Scriptures, kept their minds clouded. Christ promised them that He would send them His Spirit, who would recall His words to their minds as forgotten truths. \"He shall teach you all things,\" Christ said, \"and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\" John 14:26.",
