    "word": "This experience gives every teacher the very qualifications that will make him a representative of Christ Jesus. The methods of Christ's teaching will, if followed, give a force and directness to his communications and to his prayers. His witness for Christ will not be a narrow, tame, lifeless testimony, but will be like ploughing up the field, quickening the conscience, opening the heart, and preparing it for the seeds of truth.",
