    "word": "\"And that ye break every yoke.\" We do not want to be bound any more, no matter who it is, or what it is. There is our God whom we must serve. A God who requires our service. Nothing must come in between that God and our souls, because our souls are of infinite value, and we cannot hang them on the ministers. We cannot trust our salvation to them. We must search the Scriptures for ourselves and know what they teach. We must obey what God says. \"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor which are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\" How can you do this? By not living extravagantly yourself. By not using every dollar that you have to make yourself a place in the earth, but honor the Lord God of heaven by showing that you esteem humanity from God's standpoint. Jesus Christ is our Redeemer, and we are to feel indeed that He has died to purchase humanity, to give us freedom and liberty which can be given only through Him. \n\n\n                                    -40-",
