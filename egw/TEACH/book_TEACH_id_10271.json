    "word": "But Paul did not regard as lost the time thus spent. As he worked with Aquila he kept in touch with the Great Teacher, losing no opportunity of witnessing for the Saviour and of helping those who needed help. His mind was ever reaching out for spiritual knowledge. He gave his fellow workers instruction in spiritual things, and he also set an example of industry and thoroughness. He was a quick, skillful worker, diligent in business, \"fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" As he worked at his trade, the apostle had access to  a class of people that he could not otherwise have reached. . . .",
