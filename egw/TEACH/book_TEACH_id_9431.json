    "word": "PAGE 342. THE PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE: IN 1896, THE YEAR OF THE WRITING OF THE MESSAGE ADDRESSED TO CONFERENCE PRESIDENTS AND COUNSELORS IN WHICH ELLEN WHITE STATED, \"IT IS NOT WISE TO CHOOSE ONE MAN AS PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE,\" THE OFFICERS OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE CONSISTED OF (1) A PRESIDENT, (2) A CORRESPONDING SECRETARY, AND (3) A RECORDING SECRETARY AND TREASURER. IN THIS PARTICULAR YEAR, THE FOREIGN MISSION SECRETARY AND THE EDUCATIONAL SECRETARY WERE ALSO LISTED AS OFFICERS OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE, BUT IN 1901, WE FIND THE OFFICERS LISTED ONLY AS PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, AND TREASURER. THE CONTEXT OF THE STATEMENT MADE BY ELLEN WHITE IN 1896 MAKES IT CLEAR THAT SHE DOES NOT INTEND TO TEACH THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE A PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE, BUT RATHER, AS IS STATED ON PAGE 343, \"COUNSELORS OF THE CHARACTER THAT GOD CHOSE FOR MOSES ARE NEEDED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE.\" AT NO TIME IN THE WRITINGS OF ELLEN WHITE, EITHER PRIOR TO THE YEAR 1901, OR SUBSEQUENTLY, DID SHE INDICATE THAT IN THE DENOMINATIONAL PLAN OF ORGANIZATION THERE SHOULD NOT BE A PRESIDENT CHOSEN BY THE DELEGATES. IN HER WRITINGS, PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED, THERE ARE MANY REFERENCES TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE, TO HIS RESPONSIBILITIES, AND TO THE ATTITUDES WHICH HE SHOULD MANIFEST.",
