    "word": "The commission which Christ gave to the disciples, just prior to his ascension to heaven, was, \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and \n20\nof the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d \u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.\u201d [Matthew 28:19, 20; John 17:20.] The commission reaches those who shall believe on his word through his disciples. And all who are called of God to stand as ambassadors for him, should take the lessons upon practical godliness given them by Christ in his word, and teach them to the people.",
