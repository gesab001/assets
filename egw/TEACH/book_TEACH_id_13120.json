    "word": "The Word of God is to be our teacher. It is the voice of God speaking to our hearts. But the principles that God has given us--principles of strictest integrity--have been discarded. The deceitful heart has been consulted, and the Wonderful, the Counsellor, who alone can keep the soul pure, has been rejected. The transactions of the past years should be presented before those who should know the inward workings. Little by little have the barriers been broken away, showing that the foundation of the structure is built upon the sand. The Bible and the Bible alone must now be laid up in the heart. It must be cherished and regarded as the voice of God, for it alone can make men right and keep them so.",
