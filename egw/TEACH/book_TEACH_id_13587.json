    "word": "In His teaching our Saviour did not encourage any to attend the rabbinical schools of His day, for the reason that their minds would be corrupted with the continually repeated, \"They say,\" or \"It hath been said.\" The Lord can do more with minds that have no connection with schools where infidel authors are perused. These lesson books He reaches out His hand to remove, and in their stead places the Old and New Testament Scriptures. Those who will search the Scriptures for themselves, because it is the Word of God, who are willing to dig for the truth as for hidden treasures, will receive for their prize that wisdom which cometh alone from God. If they will not rely upon their own smartness, and not trust in their own inventions and their supposed fruitful minds, if they will give the working of the mind into the Lord's hands, and yoke up with Jesus Christ, they will not take steps where Jesus does not lead the way.",
