    "word": "Extreme Teaching \n\n     There are grand truths, long hidden under the rubbish of error, that are to be revealed to the people. The doctrine of justification by faith has been lost sight of by many who have professed to believe the third angel's message. The \n                                                                           361\nHoliness people have gone to great extremes on this point. With great zeal they have taught, \"Only believe in Christ, and be saved; but away with the law of God.\" This is not the teaching of the Word of God. There is no foundation for such a faith. This is not the precious gem of truth that God has given to His people for this time. This doctrine misleads honest souls. The light from the Word of God reveals the fact that the law must be proclaimed. Christ must be lifted up, because He is a Saviour who forgiveth transgression, iniquity, and sin, but will by no means clear the guilty and unrepentant soul.--The Review and Herald, Aug. 13, 1889.",
