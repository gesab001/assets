    "word": "Among the wealthy and the poor they find favor and help. They come close in friendship to those for whom they work, the one imparting the treasures of the Word, the other imparting temporal sustenance, and both are blessed. Even the poverty of the workers is a means of finding access to the people. As these humble missionaries pass on their way. they are helped in many ways by those to whom they bring spiritual food.
