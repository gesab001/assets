    "word": "Solomon places the control of one's self above the exploits of the bravest and most successful heroes. There is a moral grandeur in being patient under trials and provocations. \"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city\" (Proverbs 16:32). It requires discipline and firmness of purpose not to give expression to passion but at all times to take care that words shall escape the lips that will dishonor the Christian character. Self-control will be a valuable acquisition \n\n\n                                    -344- \n\nto the graces of the Spirit, and parents should teach their children, by precept and example, this precious lesson of patience and self-control.",
