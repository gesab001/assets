There is much faithful missionary work to be done in the highways and byways of the earth, and all who have any part to act in this work must be truly converted at heart. It is not a tame, scientific religion that we advocate, but a religion that will subdue hearts and sanctify and cleanse and refine the life. It is a religion that possesses living power and the spirit of the great Teacher, Jesus Christ.",
