    "word": "\"Beware of false prophets.\" Matthew 7:15. \n\n\n     Teachers of falsehood will arise to draw you away from the narrow path and the strait gate. Beware of them; though concealed in sheep's clothing, inwardly they are ravening wolves. Jesus gives a test by which false teachers may be distinguished from the true. \"Ye shall know them by their fruits,\" He says. \"Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\"",
