    "word": "If the physical powers are not taxed equally with the mental, too much strain is brought upon the latter. Unless every part of the human machinery performs its allotted tasks, the mental powers cannot be used to their highest capability for any length of time. Natural powers must be governed by natural laws, and the faculties must be educated to work harmoniously and in accord with these laws. The teachers in our schools can disregard none of these particulars without shirking responsibility. Pride may lead them to seek for a high worldly standard of intellectual attainment that students may make a brilliant show; but when it comes to solid acquirements-- those which are essential to fit men and women for any and every emergency in practical life--such students are only partially prepared to make life a success. Their defective education often leads to failure in whatever branch of business they undertake.--5T 522 (1889).",
