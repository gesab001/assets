    "word": "The soul must be infused with the Spirit of the great Teacher if the mind would penetrate into the deep things of God. The truth will enlarge and enrich the mind. Its beauty, its purity, its holiness, its invigorating power will inspire the receiver, and he will not be content to be circumscribed in his work. The yearning soul will cry out after the living God, \"Show me Thy glory.\" There are new forces of power to be gained in searching the mines of truth for precious ore. The mind becomes enlarged and enriched. Let the Spirit of God rest upon the messenger and the whole man will become a living, burning light to present the truth as it is in Jesus.",
