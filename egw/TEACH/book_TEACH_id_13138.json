    "word": "The most essential work now to be done is to consider the words of Christ, \"All ye are brethren.\" Each must stand in his lot and place to do the work appointed him, in perfect harmony with his brethren. All are to seek to strengthen and build up the waste places, to hold aloft the Bible standard, to voice the third angel's message, to live the truth, to exercise mercy and the love of God, and be ready for any work that may be next in the service of God. They are to bear in mind the teachings of Christ upon the Mount of Olives, and mark the attributes which He calls blessed. \"Blessed are the meek,\" He says, \"for they shall inherit the earth.\" \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.\" \"Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.\" Then let us cultivate the precious attribute of mercy, for it will be reflected back to us again.",
