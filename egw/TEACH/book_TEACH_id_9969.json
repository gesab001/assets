    "word": "In the parable of the lost sheep, Christ teaches that salvation does not come through our seeking after God but through God\u2019s seeking after us. \u201cThere is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way\u201d (Romans 3:11, 12). We do not repent in order that God may love us, but He reveals to us His love in order that we may repent. . . .",
