    "word": "If you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, if His love can move your heart, and His glory be dear to you, be faithful to your trust. Unite your influence with that of the heavenly agencies, and devote your God-given energies, your entrusted talents to the work of saving souls. Your talents will increase by winning souls to Christ. Paul may plant, Apollos water; but God giveth the increase. God calls for the co-operation of a devoted church. Their co-operation with Him will prove that they really believe that which they teach. Let the children of God give evidence of their faith by their actions. Every one is pledged before God to do all that is possible to win souls to Christ. God calls for the dedication of soul, body and spirit to the work.",
