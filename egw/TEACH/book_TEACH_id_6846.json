    "word": "GOD SAID, \"WHAT GOD HATH JOINED TOGETHER LET NO MAN PUT ASUNDER\"; AND YET CHRIST EXPLAINS THE LAW OF DIVORCE AS GIVEN BECAUSE OF THE HARDNESS OF THEIR HEARTS. BECAUSE OF THE DEGENERACY OF THE PEOPLE A DIVORCE LAW WHICH WAS NOT IN GOD'S ORIGINAL PLAN WAS PERMITTED. I BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IN REGARD TO SUCH ISOLATED STATEMENTS AS YOUR PROTEST AGAINST THE USE OF BUTTER, AND THE STATEMENT THAT THE CHILD SHOULD HAVE NO OTHER TEACHER THAN THE MOTHER UNTIL IT WAS EIGHT OR TEN YEARS OLD.",
