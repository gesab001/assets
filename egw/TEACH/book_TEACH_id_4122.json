    "word": "Try none of these methods in your Sabbath-schools; but let the superintendent and teachers make every effort to have life and interest in the school. What a blessing it would be if all would teach as Christ taught! His language was plain, and his thoughts were expressed with the greatest simplicity; but he spoke with loving earnestness. In your teaching be as near like him as possible. Make your exercises interesting. Let the teachers show that they have thoroughly learned the lesson, and are intensely interested in it.",
