    "word": "My brother, you have a misconception of your position. You are not to treat those to whom you are sent to minister as your heritage. You must not seek to take the place of God, teaching the people that you are to be conscience for them. You are not their sin-bearer. You cannot take away your own sins or atone for your own inconsistencies. If in the future you follow the same course that you followed in the past, the Lord will not, cannot, accept you as a shepherd of His flock. He will surely remove you.",
