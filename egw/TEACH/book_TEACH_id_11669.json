    "word": "If those who are connected with the work will place themselves in a humble, teachable position, they will be blessed by God, and will be more precious than fine gold, even than the golden wedge of Ophir, to our publishing institutions; for they will adorn their own character with the virtue and grace that dwelt in Christ. The entire nature will be sanctified, and they will be fitted through grace for the grand work of being laborers together with God. But when any man in our institutions trusts to his own devices and wisdom, he declines the authority of God, and the sooner he goes where he will have ample room to work out his devising without interference, and thus reveal the true principles that control him, the better it will be for all who are connected with him.",
