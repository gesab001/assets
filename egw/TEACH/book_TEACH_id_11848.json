    "word": "Let God's servants preach a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Let them become acquainted with His instructions, reading and studying every sentence, every word, with softened, subdued hearts drawing near to God, that the Comforter may teach them. Christ's teachings are our lessons for today, our lessons for tomorrow. The more frequently they are studied, the better will they be understood.--Ms 22, 1890, pp. 15, 16.
