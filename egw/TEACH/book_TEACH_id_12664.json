    "word": "Students should not merely be told to do this or do that without being given a lesson that will teach them the principles underlying the things they are required to do. As they put seeds into the ground, teach them the lesson of the germinating principle of seeds, found in the great lesson Book. Teach them the time to sow, the time to plant trees in their season, and when to prune them. Draw lessons from the day and night, the sunshine and clouds, the former and the latter rains, the harvest. . . .",
