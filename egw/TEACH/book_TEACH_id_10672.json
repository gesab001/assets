    "word": "When Jesus came into our world, the Jewish nation were not ready to receive Him. \"The world knew Him not.\" \"He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.\" They had lost sight of the character that He would reveal, and the manner of His coming, although these were plainly delineated in the Word. As a nation, they had become estranged from the pure spirituality attained through obedience to God's law. And so, when the Lord Jesus came to the world, His chosen people did not recognize their Deliverer; and they \n                                                                           10\ncontinued to teach for doctrine the commandments of men.",
