    "word": "In the night season I was speaking earnestly to the brethren in Southern California in reference to the school at Fernando. Perplexing questions had arisen in reference to the school. One in authority was in the assembly, and He gave counsel in regard to the way in which the school should be conducted. Our Counselor said: \"If you follow on to know the Lord, you will know that His going forth is prepared as the morning. The teachers \n                                                                           213\nin the school should be learners with the students in all the instruction given. They are constantly to receive grace and wisdom from the Source of all wisdom.",
