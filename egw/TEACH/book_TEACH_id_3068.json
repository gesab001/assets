    "word": "The council assembled and sent for their prisoners. The officers unclosed the prison doors; but those whom they sought were not there. They returned to the priests and elders and said, \"The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.\" \"Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned. And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.\"",
