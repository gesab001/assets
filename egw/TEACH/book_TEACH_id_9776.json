    "word": "The home is the child's first school. God will hold those parents accountable who do not discipline their children in accordance with His instruction. Parents are to seek God earnestly and obey Him implicitly, and they are to require obedience from their children. Do not think that you can neglect your children, and then secure their future safety by sending them to [church] school and Sabbath school. God calls upon you to do your neglected work. In the home, practice temperance in all things. And sustain the teachers who are trying to give your children a true education. . . .",
