    "word": "Necessity of Abiding in Christ \n\n     If you had been abiding in Christ, your fruit would have been unto purity and holiness. You would not be self-sufficient, heady, and high-minded, but would have been meek and lowly of heart. You would not be filled with envy, jealousy, evil surmising, strife for supremacy and position, esteeming yourselves more highly than the Lord esteems you. Look at the character of the fruit you have borne these years in the past, and then carefully consider the words of Christ. He says: \"Ye shall know them by their fruits. . . . A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\" Many of you know that you are not standing in the light of the Sun of Righteousness. Your works are not the works of righteousness, and should you be cut down as an unfruitful tree, you would lose heaven, and the life that measures with the life of God. You are not ready to close up your accounts here. You need to take heed to yourselves, to watch and pray, to educate your thoughts to think of heavenly things, to educate your lips to speak on heavenly themes, to become familiar with the heavenly atmosphere, and to be able to teach others that which you have learned of Jesus. Let the mind and soul be drawn to the great center of attraction, ever realizing the truth of Christ's words, \"Without Me ye can do nothing. \"Then will you have more humble views of yourself than you have ever had before. . . . \n                                                                           60",
