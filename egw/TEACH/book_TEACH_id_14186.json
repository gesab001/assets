    "word": "I am bidden to say that the work of following the guidance and direction of men is a mistake, from beginning to end. God now calls for genuine conversion on the part of those who have taken up the work of telling other men just where they shall go \n\n\n                            -212- \n\nand how they shall labor. No man has been delegated by God to act as a dictator to his fellow-laborers, telling them what is their duty; for this is assuming by weak and erring man that which belongs to God alone. Our brethren should refuse to accept such responsibility; for by taking such a course they are teaching men to seek the direction and guidance of man instead of the control and guidance of God. Our Christian activity is to be greatly increased, and in this work the Lord is to be the guide and counsellor of His servants.",
