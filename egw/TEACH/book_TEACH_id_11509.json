    "word": "\"We should seek to follow more closely the example of Christ, the great Shepherd, as He worked with His little company of disciples, studying with them and with the people the Old Testament scriptures. His active ministry consisted not merely in sermonizing, but in educating the people. As He passed through villages, He came in personal contact with the people in their homes, teaching, and ministering to their necessities. As the crowds that followed Him increased, when \n\n18 \n\nHe came to a favorable place, He would speak to them, simplifying His discourses by the use of parables and symbols.\"",
