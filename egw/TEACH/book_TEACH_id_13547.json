    "word": "Those who are teachers should feel the necessity of being taught, learning of Jesus Christ through His sent messengers, that they may communicate to you, that you may communicate freely to others as you have received. Ministers and people should show the same earnestness to learn the truth anew, and receive it afresh, as to learn it the first time. It will bear repetition and will need to be oft repeated, to be appropriated, being heard from other lips.",
