    "word": "Let those who have been trained for service now take their places quickly in the Lord's work. House-to-house laborers are needed. The Lord calls for decided efforts to be put forth in places where the people know nothing of the truth. Singing and prayer and Bible readings are needed in the homes of the people. Now, just now, is the time to obey the commission, \"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you\" (Matthew 28:20). Those who do this work must have a ready knowledge of the Scriptures. \"It is written\" is to be their weapon of defense.",
