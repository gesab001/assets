    "word": "The message from the spirit of prophecy today to this people is a call for a reorganization of the entire medical missionary work, the key of which is unity. It would seem that this particular phase of the message is to be so blended with every other part that the entire message is to stand out before the world after the similitude of Christ's work that every individual member of the church--layman, canvasser, Bible teacher, school teacher, institutional worker, and minister is to stand in Christ's stead before the world with His message of teaching and healing. The nurse or physician is no longer to content himself to simply minister to men's physical necessity, but is to perform a double ministry. The minister and missionary worker are to minister alike to soul and body in their need, and (57) thus the entire work is to become one united medical missionary evangelistic work.",
