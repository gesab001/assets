    "word": "A neglected field represents the neglected mind. Parents must come to view this matter in a different light. They must feel it their duty to cooperate with the teacher, to encourage wise discipline, and to pray much for the one who is teaching their children. You will not help the children by fretting, nor by censuring and discouraging them; neither will you act a good part to help them to rebel and to be disobedient and unkind and unlovable, because of the spirit you develop. If you are Christians indeed, you will have an abiding Christ and the spirit of him who gave life for sinners, and the wisdom of God will teach you in every emergency the course to pursue. Christ identifies his interests with every class and phase of humanity who are wrestling with temptations. You are not to countenance wrongdoing in any case, and you are not to make statements of wrongdoing which shall expel even the perverse doer. Never chastise in a way that increases stubbornness (unless you wish to bring upon your soul the same treatment from Jesus), and confirms the student in his evil course. Children are in need of having a steady, firm, living principle of righteousness exercised over them and enacted before them. Be sure to let the true light shine before your pupils. It is heaven's light that is wanted. Never let the world have the impression that your spirit and taste and longings are of no higher and purer an order than the worldling's. If you in your action leave this impression upon them, you let a false, deceptive light lead them to ruin. The trumpet must give a certain sound. There is a broad, clear, and deep line drawn by the eternal God between the righteous and unrighteous, the godly and ungodly; between those who are obedient to God's commandments and those who are disobedient.",
