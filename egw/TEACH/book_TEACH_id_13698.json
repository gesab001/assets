    "word": "The Healdsburg School \n\n     It is important that in our school in Healdsburg all the instruction shall be as thorough as it is in any similar school. If the laws of the land require that youth preparing for a medical course shall study some branches which you do not now teach, you should provide instruction in these required branches. Which is worse, to send our youth to Battle Creek to gain this required knowledge, or to give it to them in our schools in the various union conferences where they are living? If it is right for this instruction to be given, we are to provide facilities for giving it in every training school in our land. Thus we shall be able to avoid the necessity of sending our youth to Battle Creek, or, as has been done in the past, to some worldly institution--to Ann Arbor or some other school of the world.",
