    "word": "Just as sure as you depend on man to be appreciated and to sustain you, you will be wholly disappointed. Your encouragement and sustaining will not come from the very best of men. The Lord has a lesson to teach you, to depend on Him alone, for He is your Redeemer. You are His property--His by creation and by redemption. The way of the Lord is to be chosen, the will of the Lord is to be your will. . . .",
