    "word": "Our daily experience with Christ should be of the highest value to us. We have an individual part to act in His service. Our blessed Saviour has given us . . . precious promises for our encouragement. He desires us to know that He is watching over us, and that He will teach us what He expects us to do. If the enemy comes to us in the morning, or during the day, with annoyances, let us remember these precious promises, and not allow ourselves to be ruffled. Let us remember that we are Christ's representatives, and that we must not, by word or act, offend one another.",
