    "word": "MR No. 1370 - Results of Studying Harmful Textbooks; Teach the Lessons Christ Taught\n\n                        (Written in 1890 at Battle Creek.) \n\n     \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to Thy word\" [Psalms 119:9]. Why, then, do the teachers in our colleges and schools depend upon books for the education of children and youth that are filled with falsehood and cheapness, with fairy tales and stories, and which fill the minds of the young with desires for the unreal? Why should not the lessons which children and youth learn be pure, elevating, and ennobling? Cannot books be written that are free from every species of error? Is there not talent enough among Seventh-day Adventists to write books containing the simple lessons of the Old and New Testaments?",
