    "word": "We are never to graduate in this Word until Jesus shall change us to the future life, and then we shall learn through all eternity. You are ever to be a learner if you are to be a teacher, presenting things new and old. We shall be continually discovering rich veins of precious ore in this Word. It is a priceless treasure for God's people. There is not a moment of time that we are to spend in indolence, but we are to be all the time having our hearts open for the Spirit of God to rest upon us.",
