    "word": "When Jesus was thought to be dying beneath the burden of the cross, many women, who, though not believers in Christ, were touched with pity for his sufferings, broke forth into a mournful wailing.

He looked upon the weeping women and said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves, and for your children.\"",
