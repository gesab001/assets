    "word": "We are to be consecrated channels, through which the heavenly life is to flow to others. The Holy Spirit is to animate and pervade the whole church, purifying and cementing hearts. Those who have been buried with Christ in baptism are to rise to newness of life, giving a living representation of the life of Christ. The commission has been given to us. Upon us is laid a sacred charge. Go then, Christ says to them. Make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded, and baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. \"And, lo,\" he declares, \"I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" You are dedicated to the work of making known the gospel of salvation. Heaven's perfection is to be your power. As God's followers, by converted lives, make known the power of his grace. A clear distinction is drawn between \"him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.\"--Ms 78, 1905, pp. 3-5.
