    "word": "Feelings of Unrest Sometimes Good.--Feelings of unrest and homesickness or loneliness may be for your good. Your heavenly Father means to teach you to find in Him the friendship and love and consolation that will satisfy your most earnest hopes and desires. . . . Your only safety and happiness are in making Christ your constant counselor. You can be happy in Him if you had not another friend in the wide world.--Lt 2b, 1874. (HC 259.) \n\n128",
