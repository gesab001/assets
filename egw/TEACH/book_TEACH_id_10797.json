    "word": "Practice economy in your homes. By many, idols are cherished and worshiped. Put away your idols. Give up your selfish pleasures. Do not, I beg of you, absorb means in embellishing your houses: for it is God's money, and it will be required of you again. Parents, for Christ's sake do not use the Lord's money to please the fancies of your children. Do not teach them to seek after style and ostentation in order to attain an influence in the world. Will this incline them to save the souls for whom Christ died? No; it will not do this. It will create in the heart envy, jealousy, evil surmising. They will be led to compete with the show and extravagance of the world, and to expend the Lord's money for that which is not essential to health and happiness. \n                                                                           8",
