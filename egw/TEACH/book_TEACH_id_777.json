    "word": "A person may hear and acknowledge the whole truth, and yet know nothing of personal piety and true experimental religion. He or she may explain the way of salvation to others, and yet be a castaway. . . . \u201cWhy,\u201d asked a man who had been and still was practicing wickedness, \u201care souls converted to the truth through my influence?\u201d I answered, \u201cChrist is constantly drawing souls to Himself, and flashing His own light in their path. The seeker after salvation is not permitted to read the character of him who teaches him. If he himself is sincere, if he draws nigh to God, believing in Him, confessing his sins, he will be accepted.\u201d. . .",
