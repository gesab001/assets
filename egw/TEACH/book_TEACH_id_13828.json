    "word": "O that we had teachers who would show men by precept and example what it means to believe and live the truth! Why are our teachers walking and acting like those who are spiritually blind? As in the days of Christ, they have eyes, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not, lest they should be converted and be healed. There is need that the converting power of God should come upon our ministering brethren; for many of the people are far in advance of them in experience in the things of God. The highest interest of souls both for time and eternity, is involved in a proper understanding of the work for this time.",
