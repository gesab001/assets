    "word": "The Lord God of heaven is constantly at work for us. His angels minister to all who will receive their guardianship. Human impulse will try to make us believe that it is God who is guiding us, when we are following our own way. But if we watch carefully, and counsel with our brethren, we shall understand; for the promise is, \"The meek will He guide in judgment; and the meek will He teach His way.\" Psalms 25:9. We must never allow human ideas and natural inclinations to gain the supremacy.",
