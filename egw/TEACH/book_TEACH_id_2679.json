When Jesus revived, He looked upon them with tender compassion. He knew they were not lamenting Him because He was a teacher sent from God, but from motives of common humanity. He looked upon the weeping women and said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, but weep not for me, but for yourselves, and for your children.\"",
