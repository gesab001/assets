    "word": "Every physician, every nurse, every helper, who has anything to do in God's service, must aim at perfection and under the discipline of the greatest Teacher the world has ever known, his course must ever tend upward toward this aim. All who are connected with the medical missionary work must be learners. No one must stop to think, I cannot do this. He must say instead, God requires me to be perfect.
