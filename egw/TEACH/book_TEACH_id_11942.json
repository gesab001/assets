    "word": "Are we keeping our eyes fixed upon the perfect Pattern, or are we lowering the standard? We need the faith that works by love and purifies the heart. We need to bring Christ into our homes. We can not afford to be without His help. He says, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" He has brought His people together in church capacity in order that He may teach them to put off the world and prepare for heaven.

And how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?",
