When Christ is recognized as the head of all our working forces, more and more thoroughly will our institutions be cleansed from every common, worldly practice. The show and the pretense, and many of the exhibitions that in the past have had a place in our schools, will find no place there when teachers and students seek to carry out God's will on earth as it is done in heaven. Christ, as the chief working agency, will mold and fashion characters after the divine order; and students and teachers, realizing that they are preparing for the higher school in the courts above, will put away many things that are now thought to be necessary, and will magnify and follow the methods of Christ.",
