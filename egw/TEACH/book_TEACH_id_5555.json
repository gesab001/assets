    "word": "Patience and Adaptability Needed (counsel to a teacher).--You do not make a success as a teacher because you have not patience and adaptability. You do not know how to deal with human minds or how to impart knowledge in the best way. If your expectations are not met, you are impatient. You have had every advantage of education, but nevertheless, you are not a wise teacher. It is very disagreeable to you to inculcate ideas into dull minds. In your youth you needed discipline and training. But the spirit which you manifested under correction has spoiled your life.--Lt 117, 1901.",
