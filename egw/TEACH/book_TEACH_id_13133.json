    "word": "Let us keep our souls in the love of God. The note of warning must be given. The truth must not languish upon our lips. We must rouse people to immediate preparation; for we little know what is before us. My faith is as strong as ever that we are living in the last remnant of time. Let every teacher present an open door before all who will come to Jesus, repenting of their sins. We are not only to watch; we are to pray and work and wait. \n     [2 Peter 3:10-14, quoted.]--Letter 105, 1903. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. Sept. 3, 1987. Entire Letter.",
