    "word": "Some talk of \"principles\" that actuate their service and their teachings; but neither in word nor in deed, by strict integrity and by proper dealing, do they reveal that a work of grace has transformed the heart. They are not drawing from \n\n\n               -277- \n\nChrist the wholesome light and life and grace by which deep impressions are made upon minds, causing them to become more and still more Christlike. Some of those who claim to follow certain well-defined \"principles,\" walk and talk like unconverted worldlings. To such, the words of Christ are repeated over and over again: \"I know thy works.\" This is the message sent to the church at Ephesus.",
