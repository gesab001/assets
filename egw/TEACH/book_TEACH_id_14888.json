    "word": "There need to be teachers who are thoughtful, considerate of their own weakness and infirmities and sins, and who will not be oppressive and discourage the children and youth. There needs to be much praying, much faith, much forbearance and courage which the Lord is ready to bestow. For God sees every trial, and a wonderful influence can be exerted by teachers, if they will practice the lessons which Christ has given them. But will these teachers consider their own wayward course, that they make very feeble efforts to learn in the school of Christ and practice Christ-like meekness and lowliness of heart? The teachers should be themselves in obedience to Jesus Christ, and ever practicing his words, that they may exemplify the character of Jesus Christ to the students. Let your light shine in good works, in faithful watching and caring for the lambs of the flock, with patience, with tenderness, and the love of Jesus in your own hearts. Never, never educate them to speak impatiently and passionately, because their teacher does these things. Never educate them by giving publicity to the errors and misdoings of any scholar, for they will consider it a virtue in them to expose the wrongs of another. Never humiliate a scholar by presenting his grievances, and mistakes, and sins before the school. You can not do a work more effectual to harden their hearts and confirm them in evil than in doing this. Talk and pray with them alone, and show the same tenderness Christ has evidenced to you who are teachers. Never encourage any one student to criticise and talk of the faults of others; hide a multitude of sins in every way possible by pursuing Christ's way to cure them. This kind of educating will be a blessing, made to tell in this life and stretching into the future immortal life.",
