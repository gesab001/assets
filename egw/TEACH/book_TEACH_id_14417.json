    "word": "Working in Unity \n\n     I would that parents had sanctified intelligence, that they might see the necessity of working in unity. The husband, wife, and children are a firm. They should look upon themselves as God's agents who are to work together intelligently, regarding the family as a divine institution. The parents are to instruct their children wisely, and patiently, teaching them line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. With faith and perseverance they are to educate, train, and discipline, requiring their children to be obedient, allowing no disrespect. Thus the seeds of reverence and respect for the heavenly Father are sown. The home should be a preparatory school, where children and youth may be fitted to do service for the Master, preparatory to joining the higher school in the kingdom of God.",
