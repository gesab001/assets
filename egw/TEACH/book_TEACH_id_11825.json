    "word": "Why the Work is Not Finished \n\n     We have been asked why it is that there is so little power in the churches, why there is so little efficiency among our teachers. The answer is that it is because known sin in various forms is cherished among the professed followers of Christ, and the conscience becomes hardened by long violation. The answer is that men do not walk with God, but separate company from Jesus, and as a result we see manifested in the church selfishness, covetousness, pride, strife, contention, hardheartedness, licentiousness, and evil practices. Even among those who preach the sacred word of God, this state of evil is found, and unless there is thorough reformation among those who are unholy and unsanctified, it would be better that such men would leave the ministry, and choose some other occupation where their unregenerate thoughts would not bring disaster upon the people of God.--Letter 19b, 1892, pp. 13-14. (To O. A. Olsen, June 19, 1892.)",
