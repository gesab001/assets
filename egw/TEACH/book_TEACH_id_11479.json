    "word": "To preach in a hard, strained voice, pitched on a high key, is suicidal, and those who have practised this way of speaking should cease to do it, and learn of the divine Teacher. Several of our ministers might have been alive today if they had observed the simple rules that apply to the use of the voice. Let loud speaking and long discourses cease from among us.",
