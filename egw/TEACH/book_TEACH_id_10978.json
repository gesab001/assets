    "word": "\"It is the duty of principal and teachers to demand perfect order and perfect discipline. Those teachers who do not see the necessity of maintaining the rules that it is deemed essential to make have simply made a mistake in thinking that they are prepared to teach, and in accepting the situation. No disorder should be allowed without decided rebuke and a command to cease. It would not be allowed even in the common schools. If the principal and teachers of the school have not authority and government sufficient to set things in order, some one should take the management who will require obedience.\"--P.C.",
