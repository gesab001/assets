    "word": "To a crowded assembly he spoke from the words of Christ, \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d \u201cPhilosophers, doctors, and writers,\u201d he said, \u201chave endeavored to teach men the way to obtain everlasting life, and they have not succeeded. I will now tell it to you.\u201d \u201cGod has raised one Man from the dead, the Lord Jesus Christ, that he might destroy death, expiate sin, and shut the gates of hell. This is the work of salvation. Christ has vanquished! This is the joyful news! And we are saved by his work, and not by our own. . . . Our Lord Jesus Christ said, \u2018Peace be unto you! behold my hands\u2019\u2014that is to say, Behold, O man! it is I, I alone, who have taken away thy sins, and ransomed thee; and now thou hast peace, saith the Lord.\u201d",
