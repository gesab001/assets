    "word": "The temptations by which Christ was beset in the wilderness,--appetite, love of the world, and presumption,--are the three great leading allurements by which men are most frequently overcome. The managers of the Sanitarium will often be tempted to depart from the principles which should govern such an institution. Some are ready to vary from the right course to gratify the inclinations and minister to the depraved appetites of a few wealthy patients or friends. The influence of such a course is only evil. Any deviation from the teachings given in lectures or through the press, has a most unfavorable effect upon the influence and morals of the institution, and will, to a great extent, counteract all efforts to instruct and reform the victims of depraved appetites and passions, and to lead them to the only safe refuge,--Jesus Christ.",
