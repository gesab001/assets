Of Him it is written that He \"went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.\" Matthew 4:23. \n                                                                           396\nHe healed the sick and preached the gospel. In His service, healing and teaching were linked closely together. Today they are not to be separated.",
