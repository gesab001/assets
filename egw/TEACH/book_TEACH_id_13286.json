    "word": "Christ did not merely give us directions as to the path in which we must travel, but He came to be our teacher. He did not merely tell us how we ought to obey, but in His own life He gave us a practical example of how we should obey. Thus He is the true Helper. Going before us, He beats down the obstructions, and tells us to walk in His footsteps. Our blessed Saviour says, Follow Me; I will lead you; I am the way, the truth, and the life. He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness. [See Matthew 4:19; John 14:6; 8:12.]",
