    "word": "The message that the Lord has given me for the church in Los Angeles, is, Through faith and diligent service you are to become one with Christ. You are to eat His flesh and drink His blood, making His words a part of the daily life. The great Teacher will accept only the purest integrity, the most distinct representation of His words and His Spirit. Spiritual-mindedness must not be allowed to become a strange thing among us. We are to become more and more nearly conformed to Christ. The joy of the Lord, the praise of God, is to be on our lips and in our hearts. The character is to be transformed from the mist and cloud of uncertainty into the radiance of the light proceeding from heaven. The world is to be eclipsed by the contemplation of heavenly things.",
