    "word": "Startling Messages.--The publications sent forth from our printing houses are to prepare a people to meet God. Throughout the world they are to do the same work that was done by John the Baptist for the Jewish nation. By startling messages of warning, God's prophet awakened men from worldly dreaming. Through him God called backsliding Israel to repentance. By his presentation of truth he exposed popular delusions. In contrast with the false theories of his time, truth in his teaching stood forth as an eternal certainty. \"Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,\" was John's message. This same message, through the publications from our printing houses, is to be given to the world today. \n                                                                           179\nThe prophecy that John's mission fulfilled outlines our work,--\"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" Matthew 3:2, 3. As John prepared the way for the first, so we are to prepare the way for the second, advent of the Saviour.",
