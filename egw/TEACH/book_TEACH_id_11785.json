God has not ordered things as they now stand. Are we not too fond of doing, when God would have us stand as minute men, watching and praying, prepared to do what He commanded through consecrated agencies? Men who want to do something for God say, \"We will do this or that,\" and so a line is marked out for all to follow. Thus selfishness is growing all the time. Man is grasping all the advantages possible, bringing in all the material he can obtain for the work he wants to do, while he deprives his fellow workers of that which they need. Let not the men in responsible positions grow selfish and ambitious to accumulate buildings in one locality. The command is given, \"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others\" (Philippians 2:4). If men would work in Christ's lines, they must yoke up with Him in meekness and lowliness of heart, pleading earnestly, \"Lord, teach me Thy way. What is Thy purpose and will?\" and asking at every step, \"Am I trying to live for God or for myself?\"",
