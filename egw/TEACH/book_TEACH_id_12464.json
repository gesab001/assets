    "word": "The teacher should strive to have his knowledge of the Word and spiritual truth continually increase. But he cannot do this by wedding himself to certain authors.

This is represented as eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God.--Ms 37, 1899, pp. 4-6. (\"The Need for Consecrated Workers,\" March 21, 1897.) \n\nReleased March 17, 1978.",
