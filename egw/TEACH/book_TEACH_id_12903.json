    "word": "Brother Rice, if God has given you a work to do, it is to proclaim His truth, to hold forth the word of life, planting the feet on the eternal Rock. As represented to me, the work of Anna Phillips in connection with Brother and Sister Rice is a work that God has not set in operation, and its fruits will testify that it is not of God. Take your Bible, teach the Word of God, not the revealings of Anna Phillips. Let all be educated to search the Scriptures, to be constantly looking unto Jesus and not to human agents to be their guide. The Word of God is to be the man of our counsel. That Word is infinite. Obeyed, it will guide us into safe and sure paths. But the Word diluted with human devices and imaginings is not a safe guide.",
