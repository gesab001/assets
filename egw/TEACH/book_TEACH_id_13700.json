    "word": "We are not to search after oddities, or after things that are not revealed. Some have asked me in regard to things that are in the heavenly courts. I have always sent them to the Bible to search out those things that God has commanded them to observe. Paul received revelation after revelation, but in no instance did he satisfy the curiosity of men by relating what he saw in the heavenly courts. He wrote that he \"was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\" Many things cannot be described so that they will make a correct impression upon minds befogged by sin. A wrong use would be made of such knowledge. The things that God has commanded us to study are the things that we are to teach and to live. To those who fashion their daily conduct in accordance with these teachings, Christ gives the promise, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\"",
