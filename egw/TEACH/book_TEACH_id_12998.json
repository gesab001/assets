    "word": "We must make special efforts while the angels are holding the four winds, but there is constant danger of going forth to labor in self-confidence and leaving Christ out of the question. We want a strong hold from above; we want to press our petitions to the throne of grace; we must grasp the promises of God by living faith, in America and also here in Europe. In Christ we can be a host. Without Christ defects and mistakes will be seen in all the work. We are nearing the end; we are doing up the last great work for eternity; we are learning ourselves, and teaching others, that a people may be prepared to stand in the day of God's preparation. We cannot afford to work at random; we cannot afford to be doubleminded; we should now consecrate all our powers to God without reserve.",
