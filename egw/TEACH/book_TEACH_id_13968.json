    "word": "The largest promise that Christ could give to his disciples when he left them was the promise of the Holy Spirit. He was in search of the strongest consolation he could leave them, to do the good after his departure. Of all the subjects that were of the most important to them, he chose that of the Holy Spirit. And what did he predict concerning the Spirit? \"He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\" Truths had been buried beneath the rubbish of misinterpretation, the maxims of men, the sayings of finite beings that had been exalted as being of more consequence than the word of the living God.",
