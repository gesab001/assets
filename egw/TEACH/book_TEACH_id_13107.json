    "word": "Christ has made it possible for you to practice His life. You have His precious words in the Bible; believe in them, carry out their teachings. Never doubt the word of God. This word, if received into your life, will refine and sanctify you, and increase your usefulness. It is your privilege to help those who need help, to speak words of encouragement to those who need encouragement. Bear in mind that you are to show to the world the light of the glory of God.",
