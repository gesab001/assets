    "word": "As yet we have scarcely been a light to the world, because we cling to our sinful, corrupting practices. We have been too well satisfied with the twilight glow of heavenly enlightenment. We have not yet gained the experience that will make us feel at home in heaven. As yet we are but stepping over the threshold of the sanctuary containing the truths which every child of God must receive and reveal to a world lying in wickedness.--Ms. 102, 1902, pp. 5-6. (\"The Relation That Should Exist Between Teacher and Students,\" July 27, 1902.)",
