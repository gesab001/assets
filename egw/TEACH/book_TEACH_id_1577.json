    "word": "Let no one advance extreme views in regard to what we shall eat and what we shall drink. The Lord has given light. Let our people accept the light and walk in the light.

An increase of piety, of good, humble, spiritual religion would place our people in a position where they could learn of the Great Teacher.",
