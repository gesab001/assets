    "word": "Let teachers and students watch for opportunities to confess Christ in their conversation. Such witness will be more effective than many sermons. There are few who represent Christ truly. He needs to be formed within, the hope of glory; then He will be acknowledged as the giver of every good and perfect gift, the author of all our blessings, the one in whom is centered our hope of eternal life.",
