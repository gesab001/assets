    "word": "Elder [J. H.] Waggoner has loved discussions and contention. I fear that E. J. Waggoner has cultivated a love for the same. We need now good humble religion. E. J. Waggoner needs humility, meekness, and Brother Jones can be a power for good if he will constantly cultivate practical godliness that he may teach this to the people.--Letter 37, 1887, pp. 2, 4. (To E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones, February 18, 1887.)",
