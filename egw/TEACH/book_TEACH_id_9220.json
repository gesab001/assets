    "word": "The teacher need lay no special claims to dignity, since he can gain the respect of his pupils in no other way than by a Christlike deportment, in manifesting kindness and Christian courtesy. The teacher is to educate the pupils as Christ educated His disciples. He must make impressions that \n81\ntime can not efface. His influence should mold his scholars after the divine Pattern; and if he does this, eternity alone will tell the value of his labor. The teacher must awaken in his pupils the moral nature, and inspire in them a desire to respond to the divine agencies.",
