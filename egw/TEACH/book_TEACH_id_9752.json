To every converted soul is given the privilege of helping those around him who do not rejoice in the light in which he is standing. They also may know the joy that has come to him. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:12). They may take their place in the world as God's light bearers.--Letter 173, Aug. 5, 1903, to \"My Dear Brethren.\"",
