    "word": "In every school Satan has tried to make himself the guide of the teachers who instruct the students. It is he who has introduced the idea that selfish amusements are a necessity. Students sent to school for the purpose of receiving an education to become evangelists, ministers, and missionaries to foreign countries should not have received the idea that amusements are essential to keep them in physical health, when the Lord has presented before them that the better way is to embrace in their education manual labor in the place of amusements. These amusements, if practiced, will soon develop a passion that gives disrelish to useful, healthful exercise of mind and body. Such exercise makes students useful to themselves and others. \n\n\n                                     -280-",
