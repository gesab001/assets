    "word": "When you are teaching the people, present only a few vital points, and keep the mind concentrated on these points. Do not bring unimportant ideas into your discourses. God would not have you think that you are impressed by His Spirit when you fly from your subject, bringing in foreign matters that have no real connection with your text. By wandering from straight lines, and bringing in that which calls the mind off the subject, you lose your bearings and weaken all that you have previously said.",
