    "word": "\"This is the will of God concerning you, even your sanctification.\" There must be a decided improvement in matters of discipline in some of our recently opened schools. The Lord calls upon the teachers to be laborers together with Him, that the fruit of righteousness may appear in the lives of the students. He calls upon parents to remember that the mind, the voice, the influence--all the powers--are His gifts, to be used in winning souls to Christ. Thus each family may become a missionary family. From the home, the school, and the church a holy influence is to go forth. The grace of Christ is to be received into the life and revealed in the character.--Ms 26, 1910, pp. 1-3.
