    "word": "SEEK THE LORD WITH ALL THE HEART.\u2014Our prayers should be full of tenderness and love. When we yearn for a deeper, broader realization of the Saviour\u2019s love, we shall cry to God for more wisdom. If ever there was a need of soul-stirring prayers and sermons, it is now. The end of all things is at hand. O that we could see as we should the necessity of seeking the Lord with all the heart! Then we should find Him. May God teach His people how to pray.\u2014(God\u2019s Amazing Grace, 92.)",
