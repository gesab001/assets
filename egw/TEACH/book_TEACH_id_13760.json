    "word": "Had a large part of the company of students who have been gathered into Battle Creek, engaged in the work as evangelists, colporteurs, and canvassers, trying in humility to teach the word, there would have been a much more spiritual and sacredly intelligent medical working company. Had they gone forth, taking Christ as their Teacher, many who may never again become settled in the truth, would have received an education that would have enabled them to open the Scriptures to others. Large numbers would have been converted, and would have put out their talents to usury, teaching the things that Christ has commanded. But alas! They have been given a knowledge that, in the day of judgment, when the books will be opened, and every man judged according to the deeds done in the body, they will wish they had never been accepted. Better never to have learned the lessons they have been learning in unbelief and lack of faith, in sophistry and untruthful representations.",
