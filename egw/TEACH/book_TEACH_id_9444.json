    "word": "Unity in the Church\n     The Lord would have His church purified from all contention and strife. Every phase of character is to be in harmony with the character of Jesus Christ. Unity will then be seen as the sure result. Divisions are the fruit of Satan's work. Those who love God and keep His commandments will ever reveal the meekness and lowliness of Christ, because they have learned in the school of the great Teacher. We need to be worked by the Holy Spirit. Daily I feel the need of increased faith and increased power in faith to represent the character of Christ to our world. \u2014Letter 24, 1900.",
