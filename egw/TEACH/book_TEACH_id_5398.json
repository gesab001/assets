    "word": "Advantages of Small Schools \n\n     The Lord is certainly opening the way for us as a people to divide and subdivide the companies that have been growing too large to work together to the greatest advantage. And this dividing should be done, not only that the students may have greater advantages, but that the teachers may be benefited, and life and health spared. To establish another school will be better than further enlargement of the school at-----. Let another locality have the advantage of one of our educational institutions. Secure for it the best talent, and guard against the dangers of an overcrowded school.--Letter 253, 1908.",
