    "word": "There is a world to be warned, and every effort must now be made to exalt the truth. . . . The great Teacher held in His hand the entire map of truth.

In regard to God and in regard to His personality, the Lord Jesus said, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father\" (John 14:9). Christ was the express image of His Father's person.",
