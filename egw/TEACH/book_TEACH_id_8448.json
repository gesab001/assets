    "word": "The commission which Christ gave to the disciples just prior to His ascension to heaven was: \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.\" The commission reaches those who shall believe on His word through His disciples. And all who are called of God to stand as ambassadors for Him should take the lessons upon practical godliness given them by Christ in His word and teach them to the people.",
