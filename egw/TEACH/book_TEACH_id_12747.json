    "word": "Power to Be Obtained Through Prayer--My mind has been dwelling upon the subject of prayer. Little groups should gather and seek the Lord earnestly. We are, as a people, sadly neglecting this means of grace. Christ declares--and the words were spoken after His resurrection--\"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\" And because of this power, He adds the great gospel commission: \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" [Matthew 28:18-20]. --Letter 320, 1906.--(To S. N. Haskell, Oct. 4, 1906.) \n\nWhite Estate February 3, 1983",
