The springs of heavenly peace and joy, unsealed in the soul of the teacher by the magic words of inspiration, will become a mighty river of influence to bless all who connect with Him. Do not think that the Bible will become a tiresome book to the children. Under a wise instructor, the Word will become more and more desirable. It will be to them as the bread of life, and will never grow old. There is in it a freshness and beauty which attracts and charms the children and youth. It is like the sun shining upon the earth, giving light and warmth, yet never exhausted. By lessons from Bible history and doctrine, the children can learn that all other books are inferior to this. They can find here a fountain of mercy and love.\" \n\n                                               -",
