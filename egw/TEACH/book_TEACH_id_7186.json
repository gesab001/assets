    "word": "It is not men whom we are to exalt and worship; it is God, the only true and living God, to whom our worship and reverence are due. According to the teaching of the Scriptures, it dishonors God to address ministers as \"reverend.\" No mortal has any right to attach this to his own name, or to the name of any other human being. It belongs only to God, to distinguish Him from every other being. . . . \"Holy and reverend is his name.\" We dishonor God when we use this word where it does not belong. . . . The Father and the Son alone are to be exalted. \n                                                                           59",
