Jones, Dear brother,-- \n     I attended a meeting of the conference after you spoke yesterday, and I could not roll off the burden which came upon me. The way in which you spoke did not leave the best impression upon the people. That night I was greatly burdened, and One of authority said to me, \"Say to my servant, Alonzo Jones, that he is to stand as a representative man. He is to put on Christ Jesus, and is to be guarded in his attitude and words, so that he shall not give others an excuse for being dictatorial and overbearing. The spirit of harshness, of a desire to rule, must be put away from our ministers, our teachers, and the managers of our institutions. The meekness of Christ must be revealed.",
