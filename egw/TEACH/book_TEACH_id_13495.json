    "word": "We have not realized the wonderful power of education and religious training for the youth. And those of all ages may receive greater benefit than they have yet realized through the same means. In the Scriptures are mines of precious ore which have not been sought for, because there is so great satisfaction in working merely upon the surface. A more persevering, careful, thorough effort put forth in exploration would reveal precious resources which have scarcely seemed possible. The Lord has for us a storehouse full of treasures that will, if appropriated, tend to the present and lasting improvement of teachers, both in our day schools and in our Sabbath schools.",
