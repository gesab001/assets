They may have had years of training, and yet [may] not have touched the very beginning, the ABC of spirituality, the ABC of devotion, the ABC of self-sacrifice. The science of education is to love God, and to keep His commandments. Study the Word of God intelligently. It is the foundation of all education.--Ms. 84, 1901, pp. 1, 2.
