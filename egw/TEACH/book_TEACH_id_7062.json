    "word": "The Blind leading the Blind\n     I have seen how the blind guides were laboring to make souls as blind as themselves, and they little realize what is coming upon them. They are exalting themselves against the truth, and as the truth triumphs, many who have looked on those teachers as men of God, and have looked to them for light, are troubled. They inquire of these leaders relative to the Sabbath, who, with the object of getting rid of the fourth commandment, will answer them thereto. I saw that real honesty was not regarded in taking the many positions that were taken against the Sabbath. \n56\nThe main object is to get around the Sabbath of the Lord, and observe another day than that sanctified and hallowed by Jehovah. And if they were driven off from one position they would taken an opposite one, even a position that they had but just before condemned as unsound.",
