    "word": "I have read Elder Waggoner's letter in regard to his connecting with the Berrien Springs school as Bible teacher. I must say that I know not the voice, neither can I understand the spirit, that prompts the presentation of such propositions. I cannot recognize the voice, neither can I advise Brother Waggoner to come from Europe to take the position of Bible teacher in the school at Berrien Springs, upon the condition named in his letter. When our brethren propose such terms as these to their fellow laborers, we may know that the propositions are not prompted by the Spirit of the Lord.",
