    "word": "Schools for colored children and youth are to be established in many places. The teachers are to bring a softening, subduing influence into the school. In their habits and their dress they are always to be neat and tidy. They will find that the students need this example. And they will find also that they are very quick to imitate. When old or young show refinement of manner and taste in dress, this is never to be discouraged.",
