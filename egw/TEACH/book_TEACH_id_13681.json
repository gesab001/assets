    "word": "We cannot afford to be careless and indifferent in regard to our spiritual welfare. It has been presented to me that the work of grace first begins in the home, in individual hearts. A knowledge of God and His law should be given the children from their earliest years. The instruction that God gave to the fathers and mothers of Israel in regard to teaching His precepts to their children, is for the parents of this time. God says, Thou shalt teach these words \"diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates\" [Deuteronomy 6:7-9].",
