    "word": "The lessons of Christ are a firm foundation, an elevated platform. Let nothing that is presented by Sister Phillips induce any soul to apply to the human agent for light to be imparted through that channel. The words spoken by the human agent are Oh so much weaker and more feeble than the words of the Great Teacher. In comparison with the words of Jesus they are as chaff compared with the wheat. Symbols are manufactured and interpreted by the human agents, which are false from beginning to end. Things have been \n\n\n                                  -196- \n\nmisconstrued in your minds by the artful power of the deceiver, and you do not discern the outcome. Let every soul come to the cool, snow waters of Lebanon, and no longer drink of the turbid streams of the valley.",
