    "word": "I do not know but that I have said enough for you to work upon. But I wish to say again that there is a work to be done in the Southern field. Very little can be done in the cities of the South until sanitariums are established there. Let this work be commenced at once. A beginning has been made at Nashville. A sanitarium must be established there. A school must be started, not in the city but at a distance from it. Schools must be established in different places in the South. And colored teachers must work for the colored people under the supervision of well-qualified men who have the spirit of mercy and love.",
