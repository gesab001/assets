    "word": "I am glad there are sensible men and women here. I am (934) pleased that there is a strong force of physicians and teachers. And I want to say to you all: work in harmony, \"I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no division among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.\" The Lord wants you to do this, and I believe you will. If you cannot possibly do it here; just go away where you can. We need to draw steadily with Christ, and to labor to glorify His holy name. And the responsible men and women in this place should give thanks to God for His manifold mercies. But do not complain or indulge in criticism, because this is all out of place. It will spoil the work.",
