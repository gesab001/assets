    "word": "It is the plan of Christ for two to be united in ministerial labor, in teaching and educating the people whom they bring into the faith. I have been shown that you should unite in labor with your brother or some other minister. You should not go alone. Two can be a help to each other, if they will be entreated and listen to counsel. If your brother, or someone else, labors with you, God wants you both to be cheerful, hopeful, and trustful, casting all your care on Jesus, and committing the keeping of your souls to Him as to a faithful Creator. Represent Jesus in character. Be strong, yea, be strong in the strength of Jesus. Neither of you should tax himself to the utmost; for you may be called upon at any time to use your long experience in doing a work in vindication of the truth that will require calm nerves, candid reflection, and forcible arguments.",
