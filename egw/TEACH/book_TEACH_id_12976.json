    "word": "Do not these words encourage us to do more praying for our brethren, and less accusing of them? I know that if these directions were followed with those who are sin-sick, the Lord Jesus would be better pleased.

I am directed that we must continue our work of soul-saving in harmony with the Bible plan.",
