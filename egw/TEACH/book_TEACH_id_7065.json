    "word": "I have frequently been falsely charged with teaching views peculiar to spiritualism. But, before the editor of the \u201cDay Star\u201d run into that delusion, the Lord gave me a view of the sad and desolating effects that would be produced upon the flock, by him and others, in teaching the spiritual views.
