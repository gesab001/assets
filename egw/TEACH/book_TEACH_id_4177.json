    "word": "Paul made it a part of his work to educate young men for the gospel ministry. He took them with him on his missionary journeys, and thus they gained an experience that later enabled them to fill positions of responsibility. When separated from them, he still kept in touch with their work, and his letters to Timothy and Titus are an evidence of how deep was his desire for their success. \"The things that thou hast heard,\" he wrote, \"commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\" [2 Timothy 2:2.]",
