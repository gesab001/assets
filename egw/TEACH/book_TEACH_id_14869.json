    "word": "The work of teachers is an important one. They should make the Words of God their meditation. God will communicate by his own Spirit to the soul. Pray as you study, \"Lord, open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.\" When the teacher will rely upon God in prayer, the Spirit fills the mind and heart with pure thoughts, and God will work through him by the Holy Spirit upon the mind of the students. The Holy Spirit fills the mind and heart with sweet hope, and courage, and Bible imagery, and this will be communicated to the students. The words of truth will grow in importance and assume a breadth and fullness of meaning of which you never dreamed. The beauty and riches of the Word of God have a transforming influence upon mind and character; the sparks of heavenly love will fall upon the hearts of the children as an inspiration. We may bring hundreds and thousands of children to Christ if we will work for them.",
