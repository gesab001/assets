    "word": "A man may preach in a spirited manner and please the ear, but convey no new idea or real intelligence to the mind. The impressions received through such preaching last no longer than while the speaker's voice is heard. When search is made for the fruit of such labor, there is little to be found. These flashy gifts are not as beneficial, and as well adapted to advance the cause of truth, as a gift that can be trusted in difficult places. In the work of teaching the truth it is necessary that the important \n147\npoints of our position be well fortified with Scripture evidences. Assertions may silence the unbeliever, but will not convince him. Believers are not the only ones for whose benefit laborers are sent into the field. The salvation of souls is the great object. \u2014Vol. I, p. 442.",
