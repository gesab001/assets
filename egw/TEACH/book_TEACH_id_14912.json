We do not want our debt to accumulate. In our schools in America, the price of tuition for students has been set too low, and the managers of the schools have become convinced that even with proper economy, they could not continue these low prices. After one or two terms of school, a careful investigation has revealed to them that the sum set was not sufficient to cover expenses, that the tuition should be increased, thus avoiding a discouraging debt. Far better let all the students share in the expense, than allow the school to bear the whole weight; for this throws upon the managers of the institution on a continual suspicion of miscalculation, want of economy, and wrong planning. These debts are very discouraging to teachers.",
