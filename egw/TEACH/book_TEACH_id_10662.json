    "word": "The Training of Workers. \n\n     For the accomplishment of the Lord's work among the colored people in the South, we can not look wholly to white laborers. We need colored workers, O, so much! to labor for their own people everywhere, and especially in those places where it would \n                                                                           19\nnot be safe for white people to labor. Without delay, most decided efforts should be made to educate and train colored men and women to labor as missionaries. We must provide means for the education and training of Christian colored students in the Southern States, who, being accustomed to the climate, can work there without endangering their lives. Promising young men and young women should be educated as teachers. They should have the very best advantages. Those who make the fear of the Lord the beginning of wisdom, and give heed to the counsel of men of experience, can be a blessing by carrying to their own people the light of present truth. Every worker who labors in humility and in harmony with his brethren, will be a channel of light to many who are now in the darkness of ignorance and superstition.",
