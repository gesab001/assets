    "word": "Often an exorbitant price is charged for small services, because physicians are supposed to charge according to the charges of the worldly physicians. My teacher said, \"The institution that shall depend upon God and receive His cooperation must ever work according to the principles of the law of God. To charge a large sum for a few moments' work is not just and right. Physicians who are under the discipline of the greatest Physician the world ever knew must let the principles of the gospel regulate every fee. Let mercy and the love of God be written on every dollar received.\" When our sanitariums are conducted as they should be, a large medical missionary work will be done. Every worker will do his work with such exactitude that he will shine as a light in the world.",
