    "word": "Message after message has been given me for parents who thus neglect their family responsibilities. We are instructed to teach our children line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little, teaching them to live as in the presence of God, showing them the requirements of God's Word, and explaining to them their duty concerning them. If your children are disobedient, they should be corrected. But do not punish in anger. Before correcting them, go by yourself, and ask the Lord to soften and subdue the hearts of your children, and to give you wisdom in dealing with them. Never in a single instance have I known this method to fail.",
