    "word": "There are church members who have been quick to catch up unkind suppositions and to speak disparagingly of the teacher before other church members and even in the presence of the children. Some have talked freely and bitterly concerning a teacher without clearly understanding the difficulty of which they were speaking. This should not be. The one who thinks that a teacher has done wrong should follow the directions given in the word: \"If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.\" Matthew 18:15. Until this has been done, no one is justified in telling others of a brother's mistakes.",
