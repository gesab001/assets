After much prayer and frequent consultation together, act in accordance with the best judgment of all. Let each worker sustain the other. Do not fail or become discouraged. Keep your perceptive faculties keen and clear by learning constantly of Christ, the Teacher who cannot err.\" [REVIEW AND HERALD, AUG. 11, 1903.] \n                                                                           393",
