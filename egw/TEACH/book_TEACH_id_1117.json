    "word": "It is the privilege of every soul to make advancement. Those who are connected with Christ will grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Son of God, to the full stature of men and women. If all who claim to believe the truth had made the most of their ability and opportunities to learn and to do, they would have become strong in Christ. Whatever their occupation,--whether they were farmers, mechanics, teachers, or pastors,--if they had wholly consecrated themselves to God, they would have become efficient workers for the heavenly Master.--Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 423.",
