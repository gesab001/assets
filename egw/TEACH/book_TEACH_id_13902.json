    "word": "I beseech you to take Christ with you as you go to your churches. \"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears.\" Many are unwilling to have their way crossed. Now, it is not by following your own way that you will enter heaven; it is by choosing God's way. Will you take it? It is not your spirit that is going into heaven; it is Christ's spirit. Will you have it? Jesus says, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\" Then I ask, How is it that so many of you are saying you do not know whether you are accepted of God or not; that you want to find Jesus? Don't you know whether you have opened the door? Don't you know whether you have invited him in? If you have not, invite him now. Don't wait a moment, Open the door, and let Jesus in.",
