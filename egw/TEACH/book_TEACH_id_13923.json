    "word": "There are many in the ministry who have no love for God or for their fellow men. They are asleep, and while they sleep Satan is sowing his tares. The flock of God is in need of help from heaven, and the sheep and lambs are perishing for food. But let those who would have a deep and living experience in the things of God cease to depend upon men, even upon their own pastors and teachers, and put their trust wholly in God, using their God-given ability to His glory. Christ is to be lifted up before the people; for by beholding Him we are to become changed to His image. Jesus says, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" He has made ample atonement, and he who lays hold upon Christ by faith has peace with God. The Holy Spirit purifies the heart, presenting God in new and enduring views as our heavenly Father.",
