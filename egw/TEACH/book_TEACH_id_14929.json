    "word": "God's Word is true philosophy, true science. Human opinions and sensational preaching amount to very little. These who are imbued with the Word of God can teach it in the same simple way in which Christ taught it. Too much depends upon the opening of the Scriptures to those in darkness, for us to use one word that can not be readily understood. With all their learning many of those who claim to teach the higher education do not know what they are talking about. The highest education is that which he made so plain as to be understood by the common people. The greatest Teacher the world ever knew used the simplest language and the plainest symbols.",
