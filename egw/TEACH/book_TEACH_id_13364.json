    "word": "\"And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned [though he be ever so active,] except he strive lawfully.\" These words are appropriate.

They did not take a humble position before God, to learn before attempting to teach. They needed an experience different from what they received. \"The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits\" [2 Timothy 2:6]. They had not been partakers of the fruit, the grace of God, which is the essential element in all service, and they are not placed in positions of trust because they have not given evidence by the quality of the fruit borne, that the tree is good.",
