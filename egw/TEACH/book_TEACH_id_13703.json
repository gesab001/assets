    "word": "I have a decided interest in every school in our land; and I greatly desire that the work which should be done in all these schools shall not be centered in one place that is already congested. Every school is to have the best teachers that can be obtained, so that the work done will be thorough. Both teachers and students are to rise as high as they can in and through Christ. The religion of Jesus Christ lies at the foundation of all true education.",
