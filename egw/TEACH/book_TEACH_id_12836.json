    "word": "In an assembly where the school question was being discussed, the question was asked, Why has not appropriate matter for reading and lesson books been selected and compiled? Why has not the Word of God been extolled above every human production? Have you thought that a better knowledge of what-saith-the-Lord would have a deleterious effect on teachers and students? There was a hush in the assembly, and self-conviction came upon students and teachers. Men who had considered themselves wise and strong saw that they were weak and lacking in the knowledge of that Book which concerns the eternal destiny of the human soul.",
