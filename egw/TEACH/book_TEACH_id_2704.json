    "word": "Just in proportion as the true missionary spirit is brought into the education and training of young men and young women, will they be blessed. The students should begin to work in missionary lines where there are those with whom they can communicate to learn how to work. As they do this, they advance, and their intellect grows. They are learning how to work when the school term is ended. As they approach those who are interested, they work under the greatest Teacher the world has ever known. It is as essential that\n90\nthey should know how to communicate as that they should receive a knowledge of the truth. The practice of telling others about Christ, of reading and explaining His Word, will stamp that Word on the mind, and will make the truth their own.",
