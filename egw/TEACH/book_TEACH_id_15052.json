    "word": "\"The Lord saith, While your leaders promise you liberty, they themselves are the servants of sin, and have been for a long time. Place no man's yoke on your neck. You are this day working counter to God. From the teachings of God or of Jesus his son you have not received the sentiments that you now entertain. The garden of your heart is being sown with tares; your faith is being weakened. You \n\n\n                                     -332- \n\nhave turned from the path of truth; but the steps that you have already taken can now be retraced, if you will realize that you have been turning aside into a false path.\"",
