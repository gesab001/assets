    "word": "There is another kind of education that is very different. Its fundamental principle, as stated by the greatest Teacher the world has ever known, is, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.\" Its aim is not selfish; it is to honor God, and to serve him in the world. Both the studies pursued and the industrial training have this object in view. The word of God is studied; a vital connection with God is maintained, and the better feelings and traits of character are brought into exercise. This kind of education produces results as lasting as eternity. For \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,\" and better than all other knowledge is an understanding of his word.",
