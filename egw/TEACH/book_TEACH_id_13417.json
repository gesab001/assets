    "word": "I have confidence that the teachers in the Berrien Springs school are servants of Jesus Christ--humble men who are seeking most earnestly to glorify God. Take your place with them as a learner. Christ says, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest \n\n\n                                     -73- \n\nunto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\"",
