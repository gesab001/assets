    "word": "ELDER C. L. TAYLOR: BROTHER WHITE, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT, SO FAR AS OUR POSITION IS CONCERNED. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ANY RIGHT TO BAR OUT ANY CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE TESTIMONY HAS SAID SO. WE HAVE NEVER TALKED FOR A MOMENT THAT WE SHOULD KEEP THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO YOUNG. WE HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY, \"IF YOUR CHILDREN WANT TO COME TO THE SCHOOL, SEND THEM.\" BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHERE THE PARENTS ARE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN EIGHT OR TEN YEARS OF AGE, WE HAVE FELT THEY OUGHT TO DO IT, AND NOT TO MAKE THAT A RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO WHEN THERE IS A MATTER OF EXPENSE--EXTRA EXPENSE--INVOLVED. NOW THAT IS THE ONLY QUESTION. WE ARE NOT HOLDING TO A RULE SAYING THAT NO CHILDREN EXCEPTING THOSE OF CERTAIN AGES SHOULD COME TO SCHOOL: BUT RATHER, WE SAY THAT THOSE WHO CAN EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME, OUGHT TO DO IT, RATHER THAN TO SEND THEM TO THE CHURCH SCHOOL WHEN WE ARE SO HARD PRESSED FOR MEANS AND WOULD HAVE TO HIRE ANOTHER TEACHER.",
