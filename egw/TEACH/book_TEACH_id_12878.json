    "word": "Paul writes, \"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom: Preach the Word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables\" [2 Timothy 4:1-4]. That time has come. I present the word of warning: \"Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry\" [verse 5].",
