    "word": "From time to time reports come to me concerning statements that Sister White is said to have made but which are entirely new to me, and which cannot fail to mislead the people as to my real views and teaching. A sister, in a letter to her friends, speaks with much enthusiasm of a statement by Brother Jones that Sister White has seen that the time has come when, if we hold the right relation to God, all can have the gift of prophecy to the same extent as do those who are now having visions. Where is the authority for this statement? I must believe \n\n\n                                     -188- \n\nthat the sister failed to understand Brother Jones, for I cannot think that he made the statement. The writer continues: \"Brother Jones said last night that is the case, not that God will speak to all for the benefit of everyone else, but to each for his own benefit, and this will fulfill the prophecy of Joel.\" He stated that this is already being developed in numerous instances. He spoke as if he thought none would hold such a leading position as Sister White had done and will still do. Referred to Moses as a parallel. He was a leader, but many others are referred to as prophesying, though their prophecies are not published. He (Brother Jones) will not give permission to have the matter copied for general circulation that has been read here from some sister. . . .",
