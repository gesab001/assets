    "word": "God impresses different men to be laborers together with Him. One man is not authorized to gather too many responsibilities upon himself. The Lord would have the physician, upon whom so much depends, so closely connected with Him that his spirit will not be stirred by little items which common sense would teach people how to deal with. The Lord desires Dr. Kellogg to be one of the most efficient workers in the medical profession, slighting nothing, knowing that he has a Counsellor close by his side to sustain to strengthen, to impart a quietness a calm to the soul. Feverishness of spirit and uncertainty  will make the hand unskillful. The touch of Christ upon the physician's hand brings vitality, steadiness, restfulness, and confidence, and power.",
