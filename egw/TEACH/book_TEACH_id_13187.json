    "word": "It is not best for you to use your gifts in teaching, in molding and fashioning the characters of children, because you have not the patience or longsuffering necessary to deal with children or youth, who are to be treated as the younger members of the Lord's family. Your temperament forbids your dealing with children. They are sometimes provoking, and there is cruelty in your manner of administering punishment. You show severity which grieves the Holy Spirit and greatly injures your own soul. But when you are converted, decidedly changed in character, there is a field of labor for you in sanitarium work. In this work you will forget yourself. If you will turn your attention from self to Christ, you can use your capabilities to good purpose. It is not too late for you to repent and be converted. Up then, and be doing! The Master calls for you to work the works of righteousness. \n\n\n                                    -269-",
