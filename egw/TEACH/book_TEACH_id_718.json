    "word": "When David was bidden to choose the punishment for his sin, he said, \u201cLet us fall now into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.\u201d He felt that God knew the struggle and anguish of the soul. When people are enabled to catch a glimpse of the character of God, they see not in Him the heartless, vindictive spirit manifested by human agents; they see that affliction and trial are God\u2019s appointed means of disciplining His children, and teaching them His way, that they may lay hold of His grace. . . . As poor backsliding souls are led to the river of God\u2019s love, they exclaim, When He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold purified. Suffering souls are made patient, trustful, triumphant in God under adverse circumstances. . . .",
