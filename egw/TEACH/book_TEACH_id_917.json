    "word": "To maintain proper discipline, and yet exercise pitying love and tenderness for the souls of those under his care, the teacher needs a constant supply of the wisdom and grace of God. Order must be maintained. But those who love souls, the purchase of the blood of Christ, should do their utmost to save the erring. These poor, sinful ones are too frequently left in darkness and deception to pursue their own course, and those who should help them let them alone to go to ruin.",
