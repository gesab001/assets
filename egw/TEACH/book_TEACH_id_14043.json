    "word": "\"The teaching of every true ambassador for Christ is a most solemn, serious matter now. We are engaged in a warfare which will never close until the final decision is made for all eternity. Let every disciple of Christ be reminded that \"we fight not against flesh and blood; but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\" O, there are eternal interests involved in this conflict, there must be no surface work, no cheap experience, to meet this issue. 'The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:....whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.' \n\n\n                                   - 35 -",
