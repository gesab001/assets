    "word": "God designs that our knowledge of the truth shall be to men a savor of life unto life. The highest employment of the powers of speech is that of imparting divine truth. Wherever the audience may be, whoever may compose that audience, Christ's witness is to speak the plain, unvarnished truth. He is to minister grace to his hearers. His words will be in harmony with the teaching of Christ. The soul who is truly converted will have his lips touched with the sacred fire of cleansing. To every individual he meets he will find an opportunity of speaking the good news of salvation. He believes; therefore he utters the sentiments of his heart. He stands as the oracle of God, speaking to men the words of life and salvation. No one will mistake his position; no one will doubt on which side he stands. He stands as Christ's witness, consecrated, set apart, to declare to others the character of the Redeemer.",
