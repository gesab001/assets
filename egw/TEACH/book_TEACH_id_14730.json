    "word": "The Lord discerns that a change for the better must be made in the Huntsville School. Every teacher, whether a man or a woman, should be an apt scholar, capable of grasping advanced ideas and putting them into practice. The teacher is ever to be a learner. By his example of industry in seeking to advance in learning, and by his untiring efforts to develop a Christian character, he is constantly to strive to lead his students to higher attainments.",
