    "word": "I feel deeply, feel that we have erred in not manifesting greater love, forbearance, and pity for others. \"The diseased have ye not strengthened\" (Ezekiel 34:4), is the reproof given to unfaithful shepherds. Our feelings must not be a ruling power. We must walk in all humility of mind. The Lord loves His servants who are unselfishly engaged in the saving of souls. He will as readily guide them in judgment and teach them His will as He will teach us. We must believe that Jesus stands at the helm. He will be captain, and we may trust His own work in His all-powerful hands.",
