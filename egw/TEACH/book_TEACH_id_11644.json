    "word": "While there is, so great a deficiency among parents in the education of their children, they are not prepared to see the necessity of the thorough manner of Bro. Bell's teaching. It is true his style of teaching is in marked contrast with the generality of teachers. But it is this kind of teaching that is needed, that will give stability to the character. The lack on the part of some of the parents to sustain Bro. Bell made his work doubly hard. \n                                                                           8\nTheir neglect to govern their children at home had an influence upon them to lead them to decide that Bro. Bell was too particular, and unnecessarily exacting. In some instances the parents counteracted the earnest efforts of Bro. Bell by their sympathizing with their children. The children, who were having the very discipline they needed, understood that their parents questioned the course of Bro. Bell, and this led the children to take liberties that they otherwise would not. Had their parents united their efforts fully with the teacher of their children, great good would have been the result. These mistakes on the part of the parents depressed Bro. Bell's spirits, and his influence was not what it might have been if he had known that he had the co-operation of all the parents in his labors.",
