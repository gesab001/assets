    "word": "The condition of the Industrial School established for the training of Christian workers at Huntsville, Ala., appealed strongly to my sympathies. The large farm of three hundred and sixty acres, purchased by the General Conference as a home for this institution, will, with intelligent cultivation, meet a considerable portion of the running expenses of the school. But the buildings have been inadequate for the work that should be done. The teachers and students have very few schoolroom appliances. In the students\u2019 home and on the farm there have been very few suitable facilities. Some new buildings must be erected and furnished. Good bathrooms are greatly needed. In connection with this school, students are to be trained for the medical missionary work.",
