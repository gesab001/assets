    "word": "The lesson which Christ gave to Nicodemus is important to every teacher, to every Sabbath-school worker, to every youth and child. It is certainly important that we become acquainted with the reasons of our faith, but the most important knowledge to be gained is the experimental knowledge of what it means to be born again. The great want in our Sabbath-school work is the want of the light of life. All through our ranks are needed men and women who have learned at the feet of Jesus what is truth, and how to present it to others. It requires holy men, men who have humility, who are abiding in Christ, to be educators of our youth in the Sabbath-school.",
