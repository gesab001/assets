    "word": "The Bible\n     It is the privilege and the duty of all to closely investigate the doctrine presented to them before they receive it. And the most effectual way to find access to those whom we wish to educate in the truth, is to have them bring their Bibles, and point them to the chapter and verse, that they may see for themselves that these things are so. The people are so utterly deceived in regard to what the Bible does teach, that they will say, \u201cIt does not read so in my Bible.\u201d But ask them to bring their Bibles and show them the very chapter and verse you wish to impress upon their minds, and they will be surprised at the plain statements of revealed truth which they read out of their own Bibles.",
