    "word": "Just as soon as Christ began to preach, He began to gather disciples, who were to hear all His words, and learn of Him, the great Teacher, and, afterward, preach the gospel. These disciples, supposed to be ignorant fishermen, were not to become teachers after the manner of the Jewish educators. They were to be Christ's witnesses, bearing to the world his truth, unmingled with the traditions and sophistries of men. By practicing His virtues, by walking and working with Him, they were to be qualified to be His representatives.",
