    "word": "Jesus said, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her\" [John 8:7]. Then He continued to trace the peculiar secret sins of the individual accusers. One after another discerned the fact that Jesus knew the sin that the sinner had thought was hidden so deep that it would not be discovered. Conscious of guilt, they left the trembling woman alone with Jesus. Jesus turned and looked upon the woman and inquired, \"Hath no man condemned thee?\" She answered, \"No man, Lord. Then Jesus said to her, \"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more\" [verses 10, 11]. Let those who name the name of Jesus take heed to the new commandment which Jesus has given to His disciples. He says, \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love \n\n\n                                  -278- \n\none another. By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another\" [John 13:34, 35]. Let the teachings of Jesus have the weight that they deserve. Let us not be simply hearers of the Word, but doers also.",
