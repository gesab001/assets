    "word": "I HAVE WISHED A GOOD MANY TIMES THAT IN OUR SCHOOL HERE WE MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER DEPARTMENT, NOT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE THE SCHOOL COULD BE IMPROVED, BUT BECAUSE I HAVE LONGED SO MUCH FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE MORE TIME TO SOLVING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT ARE PERPLEXING THE MINDS OF ALL OUR TEACHERS. I FEEL SURE THAT I COULD BE A HELP IN SOME LINES MORE THAN I AM NOW, IF I WERE FREER TO WORK OUT SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS. IF THE PROBLEMS WERE SOLVED PROBLEMS, IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE HALF THE ENERGY TO EXECUTE THE WORK. BUT SO MANY OF OUR PROBLEMS ARE UNSOLVED PROBLEMS. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN OVER THE GROUND, AND WE ARE GOING OVER A NEW ROAD. WE HAVE TO CUT OUR WAY EVERY STEP, AND TO DO SO TAKES MORE TIME AND ENERGY AND THOUGHT THAN IT WILL WHEN WE HAVE BEEN OVER IT ONCE, AND CAN GO OVER IT AGAIN. I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME OF OUR PEOPLE FEEL THAT WE SHOULD HANDLE SO MUCH, BECAUSE OTHER TEACHERS DO, \n\n\n                                    -372- \n\nAND BECAUSE TEACHERS IN UNGRADED SCHOOLS IN THE PAST HAVE HANDLED ALL THE WAY FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS, AND THEY LEARNED A GOOD DEAL, TOO. BUT WE HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM ALTOGETHER TO SOLVE. IT IS ANOTHER QUESTION TO MANAGE.",
