    "word": "We need to have the temperance question revived among our own people. It would be a good thing if at our campmeetings we should invite the members of the W.C.T.U. to take part in our exercises. This will help them to become acquainted with the reasons of our faith, and will open the way for us to unite with them in temperance work. If we will do this, we will come to see that the temperance question means more than many of us have supposed. And we in turn can teach these workers many things. They will hear the truth, and many will be converted to the faith.",
