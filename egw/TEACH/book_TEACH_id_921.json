    "word": "It is a terrible fact, and one which should make the hearts of parents tremble, that the colleges to which the youth of our day are sent for the cultivation of the mind, endanger their morals. As innocent youth, when placed with hardened criminals, learn lessons of crime they never before dreamed of, so pure-minded young people, through association with college companions of corrupt habits, lose their purity of character, and become vicious and debased. Parents should awake to their responsibilities, and understand what they are doing in sending their children from home to colleges where they can expect nothing else but that they will become demoralized. The College at Battle Creek should stand higher in moral tone than any other college in the land, that the safety of the children intrusted to her keeping may not be endangered. If the teachers do their work in the fear of God, working with the Spirit of Christ for the salvation of the souls of the students, God will crown their efforts with success. God-fearing parents will be more concerned in regard to the characters their children bring home with them from college, than in regard to the success and advancement made in their studies. \n                                                                           32",
