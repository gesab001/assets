    "word": "Christ, the great Medical Missionary, is our example. Of Him it is written, that \"He went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and diseases among the people.\" He healed the sick, and preached the gospel. In His service, healing and teaching were linked closely together. Today they are not to be separated.",
