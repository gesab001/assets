    "word": "Never should a worker encourage one who is in need of instruction and help to go first to human agencies for an understanding of his duty. . . . It is a wrong education to teach our people to lean on human aids, instead of going to the Lord in prayer. The enemy of souls has been the instigator of this, that minds might become obscured. . . . Those who bear responsibilities in the work are to cooperate with heavenly angels in teaching men and women to look to God as the source of their strength. . . .",
