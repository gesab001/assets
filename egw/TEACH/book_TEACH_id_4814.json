    "word": "The teachers in the State Church are looked up to by the people as unquestionable authority in matters of religion. They appear upon the street in a long clerical robe reaching to their feet, with a stiff, quilled ruffle of white linen, nearly a quarter of a yard in width, about the neck. As they pass, men take off their hats and make a low obeisance, and women courtesy, with an air of the greatest reverence. As I saw them, I could not but think of the words of Christ,\u2014and the words apply to these priests as truly as to the ancient rabbis,\u2014\u201cAll their works they do for to be seen of men; they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.\u201d",
