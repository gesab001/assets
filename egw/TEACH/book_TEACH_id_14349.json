    "word": "It is not necessary that our medical missionaries follow the precise track marked out by medical men of the world. They \n\n\n                              -544- \n\ndo not need to administer drugs to the sick. They do not need to follow the drug medication in order to have influence in their work. The message was given me that if they would consecrate themselves to the Lord, if they would seek to obtain under men ordained of God, a thorough knowledge of their work, the Lord would make (901) them skillful. Connected with the divine Teacher, they will understand that their dependence is upon God and not upon the professedly wise men of the world.",
