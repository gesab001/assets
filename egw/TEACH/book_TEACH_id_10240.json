    "word": "John the Baptist \n\n     Pure, Native Eloquence--The voice of John was lifted up like a trumpet. His commission was, \"Show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\" Isaiah 58:1. He had obtained no human scholarship. God and nature had been his teachers. But one was needed to prepare the way before Christ who was bold enough to make his voice heard like the prophets of old, summoning the degenerate nation to repentance.",
