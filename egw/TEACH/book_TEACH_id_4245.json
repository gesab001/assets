    "word": "Diverting Minds From Present Duty \n\n     The enemy is seeking to divert the minds of our brethren and sisters from the work of preparing a people to stand in these last days. His sophistries are designed to lead minds away from the perils and duties of the hour. They estimate as of little value the light that Christ came from heaven to give to John for His people. They teach that the scenes just before us are not of sufficient importance to receive special attention. They make of no effect the truth of heavenly origin, and rob the people of God of their past experience, giving them instead a false science. \"Thus saith the Lord: Stand ye in the ways, and \n                                                                           307\nsee, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein.\" [Jeremiah 6:16.]",
