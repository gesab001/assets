    "word": "Faith in Jesus Christ's righteousness in the behalf of every individual soul should be held before the people for their study and for them to contemplate thoroughly. This theme cannot be dwelt upon too often and too earnestly. The people are suffering for the gospel of Christ. The mind and heart need to be informed and educated to believe in Christ. Truth must be communicated and through patient, painstaking effort the people must learn to take advanced steps in faith. All who have teachable minds, all who are unprejudiced, will see the simplicity of faith in Jesus Christ. \n                                                                           282",
