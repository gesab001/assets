    "word": "WHAT TO PRAY FOR DAILY.\u2014We are to look upon every duty, however humble, as sacred because it is a part of God\u2019s service. Our daily prayer should be, \u201cLord, help me to do my best. Teach me how to do better work. Give me energy and cheerfulness. Help me to bring into my service the loving ministry of the Saviour.\u201d(Ministry of Healing, 474.)",
