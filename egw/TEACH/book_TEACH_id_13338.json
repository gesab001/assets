    "word": "You may have inducements of a temporal nature placed before you. You have had this experience before, and you know what the outcome has been.

Do not hesitate to consult us in regard to any plans you may have. Serious times, I know, are before us, and my work must erelong be closed. While mind and strength are yet granted me, I desire to do all that the Lord has given me to do.",
