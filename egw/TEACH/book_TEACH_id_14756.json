    "word": "The Lord discerns that there must be a change for the better. A teacher is always to be apt to learn, grasping every idea of advance because he needs knowledge that he may obtain that correct development of character which constantly leads to higher attainments. All who are educators in our schools are themselves to be ever learning of the great Teacher who is seeking to draw their attention to Himself, that they shall be complete in Christ Jesus, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.",
