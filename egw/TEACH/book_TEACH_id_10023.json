    "word": "In the councils of heaven it was decided that the mother of the Redeemer should be a pure, pious virgin, though poor as far as earthly riches were concerned. The despised village of Nazareth was chosen as His home. Joseph, His earthly father, was a carpenter, and He who had given direction that every youth in Israel should learn a trade, learned Himself the trade of a carpenter. None need be ashamed of honest poverty. For thirty years Christ was subject to His parents, and by the labor of His hands He helped to sustain the family. Thus He would teach that labor is not a degradation, but an honor, and that it is every man's duty to engage in useful, honorable work. . . .",
