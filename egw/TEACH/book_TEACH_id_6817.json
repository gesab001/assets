    "word": "Meet the Danger Positively.--Satan will continue to bring in his erroneous theories and to claim that his sentiments are true. Seducing spirits are at work. I am to meet the danger positively, denying the right of anyone to use my writings to serve the devil's purpose to allure and deceive the people of God. [ADVOCATES OF PANTHEISTIC TEACHINGS USED E. G. WHITE WRITINGS TO BOLSTER THEIR ERRONEOUS VIEWS.] God has spared my life that I may present the testimonies given me, to vindicate \n                                                                           74\nthat which God vindicates, and to denounce every vestige of Satan's sophistry. One thing will follow another in spiritual sophistry, to deceive if possible the very elect.--Manuscript 126, 1905.",
