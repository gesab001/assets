    "word": "Bina Jones could fill a higher position in the Institute, if she had more control over her words and deportment. If she had better control of her spirit, she could exert a much better influence. She is not always respectful as she should be to the patients, and sometimes speaks in a manner that irritates. This is highly censurable in her. \n                                                                           27\nShe needs a humble mind, a meek and quiet spirit. She is in danger of selfishness, and of not rendering respect and honor to whom honor is due. It is religion, good, genuine religion, that Bina needs, and a teachable spirit, willing to be guided by others' judgment. She has good capabilities, if they were properly directed, and brought into use.",
