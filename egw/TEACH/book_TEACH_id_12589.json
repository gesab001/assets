A work is to be done that is to open the way for the advancement of the truth, and that will increase the faith of souls. The world is the Lord's vineyard, but He has been strangely shut out. Now He requires that the vineyard receive special attention. The work we are called to do in giving the light is expressed in the words of the Saviour's commission: \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:18-20).",
