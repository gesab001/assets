    "word": "Just as soon as men begin to learn, Christ, the Educator, is by their side. If they desire Him to mold the mind and instill His principles into the soul, they will be educated to understand that their talents are entrusted of God for the upbuilding of His kingdom in the world. The minds of S.D.A. ministers are but half trained. The natural disposition, the untrained, uneducated intellect, cannot represent the sublime truths for this time. The closing scenes of this world's history are not to present to the world as educators a set of novices whose frivolous lives and characters reveal that they have not yet learned the first principles of divine truth. Even our present low standard is not reached by ministers who profess to be teaching the truth, and many [listeners] are disappointed. \n\n\n                                     -247- \n\n\"Know ye not your own selves, [brethren], how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates\" [2 Corinthians 13:5].",
