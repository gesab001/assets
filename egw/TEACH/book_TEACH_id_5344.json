    "word": "The physician should be a man of pure mind. If his principles are uncorrupted, he will exert a telling influence in favor of the right. Physicians need to be constantly imbued with the Spirit of Christ, learning lessons from Him, the greatest Teacher the world ever knew; then they will be pure in thought, in mind, in action. They will give no hint in word or manner that will lead them to impure thoughts.",
