    "word": "In new places where schools are being set in operation, arrange to have a treatment-room or rooms connected with the school. Let this place be outside the main school building, so that the sick will be where it is quiet. Let those who are qualifying to teach, give lessons on treating the sick. Soon much permanent fruit will be gathered, in physical improvement and in spiritual advancement, which, combined will be of great advantage.--Unpub. MS. (D. 190'03).",
