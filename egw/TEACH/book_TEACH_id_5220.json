    "word": "Faithful men, who were obedient to the promptings of God's Spirit and the teachings of His word, were to proclaim this warning to the world. They were those who had taken heed to the \"sure word of prophecy,\" the \"light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise.\" 2 Peter 1:19. They had been seeking the knowledge of God more than all hid treasures, counting it \"better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.\" Proverbs 3:14. And the Lord revealed to them the great things of the kingdom. \"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.\" Psalm 25:14.",
