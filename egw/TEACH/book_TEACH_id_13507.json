    "word": "Our only safety is in walking circumspectly before God. Perilous times are before us. We are to make every effort to stand in the counsel of God and not in our own wisdom. Let the simple doctrines of the Word shine forth in their true bearing, and let them be urged home according to their relative importance. Let us teach only the truth of heavenly origin. Things new and old are connected through the Holy Spirit's guidance when the truth is taught as it is in Jesus, without obscurity, without compromise, without fear, without losing sight of the cross as the great center of all truth. A sanctified presentation of the message for this time, the Holy Spirit will make effective unto the saving of the souls of the hearers.",
