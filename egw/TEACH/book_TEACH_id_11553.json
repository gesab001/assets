Talk faith, pray in faith, and go forward. Those who have ever been walking in unbelief will throw their past experiences and knowledge as stumbling-blocks in your way. But in the work, it is written, you have the staff that you should take. There is much to be done. You now need to educate, educate, educate. Let no one take away your needed facilities. Have you a printing outfit? This you must have, if you do not have it; for you will want to do much of your own printing, issuing the books and other publications which you need in your work. You need the very best educator to teach type-setting and presswork to the students, giving them the education essential for this class of work.\"",
