IT IS MY CONVICTION THAT THOSE WHO WRITE FOR OUR DENOMINATIONAL PAPERS REGARDING PROPHECY AND ITS FULFILLMENT OUGHT TO BE ENCOURAGED TO GIVE DEEP AND FAITHFUL STUDY TO THE SUBJECTS ABOUT WHICH THEY WRITE, AND TO USE IN THEIR ARGUMENTS REFERENCES AND QUOTATIONS FROM THOSE HISTORIANS WHICH WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE READERS AS AUTHORITY.",
