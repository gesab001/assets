    "word": "The excuse is made, \"It is my habit; it is my way, and I cannot overcome it.\" Will my brethren take heed how they use the organs of speech in the ministration of the Word?

His followers are to make strenuous efforts to overcome their habits of long, loud speaking. This greatly injures the melody of the human voice. \n                                                                           202",
