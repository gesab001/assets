    "word": "But those who fear and reverence God meet this Heaven-daring assumption as Christ met the solicitations of the wily foe: \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\" [Luke 4:8.] God has never given a hint in his word that he has appointed any man to be the head of the church. The doctrine of papal supremacy is directly opposed to the teachings of the Scriptures. The pope can have no power over Christ's church except by usurpation.",
