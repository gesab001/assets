    "word": "I was shown that in consequence of temptations you could not lift up \"holy hands, without wrath and doubting\" [1 Timothy 2:8]. Your thoughts and actions crippled your endeavors; your earthliness and sensual thoughts dwarfed your spiritual growth. You are far from being the man God would have you to be, and you fail to qualify yourself for the work you might do because your thoughts are not pure but tainted and corrupt. Some things were shown me that are open to the eye that never slumbers or sleeps. This is written in the books of heaven, and in a little time your case will be decided, whether your name shall be blotted out from the book of life or not. It certainly will be [blotted out] unless you are a converted man, and humble your soul before God and confess your sins and turn unto the Lord with your whole heart, and purge from you every impure thought and corrupt action. Says the True Witness, \"I know thy works.\" Do not attempt to teach the people until you are a changed man; until you have in humble penitence sought the Lord with true contrition of soul and have a new heart.",
