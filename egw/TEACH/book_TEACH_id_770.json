    "word": "It is never safe to be indifferent to light. If professedly great and good people do not obey the law of God, is it any reason we should transgress? . . . It was the scribes, the rulers, the priests, men in holy office, men who believed their righteousness was above the whole world, who persecuted Christ. These pious pretenders were the fiercest persecutors Jesus had. . . .It was the teachers of the people that mocked Him while He hung upon the cross.",
