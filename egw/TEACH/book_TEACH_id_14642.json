    "word": "(Copy for Elder O. A. Olsen) \n          Brighton, Victoria, Australia, January 13, 1894 \n\nDear Brethren in Responsible Positions in the Review and Herald Office: \n\n\n     I am much pleased that you have restored Henry Kellogg to his old position, who I trust is born again, not of the flesh but of the Spirit of God. I greatly feared that his long separation from the work would disqualify him to stand in the position he is now occupying; but if the Lord has indeed accepted him, and I know he is \n                                                                           390\nalways ready to accept any soul who will return from his wanderings and accept of Jesus Christ, he will be qualified to do the work to which God has called him. The arms of Jesus are open to accept him, and he is willing to bless and to teach him. He will realize the force of the word that Christ spoke to Joshua, the high priest, \"And the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying Thus saith the Lord of Hosts; for if thou wilt keep my charge, (the Lord has in his messages shown what this charge is) then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.",
