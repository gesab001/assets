    "word": "It is God's plan to work through His instrumentalities, His chosen earthen vessels, and men are honoured when He places them as His appointed messengers. The work of preaching the Word, presenting Christ crucified as the world's Redeemer, bears the divine credentials, and proof of its sacred character is given in the conversion of souls. It is not the large buildings erected for show that give character to the work, but the winning of souls to Christ. This seals the teacher as a living oracle, as Christ's apostle. This will demonstrate that the work we are doing is of God. \u201cBy their fruits,\u201d Christ said, \u201cye shall know them.\u201d",
