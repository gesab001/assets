    "word": "Sometimes it is found that the school has been established in a church where the disorderly element among the children make the work very hard. The children who have not received proper training in the home will cause much trouble in the school, and by their perversity will make the heart of the teacher sad. But let not the teacher become discouraged. Test and trial bring experience. If the children and disobedient and unruly, there is all the more need of strenuous effort. The fact that there are children with such characters is one of the reasons why church schools should be established. The children that parents have neglected to educate and discipline aright must be saved.",
