    "word": "Mrs. White lived to see her desires fulfilled with regard to much that she had planned on doing. Her work on \"Education\" was completed in 1903; \"Testimonies for the Church,\" Volume 8, in 1904; and \"Ministry of Healing\" in 1905. Many \"Special Testimonies\" were prepared for circulation in pamphlet and leaflet form; and in 1909 \"Testimonies for the Church,\" Volume 9, the last of the series, was published. By the close of 1910 Mrs. White had given full consideration to all the problems connected with the reset edition of \"Great Controversy.\" That task having been completed, she found time to supervise the revision of \"Sketches from the Life of Paul,\" and to add several chapters on the life work and the writings of the apostles of the early Christian church. This matter was published in 1911, under the title, \"The Acts of the Apostles.\" The next volume to appear was \"Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students \n                                                                           435\nRegarding Christian Education,\" in 1913; and immediately afterward Mrs. White began the reading of manuscripts that were forwarded to the printers in 1914 for the new edition of \"Gospel Workers.\"",
