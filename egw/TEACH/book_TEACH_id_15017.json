    "word": "It is the Saviour's desire that unity and love and Christian fellowship shall prevail among His followers. The lesson that He gave his disciples in the fifth chapter of Matthew is the lesson that his disciples today are to spend their time in learning. Condemnation must follow a failure to learn this lesson. God can not cooperate with those who do not obey His teaching, who look upon their own way as better than His. The example of such ones is directly contrary to the lessons that God has given to aid His people in the formation of Christlike characters.",
