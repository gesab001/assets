    "word": "Let men and women who have a burden to produce books, work to bless the cause of God by the use of their pens. Let them work, and if they have an income from their work, let them make use of that income to do their part in uplifting the standard of truth where God shall direct. Let them seek counsel from God. Let them believe the promise of Christ that He will send the Comforter to teach them all things and bring all things to their remembrance. Letter 43, 1899, pp. 1, 2; 11, 12; 17. (To Brethren Irwin, Sisley, Smith, and Jones, March 11, 1899.)",
