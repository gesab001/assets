    "word": "MR No. 1465 - True \"Higher Education\" Is Obtainable Only From the Master Teacher\n\n     (Written August 23, 1898, from \"Sunnyside,\" Cooranbong, Australia, to \"Brethren [Frederick] Griggs and Howe.\") \n\n\n     I have read your articles in the Educator, and am surprised at that which they present. Your minds do not see all things clearly. You see men as trees walking. You grasp and advocate some truth, while in the same article you present that which opposes your own statements. Would it not be best for you to get out of the fogs of your previous education under teachers themselves befogged? This education has not been true and unmingled with error. If I write for the Educator, as I have been and am now doing, my articles would be directly opposed to your human philosophy. Shall there be a yea and nay go forth in the Educator? Or shall I be obliged to issue a paper on true education that will not have in it one thread that will dishonor our heavenly Father?",
