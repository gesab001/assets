    "word": "Deportment\n     The minister should never lose sight of the fact that he is a representative of Christ. He should cultivate grace, courtesy, and refinement of manner. Both in and out of the pulpit he should carry himself with a quiet dignity becoming his elevated calling. Solemnity, a certain godly authority, mingled with meekness, should characterize the demeanor of him who is a teacher of God's truth. Ministers should not make a practice of relating anecdotes that will detract from the force and solemnity of the truth presented. The truth should be clothed in chaste and dignified language; and the illustrations should be of a like character.",
