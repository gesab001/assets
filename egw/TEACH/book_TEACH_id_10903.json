    "word": "There are some who are ready to undertake the most difficult work, and feel competent to do it justice, who have not shown tact and wise discrimination in the simplest duties devolving upon them. This makes Dr. Kellogg afraid to trust them. They are ready to grasp the highest round of the ladder without beginning at the lowest round and climbing as he has done. Dr. Kellogg has gained his scientific knowledge by agonizing effort, and he has devoted many hours to devising, planning and making improvements, while others have been sleeping. He has taxed every power in obtaining an experience, while many would have carried out plans to enjoy themselves. He should not have sacrificed health and strength in order to meet the pressing demands. While these improvements have been going \n\n\n                          -19- \n\nforward, talent has not been brought in to correspond with the enlarging of the Institution to accommodate larger numbers. While the students should be willing to learn of Dr. Kellogg as children, he should feel the affection of a father for the students. He should not become discouraged because they are so slow to learn, and should not discourage them if they make mistakes. We are all mortal and liable to err. He should kindly point out their errors, and they should feel grateful for any instruction he can give them. A haughty spirit should not be countenanced, but all should be willing to learn, and the Doctor willing to teach and educate; so that, should he be called away to recruit his health, or should disease lay him low, there would be those who could work intelligently, and the Sanitarium not become demoralized. It will be difficult for Dr. Kellogg to lay off even a portion of the burden he has so long carried, but health and life and the salvation of his soul require a change. He should now save himself before he is a complete wreck.",
