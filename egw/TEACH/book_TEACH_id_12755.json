    "word": "You need unbending integrity. Unless you are a thoroughly converted woman, you will never enter the city of God. You should deal with the precious souls under your charge with gentleness, with kindly consideration, with affection, with love, for you will then reveal the Christ side of your character instead of the repulsive, satanic side. Practice the highest standard of moral integrity. Show your children that you love them and want them happy. This will be of more value than all of your teachings in reference to religion and truth. Practical godliness goes a great ways in influencing others to come to Christ. You make high claims of godliness while your influence is to corrupt and deceive souls.",
