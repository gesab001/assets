    "word": "Many are strongly convinced of the truth, but either husband or wife prevent their stepping out. How can one who is in fellowship with Christ's sufferings refuse to obey His will and do His work? They know the terms of salvation which are plainly revealed in the Word of God. They listen to the messages which the Lord sends through His delegated servants, but although they assent to the truth, they will not obey. They have not genuine faith to appropriate God's promises to themselves. They do not regard Him as their personal Saviour, in whom they may trust as a child trusts his loving parents. They do not regard God as a loving heavenly Father who has provided for them a perfect Saviour, a never-failing Friend, an infallible Guide and Teacher.",
