    "word": "Ideal instruction in home school\n     The school in the home should be a place where children are taught that the eye of God is upon them, observing all that they do. \n43\nIf this thought were deeply impressed upon the mind, the work of governing children would be made much easier. In the home school our boys and girls are being prepared to attend a church school when they reach a proper age to associate more intimately with other children. Constantly parents should keep this in view, realizing that their children are God's purchased little ones, to be trained for lives of usefulness in the Master's service and for a home in the future, eternal world. The father and the mother, as teachers in the home school, should consecrate hands, tongue, brain, and every power of the being to God, in order that they may fulfill their high and holy mission.",
