    "word": "The teachers in our College should not conform to worldly customs, or adopt worldly principles. The attributes which God prizes most, are charity and purity. These attributes should be cherished by every Christian. \"Every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.\" \"If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.\" \"We shall see him as he is; and every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\"",
