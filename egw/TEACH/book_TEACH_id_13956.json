    "word": "God has made men responsible beings, and placed them in circumstances favorable to obedience to his will. In the dignity of their God-given manhood, they are to be governed and controlled by God himself, not by any human intelligence in our world. Man is ever to acknowledge that God lives and reigns; men are never to become lords over God's heritage. They are to consider that \"all ye are brethren.\" In the very fact that men are free moral agents, God teaches us not to to be forced or compelled into any course of action, also that as responsible beings in co-partnership with God we are to represent God in character. We are to have an interest in our brother, in our neighbor, in all around.",
