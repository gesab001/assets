    "word": "I am now instructed to say, Do your long neglected duty. There is to be no questioning in this matter. Justice, mercy, and the love of God have been so long excluded from the managing force at the heart of the work, that eyes have become blinded and spiritual perceptions perverted. Let not those now on trial in positions of responsibility be unfaithful to the duty which has been made known. His rebuke has come to his people because of their neglect. It is his desire that something shall be done, and done at once. Let not those who are now in positions of trust work contrary to his purpose. Let them take up their work, and help where help is needed. Decide what should be done, and then do it. Let the good work begin at the late Conference, where the Lord was present, teaching line upon line and precept upon precept, be carried forward to a glorious completion.",
