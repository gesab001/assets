{"word": "Nov. 10. I wrote till noon, and after dinner we drove to Bourdon, to fill an appointment to meet with some sisters there. We had a very precious season of prayer, believing Christ's promise that where two or three meet together in His name, He meets with them to bless them. I read some important matter to those present, and talked with them. I labored harder than when I speak on the Sabbath; for I was with them for nearly two hours. It was almost dark when we reached home; but I was blessed of the Lord, and we were happy in His love.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 454}
