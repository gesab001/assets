    "word": "\"Repent, and Do the First Works\" \n\n     Solemn admonitions of warning, manifest in the destruction of dearly cherished facilities for service, say to us: \"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works.\" Revelation 2:5. Why is there so dim a perception of the true spiritual condition of the church? Has not blindness fallen upon the watchmen standing on the walls of Zion? Are not many of God's servants unconcerned and well satisfied, as if the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night rested upon the sanctuary? Are there not those in positions of responsibility, professing to know God, who in life and character deny Him? Are not many of those who count themselves as His chosen, peculiar people satisfied to live without the evidence that of a truth God is among them to save them from Satan's snares and attacks?",
