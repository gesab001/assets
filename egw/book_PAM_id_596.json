{"word": "Purpose\n \n\n     Only those who cooperate with heaven know what true education is.--When the Word of God is laid aside for books that lead away from God, and that confuse the understanding regarding the principles of the kingdom of heaven, the education given is a perversion of the name. Unless the student has pure mental food, thoroughly winnowed from the so-called \"higher education,\" which is mingled with infidel sentiments, he cannot truly know God. Only those who co-operate with heaven in the plan of salvation can know what true education in its simplicity means.--CT 15.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 237}
