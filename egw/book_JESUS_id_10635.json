{"word": "Jesus rebuked His disciples, saying, \"Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them\" (verses 55, 56). John and his fellow disciples were in a school in which Christ was teacher. Those who were ready to see their own defects, and were anxious to improve in character, had ample opportunity. John treasured every lesson and constantly sought to bring his life into harmony with the Divine Pattern. The lessons of Jesus, setting forth meekness, humility, and love as essential to growth in grace, and a fitness for his work, were of the highest value to John. These lessons are addressed to us as individuals and as brethren in the church, as well as to the first disciples of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SL", "page": 59}
