{"word": "With your Bibles you should go before God, and plead with him for an understanding of his word. You want your understanding quickened; you want to know that you know the real principles of the truth; and then when you meet opponents, you will not have to meet them in your own strength. The angel of God will stand right by your side, to help in answering every question that may be asked. But one passionate word will give Satan the advantage, and often wound your own soul and turn others away from the light. You want to be walled in, as it were, with Jesus; and as you hold yourself in this position, it will have a telling influence upon the people. Remember that the work is to present the truth as it is in Jesus, and you will have success. Although many will not hear you, yet there are those who will hear. There are honest inquirers after truth, who are far from being satisfied with the spiritual declension in the churches at the present time, and are hungry for the bread of life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 387}
