{"word": "Peter an example of one who stumbles and is restored.--Some assert that if a soul stumbles and falls, he can never regain his position; but the case before us contradicts this. Before his denial Christ said to Peter, \"When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In committing to his stewardship the souls for whom He had given His life, Christ gave to Peter the strongest evidence of His confidence in his restoration. And he was commissioned to feed not only the sheep, but the lambs--a broader and more delicate work than had hitherto been appointed him. Not only was he to hold forth the Word of life to others, but he was to be a shepherd of the flock.--5BC 1152.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 56}
