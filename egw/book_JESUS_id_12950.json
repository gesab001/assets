His faith was not in vain; for Jesus, before the whole multitude, that flocked about to witness the scene, \"rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.\" And immediately the demon left him, and the boy lay as one dead. The action of the evil spirit upon him had been so violent that it had overcome all his natural strength; and when it left him he was powerless and unconscious. The people, who had witnessed with awe the sudden change that came over the lad, now whispered among themselves, \"He is dead.\" But Jesus stooped and with tender pity \"took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2SP", "page": 335}
