    "word": "Wrong habits of life have lessened our mental and physical sensibilities, and all the strength we can acquire by right living and placing ourselves in the best relation to health and life should be devoted unreservedly to the work which God has assigned us. We cannot afford to use the few enfeebled, crippled energies which we possess to serve tables or to mingle merchandise with the work God has committed to us. Every faculty of mind and body is now needed. The work of God requires this, and no separate business can be engaged in aside from this great work without taking time and strength of mind and body, and thus lessening the vigor and force of our labor in the cause of God. Ministers who do this will not have all that time for meditation and prayer, and all that strength and clearness of mind that they should have to understand the cases of those who need help, and to be prepared to \"be instant in season, out of season.\" A word fitly spoken at the right time may save some poor, erring, doubting, fainting soul. Paul exhorted Timothy: \"Meditate upon these things; \n                                                                           471\ngive thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.\"",
