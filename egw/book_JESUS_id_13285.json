{"word": "Pilate turned pale when he read the message; but the priests and rulers had occupied the interval in farther inflaming minds of the people, till they were wrought up to a state of insane fury. The governor was forced to action; he turned to the crowd and spoke with great earnestness: \"Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ.?\" It was customary at this feast for the governor to release one prisoner, whomsoever the people desired to be set at liberty. Pilate seized this as an opportunity to save Jesus; and by giving them a choice between the innocent Saviour and the notable robber and murderer, Barabbas, he hoped to rouse them to a sense of justice. But a great was his astonishment when the cry, \"Away with this man, and release unto us \n                                                                           142\nBarabbas!\" was started by the priests, and taken up by the mob, resounding through the hall like the hoarse cry of demons.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 141}
