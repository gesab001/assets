    "word": "Lend your neighbors some of our smaller books. If their interest is awakened, take some of the larger books. Show them Christ's Object Lessons.

If possible, secure an opportunity to teach them the truth. Beside all waters you are to sow the seeds of truth, though not knowing which shall prosper, this or that.",
