{"word": "Call Forth High Qualities of the Mind.--The greatest care should be taken in the education of youth to vary the manner of instruction so as to call forth the high and noble powers of the mind. Parents and teachers of schools are certainly disqualified to educate children properly if they have not first learned the lessons of \n\n190 \n\nself-control, patience, forbearance, gentleness, and love.
