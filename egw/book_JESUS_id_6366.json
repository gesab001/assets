{"word": "In doing this kind of work, none should feel like the Pharisee when he came to the temple to pray and said, \\93God, I thank thee that I am not as  other men.\\94 Let it be kept in mind that Jesus died for all, and that he loves others just as much as he loves you. Let the heart be softened with the love  of God; and then, with quivering lip and tearful eye, open to the people the  treasures of truth. Present the truth as it [is] in Jesus; not for the sake of  contention, not for the love of argument, but with meekness and fear; and it will reach the hearts of the honest. That which makes the truth so objectionable to many is that it is not presented in the spirit of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 150}
