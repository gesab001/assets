    "word": "Chap. 74 - \"The Appearance of Evil\"\n\n     I feel urged to address those who are engaged in giving the last message of warning to the world. Whether those for whom they labor see and accept the truth depends very much upon the individual workers. The command from God is, \"Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord;\" and Paul charges Timothy, \"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine.\" The work must commence with the worker; he must be united to Christ as the branch is united to the vine. \"I am the Vine,\" said Christ; \"ye are the branches.\" The closest possible connection is here represented. Engraft the leafless twig upon the flourishing vine stock, and it becomes a living branch, drawing sap and nourishment from the vine. Fiber by fiber, vein by vein, the sapling clings, until it buds and blossoms and bears fruit. The sapless twig represents the sinner. When united to Christ, soul is joined to soul, the feeble and finite to the holy and infinite, and man becomes one with Christ.",
