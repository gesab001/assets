{"word": "He [Jesus] teaches that the exact truth should be the law of speech. \"Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay.\" . . . These words condemn all those meaningless phrases and expletives that border on profanity. They condemn the deceptive compliments, the evasion of truth, the flattering phrases, the exaggerations, the misrepresentations in trade, that are current in society and in the business world. They teach that no one who tries to appear what he is not, or whose words do not convey the real sentiment of his heart, can be called truthful. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 64}
