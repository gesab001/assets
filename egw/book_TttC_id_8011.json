    "word": "So long as we are in the world, we must have to do with the things of the world. There will ever be a necessity for the transaction of temporal, secular business; but this should never become all-absorbing. The apostle Paul has given a safe rule: \"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" The humble, common duties of life are all to be performed with fidelity; \"heartily,\" says the apostle, \"as to the Lord.\" Whatever our department of labor, be it housework or field work or intellectual pursuits, we may perform it to the glory of God so long as we make Christ first and last and best in everything. But aside from these worldly employments there is given to every follower of Christ a special work for the upbuilding of His kingdom--a work which requires personal effort for the salvation of men. It is not a work to be performed once a week merely, at the place of worship, but at all times and all places. \n                                                                           460",
