{"word": "\\93We reached Waukon Wednesday night, and found nearly all of the Sabbath-keepers sorry that we had come. Much prejudice existed against us, for much had been said concerning us calculated to injure our influence. We knew that the Lord had sent us, and that he would there take the work into his own hands. Satan had put his hand in among the company at Waukon, to mould their minds to suit himself. Our earnest prayers went up to God for him to reveal his power, and we felt like patiently waiting his salvation.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LS88", "page": 331}
