{"word": "Harmony in Home Possible Only by God's Spirit. --We must have the Spirit of God, or we can never have harmony in the home. The wife, if she has the spirit of Christ, will be careful of her words; she will control her spirit, she will be submissive, and yet will not feel that she is bondslave, but a companion to her husband. If the husband is a servant of God, he will not lord it over his wife; he will not be arbitrary and exacting. We cannot cherish home affection with too much care; for the home, if the Spirit of the Lord dwells there, is a type of heaven.--Lt 18-b 1891. (AH 118.) \n\n162", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 161}
