    "word": "God's Almoners \n\n     Those who are truly converted will regard themselves as God's almoners and will dispense, for the advancement of the work, the means He has placed in their hands. If Christ's words were obeyed, there would be sufficient means in His treasury for the needs of His cause. He has entrusted to men and women an abundance of means for the carrying forward of His plan of mercy and benevolence. He bids His stewards of means invest their money in the work of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and preaching the gospel to the poor. Perfection of character cannot possibly be attained without self-sacrifice.",
