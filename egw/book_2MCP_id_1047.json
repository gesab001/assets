{"word": "Doubts Entertained Regarded as Assured Facts.-- The general method of educating the youth does not meet the standard of true education. Infidel sentiments are interwoven in the matter placed in schoolbooks, and the oracles of God are placed in a questionable or even an objectionable light.
