    "word": "Ministerial Help \n\n     In camp meetings or tent efforts in or near the large cities there should be an abundance of ministerial help. In all our camp meetings the ministerial force should be as strong as possible. It is not wise to allow a constant strain upon one or two men. Under such a strain they become physically and mentally exhausted, and are unable to do the work appointed them. In order that they may have the strength required for the meetings, ministers should arrange beforehand to leave their fields of labor in safe hands, with those who, though they may not be able to preach, can carry forward the work from house to house. In God many can do valiantly, and for their labor will see returns the richness of which will surprise them.",
