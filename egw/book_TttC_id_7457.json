This is why we cherish so little of that sweet compassion which Jesus manifests toward us and which we should manifest toward one \n                                                                           247\nanother. We should remember that our brethren are weak, erring mortals like ourselves. Suppose that a brother has through unwatchfulness been overborne by temptation and contrary to his general conduct has committed some error, what course shall be pursued toward him? We learn from the Bible that men whom God had used to do a great and good work committed grave sins. The Lord did not pass these by unrebuked, neither did He cast off His servants. When they repented, He graciously forgave them and revealed to them His presence and wrought through them. Let poor, weak mortals consider how great is their own need of pity and forbearance from God and from their brethren. Let them beware how they judge and condemn others. We should give heed to the instruction of the apostle: \"Ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\" We may fall under temptation and need all the forbearance which we are called to exercise toward the offender. \"With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\"",
