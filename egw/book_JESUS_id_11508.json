{"word": "32 (ch. 1:29; 3:14, 15; see EGW on Galatians 6:14). No Rest for Some.--Never before was there such a general knowledge of Jesus as when He hung upon the cross. He was lifted up from the earth, to draw all to Him. Into the hearts of many who beheld that crucifixion scene, and who heard Christ's words, was the light of truth to shine. With John they would proclaim, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" There were those who never rested until, searching the Scriptures and comparing passage with passage, they saw the meaning of Christ's mission. They saw that free forgiveness was provided by Him whose tender mercy embraced the whole world. They read the prophecies regarding Christ, and the promises so free and full, pointing to a fountain opened for Judah and Jerusalem (MS 45, 1897).", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "5BC", "page": 1137}
