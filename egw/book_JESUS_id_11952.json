They could not refute his arguments, but refused to accept his conclusions. The prophecies which the rabbis themselves applied to Christ were a great annoyance to these opposing Jews; for the apostle showed that the fulfillment of these very prophecies required them to accept of Christ.

Frenzied with malice, they reiterated their assertions that Jesus of Nazareth was a deceiver.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LP", "page": 277}
