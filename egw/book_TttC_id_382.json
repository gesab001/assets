    "word": "Heed the counsel of the True Witness. Buy gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, white raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and eyesalve that thou mayest see. Make some effort. These precious treasures will not drop upon us without some exertion on our part. We must buy--\"be zealous and repent\" of our lukewarm state. We must be awake to see our wrongs, to search for our sins, and to zealously repent of them.",
