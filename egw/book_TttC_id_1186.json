    "word": "True, noble, disinterested benevolence is too rarely found among the wealthy. In their ambition for wealth they overlook the claims of humanity. They cannot see and feel the cramped, disagreeable position of their brethren in poverty, who perhaps have labored as hard as themselves. Like Cain they say: \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" \"I have worked hard for what I have; I must hold on to it.\" Instead of praying, \"Help me to feel my brother's woe,\" their constant study is to forget that he has any woes, any claims upon their sympathy or liberalities.",
