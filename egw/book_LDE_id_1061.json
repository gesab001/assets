{"word": "The Vigor of Eternal Youth \n\n     All come forth from their graves the same in stature as when they entered the tomb. Adam, who stands among the risen throng, is of lofty height and majestic form, in stature but little below the Son of God. He presents a marked contrast to the people of later generations; in this one respect is shown the great degeneracy of the race. But all arise with the freshness and vigor of eternal youth. . . . Restored to the tree of life in the long-lost Eden, the redeemed will \"grow up\" (Malachi 4:2) to the full stature of a race in its primeval glory.--GC 644, 645 (1911).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 289}
