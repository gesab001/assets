{"word": "IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12:28, WE ARE INFORMED THAT GOD HATH SET, PLACED, OR FIXED, CERTAIN SPIRITUAL GIFTS IN THE CHURCH. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY SCRIPTURAL PROOF THAT HE HAS REMOVED OR ABOLISHED THEM, WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO REMAIN. WHERE IS THE PROOF THEN THAT THEY ARE ABOLISHED? IN THE SAME CHAPTER WHERE THE JEWISH SABBATH IS ABOLISHED, AND THE CHRISTIAN SABBATH INSTITUTED--A CHAPTER IN THE ACTS OF THE MYSTERY OF INIQUITY AND THE MAN OF SIN. BUT THE OBJECTOR CLAIMS BIBLE PROOF THAT GIFTS WERE TO CEASE, CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING TEXT: \"CHARITY NEVER FAILETH: BUT WHETHER THERE BE PROPHECIES, THEY SHALL FAIL; WHETHER THERE BE TONGUES, THEY SHALL CEASE; WHETHER THERE BE KNOWLEDGE, IT SHALL VANISH AWAY. FOR WE KNOW IN PART, AND WE PROPHESY IN PART. BUT WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME, THEN THAT WHICH IS IN PART \n                                                                            136\nSHALL BE DONE AWAY. WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I SPAKE AS A CHILD, I UNDERSTOOD AS A CHILD, I THOUGHT AS A CHILD: BUT WHEN I BECAME A MAN, I PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS. FOR NOW WE SEE THROUGH A GLASS, DARKLY; BUT THEN FACE TO FACE: NOW I KNOW IN PART; BUT THEN SHALL I KNOW EVEN AS ALSO I AM KNOWN. AND NOW ABIDETH FAITH, HOPE, CHARITY.\" 1 CORINTHIANS 13:8-13.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "EW", "page": 135}
