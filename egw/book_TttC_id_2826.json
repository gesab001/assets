    "word": "I saw your feet faltering, your faith wavering. Doubt and unbelief were enclosing you about, and the light of Jesus was departing. Vanity is one of the strongest principles of our depraved natures, and Satan will constantly appeal to it with success. Persons have not been wanting who were ready to aid Satan in his work--to flatter you, to present your ability and the influence you could have in society, to urge that it would be a great pity for you to unite your interests with a people of humble faith and mingle in a class of society, as they regard it, beneath you. It has seemed to you that you were making a great sacrifice for the truth. It is true that the masses who possess influence do not choose to sacrifice their worldly ambition, to separate their affections from the world, and turn their footsteps into the narrow, humble path traveled by the suffering Man of Calvary. They consider their talents and influence too precious to be devoted to the cause of God, too precious to be given back to glorify the Giver who lent them these talents to be improved upon and returned to Him, both principal and interest. For the temporal advantages they hope to gain they will sacrifice the eternal. For the flattery of men they will turn from the approval of the Lord, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, and will forfeit all right to the honor which cometh from above. How few know what is for their best interest! You do not appreciate this. Jesus, through a life of unexampled suffering and an ignominious death, has opened a way whereby man may follow in His footsteps, and \n                                                                           495\nfinally be exalted to His throne, and receive the reward of immortality and eternal life. For a life of obedience he will receive an immortal inheritance, a treasure undefiled that fadeth not away.",
