{"word": "A profession of Christianity without corresponding faith and works, will avail nothing. No man can serve two masters. The children of the wicked One are their own master's servants, and to whom they yield themselves servants to obey, his servants they are. Until they renounce the Devil and all his works, they cannot be the servants of God. It cannot be harmless for servants of the heavenly King to engage \n                                                                           147\nin the pleasures and amusements which Satan's servants engage in, even if they often repeat that such amusements are harmless. God has revealed sacred and holy truths, to separate his people from the ungodly, and purify them unto himself. Seventh-day Adventists should live out their faith. Those who obey the ten commandments, view the state of the world and religious things from altogether a different stand-point from professors who are lovers of pleasures, who shun the cross, and are living in violation of the fourth commandment. In the present state of things in society, the task is no easy one, for parents to restrain their children, and instruct them according to the Bible rule of right. Professors of religion have so departed from the word of God, that when his people return to his sacred word, and would train their children according to its precepts, and like Abraham of old command their households after them; the poor children with such an influence around them think their parents unnecessarily exacting and over-careful, in regard to their associates. They naturally desire to follow the example of worldly, pleasure-loving professors.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "4bSG", "page": 146}
