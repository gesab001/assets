{"word": "As you seek to obtain a knowledge of the truth, you should seek to obtain an experimental knowledge of Christ, that you may work after His methods. You should pray as did Moses, Lord, reveal to me Thy glory. A revelation of the goodness, the tenderness, and love of Jesus toward fallen man, will cause self to sink into nothingness, and will exalt Jesus. Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary; talk of Jesus and His matchless love. There is where many who present the truth fail. They talk doctrines, but do not dwell upon the matchless, forbearing love of Jesus.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "TSA", "page": 29}
