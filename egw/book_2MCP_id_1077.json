{"word": "Education of Children Not Like Training Dumb Animals.--The education of children at home or at school should not be like the training of dumb animals; for children have an intelligent will, which should be directed to control all their powers. Dumb animals need to be trained, for they have not reason and intellect. But the human mind must be taught self-control. It must be educated to rule the human being, while animals are controlled by a master and are trained to be submissive to him. The master is mind, judgment, and will for his beast.--3T 132 (1872).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 687}
