    "word": "With untiring zeal those who have received the light of present truth should go forth to give this light to those who sit in darkness. With consecrated efforts, by self-denial and self-sacrifice, they are to labor in the strength of the God of Israel. This message is to be carried to foreign lands; it is to be given to the cities and towns of our own country. The weary and the heavy-laden are longing for the message of truth that will give them rest and peace in Christ. Who will carry the message to those who have never heard it? Who will seek the joy and glory of God by drawing sinners to the feet of Him who gave His life a sacrifice for every soul? Who will lift up the Saviour before men as \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\"? John 1:29.",
