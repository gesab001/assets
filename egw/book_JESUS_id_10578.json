{"word": "College View, Nebraska \n                                  September 16, 1904 \n\nDear Sister Marian: \n     I keep your case before me, and I am grieved that you are troubled in mind.  I would comfort you if it were in my power.  Has not Jesus, the precious Saviour, been to you so many times a present help in times of need?  Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, but cease worrying.  This is what you have many times talked to others.  Let the words of those who are not sick, as you are, comfort you, and may the Lord help you, is my prayer.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "RY", "page": 149}
