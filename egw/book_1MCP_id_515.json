{"word": "Husband Not to Dwell on His Position.--It is no evidence of manliness in the husband for him to dwell, constantly upon his position as head of the family. It does not increase respect for him to hear him quoting Scripture to sustain his claims to authority. It will not make him more manly to require his wife, the mother of his children, to act upon his plans as if they were infallible.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "1MCP", "page": 160}
