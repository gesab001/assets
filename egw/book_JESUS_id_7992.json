{"word": "In Jesus the Redeemer they discern infinite wisdom, infinite justice, infinite mercy--depths, heights, lengths, and breadths of love which passeth knowledge. Beholding the perfection of Christ's character, contemplating His mission, His love, His grace, His truth, they are charmed; the great want of the soul is met, and they will say with the psalmist, \"I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness.\" The divine object of faith and love they see to be Jesus Christ; with them the love of the world, the worshiping of earthly treasures, has come to an end. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MM", "page": 244}
