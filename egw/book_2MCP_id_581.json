{"word": "Daily Exercise of Faith.--I find that I have to fight the good fight of faith every day. I have to exercise all my \n\n540 \n\nfaith and not rely upon feeling; I have to act as though I knew the Lord heard me and would answer me and bless me. Faith is not a happy flight of feeling; it is simply taking God at His word--believing that He will fulfill His promises because He said He would.--Lt 49, 1888.
