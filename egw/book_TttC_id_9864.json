    "word": "When persons are spoken to on the subject of health, they often say: \"We know a great deal better than we do.\" They do not realize that they are accountable for every ray of light in regard to their physical well-being, and that their every habit is open to the inspection of God. Physical life is not to be treated in a haphazard manner. Every organ, every fiber of the being, is to be sacredly guarded from harmful practices.",
