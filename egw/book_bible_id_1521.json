{"word": "Work for the Wealthy Classes \n\n     The servants of Christ should labor faithfully for the rich men in our cities, as well as for the poor and lowly. There are many wealthy men who are susceptible to the influences and impressions of the gospel message, and who, when the Bible and the Bible alone is presented to them as the expositor of Christian faith and practice, will be moved by the Spirit of God to open doors for the advancement of the gospel. They will reveal a living faith in the word of God, and will use their entrusted means to prepare the way of the Lord, to make straight in the desert a highway for our God. \n                                                                           349", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GW", "page": 348}
