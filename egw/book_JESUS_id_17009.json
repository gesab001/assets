{"word": "Said Christ, \"All things that the Father hath are mine.\" \"I and my Father are one\" (John 16:15; 10:30). \"I appoint unto you a kingdom\" (Luke 22:29). The Lord Jesus lays His hand upon the eternal throne of God with all the ease and assurance of one who rules and reigns, putting on His head the crown of deity. He sits at the right hand of God and receives supreme honor as God, the glory He had before the world was. He distributes His gifts to all who by faith shall claim them. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 338}
