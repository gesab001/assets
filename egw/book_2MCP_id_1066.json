{"word": "Summon the Aid of the Will.--Indolence is a great evil. Men, women, and youth, by dwelling upon themselves, think they are in a much worse condition than they really are. They nurse their ailments, and think of them and talk of them, until their usefulness seems to be at an end. Many have passed into the grave when they might have lived, and ought to have lived. Their imagination was diseased. Had they resisted the disposition to yield to infirmities and be overcome by them; had they summoned to their aid the powers of the will, they might have lived to bless the world with their influence.--HR, July, 1868.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 683}
