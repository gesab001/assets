    "word": "A Place for Everyone \n\n     There is earnest work for every pair of hands to do. Let every stroke tell for the uplifting of humanity. There are so many that need to be helped. The heart of him who lives, not to please himself, but to be a blessing to those who have so few blessings, will thrill with satisfaction. Let every idler awake and face the realities of life. Take the word of God and search its pages. If you are doers of the word, life will indeed be to you a living reality, and you will find that the reward is abundant.",
