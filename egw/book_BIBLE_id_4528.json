Men and women will be converted, and so filled will they be by the Spirit of God that they will pass from country to country, from city to city, proclaiming the message of truth. With hearts filled with earnest love for souls, they will open their Bibles and present the Word.--Manuscript 2, Jan. 2, 1900, \"The Need of a Reformation.\"", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 16}
