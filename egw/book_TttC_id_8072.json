    "word": "The Lord has rich blessings for the church if its members will seek earnestly to arouse from this perilous lukewarmness. A religion of vanity, words devoid of vitality, a character destitute of moral strength,--these are pointed out in the solemn message addressed by the True Witness to the churches, warning them against pride, worldliness, formalism, and self-sufficiency. To him that says, \"I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,\" the Lord of heaven declares, Thou \"knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\" But to the lowly, the suffering, the faithful, the patient, who are alive to their weakness and insufficiency, are given words of encouragement: \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\" The True Witness \n                                                                           485\nsays to all: \"I know thy works.\" This close scrutiny is over the churches in California. Nothing escapes His searching gaze; their faults and errors, their neglects and failures, their sinful departure from the truth, their declensions and shortcomings--all are \"opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\"",
