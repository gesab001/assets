{"word": "Rest and Reflection \n\n     The disciples of Jesus needed to be educated as to how they should labor, and how they should rest. Today there is need that God's chosen workmen should listen to the command of Christ to go apart and rest awhile. Many valuable lives have been sacrificed, that need not have been, through ignorance of this command. . . . Though the harvest is great and the laborers are few, nothing is gained by sacrificing health and life. . . . There are many feeble, worn workmen who feel deeply distressed when they see how much there is to be done, and how little they can do. How they long for physical strength to accomplish more; but it is to this class that Jesus says, \"Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile.\"--Review and Herald, Nov. 7, 1893.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 249}
