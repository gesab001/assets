    "word": "The scepter is no longer held in the hand of a proud and powerful monarch. The mighty ruler is a maniac. He now herds with the cattle to eat as they eat. He is a companion of the beasts of the field. The brow that once wore a coronet is disfigured by the absence of reason and intellect. The mandate has gone forth: \"Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit.\" Verse 14.",
