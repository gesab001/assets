    "word": "Not with tame, lifeless utterance is the message to be given, but with clear, decided, stirring utterances. Hundreds are waiting for the warning to escape for their lives. The world needs to see in Christians an evidence of the power of Christianity. Not merely in a few places, but throughout the world, messengers of mercy are needed. From every country is heard the cry: \"Come over, . . . and help us.\" Rich and poor, high and low, are calling for light. Men and women are hungering for the truth as it is in Jesus.
