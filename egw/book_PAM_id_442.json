{"word": "Offering Appeal\n \n\n     An offering appeal should include both the practical need and the spiritual motivation for giving.--I appeal to the congregation that regularly assemble at our Tabernacle: Will you not bring in your offerings to lift the debt from the Lord's house? I appeal to those who send their children to Battle Creek, where they unite with us in the worship of God: Will you not assist us to lift this debt? I invite all to be especially liberal at this time. Let cheerful freewill--offerings be brought to the Lord, let us consecrate to Him all that we are, and all that we have. . . .--RH Jan. 4, 1881.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 181}
