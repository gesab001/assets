{"word": "The change of heart by which we become children of God is in the Bible spoken of as birth. Again, it is compared to the germination of the good seed sown by the husbandman. In like manner those who are just converted to Christ are, \"as newborn babes,\" to \"grow up\" to the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus (1 Peter 2:2; Ephesians 4:15). Or like the good seed sown in the field, they are to grow up and bring forth fruit. Isaiah says that they shall \"be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified\" (Isaiah 61:3). So from natural life, illustrations are drawn, to help us better to understand the mysterious truths of spiritual life.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 70}
