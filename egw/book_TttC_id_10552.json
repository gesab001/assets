    "word": "Concerning Israel, the Lord declared: \"The people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\" Numbers 23:9. To us as well as to ancient Israel these words apply. God's people are to stand alone. The observance of the seventh-day Sabbath is to be a sign between them and God, showing that they are to be a peculiar people, separate from the world in habit and practice. Through them God will work to gather from all nationalities a people for Himself.",
