    "word": "No man can serve God without uniting against himself evil men and evil angels. Evil spirits will be put upon the track  of every soul that seeks to join the ranks of Christ, for Satan wishes to recover the prey taken from his grasp. Evil men will give themselves over to believe strong delusions, that they may be damned. These men will put on the garments of sincerity and deceive, if possible, the very elect.",
