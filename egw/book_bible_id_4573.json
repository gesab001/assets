{"word": "The living out of Bible truth gives a direct and powerful tendency to expansion and growth. Every virtue becomes invigorated as it is exercised. It is a sore trial to drag ourselves away from worldly, deceiving influences. Every step that we advance we see obstacles that Satan presents, and we have to wrestle with difficulties, but an experience is being gained in having to press against these barriers, for the way opens, fresh incentives are presented from heaven, and faith becomes confirmed as we look upon Christ.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 370}
