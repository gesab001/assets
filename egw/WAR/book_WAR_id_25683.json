    "word": "Abridged\n\n12 - Back a Year \n\nDate: December 25, 1904 Source: Letter 337, 1904 Status: Previously unpublished\nContext: In an extremely pointed letter, Ellen White rebukes Oakwood principal B.E. Nicola for staying on in the head post an additional year. \nDear Brother Nicola,\n     I am sorry that you were successful in retaining your position at the Huntsville School one year longer than some thought you ought. Whatever your qualifications may be, you are not the man to carry the Huntsville School forward successfully. By remaining at the school during the past year, you have put the institution back a year. I cannot see why this was permitted. The Lord is grieved when men of experience refuse to be true to their God-given work.",
