    "word": "I repeated to him the words spoken by my guide in reference to these associations. Giving a certain movement that was made by my guide, I said, \"I cannot relate all that was given to me.\" Brother Faulkhead told Elder Daniells and others that I gave the particular sign known only by the highest order of Masons, which he had just entered. He said that I did not know the sign , and that I was not aware that I was giving the sign to him. This was special evidence to him that the Lord was working through me to save his soul.--Letter 46, 1892.",
