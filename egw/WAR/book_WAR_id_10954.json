God Meets Us Where We Are.--\"With the pure Thou wilt shew Thyself pure; and with the froward Thou wilt shew Thyself froward\"--that is, as God meets us where we are, so we are to meet men where they are. Let us not, by refusing to meet our fellow-men where they are, place ourselves outside the compass of God's love and mercy (MS 116, 1902).",
