    "word": "In regard to the messages of warning given me regarding people being called to Battle Creek, you have worked contrary to the counsel of the Spirit of God. You were standing where you liked to be, and you have reasoned away the objections to being in Battle Creek. Standing, as did Aaron, directly opposed to the Word of the Lord, you have made of no effect the testimonies of warning sent to keep young men and young women from going to Battle Creek. You have allowed your influence to be used to lead people to do just what the Lord has warned them not to do, and the Lord pronounces you an unfaithful steward in your influence in Battle Creek. Whatever excuses you may make, it is thus charged against you. You have worked decidedly counter to the Lord's plans, and God says, \"I will judge him for this, unless he repents.\"",
