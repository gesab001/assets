    "word": "Satan's Weapons.--The indulgence of fleshly lusts wars against the soul. The apostle in the most impressive manner, addresses Christians, \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God\" (Romans 12:1). If the body is saturated with liquor and the defilement of tobacco, it is not holy and acceptable to God. Satan knows that it cannot be, and for this reason he brings his temptations to bear upon men upon the point of appetite, that he may bring them into bondage to this propensity and thus work their ruin.--RH, Sept 8, 1874.",
