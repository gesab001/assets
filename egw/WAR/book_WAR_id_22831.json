    "word": "Christ died to save sinners, not in their sins, but from their sins. The warning given in Revelation shows us the terrible consequence of transgression. By lips that will not lie, God's law is declared to be holy, just, and good. Our duty to obey this law is to be the burden of the last message of mercy to \n\n\n                                   -183- \n\nthe world. God's law is not a new thing. It is not holiness created, but holiness made known. It is a code of principles expressing mercy, goodness, and love. It presents to fallen humanity the character of God, and states plainly the whole duty of man. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.\" This command contains the principles of the first four precepts. And \"Thou shalt love they neighbor as thyself\" [Mark 12:30, 31]. Upon these two great principles, the Word of God declares, hang all the law and the prophets.",
