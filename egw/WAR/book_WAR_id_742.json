    "word": "God had already told him that through Isaac his seed should be as the sand of the sea for multitude. As he stepped out into the night, he seemed to hear the divine voice that called him out of Chaldea fifty years before and said to him, \u201cLook now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them. . . . So shall thy seed be.\u201d Can it be the same voice that commands him to slay his son? He remembered the promise, \u201cI will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.\u201d Is it not the voice of a stranger that commands him to offer his son as a sacrifice? Can God contradict Himself? Shall He cut off the only hope of the fulfillment of the promise? Must he become childless?",
