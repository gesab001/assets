    "word": "Many obtain a surface knowledge of truth or Bible doctrine, and then stop, thinking they know it all. But do they know it all? No; no; God's word is, Go forward, looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of your faith. Because young men measure themselves among themselves, and reach a standard which others have reached, they are satisfied to stop learning. But the voice of God bids them go forward. Fifty times as much might be accomplished in self-education than now is if the minds of men and women were awake to their own possibilities and privileges. Education of self means more than the colleges can give you.",
