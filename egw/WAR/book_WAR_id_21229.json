    "word": "Wherever they may turn, the youth will see examples of unholiness. If they go with the multitude to do evil, their influence will be cast on the side of the adversary of souls; they will mislead those who have not cherished principles of unswerving fidelity to God.

But one person in a school who has a conscientious regard for truth and a true conception of duty, who will make straight paths for his feet lest the lame be turned out of the way, can do much in Christ's lines. \n\n\n                                    -283-",
