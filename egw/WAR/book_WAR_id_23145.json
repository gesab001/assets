    "word": "In Melbourne they are about to build their meetinghouse, so we cannot ask help from them, and it would be a great mistake to stop the work on the school building for a year. The students have been waiting for some time for the school to open, and we are anxious to get the building up that they may attend. I know that the Lord would have the work of building the school commenced without delay. He has means for us somewhere, and I know He would have us arise and build. If you will help us, we will be grateful to Him who has made you stewards of His means.",
