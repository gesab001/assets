    "word": "Those who truly believe in Christ sit together with Him in heavenly places. Let us accept the badge of Christianity. This is not an outward sign, not the wearing of a cross or a crown, but it is something that reveals the union of man with God. Let us \u201cput off the old man with his deeds; and . . . put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him\u201d (Colossians 3:9, 10). The beauty of holiness is revealed as Christians draw near together, blending in Christlike love.",
