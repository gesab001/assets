    "word": "\"Be reconciled to thy brother.\" \n Matthew 5:24. \n\n\n     The love of God is something more than a mere negation; it is a positive and active principle, a living spring, ever flowing to bless others. If the love of Christ dwells in us, we shall not only cherish no hatred toward our fellows, but we shall seek in every way to manifest love toward them.",
