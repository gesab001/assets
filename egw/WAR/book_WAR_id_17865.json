    "word": "You may feel that you cannot meet the approval of heaven. You may say, \"I was born with a natural tendency toward this evil, and I cannot overcome.\" But every provision has been made by our heavenly Father whereby you may be able to overcome every unholy tendency. You are to overcome even as Christ overcame in your behalf. He says, \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne\" (Revelation 3:21). It was sin that imperiled the human family; and before man was created the provision was made that if man failed to bear the test, Jesus would become His sacrifice and surety, that through faith in Him, man might be reconciled to God, for Christ was the Lamb \"slain from the foundation of the world\" (Revelation 13:8). Christ died on Calvary that man might have power to overcome his natural tendencies to sin.",
