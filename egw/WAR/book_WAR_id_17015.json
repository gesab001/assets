    "word": "Men and women are not to be spiritually dwarfed by a connection with the church, but strengthened, elevated, ennobled, prepared for the most sacred work ever committed to mortals. It is the Lord\u2019s purpose to have a well-trained army, ready to be called into action at a moment\u2019s notice. This army will be made up of well-disciplined men and women who have placed themselves under influences that have prepared them for service.",
