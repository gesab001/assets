    "word": "In the afternoon, Elder Luther Warren gave an excellent discourse. Brother Warren is an able worker, and we hope he may labor for a time in this needy field. Now is a favorable time to work Redlands. The Women's Christian Temperance Union recently held an important convention in Redlands, and Dr. Starr attended their meetings.
