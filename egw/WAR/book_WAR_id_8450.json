    "word": "We must keep the eye directed upward to God above the ladder. The question with men and women gazing heavenward is, How can I obtain the mansions for the blessed? It is by being a partaker of the divine nature. It is by escaping the \"corruption that is in the world through lust.\" It is by entering into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, laying hold of the hope set before you in the gospel. It is by fastening yourself to Christ and straining every nerve to leave the world behind. . . . It is by being in Christ and yet led by Christ; by believing and working, . . . holding onto Christ and constantly mounting upward toward God. . . .",
