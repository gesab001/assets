    "word": "Brother Wilson and his wife, precious and successful laborers, have accomplished a good work wherever they have gone. But our beloved Brother Wilson now sleeps in Jesus. We bury our faithful standard-bearers, but we have no time to stop for mourning; we are to \"go forward.\" The inhabitants of the world are perishing, many without having heard the call to repentance. The work must be advanced in every place.",
