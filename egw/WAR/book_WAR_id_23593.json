    "word": "Education, true education, means much. The time devoted in school to learning how to eat with your fork in place of your knife, is not the most essential. These little matters of form and ceremony should not occupy time and strength. Those students who are at first somewhat coarse and awkward will soon overcome this. If the teachers are themselves courteous and kind and attentive, if they are true in heart and soul, if they do their work as in the sight of the whole universe of heaven, if they have the mind of Christ and are molded and fashioned by the Holy Spirit, they will behave, not in a simpering, affected manner, but as ladies and gentlemen of solid worth. And if students have before them the teachers' example of propriety, they will day by day be educated in proper manners. \n\n\n                                     -283-",
