    "word": "Steadily and surely the darkness of ignorance and superstition was dispelled by the blessed light of the gospel. Freed from Romish oppression, the nation attained to strength and greatness it had never reached before. Sweden became one of the bulwarks of Protestantism.

It was the armies of Sweden that enabled Germany to turn the tide of popish success, to win toleration for the Protestants\u2014Calvinists as well as Lutherans\u2014and to restore liberty of conscience to those countries that had accepted the Reformation.",
