    "word": "May 31. I rested well during the night but the same inability to eat continues. We left about eleven o'clock for the cars to take us to Hamburg. At \n\n\n                                    -130- \n\nDusseldorf we changed cars.

Two young ladies entered the ladies' room, stood before the mirror, and then sought to beautify their appearance as much as possible, exhibiting themselves before the mirror, turning around this way and that, putting powder upon their faces. Oh, thought I, if they would be one-half as particular to beautify their character by the great standard of God's holy law, His mirror, His detector of the defects in character, there would be far less vanity for the outward appearance, and far more for the inward adorning, the perfection of character, the possession of the meekness of Christ.",
