    "word": "Is God pleased to see any of the organs or faculties He has given man neglected, misused, or deprived of the health and efficiency it is possible for them to have?

We are wholly dependent on God, and our faith is strengthened be believing, though we cannot see God\u2019s purpose in His dealing with us, or the consequence of this dealing. Faith points forward and upward to things to come, laying hold of the only power that can make us complete in Him.",
