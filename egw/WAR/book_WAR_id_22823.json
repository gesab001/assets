    "word": "The Lord has appointed every converted soul to witness for Him. The light that has been given to the individual members of His church is to shine forth, not merely in much talk, but in good works. Every talent entrusted to every soul is to be traded upon. The talents that might have been put out to the exchangers by those who have done nothing in the service of God will be required again with the improvements that the Lord required His stewards to make. Every jot of light, of ability, of influence, is to be used, not for self-pleasing, \n\n\n                                   -173- \n\nbut for the Lord. We are to be yoked up with Christ in perfect obedience to the Lord our God, who is holy, just, and good. Thus God's people may develop characters of increasing consecration, efficiency, and tact, and act their part as laborers together with God.",
