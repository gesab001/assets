    "word": "Be careful to maintain the elevated character of the missionary work. Let all connected with our missions, both men and women, be constantly inquiring, \"What am I? and what ought I to be and to do?\" Let all remember that they cannot give to others what they themselves do not possess; therefore \n                                                                           463\nthey should not settle down content with their natural ways and habits, seeking to make no change for the better. Paul says, \"I press toward the mark.\" [Philippians 3:14.] There must be constant reformation, unceasing advancement, if we would perfect a symmetrical character. \n\n                                               -",
