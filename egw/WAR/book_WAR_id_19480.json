    "word": "Let us take this for our lesson. Study every word attentively. Upright principles and pure sentiments, cultivated and practised, form a character after the divine similitude.

All such will be imbued with his Spirit. They will have a reservoir of persuasion, and a storehouse of simple eloquence.",
