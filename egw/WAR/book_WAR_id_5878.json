And in His presence, all the trials and sufferings of this life will be as nothingness. \u201cCast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry.\u201d Verses 35-37.",
