    "word": "In Some Places Bible Work Better Than Public Effort.--I was once shown a place in which a tent effort had been made. Great preparations were made, and the expense entailed was large. Enough was done to awaken the whole community, and in one sense it was awakened; but it was to warn of the dangerous errors held by those who were preaching the truth. An alarm was sounded, and falsehoods were repeated again and again. The stay-away argument was urged with much effect. The laborers were disappointed with their efforts, for only a few came to hear, and very few decided to obey the truth.",
