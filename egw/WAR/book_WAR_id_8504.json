    "word": "What if the professed followers of Jesus should look upon their expensive garments and should see the words written upon them by the finger of God, \"Clothe the naked.\" What if they should see inscribed upon their expensive decorations in their homes, the pictures, and furniture, \"Bring the poor that are cast out to thy house\"! In the dining room, where the table is laden with abundant food, the finger of God has traced, \"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry . . . ?\" Let all, old and young, consider that it is not a light matter to be the Lord's steward. . . . The needy, the oppressed, are left in want, while the Lord's money is selfishly squandered in extravagance and luxury. O that all will remember that God is no respecter of persons! It is a great thing to be a steward, faithful and true, before a just, impartial God. . . .",
