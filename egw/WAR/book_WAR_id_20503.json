    "word": "The hand of God is to be stretched out for the poor, degraded race. Men and women are sent to far-off lands, among heathen savages, to labor at great expense, and often at the sacrifice of their lives, but here are heathen at our very doors. The nation of slaves who were treated as if they had no souls, but were under the control of their masters, were emancipated at immense cost of life on both sides, the North seeking to restrict, the South to perpetuate and extend slavery. After the war, if the Northern people had made the South a real missionary field, if they had not left the Negroes to ruin through poverty and ignorance, thousands of souls would have been brought to Christ. But it was an unpromising field, and the Catholics have been more active in it than any other class.",
