    "word": "\"Several times it has been pointed out to me that there has been a close, ungenerous spirit exercised toward Brother H. from the very first of his labors in Battle Creek. It makes me feels sad to state the reason. It was because he went there a stranger and in poverty. Because he was a poor man, he has been placed in unpleasant positions, and made to feel his poverty. Men connected with our institutions have thought that they could bring him to their terms, and he has had a very unpleasant time. There are sad chapters in his experience, which would not have passed into history if his brethren had been kind, and had dealt with him in a Christlike manner. The Lord's cause should always be free from the slightest injustice; and no act connected with it should savor in the smallest degree of penuriousness or oppression.",
