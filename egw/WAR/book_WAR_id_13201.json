    "word": "\"Dare to be a Daniel, dare to stand alone!\" Have courage to do the right. A cowardly and silent reserve before evil associates, while you listen to their devices, makes you one with them. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, \n                                                                           190\nsaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters.\"",
