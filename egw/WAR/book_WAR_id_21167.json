    "word": "MR No. 564 - Personal Recreation of Ellen G. White\n\nPlanting a Garden: \n     I arose at half past four a.m. At five I was at work spading up ground and preparing to set out my flowers. I worked one hour alone, then Edith Ward and Ella May White united with me, and we planted our flowers. Then we set out twenty-eight tomato plants, when the bell rang for morning prayers and breakfast. I think I have received no harm from my vigorous exercise, but feel better for the work done.--Ms 62, 1896, pp. 1, 2. (Diary, February 10, 1896.)",
