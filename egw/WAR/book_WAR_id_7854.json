    "word": "Custom Is at War With Nature.--Our artificial civilization is encouraging evils destructive of sound principles. Custom and fashion are at war with nature. The \n\n560 \n\npractices they enjoin and the indulgences they foster are steadily lessening both physical and mental strength and bringing upon the race an intolerable burden. Intemperance and crime, disease and wretchedness, are everywhere.--MH 125, 126 (1905).",
