    "word": "There is a much greater work to be done in this country than has yet been accomplished. I am thankful to see so large a number present at this meeting. But shall not your numbers be more than doubled during the coming year? Let each answer for himself what he will do. All heaven is interested in the salvation of man. It is for you to say whether you will be co-laborers with Christ or not; whether you will, without fainting, suffer the reproach that he endured; whether you will, without faltering, press the battle to the gates. Oh, must Christ, the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, bear the heavy cross, wear the thorny crown, and drink the bitter cup, while we recline at ease and \n154\nglorify ourselves, forgetful of the souls whom he died to redeem by his precious blood? No; let us do while we have the strength; let us work while it is day; let us devote ourselves to the service of God, that we may have his approbation and at last receive his reward.",
