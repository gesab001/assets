    "word": "Great dangers threatened the Reformation; but its advocates still trusted their cause with God, and pledged themselves to be firm to the gospel. The Elector of Saxony was urged by his councillors not to appear at the Diet. The emperor, they said, required the attendance of the princes in order to draw them into a snare. \u201cWas it not risking everything to shut oneself up within the walls of a city with a powerful enemy?\u201d But others nobly declared. \u201cLet the princes only comport themselves with courage, and God's cause is saved.\u201d \u201cOur God is faithful; he will not abandon us,\u201d said Luther. The elector set out, with his retinue, for Augsburg. All were acquainted with the dangers that menaced him, and many went forward with gloomy countenance and troubled heart. But Luther\u2014who accompanied them as far as Coburg\u2014revived their sinking faith by singing the hymn, written on that journey,\u2014\u201cA strong tower is our God.\u201d Many an anxious foreboding was banished, many a heavy heart lightened, at the sound of the inspiring strains.",
