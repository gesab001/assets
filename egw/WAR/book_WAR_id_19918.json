IN ORDER TO MEET THE INCREASED DEMANDS THUS MADE UPON AMERICA FOR MEN AND MEANS, THE HOME FIELD MUST BE WORKED DIFFERENTLY THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. HERE WORKERS ARE TO BE DEVELOPED. THE DEMAND IS NOW SO GREAT, THAT, IN ORDER TO FINISH THE WORK SPEEDILY, NO LONGER CAN DEPENDENCE BE PLACED ENTIRELY UPON OUR SCHOOLS, OR A LONG COURSE OF TRAINING, TO SUPPLY THE MEN AND WOMEN NEEDED.",
