    "word": "I have seen an angel standing with scales in his hands, weighing the thoughts and interest of the people of God, especially the young. In one scale were the thoughts and interest tending Heaven-ward; in the other scale were the thoughts and interest tending to earth. And in this scale were thrown all the reading of story books, thoughts of dress and show, vanity, pride, &c. Oh, what a solemn moment! The angels of God standing with scales, weighing the thoughts of the professed children of God--those who profess to be dead to the world and alive to God. The scale filled with thoughts of earth, vanity, and pride, quickly went down, notwithstanding weight after weight rolled from the scale. The scale with the thoughts and attractions to Heaven went quickly up as the other went down, and oh! how light was the scale. I can relate this as I saw it, but never can I give the solemnity and vivid impression stamped upon my mind, as I saw the angel with the scales weighing the thoughts and interest of the people of God. Said the angel, \"Can such enter Heaven? No, no, never. Tell them the hope they now possess is vain, and \n                                                                           12\nunless they speedily repent, and get salvation, they must perish.\"",
