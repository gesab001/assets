    "word": "The voice of the Son of God called forth the sleeping saints, clothed with glorious immortality. The living saints were changed in a moment, and were caught up with them into the cloudy chariot. It looked all over glorious as it rolled upward. On either side of the chariot were wings, and beneath it wheels. And as the chariot rolled upward, the wheels cried, \"Holy,\" and the wings, as they moved, cried, \"Holy,\" and the retinue of holy angels around the cloud cried, \"Holy, holy holy, Lord God Almighty!\" And the saints in the cloud cried, \"Glory! Alleluia!\" And the chariot rolled upward to the holy city. Jesus threw open the gates of the golden city, and led us in. Here we were made welcome, for we had kept \"the commandments of God,\" and had a \"right to the tree of life.\" Revelation 14:12; 22:14.",
