    "word": "Apparently the Lord permitted his enemies to triumph, as far as outward appearance was concerned. But God's hand was moving unseen in the darkness. He permitted His faithful servant to be placed where Christ could give him a more wonderful revelation of Himself to give to the world. The Lord was preparing John to endure hatred and scorn for the sake of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. He was hidden as it were on a desert island, and here Christ visited him, giving him a most wonderful view of His glory, and making known to him what was to come upon the earth. The man who exiled John was not released from his responsibility. He was the instrument used by Jehovah to carry out His eternal purpose, and the very effort to extinguish the light, placed the truth in bold relief.",
