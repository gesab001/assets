    "word": "But dissatisfaction was expressed by some of our own people. One said: \"A stop must be put to this work, or our business will be spoiled.\" As one brother was carrying away an armful of books, a canvasser laid his hand upon his arm and said: \"My brother, what are you doing with so many books?\" Then I heard the voice of our Counselor saying: \"Forbid them not.

This work is to continue without the forbiddings of anyone. Souls are perishing out of Christ. Let them be warned of His soon appearing in the clouds of heaven.\"",
