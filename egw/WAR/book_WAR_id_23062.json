    "word": "God never designed that one man's judgment and plans should be regarded as supreme. He says, \"Ye are laborers together with God.\" Let no man undertake to repress or discourage. Let him not seek to put his armor upon his brother, for he has not proved it. The president of our General Conference is not to consider it his work to lay plans as to how the minister shall carry forward his work. And the ministers are never to copy any man's gestures, his habits, his attitude, his expressions, the tones of his voice. They are to become no man's shadow, in thought, in sentiment, or in devising and execution of the great whole. If God has made you a shepherd of the flock, He has given you qualification to do that work. Christ says, \"Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your Father, which is in heaven\" [Matthew 23:9]. Let every man take his Bible, and place himself in divine communion with the great Teacher. God is the source from which all knowledge and wisdom flows.",
