    "word": "My brother, you are in the presence of Him who has never failed to accomplish His work or to fulfill His word. Bear not this message that you think means so much. In one way, it does mean much. It means the uprooting of faith in God and the making of infidels. Cease from all such work, for it will open the door for many to depart from the faith once delivered to the saints, and to give heed to seducing spirits.--Ms 62, 1905. (\"A Warning Against False Theories,\" May 24, 1905.)",
