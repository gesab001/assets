    "word": "I was rejoiced to hear of the good time you had at your house with Sister Gorham and Eastman. I should love to have been one of your company. I have not forgotten the good seasons we had together, neither have I forgotten your kindness to us. May the Lord reward you and your labors of love unto us. We have had sweet union together. Oh, may it last until Jesus comes. Let nothing cast you down but be encouraged and remember Jesus hath the watchful care over you.",
