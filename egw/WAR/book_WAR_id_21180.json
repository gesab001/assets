    "word": "The Lord would have His stewards discharge their duties faithfully in His name, and in His strength. By believing and acting upon the Word, they may go on conquering and to conquer. But, when men depart from the principles of righteousness, they can conceive a high opinion of their own goodness and aptitude, and unconsciously they exalt themselves. The Lord will allow them to walk alone, and to do their own way. He will give them opportunity to see themselves, and to manifest to others their own weakness. The Lord's way is always to be closely followed, His Word is to be taken as it reads, and men are not to devise and plan according to their own weak judgment.",
