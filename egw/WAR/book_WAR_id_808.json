    "word": "Nehemiah was chosen by God because he was willing to cooperate with God as a restorer. . . . He would not be led and corrupted by the devices of unprincipled men who had been hired to do an evil work. He would not allow them to intimidate him into following a cowardly course. When he saw wrong principles being acted upon, he did not stand by as an onlooker and by his silence give consent. He did not leave the people to conclude that he would stand on the wrong side. He took a firm, unyielding stand for the right. He would not lend one jot of influence to the perversion of the principles that God had established. Whatever course others might pursue, he could say, \u201cSo did not I, because of the fear of God.\u201dManuscript 121, 1898.",
