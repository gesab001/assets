    "word": "Consider the blessed reward in the kingdom of God awaiting those who in this life seek for the divine similitude. There there will be no more trial, no more affliction or pain or death. There we shall receive the crown of the overcomer and the harp of gold. Not for a few short years, but from everlasting to everlasting, we shall live to sing the song of praise to the Lamb. Will you engage in the effort to win these eternal blessings? Will you give your hearts unreservedly to God? He wants you. He stands ready to accept you, ready to forgive when you repent and turn from your sins. You may fail again and again, but again and again He will forgive if you truly repent, and He will bring you off more than conqueror at last through Him who has loved you and washed you in His own blood.--Manuscript 97, 1909. (MR 900.47)",
