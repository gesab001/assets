    "word": "Edson Urged to Treat His Father Tenderly.--Dear Edson, do not on any account move rashly in regard to the letter written by your father. [AFTER SEVERAL STROKES, JAMES WHITE HAD SOME PERSONALITY CHANGES, SOMETIMES BECOMING UNREASONABLE AND THINKING THAT EVERYBODY WAS AGAINST HIM. HE WAS HARSH AND SEVERE TOWARD EDSON AND WROTE HIM A VERY UNKIND LETTER. HE LATER APOLOGIZED TO EDSON FOR HIS CRITICISM.] Keep quiet; wait and trust; be faithful; make every concession you can, even if you have done so before; and may God give you a soft and tender heart to your poor, overburdened, worn, harassed father.--10MR 29 (1871).",
