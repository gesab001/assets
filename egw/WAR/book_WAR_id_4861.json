    "word": "There is only one path that leads from darkness upward to the light until it touches the throne of God, --the path of faith. This path is not dark and uncertain; it is not the way of finite minds, not a path made by human hands, in which toll is exacted from every traveler. Entrance to it cannot be gained by works of penance.",
