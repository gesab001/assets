    "word": "Number Eight. - Family Religion.\n\n     I have been shown the high and responsible position God's people should occupy. They are the salt of the earth and the light of the world, and must walk even as Christ walked. They will come up through much tribulation. The present is a time of warfare and trial. Our Saviour says in Revelation 3:21, \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.\" The reward is not given to all who profess to be followers of Christ, but to those who overcome, even as he overcame. We must study the life of Christ, and learn what it is to confess him before the world. No one can confess Christ unless the mind and Spirit of Christ are in him. The fruits of the Spirit are manifested outwardly, and these are a confession of Christ.",
