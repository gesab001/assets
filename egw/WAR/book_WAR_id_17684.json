    "word": "Economizing to Help Others.--We live economically in every way and make a study of how every penny is to be laid out. . . . We make over and over our clothing, patching and enlarging garments in order to make them wear a little longer, so that we can supply with clothing those who are more needy. One of our brethren in Ormondville, who is an intelligent carpenter, could not go forward in baptism because he had not a change of clothing. When he was able to get a cheap suit he was the most grateful man I ever saw, because he could then go forward in the ordinance of  baptism.--Letter 89a, 1894.",
