    "word": "Jesus calls to every wanderer, \u201cMy son, give me thine heart;\u201d \u201cReturn, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.\u201d The youth cannot be happy without the love of Jesus. He is waiting with pitying tenderness to hear the confessions of the wayward, and to accept their penitence. He watches for some return of gratitude from us, as the mother watches for the smile of recognition from her beloved child. The great God teaches us to call him Father. He would have us understand how earnestly and tenderly his heart yearns over us, in all our trials and temptations. \u201cLike as a father pitieth his children, \n408\nso the Lord pitieth them that fear him.\u201d [Psalm 103:13.] The mother might sooner forget her child, than God could forget one soul that trusts him.",
