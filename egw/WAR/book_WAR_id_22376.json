    "word": "The followers of Christ may receive divine illumination daily, and have clear conceptions of the great mercy and love of God toward us poor sinners. As we behold the love of Christ, we shall begin to reflect it. \"God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ\" [2 Corinthians 4:6]. In Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. How are they hid? Under the veil of humanity and deep humiliation. \n\n\n                                   -161- \n\nThe abundance of his knowledge covers all the treasures of wisdom; for in Christ all fullness dwells.",
