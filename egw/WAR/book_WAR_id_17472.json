    "word": "Conversation About Heaven--When we can associate together to help one another heavenward, \n                                                                           160\nwhen the conversation is upon divine and heavenly things, then it amounts to something to talk; but when the conversation centers upon self and earthly and unimportant matters, silence is golden. The obedient ear will receive reproof with humility, patience, and teachableness. Then only do our communications with each other prove beneficial, and fulfill all that God would have them. When both sides of the divine instruction are fulfilled, the wise reprover does his duty, and the obedient ear hears to a purpose and is benefited.--SD 166.",
