I HAVE BEEN STUDYING THESE THINGS ALL THE TIME, WAITING FOR THE BOARD TO DO WHAT IT IS CALLED UPON TO DO, WITHOUT MY HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, FOR I DID NOT THINK IT WAS MY PLACE; BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE, THESE THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN SEARCHED OUT AS THE TESTIMONY SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN, HENCE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CORRECTED AS THE TESTIMONY SAYS THEY MUST BE CORRECTED.",
