    "word": "Much excellent labor was bestowed upon the Laodicean church. To them was given the exhortation, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" But the church did not follow up the work begun by God's messengers. They heard, but they failed to appropriate the truth to themselves, and to carry out the instruction given them. The result that followed is the result always sure to follow the rejection of the Lord's warnings and entreaties (MS 128, 1903).",
