Location: Nashville, Tennessee Source: Ms. 152, 1904 Status: Previously unpublished\nContext: On Ellen White\u2019s summer Southern tour of 1904, she met with the Huntsville School Board shortly after her first trip to the Oakwood School. \n     Mrs. E. G. White: I would say that Huntsville has been kept before me at the same time that Graysville was fitting up, and I thought I was bearing the message all the time, to get before our people, that Huntsville needed more encouragement, really, than Graysville, because the most destitute needs the first attention. Had I been at Huntsville and seen its situation, I should have taken on a stronger burden. I knew its situation was\u2014well, I knew it was in need of help very much, but I did not anticipate so much need as I found when I went there. And it made my heart ache. It seemed as if it would take my flesh right off from my bones. I have not had any appetite for anything since I came back; I have not hardly. It seemed as if I had come right up to a stump. I thought: Our brethren in the South who knew anything of Huntsville and knew anything of its situation\u2014to leave it as it was; how God could look upon it\u2014that has been my thought. How God can look upon it, how God can acquit them at the sight of their eyes; it has been a great mystery to me to understand. I certainly know that in the place of its coming up, it is in many respects\u2014the appearance\u2014going backward instead of forward.",
