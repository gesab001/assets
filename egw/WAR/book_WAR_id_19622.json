    "word": "Paul charged Timothy to be \"strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\" \"Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please Him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. . . . Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\"",
