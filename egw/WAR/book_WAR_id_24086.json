    "word": "At the meetings at Minneapolis, at Potterville, and at Battle Creek, I presented general principles before you, hoping that you might hear, be impressed, and be converted, that I might not be under the painful necessity of addressing you personally. But as you have had the privilege of hearing the message which God has given me and others to bear, and yet your doubts and unbelief \n                                                                           395\nhave been strengthening instead of diminishing, I am alarmed for you. I know you and others in a similar position are not in the light, you are on the enemy's ground. Both of you are placing yourselves where the Spirit of God can no more find access to your hearts than It could find access to the hearts of the Jewish people when they gave themselves up to unbelief. Through Christ, light is shining to man; heaven is connected with earth, and the angels of God are ascending and descending upon the mystic ladder. They bring messages of warning, reproof, instruction, encouragement, and love. The glory of God is above the ladder, and shining down all its length. God will not devise some new way to reach the hearts of those who have shut themselves away from the light. It is at the peril of their souls that they refuse the light.",
