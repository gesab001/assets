    "word": "Denmark is a small country, consisting of a peninsula and larger and smaller islands. Its area is about the same as that of Maryland, but it contains more than double the number of inhabitants, its population being upwards of two millions. This country lies as far north as Labrador and Hudson's Bay in America; yet the climate is not severe; the winter is milder than in most of our Northern States. No doubt this is largely due to the influence of the gulf-stream, which brings a current of warm water from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic Ocean to the shores of Europe. This is a priceless blessing to its far northern countries, which would otherwise be deprived of many of the blessings of life.",
