    "word": "Stewardship of Time \n\n     Time is money, and many are wasting precious time which might be used in useful labor, working with their hands the thing that is good. The Lord will never say, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant,\" to the man who has not taxed the physical powers which have been lent him of God as precious talents by which to gather means, wherewith the needy may be supplied, and offerings may be made to God.",
