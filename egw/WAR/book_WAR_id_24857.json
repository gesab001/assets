    "word": "Let those who have every convenience at hand for the work they are doing ask themselves, How is it with those who are breaking new fields? Can I not help those who are working in new fields, where the standard of truth has not been lifted? God requires those in our institutions to have their conception sharpened, their minds enlarged. He will be pleased to have foreign missionary work become a burden that will weigh so heavily upon their minds that they will know the difference between the work of those in places where the work has been established and the work of those who engage in aggressive warfare. Let the true spirit of self-denial be learned out of the Word and brought into the practical life. \n\n                                               -",
