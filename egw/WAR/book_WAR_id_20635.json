    "word": "\"In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.\" Let us walk humbly with God, seeking Him diligently and serving Him earnestly, lest we be found unprofitable servants. Our Lord loves to have us trust Him implicitly, recognizing the sacredness of His work and His power to carry it forward. We need not be in darkness and doubt. Christ is constantly inviting us, \"Look unto Me. He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" No man can look to Christ without being strengthened and uplifted. By beholding Him, he is changed into the same image, and cherishes the same spirit. All sullenness and gloom are gone. His experience is as clear as the sunlight. The consciousness that Jesus loves him fills him with joy and gladness, and he reflects the divine image. His constant question is, \"What shall I render unto Thee for Thine infinite love and mercy to me? I am Thy servant; for Thou hast loosed my bonds.\"--Letter 157, 1902, pp. 1-14.
