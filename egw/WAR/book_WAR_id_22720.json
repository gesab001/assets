    "word": "One of the greatest errors connected with this subject is that idea that the young and inexperienced must not have their affections disturbed, that there must be no interference in this love experience. If there ever was a subject that needed to be viewed from every standpoint, it is this subject. The aid of the experience of others, and a calm, careful weighing of the matter on both sides, is positively essential. It is a subject that is treated altogether too lightly by the great majority of people. Take God into your counsel, young friends. Pray over the matter. Weigh every sentiment, and watch every development of character in the one with whom you think to link your life interest. Examine carefully to see if your married life will be happy, or inharmonious and wretched. Let the questions be raised, Will this union help me heavenward? Will it increase my love for God? And will it enlarge my sphere for usefulness in this life?",
