    "word": "Unsanctified self will never see the kingdom of God. It must die, and Christ must live in the thoughts, and be enshrined in the heart. His glory is to be kept ever in view, else they will occupy the lowest seat,--not in his service, for they will have no part in God's work. God will not accept the selfish, divided soul. \"He that will come after me,\" he says, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\" The love of display, the love of adornment, is an effectual barrier to the obtaining of the inward adorning. God exhorts his people, \"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\" Then shall we not seek to secure to ourselves that which the Lord pronounces a great price?",
