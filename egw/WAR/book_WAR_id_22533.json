    "word": "God holds responsible the men whom He has appointed to positions of trust. They are to conduct our institutions upon strictly Bible principles, in every line, in every branch. They are to educate those who are connected with them. They may be surrounded with ever increasing cares, but if they are looking to God in prayer, if they are seeking for the grace of Christ, they will have the help that they so much need. They will not be found unfaithful in their stewardship in large or small responsibilities, in spiritual or business lines.",
