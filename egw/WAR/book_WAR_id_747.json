    "word": "The question with men and women gazing heavenward is How can I obtain the mansions for the blessed? It is by being a partaker of the divine nature. It is by escaping the \u201ccorruption that is in the world through lust.\u201d It is by entering into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, laying hold of the hope set before you in the gospel. . . . It is by being in Christ and yet led by Christ, by believing and working\u2014trusting in Jesus, yet working upon the plan of addition, holding on to Christ and constantly mounting upward toward God. . . .",
