    "word": "Many, many are trusting to their own righteousness. They set up a standard for themselves and do not submit to the will of Christ and allow Him to clothe \n\n\n                                 -165- \n\nthem with the robe of His righteousness. They form characters according to their own will and pleasure. Satan is well pleased with their false religion. They misrepresent the perfect character--the righteousness--of Christ. How sad it is. Themselves deceived, they deceive others. They are not accepted of God. They are liable to lead other souls into false paths. They will at last receive their reward with the great deceiver--Satan.",
