    "word": "Jerusalem is a representation of what the church will be if it refuses to receive and walk in the light that God has given. Jerusalem was favored of God as the depositary of sacred trusts. But her people perverted the truth, and despised all entreaties and warnings. They would not respect His counsels. The temple courts were polluted with merchandise and robbery. Selfishness and love of mammon, envy, and strife, were cherished. Every one sought for gain from his quarter. Christ turned from them, saying, \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,\" how can I give thee up? \"How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!\" Matthew 23:37.",
