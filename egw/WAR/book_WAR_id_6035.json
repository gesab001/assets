    "word": "There is much work to be done right here in Switzerland. Take heed first to yourselves, dear fellow-laborers, and afterward to the doctrine. As surely as you allow your natural temperaments and dispositions to control you, just so surely will they appear in your labors, to mar the work of God. If you should bring souls into the truth, they would imitate your defects of character. Let the reformation begin with yourselves; let the converting power of God first be felt upon your own hearts, and then you will be better able to lead others to Christ.",
