    "word": "Physical Work Combined With Book Study--There has been some delay in getting the title to the Buena Vista property [Sonoma, California]. We are looking forward to having the matter settled soon. This is an excellent site for a school. As soon as I saw it, I was sure that it would make an ideal place for the carrying on of our educational work, for we can combine physical work on the farm with the study of books. Here the students can be taught to build and to engage in many useful lines of labor, as the students at Madison are being taught to do. There should also be sanitarium facilities in connection with the school, for I have been shown that where we have a training school we should have a sanitarium where the students can receive instruction in caring for the sick and suffering.--Letter 18, 1909, p. 2. (To J. E. White and wife, Jan. 13, 1909.) \n\n\n                                   -168-",
