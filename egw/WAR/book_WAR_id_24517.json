    "word": "God is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but the day of His judgment will come at last. \"Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when He cometh shall find watching.\" O that you may awake before it shall be everlastingly too late, and prepare to meet your God. Often the Spirit of God has taken of the things of God, and shown them to you, but you have refused to accept them, and by your refusal you have despised the truth, and have placed yourself in the path of the unrepentant Jews. Have you forgotten that God who is strong to save, is also strong to smite the rejecters of His law? This may be the last \n                                                                           1355\nappeal the Lord will make to you; for there is a line beyond which the forbearance of God does not pass. By continual resistance the sinner places himself where he knows nothing but resistance. When he disregards the calls of God's mercy, and continues to sow the seeds of unbelief, the dread mark is placed over his doorway, \"Ephraim is joined to his idols; let him alone.\" Jesus grieves over you, saying, \"How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing; but ye would not.\" No longer grieve the Saviour by your resistance. \"Knowing the time that it is now high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.\"",
