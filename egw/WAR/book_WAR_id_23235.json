    "word": "We have more than a royal path to heaven--we have a divine road. We are to stand before the great white throne, and hear the decisions of the infallible Judge of the quick and of the dead. Some act as if they were at liberty to cancel the decisions of the Judge, to review them, and take the warnings given of God, cut them up, choose one part and reject another, endorse or reverse at pleasure. In this way the messages of God are made void and made to bend to men's likings, ideas, and judgments.",
