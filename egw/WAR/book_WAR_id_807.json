    "word": "The strength of nations and of individuals is not found in the opportunities and facilities that appear to make them invincible; it is not found in their boasted greatness. That alone which can make them great and strong is the power and purpose of God. They themselves, by their attitude toward His purpose, decide their own destiny. Human histories relate people\u2019s achievements, their victories in battle, their success in climbing to worldly greatness. God\u2019s history describes men and women as heaven views them. . . .",
