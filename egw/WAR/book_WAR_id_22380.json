    "word": "I have also been pronounced a deceiver because I have said, \"The Lord will soon come; get ready, get ready, that ye may be found waiting, watching, and loving His appearing.\" But in the Revelation I read this statement, \"Behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" \"Behold, I come quickly: Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.\" \"Behold, I come quickly: Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.\" Was the One who bore this testimony a deceiver, because the \"quickly\" has been protracted longer than our finite minds could anticipate? It is the faithful and true Witness that speaks. His words are verity and truth.",
