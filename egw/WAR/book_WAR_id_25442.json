    "word": "Every housekeeper should feel it her duty to educate herself to make good sweet bread, and in the most inexpensive manner; and the family should refuse to have upon the table bread that is heavy and sour; for it is injurious. There are a large number of poor families who buy the common baker's bread which is often sour, and is not healthful for the stomach. In every line of cooking the questions that should be considered is, \"How shall the food be prepared in the most natural and inexpensive manner?\" And there should be careful study that the fragments of food left over from the table be not wasted. Study how, that in some way these fragments of food shall not be lost. This skill, economy, and tact is a fortune. In the warmer part of the season, prepare less food. Use more dry substance. There are many poor families, who, although they have scarcely enough to eat, can often be enlightened as to why they are poor, there are so many jots and tittles wasted.",
