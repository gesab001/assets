    "word": "We are certainly nearing the close of this earth's history, and God hath commended His love toward us in giving us the truth that has filled our hearts with such joy, that we may exercise love toward others. Look to the Man of Calvary giving His life for the sins of the world. Why? That in beholding such love for man, that all who believe shall not perish, we shall manifest the same love for our fellow-men. Love for lost souls brought Christ to Calvary's cross. Love for souls will lead us to self-denial, self-sacrifice in order to seek and to save that which was lost. Ye are labourers together with God. Self must die and our life be hid with Christ in God. Love for souls for whom Christ died means crucifixion of self.",
