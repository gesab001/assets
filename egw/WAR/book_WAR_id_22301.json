    "word": "Soul-Saving. \"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time\" [Colossians 4:5]. Precious time has passed into eternity, unused in the Master's service. Men have been doing a work that the Lord has warned them not to do. The actions of the professed religious world are to be no criterion for those to whom God in His great mercy has given advanced light. We can see that the world is in a great moral conflict. Unwarned souls are perishing in their sins while many of our churches remain content to do little or nothing to let the full light of the gospel, the light of true medical missionary work, shine into the hearts of men and women, that they may behold the way to heaven. We are failing to gain access to souls.",
