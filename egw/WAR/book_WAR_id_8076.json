    "word": "The spasmodic, fitful movements of some who claim to be Christians are well represented by the work of strong but untrained horses. When one pulls forward, another pulls back, and at the voice of their master, one plunges ahead, and the other stands immovable. If men will not move in concert in the great and grand work for this time, there will be confusion. . . . If men wear the yoke of Christ, they cannot pull apart; they will draw with Christ. . . .",
