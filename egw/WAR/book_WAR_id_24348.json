    "word": "I wish that all would see that the very same spirit which refused to accept Christ, the Light that would dispel the moral darkness, is far from being extinct in this age of the world. There are those in our day who are no more ready to recognize and acknowledge light than were the people when the prophets and the apostles came with messages from God, and many rejected the message and despised the messenger. Let us beware that this spirit is not entertained by any one of us. \n     [Revelation 2:1-5, quoted.]",
