    "word": "Wallings Mills, Sunday, September 14, 1873. Mr. Walling unexpectedly drove up and said he was ready to go over in the Park. He hurried us all up and we were packed, about ready to start at eleven o'clock. We drove out about six miles and took dinner. We spread our table by the side of a stream, built a fire, and had some warm food. We enjoyed it much. We rested one hour and then drove on. We made good time through the woods, and we thought that we might have time to pass the Range by daylight. We ascended the Range slowly. The road was worse than we anticipated, and we had to move very slowly. We did not get to timberland the other side of the Range until after dark. We made camp about nine o'clock and did not get to rest until about midnight. We had a flaming camp fire which was very grateful after sitting sometime in the wagon waiting for a good camping spot to be found. I was sick and could not sleep at night.",
