    "word": "The evils of fashionable society have a tendency to corrupt innocence and virtue; but every follower of Christ, every one who has this hope in him will purify himself even as He is pure, so that not a taint of defilement will be found in his thoughts or upon his lips, in his heart or on his character. There must be a coming up to a higher, holier standard. A decided warfare should be waged, not only against the evils that are in the world, but also among those who profess to believe the truth for this time. These evils if not put away, will result in spiritual death. . . . .",
