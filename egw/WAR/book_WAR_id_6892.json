    "word": "At the Grave \n\n     Half a century had passed since Mrs. White and her husband buried their youngest child and soon afterward their first-born in the beautiful spot where now she herself was to rest. When in 1881 Elder James White was laid beside the children, little did his bereaved companion think that the Lord would strengthen her to continue in ministry for a full third of a century. Yet such had been the case; and now, her labors ended, she was to rest by the side of her loved ones.",
