    "word": "Kettering, England, July 2, 1887. Sabbath morning. It is a very warm morning. I have not been able to sleep since half past three. I engaged in writing. I feel deeply the need of special help from God in seeking to win souls to Jesus Christ. \"Without Me,\" says Christ, \"ye can do nothing.\" How weak we are in our own finite strength. We want to work for the Master. I want to please Jesus, who has loved me, who has died for me. There is an unutterable longing of soul for the sweet, constant peace of Christ. I want Jesus in my thoughts continually.",
