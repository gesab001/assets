    "word": "Those who walk in wisdom's ways are, even in tribulation, exceedingly joyful, for He whom their soul loveth walks invisible beside them.  At each upward step they discern more distinctly the touch of His hand; at every step, brighter gleamings of glory from the Unseen fall upon their path; and their songs of praise, reaching ever a higher note, ascend to join the songs of the angels before the throne.  \"The path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\"  -- ST Aug. 3, 1904.",
