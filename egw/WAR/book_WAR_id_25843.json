    "word": "I see no reason why you should not be on the committee of the Southern Union Conference as a counsellor; for you know more about how the work in the South should be carried forward than do some who have had less experience. And if your voice and your experience should be regarded by the committee as of much value, you must be careful not to think that your opinions are to be accepted as supreme, above the judgment of those with whom you are associated in labor. Remember that counsellors are to be connected with the various branches of our work. All are to pray and watch unto prayer, cherishing the wisdom that cometh from above.",
