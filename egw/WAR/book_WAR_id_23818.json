    "word": "I have been instructed to say that you have drawn your time and strength and money away from enterprises which if they had been advanced, would have done ten fold more good than the enterprises that you have carried forward. Invention after invention has taken your time and means. Your money has been used in a way that has done more harm than good. The setting of men to work in various ways in what is called medical missionary work has consumed much time and money, but has produced next to nothing. The Lord has entrusted capital to you, to be used in advancing His kingdom, and if you misuse this capital you must settle with Him.",
