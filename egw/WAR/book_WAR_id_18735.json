    "word": "I warn my brethren and sisters to give not one word of sympathy or support to these men who have been holding fast their loathsome errors in the face of evidence and light to the contrary. We would suppose that such a warning was wholly unnecessary; but when there are men and women who are inclined to condemn the church, and those whom God has used to bear his message to the world, they are in danger of following a strange voice, rather than that of the true Shepherd.",
