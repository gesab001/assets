We . . . are grateful to our heavenly Father that it is as well with us as it is. We have but little provision except three papers of granola. We can get along nicely if we get some milk. . . . We have enough to keep us warm and I think we can manage to get food enough to eat until we shall be able to go either back or forward.--Letter 67, 1889, p. 2. (To Daughter Mary (Mrs. W. C. White) and Sister McOmber, June 1, 1889.)",
