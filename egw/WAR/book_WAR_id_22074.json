    "word": "MR No. 1109 - \"Preach the Word\"; Be on Guard Against Fanaticism; Take No Rash Action Against Anna Phillips' Writings\n\n     (Written April 16, 1894, from Granville, N.S.W., to \"Dear Brethren Prescott and Jones.\") \n\n\n     You may be perplexed to know just what is the best course to pursue in reference to the writings of Anna Phillips. I would suggest that nothing should be done rashly. I feel very tenderly toward this sister. I would not say or do anything to harm her. And as the writings have been so eagerly grasped and scattered broadcast with so little test and proving, let there be no abrupt moves to call them in and destroy them as if they were poison. Where they have already been sent out with the sanction of our responsible men, let them remain. To make abrupt moves now would do harm.",
