    "word": "Behold that crowd collected about some of God's servants to murder them! But the Lord is working upon the heart and mind of perhaps only one man to plead in behalf of these servants who love and fear God. When the war council has been carried on to determine the destruction of some Christian's life, on several occasions the intercession of one savage has turned the decision, and his life has been spared. Oh, the love that goes forth to the savage for this one act. To such in the judgment Christ is represented as saying, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited Me: I was in prison and ye came unto Me.\" \"Come, ye \n\n\n                                    -116- \n\nblessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Ms 79, 1897, pp. 4, 5. (\"Christ's Second Coming,\" undated.)",
