    "word": "Money and goods, houses and lands, are the Lord's, entrusted to human agents to be used for the advancement of the work of God. Those who spend this money in luxury and show are not following Christ's footsteps. Outside show and parade is the fruit of self-exaltation. This influence hinders the work the Lord desires to go forward in triumph.",
