    "word": "Brethren and sisters in Bedford, learn to suffer more. Learn to deny yourselves more. There is need of it. Die to self. Do not love your ease too much. Have energy in your daily labors and energy in the cause of God. Your reward is not here. Jesus has purchased for us an immortal inheritance, and for that we can endure anything. Oh, what love, what wondrous love has been manifested for us by the Beloved of the Father! Oh, do not, any of you, neglect the preparation necessary and finally be weighed in the balances and found wanting!--Letter 14, 1861. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 18, 1991. Entire Letter.",
