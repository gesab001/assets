    "word": "The evils which have existed in all ages will continue to exist till the close of probation. We need to understand the cause of these evils, and the modes of Satan's attacks, that we may be able to resist them. We have to meet not only men who fall into error, but principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places. Satan is battling for his empire, which the servants of God are determined to wrench from him. In this sharp warfare, for fear that errors will come into their ranks they have sometimes turned their weapons against the true messengers of God. What can keep the church from making these sad blunders, from putting light for darkness? \n\n\n                                    -119- \n\nOnly the spirit of the blessed Jesus. They cannot avoid meeting these errors and will have to deal with them, but they should never do it in a harsh manner, with a fierce, haughty, tyrannical spirit.--Letter 12, 1890, pp. 5,6,22,29,30, (To Brother and Sister Garmire, Aug. 12, 1890.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. October 27, 1982",
