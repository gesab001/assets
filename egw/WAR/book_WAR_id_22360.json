    "word": "Sharp, clear conceptions of truth will never be the reward of indolence. Investigation of every point that has been received as truth will richly repay the searcher in finding precious gems. In closely investigating every jot and tittle which we think is established truth beyond controversy, in comparing Scripture with Scripture, searching to see if there is no flaw in their interpretation, errors may be discovered. Christ would have the searcher of the Scriptures sink the shaft down deeper into the mines of truth. If the search is properly conducted, precious jewels of inestimable value will be found. The word of God is the mine of the unsearchable riches of Christ.--Manuscript 143, 1897. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. June 5, 1986. Entire Manuscript.",
