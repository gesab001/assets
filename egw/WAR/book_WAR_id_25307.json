    "word": "\"Every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\" Continue to present your requests to God; continue to ask for the blessings which you must receive from His never-failing goodness. Knock at the door of mercy and grace with a sincerity and earnestness which shows that you will continue to knock and seek until your efforts are rewarded by the bestowal of the gifts that are needed by all who perfect a Christian character. Read John 16:32, 33;  15:16,18-21.",
