    "word": "When we get your clothes and then you put on the best you have, as you do, merely to come to the office or to walk down street, you appear foolish and vain, and remarks are made about it. They think we lack good judgment in doing so much for you, but, Edson, ever remember that the outward adorning will not raise you in the estimation of any, but the inward adorning which God says is of great price is a meek and quiet spirit. Such a spirit is of value in heaven and is current among the angels of God. Strive for this. Put away show and vanity. Be a sincere Christian. Write me.--Letter 15, 1868. (To \"Dear Son Edson,\" June 17, 1868.)",
