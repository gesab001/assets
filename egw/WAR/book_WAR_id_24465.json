    "word": "If our brethren, who have been betrayed into error, now manifest the right spirit and humble their hearts before God, their mistake may prove a great blessing to them. Some of our brethren have looked to those ministers and have placed them where God should be. They have received every word from their lips., without carefully seeking the counsel of God for themselves. I thank the Lord with heart, and soul, and voice that the trial came upon men who truly loved and feared God, who would receive the warning and reproof of God, who would not refuse the correction of God like stubborn children, and wait long in resistance, as those did who were reproved at the important meeting at Minneapolis. Bro. Jones and Prescott have made it manifest that they do indeed hear the voice and accept it as from God.",
