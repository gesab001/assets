    "word": "Attention to form and ceremony should not occupy time and strength that rightfully belong to things more essential. Everything in this age of corruption is perverted to display and outward appearance, but this spirit should not find place in our schools. We should teach Bible manners, purity of thought, strict integrity. This is valuable instruction. If the teachers have the mind of Christ and are being molded by the Holy Spirit, they will be kind, attentive, and truly courteous. If they work as in the sight of heaven, they will be Christian ladies and gentlemen. Their refined bearing will be a constant object lesson to the students, who, though at first they may be somewhat uncultured, will day by day be molded by its influence.",
