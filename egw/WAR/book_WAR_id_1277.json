    "word": "23\n \n\nHome Responsibilty\n\n     Faithfulness in Home - Better Leader of the Flock--I beseech you for Christ's sake to cut away this spirit of harshness and censure.  You need a mother's tender love.  You need the Christ-love.  Then you will not chide for every mistake; you will have something of the same patience toward these lambs of the flock that Christ has manifested toward you.  Then God will accept your labors for others.  When you faithfully bear the responsibilities in your own home, you will be better prepared to bear the responsibility of feeding the flock of God and especially of manifesting the Saviour's tender care for the lambs of the flock.",
