    "word": "God keeps a reckoning with the nations. . . . In this age a more than common contempt is shown to God. Men have reached a point in insolence and disobedience which shows that their cup of iniquity is almost full. . . . The Spirit of God is being withdrawn from the earth. When the angel of mercy folds her wings and departs, Satan will do the evil deeds he has long wished to do. Storm and tempest, war and bloodshed--in these things he delights, and thus he gathers in his harvest.

From the pulpits of the popular churches will be heard the statement that the world is being punished because Sunday is not honored as it should be. . . .",
