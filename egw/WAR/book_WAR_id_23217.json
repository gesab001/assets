    "word": "You have had great light, great opportunities and privileges, in \n\n                                     -158- \n\nhaving your way so definitely marked out. A voice has been following you saying, \"This is the way, walk ye in it\" [Isaiah 30:21]. Why, oh, why, have you disregarded the voice of warning and reproof? Why did you not receive the light, and render to the Master earnest, sincere service? Had you been meek and lowly of heart, you could have reflected pure, steady beams of light upon the pathway of others. Those who receive the light that God graciously gives them, with a heart to obey, evidence a more than common sensibility. They do not in their simple, confiding trust, show weakness of character, but a strength of purpose that is of Christ.",
