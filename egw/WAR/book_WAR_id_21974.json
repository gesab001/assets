    "word": "If human agents will walk humbly with God, pressing onward and upward, the Lord will use them as channels through which He can communicate light. If they are purged from all selfishness, if they have a continual desire to work for the glory of God, they will receive increased light from the Source of all light. But God cannot connect with those who give evidence that they live to please themselves, to make themselves first. He declares that those who do this will in the end be last of all.--Letter 49a, 1896, p. 9. (To the workers in the Echo office, September, 1896.)",
