    "word": "I believe if our ministering brethren would only read the testimonies that the Lord has graciously given them, that they would reveal a different spirit. God will hold them accountable for neglect and disregard of the light which he has given them. . . . You have had too many burdens upon you, but I tell you in love that the Lord has not been pleased with the spirit of warfare you have had on health reform. Had you been a health reformer in deed and truth, you would have had much better health and escaped many perils. God has given light upon this subject, but you have worked away from the light, and your influence has been opposed to the work that the Lord would do for this people upon this point. You have stood directly in the way of the work of God in health reform. You have suffered sickness because your habits in eating and in labor have not been according to the light which God has given to His people. I am sorry that I have to write in reference to these things as I do. Had you appreciated and heeded the light which the Lord has given us, you would not now be confused in judgment, and so enfeebled in nerve and brain power. You attribute your sickness to erroneous causes. . . . Your health is shattered, but do not allow your mind to take a wrong bias; for when you once get set in the wrong direction it will be difficult for you to change. You have been doing this, little by little, for years. . . . I want to be in harmony with God and in harmony with you. I want you to fall on the Rock and be broken. Let self die; let Christ be enthroned in the heart. . . . Jesus loves you and will work for you and gather you in His strong arms.--Letter 18, 1888, pp. 3, 4, 6. (To Brother and Sister Butler, December 11, 1888.) \n\n\n                                    -39-",
