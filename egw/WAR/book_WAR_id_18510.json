    "word": "\"Some ministers fail of success because they do not give their undivided interest to the work, when very much depends upon persistent, well-directed labor. \n\n\n                        -14- \n\nMany are not laborers; they do-not pursue their work outside of the pulpit. They shirk the duty of going from house to house, and laboring wisely in the home circle. They need to cultivate that rare Christian courtesy which would render them kind and considerate toward the souls under their care, working for them with true earnestness and faith, teaching them the way of life.\"--P. 72. \n\n                                               -",
