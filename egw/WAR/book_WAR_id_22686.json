    "word": "Jesus loves His children, even if they err. They belong to Jesus, and we are to treat them as the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ.

He keeps His eye upon them, and when they do their best, calling upon God for His help, be assured the service will be accepted, although imperfect.",
