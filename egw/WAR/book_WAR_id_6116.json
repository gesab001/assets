    "word": "He who is seeking to qualify himself for the sacred work of God should be careful not to place himself on the enemy's ground, but should choose the society of those who will help him to obtain divine knowledge. God suffered John, the beloved disciple, to be exiled to Patmos, where he was separated from the world's bustle and strife, shut away from every outside influence, and even the work that he loved. Then the Lord could commune with him, opening before him the closing scenes in this world's history. John the Baptist made his home in the wilderness, there to receive of God the message he was to bear, to prepare the way for the Coming One. So far as consistent, we should shun every influence which would tend to divert the mind from the work of God. And those especially who are young in faith and experience should beware that they do not in self-confidence place themselves in the way of temptation.",
