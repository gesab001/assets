    "word": "The weight of the wrath of God will fall upon those who have misspent their time and served mammon instead of their Creator. If you live for God and heaven, pointing out the way of life to others, you will go onward and upward to higher and holier joys. You will be rewarded with the \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" The joy of Christ was that of seeing souls redeemed and saved in His glorious kingdom. \"Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\"",
