    "word": "MR No. 399 - Our Duty Toward the Jews\n\n     Before His ascension to heaven, Jesus, with hands outstretched in blessing on His disciples, gave them their commission: \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;\" \"and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Repentance and remission of sins were to be preached in His name among all nations, but the work was to begin at Jerusalem. Before going out into new fields of labor, the disciples of Christ were to give the message to the people living in their own country. Home missions were to receive their first attention.",
