    "word": "In the mountains, Colorado, Sunday, September 21, 1873. It was a severe night, and today the storm is over and it is very pleasant. We devoted the day to earnestly seeking the Lord. We had our hearts melted and broken before Him. We see a great work to be done and we know that we are not fitted for the work. We have too little spiritual strength. We must have help from God. We want a right spirit renewed within us. My husband and myself went up upon a high hill where it was warmed by the rays of the sun, and in full view of the snow-covered mountains we prayed to God for His blessing. I earnestly desire to do the will of God. We had some comfort in the Lord and felt, both of us, to resolve to be more careful of each other's feelings and to ever treat each other with becoming respect and dignity. We both wept before the Lord and felt deeply humbled before Him.",
