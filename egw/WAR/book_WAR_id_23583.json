    "word": "Moses lifted up his hands toward heaven when Israel and the opposing power were in warfare. Before all Israel he stood with his hands uplifted toward heaven. As soon as they began to drop the enemy gained the victory, and every time his hands were uplifted toward heaven the forces of Israel gained the victory. So Aaron and Hur stood on each side and held his hands toward heaven as a symbol, signifying that he was laying hold of the God of heaven as they must do. They must stretch their arms toward heaven. Christ is their helper.",
