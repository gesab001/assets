    "word": "Evangelizing the Cities--The unwarned multitudes are fast becoming the sport of the evil one. Satan is leading them into many forms of folly and self-pleasing. Many are seeking for that which is novel and startling. Their minds are far from God and the truths of His Word. At this time, when the enemy is working as never before to engross the minds of men and women and turn them from the truth, we should be laboring with increasing activity in the highways and also in the byways. Diligently, interestedly, we are to proclaim the last message of mercy in the cities--the highways--and the work is not to end there, but is to extend into the surrounding settlements and in the country districts--into the byways and the hedges. All classes are to be reached. As we labor we shall meet with various nationalities. None are to be passed by, unwarned. The Lord Jesus was the gift of God to the entire world--not to the higher classes alone, and not to any one nationality to the exclusion of others. His saving grace encircles the whole world. Whosoever will, may drink of the water of life freely.--Letter 4, 1911, p. 3. (To W. C. White, Feb. 15, 1911.)",
