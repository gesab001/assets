    "word": "Manuscript 147, 1904. (Diary entry for Nov. 23, 1904, San Diego, Calif.)

R.] Palmer informed me the second stream of water had come as large as his hand. I have never seen work carried forward with greater faith and hopefulness. All are of good courage, and the poor, drying up, dying trees are beseeching us by their appearance for refreshing streams of water.",
