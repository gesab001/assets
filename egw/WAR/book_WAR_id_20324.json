    "word": "Nothing can weaken a church so manifestly as division and strife, and if this does exist, nothing can so war against the truth, and against Jesus Christ, as this spirit. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" \"Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom\" [James 3:11-13].",
