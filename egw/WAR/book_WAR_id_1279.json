    "word": "Your position binds you under the most sacred obligations to be very careful what kind of a spirit you entertain towards your brethren.  They are acting a part in God's cause as well as yourself.  Will not God teach them and guide them as well as yourself?  You are not even to allow yourself to think unkindly of them, much less to climb upon the judgment seat and censure and condemn your brethren, when you may be yourself, in many respects, more deserving of censure than they.  Your work is bearing the inspection of God.--Letter 21, 1888, pp. 10, 11 (Oct. 14, 1888 to Brother Butler).",
