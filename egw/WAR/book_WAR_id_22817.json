    "word": "The close study of Daniel's visions and warnings is essential. The first words of the Revelation mean, not a book closed, but a book opened. Where did John get the light? Did it originate with the aged disciple?--No. \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to shew unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass; and He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John: who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein\" [Revelation 1:1-3]. \n\n\n                                    -167-",
