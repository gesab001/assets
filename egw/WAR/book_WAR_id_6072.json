    "word": "Said Christ to his apostles: \u201cBehold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake.\u201d \u201cYe shall be hated of all men for my name's sake; but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\u201d \u201cThe disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord.\u201d",
