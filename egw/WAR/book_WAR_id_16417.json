    "word": "C. T. & B. H.--53-54 \n     The apostle Peter understood the relation between the mind and the body, and raised his voice in warning to his brethren: \"Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\" Many regard this text as a warning against licentiousness only; but it has a broader meaning. It forbids every injurious gratification of appetite or passion. Every perverted appetite becomes a warring lust. Appetite was given us for a good purpose, not to become the minister of death by being perverted, and thus degenerating into \"lusts which war against the soul.\" . . .",
