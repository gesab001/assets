    "word": "God loves the soul of Doctor Osborn. He is a man who, if converted soul and body to God, would do good. The Master has entrusted him with talents of influence and means. He has made him His steward and He will ere long require him to give an account of his stewardship. Many souls will come to the knowledge of the truth through his efforts to spread the publications. There are a large circle of his acquaintances and relatives to whom he can be the means of presenting the truth, some of whom will receive it.",
