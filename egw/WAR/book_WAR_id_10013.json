    "word": "Paul and the other apostles, and all the righteous who have lived since then, have acted their part in the building of the temple. But the structure is not yet complete. We who are living in this age have a work to do, a part to act. We are to bring to the foundation material that will stand the test of fire--gold, silver, and precious stones, \"polished after the similitude of a palace\" (Psalm 144:12). To those who thus build for God, Paul speaks words of encouragement. . . : \"If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.\" . . . The Christian who faithfully presents the word of life, leading men and women into the way of holiness and peace, is bringing to the foundation material that will endure, and in the kingdom of God He will be honored as a wise builder.--The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 598, 599.",
