    "word": "\u201cThe next morning we consulted together whether to return to Rochester, or go on. The family who had entertained us said we would bury the child on the road. And to all appearance it would be so. But I dared not go back to Rochester. We believed the affliction of the child was the work of Satan to hinder us from traveling, and we dared not yield to him. I said to my husband, \u2018If we go back I shall expect the child to die. He can but die if we go forward. Let us proceed on our journey trusting in the Lord.\u2019 We had a journey before us of about one hundred miles to perform in two days, yet we believe that the Lord would work for us in this time of extremity. I was much exhausted and feared I should fall asleep and let the child fall from my arms, so I laid him upon my lap and tied him to my waist and we both slept that day over much of the distance. The child revived and continued to gain strength the whole journey and we brought him home quite rugged.",
