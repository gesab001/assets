Often their letters were focused on this work.\nDear children Edson and Emma,\n     I have been waiting anxiously for a letter from you, my son. There have been so many accidents on the road lately, and the trains have been so long delayed that I\n107\nhave been somewhat troubled on your account. I know that you have been sick in body and worried in mind.",
