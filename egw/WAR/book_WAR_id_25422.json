You have chosen your own way, and mingled self with your work, and have become less and less sensible of the danger to your own self and to the work. You have come to think that you were the one to whom credit should be given for the matter that comes from your hands. I have had warnings concerning this, but could not see how I could come to the very point. . . . \n\n\n                                         Ellen G. White \n\n                                               -",
