    "word": "Satan must deceive in order to lead away. \"In vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.\" Underhand work must be done; a deceiving influence must be exerted; false pretenses must be set forth as truth; suspicion must be lulled to sleep. Satan will clothe temptation and sin with the garments of righteousness, and by this deception he will win many to his side. Christ pronounced Satan a liar and a murderer. Oh, that unwary souls would learn wisdom from God.",
