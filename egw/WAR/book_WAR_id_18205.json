For many years light has been given me regarding the value of medical missionary work, and the necessity of establishing sanitariums in chosen places, where their work and influence will tell for the advancement of the truth. Institutions in which medical missionary work can be done are to be regarded as especially essential to the advancement of the Lord's work. The sick and suffering are to be relieved, and then, as opportunity offers, they are to be given instruction regarding the truth for this time. Thus we can bring present truth before a class of people who could be reached in no other way.",
