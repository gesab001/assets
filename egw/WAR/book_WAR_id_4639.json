    "word": "Some have thought it an evidence of intellectual keenness and superiority to perplex minds in regard to what is truth. They resort to subtlety of  argument, to playing upon words; they take unjust advantage in asking questions. When their questions have been fairly answered, they will turn the subject, bring up another point, to avoid acknowledging the truth. We should beware of indulging the spirit which controlled the Jews. They would not learn of Christ, because his explanation of the Scriptures did not agree with their ideas; therefore they became spies upon his track, \u201claying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.\u201d [Luke 11:54, 52.] Let us not bring upon ourselves the fearful denunciation of the Saviour's words, \u201cWoe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.\u201d [Luke 11:54, 52.]",
