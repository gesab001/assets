    "word": "But Peter was converted, and then after the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, when before the rulers, he boldly declared for Jesus, and charged the rulers with these words: \"But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; and killed the Prince of life.\" There Peter shows himself entirely a different man after his conversion, than the self-confident, boasting Peter prior to his conversion. I presented before them the voice of the world, the enemies of Christ, saying to Christ's messengers, \"Ye should not teach in this name,\" and \"bring this man's blood upon us.\" Did these threatenings succeed? did it make cowards of the witnesses of Christ? -- No; they proclaimed the \n\n\n                      - 7 - \n\nmessage given them of God; and they were shut up in prison, and God sent his angels to release them. The angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said, \"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.\" This voice from the heavenly angels was directly opposite to that voice from the authorities, and which should they obey? \"Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay him.\" Then Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, pleaded in behalf of the apostles, and his words prevailed. Well, this is a little part of the words the Lord gave me to speak to the people.",
