    "word": "These words of Christ should sink into the hearts of all who believe present truth: \"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.\" Our danger is presented before us by Christ Himself. He knew the perils we should meet in these last days, and would have us prepare for them. \"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.\" They were eating and drinking, planting and building, marrying and giving in marriage, and knew not until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the Flood came and swept them all away. The day of God will find men absorbed in like manner in the business and pleasures of the world, in feasting and gluttony, and in indulging perverted appetite in the defiling use of liquor and the narcotic tobacco. This is already the condition of our world, and these indulgences are found even among God's professed people, some of whom are following the customs and partaking of the sins of the world. Lawyers, mechanics, farmers, traders, and even ministers from the pulpit are crying, \"Peace and safety,\" when destruction is fast coming upon them.",
