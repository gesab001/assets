    "word": "MR No. 590 - Give the Message in Simple Language\n\n     I feel more thankful than I can express for the interest my workers have taken in the preparation of this book [Acts of the Apostles], that its truths might be presented in the clear and simple language which the Lord has charged me never to depart from in any of my writings. The Lord has been good to me in sending me intelligent, understanding workers. I appreciate highly their interest, and the encouragement I have had in preparing this book for the people. I trust that it will have a large circulation. Our people need all the light that the Lord has been pleased to send, that they may be encouraged and strengthened for their labors in proclaiming the message of warning in these last days.",
