I might write you much more upon this, but I will pursue my narrative of my journey. Our first day out from Basel at noon we halted under the wide-spread branches of a grand old oak. W. C. W. unharnessed Dolly, and John Vuilleumier brushed her down, using hay \n\n\n                                    -22- \n\nas a curry-comb, then left her to eat grass, which privilege she enjoyed, if we can judge from appearance. A bed was made for me on the grass. I had been sick for several days, and the proposition was made to defer the journey until the next week, [my] being unable, as they thought, to travel. This day, the twentieth of May, was very warm. I decided to undertake the journey, and if it was impossible for me to travel safely, to return to Basel. I was very weak, but my rest in sleep did me good.",
