    "word": "My brother, do not feel that it is below your dignity to make a decided change. You must place yourself at the feet of Christ as a learner, else you will surely fail of obtaining the overcomer's reward. Lay off your commanding, kingly authority, and become one of God's little children. Until you are willing to study and obey God's will, you will be overcome by temptations, and led to do strange things, which will disqualify you for filling a position of influence.",
