    "word": "God has given Dr. Kellogg every encouragement to believe that the heavenly angels would be by his side if he would pursue a right course. But notwithstanding the warnings and reproofs which have been given him, he has persistently followed his own way. He is now demonstrating the truth of the warnings which have been given him. He has not done what he might have done as God's steward to build up the work in solid lines, that it might in the highest degree represent Christ. He has been diverted from the right way. He has deceived himself and those who are associated with him. I would warn him again of the danger of the road over which he is traveling. God has given no mortal man license to judge his delegated ministers in the way Dr. Kellogg has judged \n\n\n                                -38- \n\nthem. Dr. Kellogg has no more right to judge the ministers than the ministers have to judge him.",
