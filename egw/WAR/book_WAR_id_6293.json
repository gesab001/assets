    "word": "When the farmers seek to recommend or exhibit their products, they do not gather up the poorest but the best specimens. The women possess a zeal to bring the very best golden lumps of butter, molded and prettily stamped. The men bring the best yield of vegetables of every kind. The very best and most attractive fruit is brought, and their appearance does the skillful workers credit. The variety of fruits--the apples, peaches, apricots, oranges, lemons, and plums-- all these are very attractive. . . . No one would bring the most dwarfed specimens, but the very choicest which the land can produce.",
