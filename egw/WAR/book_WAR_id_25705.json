    "word": "That which to me seemed the greatest mystery of all was the striking contrast between \u2014\u2014- and Huntsville. At \u2014\u2014- the school and the sanitarium have been built up substantially by friends both in the North and in the South. The \u2014\u2014brethren and sisters have given much toward the erection and equipment of good buildings. The \u2014\u2014- community has an appearance of thrift and prosperity. This is as it should be. But I could not understand how those there, who have known of the destitution of a sister institution at Huntsville, have been content to continue building up their home institutions, without doing something for the training-school for colored people.",
