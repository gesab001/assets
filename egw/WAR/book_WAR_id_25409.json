    "word": "I cannot endorse the course Brother_____has pursued. He has not written one word to me, to see if God has given any light in these matters; yet he has presented them in public, making manifest his confidence in them. The fact that Brother _____has been presenting precious light to the people, leads them to regard all he says as if inspired of God, else Brother_____would not present them as he has done, I cannot see wisdom in this course. More clearly than do my Brethren I discern the inwardness of this thing, and the results that will follow. I have already made decided statements in reference to this matter, and I am sorry it has been brought in as it has, to do a work which will cast reflections upon the testimonies God has given. Where these so-called revelations are accepted, they will surely lead many into erroneous, precipitate action. I am burdened over these things.",
