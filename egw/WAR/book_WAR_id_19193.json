    "word": "It is manifesting great ingratitude toward God to dwell upon the dark side of affairs, and let the shadows of despair shut from our souls the Sun of Righteousness. Sorrow comes and goes; it is the lot of man; we should not seek to magnify it, but rather dwell upon that which is bright and pleasant. When winter spreads its icy covering over the earth, we do not let our gladness freeze up with the flowers and brooks, and continually mourn because of the dismal days, and the chilling winds. On the other hand, we reach forward in imagination to the coming summer, with its warmth, and life, and beauty. Meanwhile we enjoy all the sunshine that comes to us, and find much comfort, in spite of the cold and snow, while we are waiting for nature to put on her fresh, bright garments of rejoicing.",
