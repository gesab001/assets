    "word": "I feel so distressed over the matter of Elder Olsen going on and on in the face of so great light. How he can be excusable I cannot define. He has acted like a blind man, like a man dazed. There can be no spiritual union between a man who puts his entire trust in God and a man who is walking contrary to God. Their hearts, their sympathies and feelings cannot sympathize upon the most momentous of all topics, the Holy Spirit's manifestation. \"Ask and ye shall receive.\" \"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?\" The Lord was anxious to do more, much more, for His people than they could conceive of, in His benevolence toward man, His unexampled love as opposed to their limited conceptions of His goodness.",
