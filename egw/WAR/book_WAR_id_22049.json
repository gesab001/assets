    "word": "Read the words of Christ in Matthew 23:23: \"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin, and \n\n\n                                  -117- \n\nhave omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.\" These denunciations are given as a warning to all who \"outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within\" \"are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\" They say, We are delivered to do all these things. They also say, \"If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. \"Wherefore,\" said Jesus, \"ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.\" What lessons are here; how fearful and decisive! Jesus said, \"Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city.\" This prophecy was literally fulfilled by the Jews in their treatment of Christ and of the messengers whom God sent to them. Will men in these last days follow the example of those whom Christ condemned?",
