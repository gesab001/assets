    "word": "I have donated my horse, for which I paid $175; my carriage, for which I paid $110; my harness, for which I paid thirty dollars. I have had these in use a little more than one year. They may sell them and get what they can to invest in the house of worship. I pledged also $100 towards a meetinghouse in Bienne. We can see no other way to do than to build houses of worship, and our brethren must begin to work themselves into houses under their control as tenement houses.--Manuscript 31, 1887, pp. 3-5.
