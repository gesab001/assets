    "word": "Think how great was the light that was given to the Jews, and yet they rejected the Lord of life and glory. Jesus says, \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin. . . . If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.\" The light became brighter and brighter, until there was no escaping the conclusion that Christ was no ordinary teacher; but when conviction is disregarded, when evidence is rejected, men are forced to take a position of active opposition and stubborn resistance. The Spirit of God followed the impenitent, with warnings and entreaties, the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness illuminated the mind; but many refuse the compassion of a loving Saviour, and would not permit their hearts to break and melt under the beams of his love. They refused the message of mercy, refused to do what God required in the way that God required, and their offerings were as devoid of merit as were the offerings of Cain; for they mingled not with them the virtue of the blood of a crucified and risen Saviour.",
