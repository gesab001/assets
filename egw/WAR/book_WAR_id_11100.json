    "word": "Chapter 18 \n\n     1-3 (2 Corinthians 10:1, 7, 8; see EGW on Acts 20:17-35). The Apostles Counseled Over Methods of Labor.--When Paul came to Corinth, he solicited work from Aquila. The apostles counseled and prayed together, and decided that they would preach the gospel as it should be preached, in disinterested love for the souls who were perishing for lack of knowledge. Paul would work at tentmaking, and teach his fellow laborers to work with their hands, so that in any emergency they could support themselves. Some of his ministering brethren presented such a course as inconsistent, saying that by so doing they would lose their influence as ministers of the gospel. The tenth chapter of Second Corinthians records the difficulties Paul had to contend with, and his vindication of his course. God had placed special honor upon Paul. He had given him his credentials, and had laid upon him weighty responsibility. And the apostle writes, \"I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you,\"-- because he humbled himself to do mechanical work--\"but being absent am bold toward you\" [2 Corinthians 10:7, 8 quoted] (RH March 6, 1900).",
