    "word": "The Lord has given warnings, He has presented principles that it is necessary for every Christian to heed, and bring into his practical life.

Those who do not place their dependence upon God will certainly be overthrown by the enemy. Satan is working by every conceivable device to keep in his own ranks those who claim to be on the Lord's side. He can blind their eyes until they will call light darkness, and darkness light. . . .",
