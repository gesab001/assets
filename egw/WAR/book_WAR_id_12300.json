When Jesus pointed his followers to these signs, he foretold also the existing state of worldliness and backsliding, and gave warning of the result to those who refused to arouse from their careless security: \"Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.\" \"If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\" [Revelation 3:1, 3.] \n                                                                           196",
