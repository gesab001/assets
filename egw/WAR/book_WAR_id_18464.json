    "word": "We are not our own. We have been bought with a price. We are pledged by our baptismal vows to work for God. We are to remember that our money is not to be spent selfishly, but that all we can spare is to be used to advance the work of God. Our every word and act is to be in accordance with the will of God, that we may be enabled to render our account with a conscience void of offense toward God or man.",
