    "word": "You need to have that love of Christ in your heart, and then you will win your way, but when any wrong exists among your brethren, you handle it in such a way that it creates in the one whom you think wrong a spirit of resistance and defiance. You have not woven into your work the love, the compassion, and the tenderness of Christ. Had you done this, had you encircled_____with your love, had you bound him to your heart with the tender bonds of affection, you would have saved him. But you let him drift away, inwardly glad that you would have no more perplexity over his case.",
