C. \n                                               May 28, 1905 \n\nDear Brother Burden: \n\n\n     When you wrote to me about the advisability of purchasing the property known as \"Loma Linda\", I did not consult with anyone, because I thought this would hinder us, and I believed that we could carry the matter forward without putting the burden on the Conference. We do not desire to bring perplexity upon the Conference regarding this matter. Be assured, my brother, that I never advance anything unless I have a decided impression that it should be carried out, and unless I am firmly resolved to assist.",
