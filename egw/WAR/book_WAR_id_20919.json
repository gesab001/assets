    "word": "I was bidden to look and behold what continuous efforts had been put forth and how precious time and money had been consumed in educating ministers in Bible truth, and instructing them how to work, and yet how small a number had responded to the light that had been given; how few had been led to tremble at the word, and to arouse from their dormant, sluggish, spiritual state, to take in the fact that there is a world to be warned, and that there are souls who are perishing out of Christ. The sanction of heaven cannot be given to misuse of light and truth or to spiritual inactivity. Of those who have not improved their privileges it is written in the books of heaven, \"Thou wicked and slothful servant, . . . thou oughtest therefore to have put My money to the exchangers, and then at My coming I should have received Mine own with usury.\" Matthew 25:26, 27. Those who have been privileged to have the truth brought before them, should, irrespective of circumstances, receive the truth into good and honest hearts, and go to work as faithful stewards of the grace of Christ.",
