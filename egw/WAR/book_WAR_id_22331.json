    "word": "Those who are employed as teachers should become intelligent in regard to the philosophy of health, that they may know how to preserve their own health, and to help others. Through the overloading of digestive organs the brain is made to suffer. When a great variety of food is taken into the stomach at one meal, the result is that there is confusion of thought, inability to retain ideas, or to understand instruction. Many teachers and pupils, for this cause, feel that they are overworked. But their overwork was caused by the unnecessary burden of food which was placed upon the stomach, and which taxed the entire forces of the system. When teachers are in this condition they are in danger of making unwise decisions, which do much harm. Through the overloading of the digestive organs, the teacher becomes dyspeptic, and manifests impatience toward the pupils.",
