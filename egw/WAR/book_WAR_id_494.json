    "word": "Chap. 2 - The Call of the Cities\n\n                         Who Are Called \n\n     From the light that God has given me, I know that His cause today is in great need of the living representative of Bible truth. The ordained ministers, alone, are not equal to the task. God is calling Bible workers, and other consecrated laymen of varied talent who have a knowledge of present truth, to consider the needs of the unwarned cities. There should be one hundred believers actively engaged in personal missionary work where now there is but one. Time is rapidly passing. There is much work to be done before satanic opposition shall close up the way. Every agency must be set in operation, that present opportunities may be wisely improved.--Medical Ministry, p. 248.",
