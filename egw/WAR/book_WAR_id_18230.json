    "word": "Yet God's purpose can not be thwarted. In regard to the way and means or the men by whom His purposes are to be carried out, His understanding is infinite. He can not err, nor be in perplexity. He will not alter the word that He has spoken. His goodness and truth are eternal, and He will honor those who will walk humbly with Him.",
