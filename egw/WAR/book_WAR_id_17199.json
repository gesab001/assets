    "word": "The light of truth must shine forth to the world. Those who love God and keep his commandments are called to aggressive warfare, not against one another, but against the armies of the invisible foe.

At no time are those who claim to be Christ's disciples to feel at ease in their church capacity, content to do nothing to rescue fallen human beings, and bring them back to their loyalty.",
