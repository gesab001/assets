    "word": "There are those who are premature in their desire to reform things that to them appear to be faulty. They think that they should be chosen to take the place of those who have made mistakes. They undervalue what these workers have done while others were looking on and criticizing. By their actions they say, \"I can do great things. I can carry the work forward successfully.\" To those who think they know so well how to avoid mistakes, I am instructed to say, \"Judge not, that ye be not judged. You might avoid mistakes on one point, but in other things you would make grave blunders, which would be very difficult to remedy, and which would bring confusion into the work. These mistakes might do more harm than the mistakes your brethren have made.\"",
