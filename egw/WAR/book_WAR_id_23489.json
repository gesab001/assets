    "word": "Letter 104, 1896, entire letter. (To Eld. I. N. Williams, President of the Pennsylvania Conference [Caldwell's home conference], April 12, 1896.)--We have had great trouble of mind in regard to Bro. W. F. Caldwell, who expects to return to America by this month's boat. He has shown a fondness for the society of young girls, and has been full of gaiety, conducting himself like a boy. About a year ago, at the suggestion of my son, W. C. White, I employed him to run the typewriter for [Fannie Bolton], as she read the manuscript to him. But soon I became burdened; warnings were given to me again and again. I talked with him by himself in regard to his freedom and enjoyment in the society of young women and his frivolous conduct, but he said he had always been sociable with young ladies, and thought it no harm. We wanted to help him; for he had no money, and but very poor clothing. He has good ability, and might have developed into a competent helper for W. C. or a worker for me; but I dared not have him remain a member of my family.",
