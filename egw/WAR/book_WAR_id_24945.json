    "word": "The workers connected with our medical institutions should have the full confidence of the patients. Let them remember that this will be gained, not by elegant dress or by smartness of speech, but by living the life of Christ. Warm-hearted, unselfish workers are needed in our sanitariums, -- workers who can speak words of tenderness and compassion to the sick and suffering. The physicians and nurses are not to be stiff and unsocial, neither are they to be light (62) and trifling. They are to be bright and cheerful, bringing sunshine to the hearts of the sick. They are to talk of the Saviour and His power to save. In Him there is healing for soul and body.",
