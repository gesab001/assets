    "word": "Chap. 11 - Plans For Our Publishing Work.\n\n     While at Fresno I passed through a peculiar experience. In the night season I was in an assembly where a number of the brethren were in council. There seemed to be a cloud over the company. I could not distinguish faces, but I could hear voices. At first I could not understand what was said. Afterward I heard plans outlined in regard to the way in which the publishing work should be carried on. The assertion was made that this work should be placed on a surer basis; that changes should be made; that the plans which in past years were formulated for the advancement of the publishing work would have to be remodeled; that it was a wrong policy which had led to the development of the printing and publishing of books in so many places; that the Echo Office and the Nashville Office were too large; and that the work, if wisely adjusted, would be so arranged that the greater part of the printing and publishing of our larger books would be done at Battle Creek.",
