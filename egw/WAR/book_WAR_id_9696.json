    "word": "Stifle Wrong Principles.--There has been an effort to bring God's servants under the control of men who have not the knowledge and wisdom of God or an experience under the Holy Spirit's guidance. Principles have been born that should never have seen the light of day....Finite men have been warring against God and the truth and the Lord's chosen messengers, counterworking them by every means they dared to use. Please consider what virtue there can be in the wisdom and plans of those who have slighted God's messages and, like the scribes and Pharisees, have despised the very men whom God has used to present light and truth which His people needed.... A wrong against the weakest or most erring of His flock is even more offensive to God than if it were against the strongest one among you.--Lt 83, 1896.",
