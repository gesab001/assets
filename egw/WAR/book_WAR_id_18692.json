    "word": "About three years ago I was shown that as yet there was no one who could supply Dr. Kellogg's place. This state of things should not be. The power, and tact, and knowledge of the Doctor should be employed in training as far as possible men who will help him, and who could carry on the work he is now doing should he be obliged to leave, to have needed rest and change. No one should be intrusted with this work who will not obey the light God has given in regard to hygienic principles, hygienic diet. Some practicing physicians do not now sense the necessity of keeping up the standard. It is so much easier to slip back \n\n\n                           -31- \n\ninto the old rut of selfish indulgence, gratification of appetite, free, loose manners, showing preference for the society of girls, and introducing a courting spirit. A spirit of reserve in this direction should be constantly encouraged, rather than of free, easy, careless indulgence. It is the spirit of the age to despise restraint, to desire to follow inclination, to jest and joke, and be jolly in amusement with young ladies; and the result has been wrecks of character, encouragement to impurity, licentiousness, immorality, and marriages which have ruined the usefulness and efficiency of men and women who had ability and talents, but who have been unable to rise to any noble heights after their unwise marriages. Thus the wheels of progress have been blocked, the powers of the mind dwarfed. I utter my earnest warning and protest against the familiar association of young men and women who intend to connect with our Sanitarium. If they want to be men of God, let them deny their inclination, and devote their God-given powers to doing good and being a blessing to society. Let them consecrate themselves unreservedly to God, to save perishing souls.",
