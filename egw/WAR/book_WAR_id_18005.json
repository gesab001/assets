    "word": "Teachers, tell your students that the Lord Jesus Christ has made every provision that they should go onward, conquering and to conquer. Lead them to trust in the divine promise: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth [talks faith one moment, and acts unbelief the next] is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive \n\n\n                     - 35 - \n\nanything of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.\" James 1:5-8.",
