    "word": "\"The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven \n\n                      - 11 - \n\nwith his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power: when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.\" Selfish characteristics do not reveal the glory of God, and cannot be practised by those who are truly united to Christ. There is to be straightforward action in all things. When the people of God begin to walk apart from him, their actions testify that they are not eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God, that they are not one in spirit with Christ. \"A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.\" There is among us a leaven of disregard for spiritual and holy practices.",
