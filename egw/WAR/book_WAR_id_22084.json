    "word": "MR No. 1111 - The Value of Organization; Avoid Extravagant Expressions; Do Not Call Attention to Writings of Anna Phillips\n\n     (Written January 14, 1894, from Melbourne, Victoria, to A. T. Jones.) \n\n     I have received letters from some in America stating that you have endorsed Anna Phillips' revelations, and that you read them to the people, giving the people the impression that you are reading from the testimonies of Sister White; and afterwards they learn that it is an entirely different matter. I want you to consider this carefully, for the Lord has given me light to the effect that the attention of the people is not to be called to Anna Phillips. God has spoken His words through testimonies, and the late claims that Elder Rice is making so much of are not to be presented to the people, for these claims are not true. I am sorry you have done this.",
