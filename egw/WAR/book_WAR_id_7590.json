    "word": "Chap. 99 - Spirit of Sacrifice\n\n     The spirit of covetousness, of seeking for the highest position and the highest wage, is rife in the world. The old-time spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifice is too seldom met with. But this is the only spirit that can actuate a true follower of Jesus. Our divine Master has given us an example of how we are to work. And to those whom He bade, \"Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men,\" He offered no stated sum as a reward for their services. They were to share with Him His self-denial and sacrifice.",
