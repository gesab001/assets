    "word": "I was shown the case of Brother M. His interest is in the truth and he considers nothing too dear to sacrifice for the truth. I was pointed back to a certain time and saw that he had done more than God required of him, which has caused him embarrassment. He moved too strongly. He saw that there was need for something to be done and was disgusted by the slow course of those who could do something. Their unwillingness grieved him. He saw that the lack must be supplied and he moved strongly and the burden was not equally divided. Brethren G, W, L, and J should not have been so backward, but should have shared the burdens at the very time they ought to be borne. Brother M became impatient and his brethren were grieved with him, but their error was greater than his. Brethren J and L have not been as willing to bear their part of the burdens as they should have been. This lack injures their own souls. They must prize the truth above everything else, and be willing to sacrifice for the truth.--Ms 4, 1860. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. March 12, 1986. Entire Manuscript.",
