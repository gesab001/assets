    "word": "How to Preserve Our Sensibilities [TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH, VOL. 3, PP. 50-52 (1871).] \n\n\n     God created man a little lower than the angels and bestowed upon him attributes that will, if properly used, make him a blessing to the world and cause him to reflect the glory to the Giver. But although made in the image of God, man has, through intemperance, violated principle and God's law in his physical nature. Intemperance of any kind benumbs the perceptive organs and so weakens the brain nerve power that eternal things are not appreciated, but placed upon a level with the common. The higher powers of the mind, designed for elevated purposes, are brought into slavery to the baser passions. If our physical habits are not right, our mental and moral powers cannot be strong; for great sympathy exists between the physical and the moral. The apostle Peter understood this and raised his voice of warning to his brethren: \"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\" 1 Peter 2:11. . . .",
