    "word": "If those who deal with the erring had hearts full of the milk of human kindness, what a different spirit would prevail in our churches! May the Lord open the eyes and soften the hearts of those who have a harsh, unforgiving, unrelenting spirit toward those whom they think in error. Such men dishonor their office and dishonor God. They grieve the hearts of His children, and compel them to cry unto Him in their distress. The Lord will surely judge for these things.",
