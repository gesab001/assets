    "word": "Goliath disdained David; for his appearance was that of a mere youth untaught in the tactics of warfare. Goliath railed upon David, and cursed him by his gods. He felt that it was an insult upon his dignity to have a mere stripling, without armor, come to meet him. He made his boast of what he would do to him. David did not become irritated because he was looked upon as so inferior, neither did he tremble at the giant's terrible threats, but replied, \u201cThou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.\u201d [1 Samuel 17:45, 47.] David tells Goliath that in the name of the Lord he will do to him the very things that Goliath had threatened to do to David. \u201cAnd all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.\u201d",
