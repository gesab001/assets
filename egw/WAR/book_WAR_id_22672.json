    "word": "A Call to Repentance. There is work to be done in our cities, work to be done in every place. God will take men from the plough, from the sheepfold, from the vineyard, and will put them in the place of those who think that they must have the highest wages. Those who grasp high wages will find in the money they get all the reward they will ever receive. Such ones cannot be expected to feel a burden for the salvation of perishing souls. The Lord wants no such workers. Until they banish selfishness from their hearts, their efforts are worthless. The Lord will take out of the way those workers who are not moving forward in His lines.",
