    "word": "God demands more of us than we are willing to give Him. None are to be forward or obtrusive, but we are quietly to live out our religion, with an eye single to the glory of God. \"Learn of Me,\" says Christ; \"for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" Then we shall shine as lights in the world, without noise or friction. None need fail; for One is with them who is wise in counsel, excellent in working, and mighty to accomplish His designs. He works through His agents, seen and unseen, human and divine. This work is a grand work, and will be carried forward to the glory of God if all who are connected with it will make their works correspond to their profession of faith. Purity of thought must \n\n\n                     -9- \n\nbe cherished as indispensable to the work of influencing others. The soul must be surrounded by a pure, holy atmosphere--an atmosphere that will tend to quicken the spiritual life of all who inhale it.",
