    "word": "Purposes of infinite mercy were reaching their fulfillment, even through the disappointment of the disciples. While their hearts had been won by the divine grace and power of His teaching, who \u201cspake as never man spake,\u201d yet intermingled with the pure gold of their love for Jesus, was the base alloy of worldly pride and selfish ambitions. Even in the passover chamber, at that solemn hour when their Master was already entering the shadow of Gethsemane, there was \u201ca strife among them, which of them should be accounted greatest.\u201d [Luke 22:24.] Their vision was filled with the throne, the crown, and the glory, while just before them lay the shame and agony of the garden, the judgment-hall, the cross of Calvary. It was their pride of heart, their thirst for worldly glory, that had led them to cling so tenaciously to \n349\nthe false teaching of their time, and to pass unheeded the Saviour's words showing the true nature of his kingdom, and pointing forward to his agony and death. And these errors resulted in the trial\u2014sharp but needful\u2014which was permitted for their correction. Though the disciples had mistaken the meaning of their message, and had failed to realize their expectations, yet they had preached the warning given them of God, and the Lord would reward their faith, and honor their obedience. To them was to be intrusted the work of heralding to all nations the glorious gospel of their risen Lord. It was to prepare them for this work, that the experience which seemed to them so bitter had been permitted.",
