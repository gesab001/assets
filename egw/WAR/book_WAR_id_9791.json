    "word": "I ask you to be guarded in this matter. The Lord would have The Desire of Ages do its work. The illustrations will be no detriment to the book, but an advantage in its sale. The investment of so large an amount of money in illustrations was not essential, but that should not in any way hinder the canvassers from handling the book. Canvassers generally have much to say in favor of illustrations. Now, because cautions and warnings are given to prevent the coming in of an evil which no one suspected, some may refuse to handle The Desire of Ages.--Lt 76, 1900.",
