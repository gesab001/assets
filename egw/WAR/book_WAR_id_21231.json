    "word": "This constitutes the ideal of Christian character, the all-round man, the perfect man in Christ. He does not spend his life in prayerful meditation only, neglecting to do earnest work for the Master. Neither is his life all outward bustle. He does not engage in active work to the neglect of personal piety. There is a happy blending of both qualities. He is \"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\" (Romans 12:11.)",
