    "word": "Elder Haskell and wife, we have no warnings to give you to stimulate zeal and earnestness. You could not look upon this field, or upon any field in its destitution, without putting your shoulder to the wheel. But the light given me from God is, that you need to consider that if you would serve the work, you must not disqualify yourselves physically or morally by overdoing. Keep fresh, that you may educate others how to work, and do not get discouraged because you cannot carry the whole load. The Lord does not place \n\n\n                                    -397- \n\nupon you burdens so heavy that you cannot carry them without sacrificing your mental, moral, and spiritual capabilities.--Letter 3, 1902, pp. 2, 4, 5. (To S. N. Haskell and wife, January 1, 1902.)",
