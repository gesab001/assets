    "word": "This careless inattention to the management of the Health Institute and its surroundings, has told fearfully against it, and a number of lives have been lost. Health reformers profess to believe in the hygienic agencies of pure air, pure water and strict cleanliness. These are the most efficient remedies for disease. The duty devolving upon the physician has been grossly neglected, notwithstanding repeated warnings and reproofs. The physician's duty is to have a care for all the surroundings of the Institute. In \n                                                                           15\nconsenting to become physicians there, they assume the responsibility of taking in their hands the health and lives of the patients. It is their duty to take a deep interest in those who are placed under their care, to patiently advise and instruct them, to give them proper treatment and to guard them against every hurtful influence, and to banish from the institution or its surroundings everything detrimental to health.",
