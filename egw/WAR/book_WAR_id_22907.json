    "word": "For several mornings before I left Cooranbong I was passing through interesting scenes with you. Again and again had your case been urged upon my mind. The parable scene found in Matthew 25:14-23 was presented before me. This is the last of the many parables in His public teachings given [to the disciples] by our Lord Jesus Christ. Early in the morning He had crossed the mount. He gave them the warning in regard to His second appearing in the clouds of heaven. Chapter 24:36: \"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only.\" \"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come\" [verse 14].",
