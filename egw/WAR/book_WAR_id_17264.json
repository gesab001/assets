    "word": "The Lord leaves in darkness no man who has an ear to hear and a heart to understand. Let everyone keep the eye single to God's glory. Be not led astray by the snares of the wicked one. \"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall\" (1 Corinthians 10:12). Let the warnings that God has given in His Word be voiced by the watchmen on the walls of Zion and heeded by every soul in the Master's service.",
