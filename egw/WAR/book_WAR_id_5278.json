    "word": "These souls brought forth fruit meet for repentance. They believed and were baptized, and rose to walk in newness of life,\u2014new creatures in Christ Jesus. Not to fashion themselves according to the former lusts, but by the faith of the Son of God to follow in his steps, to reflect his character, and to purify themselves even as he is pure. The things they once hated, they now loved; and the things they once loved, they hated. The proud and self-assertive became meek and \n462\nlowly of heart. The vain and supercilious became serious and unobtrusive. The profane became reverent, the drunken sober, and the profligate pure. The vain fashions of the world were laid aside. Christians sought not the \u201coutward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\u201d [1 Peter 3:3, 4.]",
