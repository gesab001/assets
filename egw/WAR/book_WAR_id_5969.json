    "word": "1082. There are those who have entered the medical profession who should have chosen some other calling. They are unsympathetic. They seem to think the proper way is to withhold all words of sympathy, and gird up their compassion so that not a particle of it shall be drawn out. They are cold and uncommunicative, and leave no warm, cheering influence. They seem to think words of tenderness and compassion are an evidence of weakness.-- Counsel to Physicians and Medical Students, p. 28.",
