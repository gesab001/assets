    "word": "Laboring as God's Helping Hand \n\n     Our work has been marked out for us by our heavenly Father. We are to take our Bibles and go forth to warn the world. We are to be God's helping hand in saving souls. We are to be channels through which His love is day by day to flow to the perishing. The realization of the great work in which he has the privilege of taking part ennobles and sanctifies the true worker. He is filled with the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Nothing is drudgery to the one who submits to the will of God. \"Doing \n                                                                           21\nit unto the Lord\" is the thought that throws a charm over the work that God gives him to do.--Letter 43, 1902.",
