    "word": "We must not be discouraged. We want to get rid of unbelief; we do not want to talk it, or act it, or think it, but press forward to the mark of the prize of the high calling that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. I feel anxious, because I know that the time has come when God's people should put on their beautiful garments. \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" It is the word of infinite power that He wants you to eat and drink. He wants you to eat His flesh and drink His blood, and then the power of God will be in your midst. Then the voice will be touched with a peculiar power. \n\n\n                                    -310-",
