    "word": "The warnings given in the word of God to the children of Israel were meant, not merely for them, but for all who should live upon the earth. He says to them, \"Woe to the rebellious children, . . . that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin: that walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth: to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!\" If the Lord reproved his people anciently because they neglected to seek counsel of him when in difficulty, will he not be displeased today if his people, instead of depending on the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness to lighten their way, \n\n\n                     - 45 - \n\nturn from him in their test and trial, for the aid of human beings who are as erring and inefficient as themselves? Where is our strength? Is it in men who are as helpless and dependent as ourselves, who need guidance from God even as we do?",
