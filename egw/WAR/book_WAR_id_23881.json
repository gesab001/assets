    "word": "I am instructed to say to our people, Let us follow Christ. We may safely discard all ideas that are not included in His teachings. I appeal to our ministers to be sure that their feet are placed on the platform of eternal truth. Beware how you follow impulse, calling it the Holy Spirit. Some are in danger in this respect. I call upon them to be sound in the faith, able to give every one who asks a reason of the hope that is in them.",
