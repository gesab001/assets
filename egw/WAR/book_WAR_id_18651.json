    "word": "PH015 - Brother Aldrich (1869)\n\n\n             Brother Aldrich. \n\n     I was shown that in Bro. Aldrich's case, he has been labored with faithfully. His case was correctly stated in regard to the course he has pursued in reference to the Office and Institute. My husband felt to bring these things before Bro. Aldrich, from a sense of duty, in the presence of his brethren who had confidence in him. He was not among enemies, nor in the presence of any who wished to injure him, but among those connected with him in the work, who had a perfect right to investigate all his course in connection with the work and cause of God. When errors were pointed out in regard to his management of matters in going forward upon his own judgment, without consulting his brethren, Bro. Aldrich made no acknowledgments of the wrongs, which were made plain to all present. He would not humble his pride to say he had been wrong. This was too humiliating. The golden opportunity passed of his confessing his errors, and in humility seeking to God for wisdom, and imploring his guidance.",
