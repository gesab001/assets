    "word": "I had to stand and see men triumphing in their evil work. The Lord said, I will punish for these things. Then came the word of the Lord to me, \"Make no large concessions. There are those who will not appreciate any sacrifice you might make. You must maintain principle. Take your books out of the hands of those who are not right with God; for they will harass and perplex you and grieve your soul. The Lord desires you to be a steward of means; He will be your counsellor. Trust not in man nor in the word of man, for they will fail you. The Lord would not have you brought in strait places, as you now are; for this will prevent you from doing the work I have commanded you to do as My messenger. You are not to be placed in the position where those who are reproved will be greatly gratified by your supposed dependence. You are to lead out; you are not to be led into poverty and left there, for the word of the Lord is to be proclaimed more decidedly in the future than in the past.\"",
