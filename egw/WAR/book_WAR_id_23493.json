    "word": "Letter 25, 1897, entire letter. (To Fannie Bolton, April 11, 1897.)--The work which you have done here in Australia has yielded a harvest which is widespread. You denied having said to Sr. Malcolm that which they told me, and insisted upon, you had said. You afterward visited Sister Malcolm, and denied having said that Sr. White was a very ignorant woman, who could not write, and whose writings you had to make all over, and that it was your talent in connection with the work that made the articles in the papers and books what they were. My only course has been to dismiss you from my employment several times. I did this while you were at my home at Preston; but because of your apparent repentance, I foolishly consented to let you work with me again.",
