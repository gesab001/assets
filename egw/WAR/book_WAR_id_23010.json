    "word": "On the Sabbath the Spirit of the Lord was in the midst of us. Brother F bore a clear, straightforward testimony. He said that Sister White had had a testimony specially for him, and he accepted it, and shall follow its counsel in every particular. Byron Belden was all broken down, and made humble confessions.
