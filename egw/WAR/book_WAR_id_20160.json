    "word": "Let us remember that time is short. Tell the people that golden opportunities for service are being neglected. All nations are to be warned and instructed to seek the Lord without delay; for that mighty angel who deceived so many of the angelic host is working untiringly to set in operation his seductive wiles, with which he has deceived millions, and through which he desires to deceive the whole world. The work of which the prophet Zechariah writes is a type of the spiritual restoration to be wrought for Israel before the end of time. \"Thus saith the Lord,\" the prophet declared, \"Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets. . . . I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days. . . . For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.",
