    "word": "In a letter to Elder G. I. Butler dated October 30, 1906, she says \"Recently I have written letters to different ones who are in danger of being misled by the deceptive influence that prevails at B. C. The disaffected ones will make every effort possible to secure the Tabernacle, and to gain other advantages by which to disseminate their wrong theories and carry forward their apostasies. But the Lord lives and reigns. I am writing out the cautions He gives me. I will not give up. I must relieve my soul of its burden. It may be that I shall have to visit Battle Creek.",
