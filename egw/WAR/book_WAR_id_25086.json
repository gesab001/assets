    "word": "Elder Reaser is seeking to keep the better world in view, and he wants us to trust him. How tenderly my heart went out toward him as I read his letters. I desire to help him over this hard place. I believe that if we can tenderly help him at this time, that he will respond to our efforts in his behalf. I feel that we should not make it known to the churches that we (589) feared he would have to resign his position. I would not take a step that would mar his life record. Let us try to help him to put his heart and soul and strength on the Lord's side, for the upbuilding of His church.",
