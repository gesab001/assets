    "word": "MR No. 902 - Proxy Voting\n\n     I have written out something in regard to votes by proxy. The way in which this matter has been managed should not be repeated. Those who, by the number of votes which they have accumulated, have placed men whom they have chosen in positions of influence, reveal that they are untrustworthy. They show just what they would do if they could. It may be that the Lord has suffered this thing to be, that He may awaken the understanding of His people. There must be faithful watchmen on the walls of Zion who will be ready to give the note of warning to the unruly elements who think that they have wisdom to run anything they choose. It is the privilege of all who are thus elected to say, I do not choose to serve in any position brought about by such unprincipled means.--Letter 45, 1898. (To W. C. Gage and wife, May 19, 1898.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. December 12, 1981",
