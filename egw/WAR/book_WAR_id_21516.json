    "word": "Caution Regarding the General Revision of SDA Books (To A. G. Daniells)--I have seen that Satan would have been greatly pleased to see Elders Prescott and Daniells undertake the work of a general overhauling of our books that have done a good work in the field for years. But neither of you is called of God to that work. If you were to enter upon such a work, \n\n\n                                    -365- \n\nmuch time would be employed that should be given to the proclamation of the last warning message to an impenitent world.",
