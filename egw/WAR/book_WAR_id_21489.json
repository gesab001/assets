    "word": "God's long forbearance is wonderful. The Master is treated with disrespect, He receives but little thanksgiving for His bestowment of blessings. The world is mad. They do not consider that His long forbearance toward the wicked is a part of His great plan, that judgments will surely come. But the long-suffering God will do His work. He will discriminate with justice and accuracy.--Ms. 151, 1898, p. 6. (Notes of the Queensland Camp Meeting, copied November 2, 1898.)",
