    "word": "September 17, 1889--The effects of the rain are not seen; it is dry and dusty. We eat and drink dust. Last night I was much afflicted for want of \n\n\n                                   -152- \n\nbreath. I longed to breathe sweet pure air that was not filled with dust and alkali and tobacco. All we can do is to exercise patience and look forward with joy to the time when the sagebrush plains are behind us.--Ms. 21, 1889, pp. 17-18. (Diary, September 15-17, 1889.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. August 22, 1981",
