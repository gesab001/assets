    "word": "The chief burden of every human being is to be the salvation of body, soul and spirit. Every Christian strives to accumulate true riches; for in this there is safety and consolation. In the place of lavishly investing means in uncertain enterprises, he yearly lays up treasure in the Bank of Heaven, his home. He keeps in circulation in the work of God upon the earth every talent entrusted to him, increasing his gifts by trading upon them. He knows that he can not become rich in heavenly treasure by binding up his talents, be they few or many, in anything against which God has warned him. He does not hide his gifts in worldly enterprises and uncertain projects. He invests his Lord's money in the cause, trading upon it to help the Saviour to secure his purchased possession. He realizes that he is entrusted with means to use for the advancement and glory of Christ's kingdom by saving the souls for whom the Saviour died. \n\n\n                                       (Signed)  Ellen G. White.",
