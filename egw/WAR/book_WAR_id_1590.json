    "word": "I speak to you who are engaged in the canvassing work. Have you read volume 4 [The Great Controversy]? Do you know what it contains? Have you any appreciation of the subject matter? Do you not see that the people need the light therein given? If you have not already done so, I entreat you to read carefully these solemn warnings and appeals. I am sure that the Lord would have this work carried into all the highways and byways, where are souls to be warned of the danger so soon to come.--Letter 1, 1890.",
