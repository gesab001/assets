    "word": "Wherever you are, however trying your circumstances, do not talk discouragement. The Bible is full of rich promises. Can you not believe them?

It means that we need not go in our own strength, for God has pledged His word that He will go with us.--Historical Sketches, pp. 128, 129. (1886)",
