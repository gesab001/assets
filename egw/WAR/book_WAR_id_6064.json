    "word": "The Scandinavian children seem remarkably quiet and well trained. Wherever we went, they came forward, one by one, and shook hands with us, the girls making a courtesy, and the boys a low bow.

At another place where we visited, even the little girl of two and a half years went through the ceremony with credit.",
