    "word": "One thing makes me feel very sad, and that is that there is not always harmony among the workers in our institutions. I have thought, Is it \n\n\n                        -25- \n\npossible that there is any one who will find fault with those connected with them in the work? Is there any one who will suggest to patients or to visitors or fellow workers that there are many things which ought to be done that are not done, and many other things which are not done right? If they do this, they are not doing the work of Christians. Men who have been appointed to different positions of trust are to be respected. We do not expect to find men who are perfect in every respect. They may be seeking for perfection of character, but they are finite, and liable to err. Those who are engaged in our institutions should feel it their duty jealously to guard both the work and the workers from unjust criticism. They should not readily accept or speak words of censure against any who are connected with the work of God; for in thus doing God himself may be reproached, and the work that he is doing through instrumentalities may be greatly hindered. The wheels of progress may be blocked when God says, \"Go forward.\"",
