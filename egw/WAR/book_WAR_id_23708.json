    "word": "Over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, Christ proclaimed, \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" Let us rejoice that we have a risen Saviour. Just before He ascended on high, leading captivity captive and giving gifts unto man, He said to His disciples, \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" [Matthew 28:19, 20]. With outstretched hands He blessed them before He was taken up to join the glorious angels waiting to escort Him on His upward way.",
