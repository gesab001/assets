    "word": "Chap. 86 - Sharing Confidences\n\n\n     Trustworthiness Brings Peace of Mind.--Christ inquires of everyone professing His name, \"Lovest thou Me?\" If you love Jesus, you will love the souls for whom He died . A man may not bear the most pleasant exterior, he may be deficient in many respects; but if he has a reputation for straightforward honesty, he will gain the confidence of others. The love of truth, the dependence and confidence which men can place in him, will remove or overbear objectionable features in his character. Trustworthiness in your place and calling, a willingness to deny self for the purpose of benefiting others, will bring peace of mind and the favor of God.--4T 353 (1879).",
