    "word": "Those who refuse to heed the warnings sent by God may say, It is only man who is rebuking us. They may decide to follow their own sinful way, flattering themselves that in the reproofs sent the divine and the human are commingled. They may declare that they will not be instructed, \n\n\n                                     -68- \n\nthat they will do as they please. Thus said the Jews in the days of Christ. Those who claimed to be pious, the priests and rulers, said of Christ, He hath a devil; therefore we need not pay the least attention to His words. He is only a human being. [Matthew 11:20-24, quoted.]",
