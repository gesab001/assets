    "word": "As those who profess to believe the truth, we are called, not only in these cities, Melbourne and Sydney, but everywhere, to rise up in the spirit and mind of Christ, and with a firm purpose of heart separate from all worldly influences, break every worldly link, laying aside every weight in order to wear the armor of righteousness and be co-workers with Jesus Christ. We are to be absolutely and completely for Him in this world, as He is for us in the presence of God. If Christ abides in the heart, the work will go forward; but if there is a reserve--an undercurrent in the soul, any secondary object, any worldly motive, any selfish aims or ends--the work that the Lord means should be done, will not be done. We must make the kingdom of heaven and the glory of God our best and whole interest. We want to see the work advancing.",
