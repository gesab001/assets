    "word": "Jan. 27. Receiving the Messages of God's Spirit. I bore my testimony in the minister's meeting, and the Lord gave me a large measure of His Spirit. I entreated my brethren standing in positions of responsibility not to grieve the Spirit of God away from their hearts by their unwillingness to receive the testimonies that God has sent them in reproof and warning. I saw that they were dishonoring God by much talking. Their hearts were not free from prejudice. I said to them, Do not receive the word of any man, but go to the Scriptures for yourselves. Do not turn away from the messages that God sends, as you did at Minneapolis. Prayerfully consider every point, with hearts open to conviction. Receive every ray of light sent you. That which has been set before you deserves candid consideration. Truths that have been buried under a mass of rubbish are to be revived, and reset in their original setting. \n                                                                           572",
