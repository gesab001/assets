    "word": "I tell you, my brother and sister, we are living in the Laodicean state of the church. If any ever needed to fall upon the rock and be broken, it is the people of California and all through our church in America. We need to arouse and act as one man. We need to be earnest and alive. Horrors upon horrors are following upon the destruction of human life. Yet these things receive only a few remarks. The world will not be warned: but the day of the Lord is coming unawares, as a thief in the night. \n\n\n                                   (Signed) E. G. White.",
