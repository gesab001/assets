    "word": "The Time of God's Judgments a Time of Opportunity for the Unwarned--The time of God's destructive judgments is the time of mercy for those who have no opportunity to learn what is truth. Tenderly will the Lord look upon them. His heart of mercy is touched; His hand is still stretched out to save, while the door is closed to those who would not enter. Large numbers will be admitted who in these last days hear the truth for the first time.--Letter 103, 1903, p. 4. (To G. B. Starr and wife, June 3, 1903.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C.
