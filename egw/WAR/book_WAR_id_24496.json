    "word": "When the character, in both warp and woof, is composed of worthless material, an attempt is often made to patch it up; the motives and impulses and actions supposed to be good, are to be retained, while other things, the more objectionable features of the character are to be discarded. Thus thought Nicodemus until he listened to the lessons of Christ. These lessons came home to his soul with solemn power, revealing that his piety was not after the similitude presented by Christ. Nicodemus had witnessed the miracle of Christ, and he came to the Master by night, for he had not the moral courage to approach him openly, since this would excite the criticisms of the priests and Pharisees. When he greeted Jesus as Rabbi, he thought he was showing him special honor. He said, \"We know that thou art a Teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.\" This was a great step for Nicodemus to take, but Jesus answers him, \"Verily verily, I say unto you, Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of heaven.\"",
