    "word": "We have a heaven to gain and a hell to shun. We stand forth under the Divine commission, and the solemn vows made to God. We stand forth as messengers in Christ's stead, as the stewards of the mysteries of God. Ever remember that we are surrounded with a cloud of witnesses. The heavenly intelligences are looking upon us as the ambassadors of the King of kings and Lord of lords. We have a right to lift the standard high. Thus saith the Lord, who realizes the dignity of our calling, the sacredness of our work. We may well humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, else He will humble us. The Lord looks upon men-pleasing with disfavor, where there is a satanic accusing of the men who should be respected, whom God is using.",
