    "word": "Few realize the power of habit. Inspiration asks, \"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?\" and adds, \"then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil.\" Jeremiah 13:23. This is a solemn assertion. . . . But there is comfort and courage in the reflection that if evil habits acquire such force that it seems almost impossible to turn in the right direction, the power of good habits is equally strong. The results of each day's work, whether the tendency be to elevate us in the scale of moral worth or to push us downward toward perdition, are influenced by the days that have preceded it. Defeat today prepares the way for still greater defeat tomorrow; victory today ensures an easier victory tomorrow. Then how careful we should be to see that the habits and characters we are forming are correct and virtuous. . . .",
