    "word": "Brother Butler, we must reach higher. We will not limit the Holy One. We must pray, and that fervently, that angels may be directed to come to our help to meet the moral darkness that covers the earth like a funeral pall. We rejoice so much that you are at work in San Francisco, to get the solemn warning before the people. We hope and pray that every element among our people who profess the truth may be in harmony with the Spirit of God, that they may work unitedly and in faith and hope, and that God will give the truth a glorious victory in San Francisco.",
