    "word": "Do not reproach the Christian religion by jealousy and intolerance toward others. This will but poorly recommend your belief to them. No one has ever been reclaimed from a wrong position by censure and reproach; but many have thus been driven from the truth, and have steeled their hearts against conviction. A tender spirit, a gentle and winning deportment, \n400\nmay save the erring, and hide a multitude of sins. God requires us to have that charity that \u201csuffereth long, and is kind.\u201d [1 Corinthians 13:4.]",
