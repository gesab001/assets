    "word": "Let us in the name of the Lord press perseveringly forward in the race for eternal life. We have a great work to do in enlightening our own souls and in living up to a higher standard. Let us place a proper estimate on the preciousness of a knowledge of the truth. Then we shall have a clearer understanding in regard to God's goodness to us and our obligations to others. While seeking to save the lost, let us keep our minds constantly uplifted in prayer for divine guidance. We are not to look to men, but are to behold Jesus. Let us not lose our spirituality. Christ desires His people to be greatly revived by the Holy Spirit. \n\n\n                                   -349-",
