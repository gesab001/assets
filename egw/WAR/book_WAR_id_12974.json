    "word": "Wavering at God's Promises\n \n\n     After Abraham's separation from Lot the Lord said to him, \"Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.\" \"The word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great\n77\nreward. . . . And Abram said, Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.\"",
