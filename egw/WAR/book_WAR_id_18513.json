    "word": "Great is the mercy of the Lord toward those who have departed from him. He says: \"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.\" \"How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as the Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me; my repentings are kindled together.\"--Mrs. E. G. White, Australia, 1892. \n\n\n                                  [23]",
