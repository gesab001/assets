    "word": "The neighbors flocked in. My husband spoke and I followed him. We had an interesting meeting, singing, talking, and praying. We retired to rest but I was too weary to sleep until about midnight. We arose at half past three and were on our way at four. . . . At half past six we halted on the prairie and built a large fire and all came together for a season of prayer. We then ate of our humble fare and were soon on our way again. At one o'clock we were on the campground and were faint and weary. We felt refreshed by eating a warm dinner. Our tent was pitched in the afternoon, and we made our beds. Had a good straw bed to lie on, and we slept sweetly the first night.--Letter 9, 1870, p. 2. (To Emma McDearmon, June 8, 1870.)",
