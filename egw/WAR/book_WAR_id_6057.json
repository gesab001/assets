    "word": "Hamburg, situated on the river Elbe, contains upwards of two hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants. The trade of all Northern Europe centers here; it is the great port of entry for the German empire, and is the most important commercial town on the Continent. Though very ancient, it is a beautiful city. It was here that Tyndale, when forced to flee from England, began the publication of the English New Testament. In wretched lodgings he endured hunger and cold while toiling day and night to give the gospel to England. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark, translated and printed here, were secretly sent to London as the first-fruits of his great work.",
