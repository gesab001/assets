    "word": "The religion of Christ never degrades the receiver, never makes him coarse or rough or uncourteous. It never incapacitates him for imparting what he has received. The truth as it is in Jesus is warm with comfort and love. Day by day the soul is to receive this truth, for it is spiritual food. Knowing that we have a living Christ, we may safely trust the soul to His keeping. He says, \"Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\" There is divine power for every one who will receive Christ by faith. In the Redeemer's power, practicing self-denial, they can walk in perilous places. \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross \n\n\n                                    -173- \n\ndaily, and follow Me.\" These words are spoken to every one who desires to be a Christian. . . . He who shuns the cross shuns the reward promised to the faithful.",
