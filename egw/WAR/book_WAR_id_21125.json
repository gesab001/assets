    "word": "Believers must not expect to gain eternal life without meeting trial and difficulty. They are to prepare to do the work that Christ did, and to meet \n\n\n                                   -355- \n\nthe trials that He daily experienced. Christ and Belial are at work in the world, and there is no peace or unity between them. The enmity which in the garden of Eden God declared should exist between the serpent and the Seed of the woman is very apparent. Satan is constantly seeking to lead men into error. He is the god of all dissension, and he has no lack of isms to bring forward to delude. New sects are constantly arising to lead away from the truth; and instead of being fed with the bread of life, the people are served with a dish of fables. The Scriptures are wrested, and, taken from their true connection, are quoted to give falsehood the appearance of truth. The garments of truth are stolen to hide the features of heresy.",
