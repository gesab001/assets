    "word": "Paul speaks of a class to whom the Lord's appearing will come unawares. \u201cThe day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, . . . and they shall not escape.\u201d But he adds, to those who have given heed to the Saviour's warning, \u201cYe, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.\u201d [1 Thessalonians 5:2-5.]",
