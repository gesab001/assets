    "word": "But there are those who feel no responsibility and do nothing, even for their own families, except to help them downward. Oh, it is a painful picture. While the servants of God may be rising up and exhausting their vitality, and going down into the grave under the load and under the burden, there are those here who do not lift one ounce [of] weight of the burden. They do not visit the sick, they do not find out the needy, they do not try to be a comfort and a blessing here and there to one another, and there is no spiritual vitality in them. They do not in the fear of God take care of their own families. The fear of the Lord does not circulate in their own homes.",
