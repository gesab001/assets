    "word": "Those who make the most of their opportunities, who place themselves in right relation with God, will be rewarded even as was Daniel. We read of him, \"Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king; . . . for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king\" [Daniel 1:8-10]. \"Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days,\" Daniel said, \"and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the [portion of the] king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat\" [verses 12-15].",
