    "word": "After nine years of struggling, we begin to see some signs of success in this country. But the advancement has been made under the most trying circumstances. In order to advance the work we have been obliged to borrow thousands of dollars. I tell you in the name of the Lord that this need not have been. If our institutions, our sanitariums and publishing houses had bound about their desire for more facilities, and had shown an unselfish interest in the work so constantly set before them, the cause in foreign fields would have certainly made much more advancement, and marked success would have attended the business of which they were stewards. The selfish desire which some have shown to use all the means to enrich one portion of the Lord's vineyard reveals unfaithful stewardship; and I am charged to make this appeal to God's people.",
