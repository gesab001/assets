    "word": "The one who is supposed to help me has been a great burden to me since she came to Australia. I \n                                                                           56\nhave borne and done everything that I could do to help Fannie, but when she gets into these tantrums she seems inspired by Satan. She afterwards confesses, but not quite as fully heretofore as this time, but she cannot be trusted. She tried to get Sara to put into her hands a letter written to Dr. Kellogg, so that she could see if there was anything written about her. Sara told her she would never do that. She asked her, \"What do you take me to be, Fannie? Is this the principle you would teach me, after being so long connected with Sister White in her work? Would you teach me to betray my trust, to steal a writing, a private letter to go to America, and put it in your hands to read its contents?\" This matter she urged and Sara would not comply and she was greatly stirred up over it. So you see what dependence I can put in such helpers. . . .",
