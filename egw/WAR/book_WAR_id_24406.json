    "word": "The word of the Lord has come to me in clear lines in reference to the principles and practices of those connected with the Review office. There has been need of self-examination on the part of the workers. Every man who has to do with sacred things should perform his work in a Christ-like manner. There must be no sharp practice, \n                                                                           1101\n\"A false balance is abomination to the Lord.\" A false balance is a symbol of all unfair dealing, all devices to conceal selfishness and injustice under an appearance of fairness and equity. God will not in the slightest degree favor such practices. He hates every false way. He abhors all selfishness and covetousness. Unmerciful dealing he will not tolerate, but will repay in kind. God can give prosperity to the working men whose means are acquired honestly. But his curse rests upon all that is gained by selfish practices. When one indulges in selfishness or sharp dealing, he shows that he does not fear the Lord or reverence his name. Those who are connected with God will not only shun all injustice, but will manifest his mercy and goodness toward all with whom they have to do. The Lord will sanction no respect of person; but he will not approve the course of those who make no difference in favor of the poor, the widow, and the orphan.",
