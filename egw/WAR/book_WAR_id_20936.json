    "word": "There is great danger in our casting aside the counsel of God for the counsels of men. Satan is delighted when he lays his snares and we walk into the meshes of his net.

Trust in the Lord, heed his voice, and turn from men.--Ms 41, 1894, p. 16. (Diary, October 19, 1894.) \n\nReleased December 2, 1974.",
