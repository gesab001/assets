    "word": "All should beware of cherishing this view of the matter, for conscience is thus losing its sensitiveness. One may reason, \"The little I have taken does not amount \n                                                                           409\nto much;\" but the question comes home, Did the smallness of the amount lessen the sin of the act? Again, the little which one person takes may not amount to much, but when five act on the same plan, five littles are taken. Then ten, twenty, or even more, may presume in the same way, until every day the workers may, to their own injury, appropriate many littles that they have no right to touch. Many littles make much in the end. But the greatest loss is sustained by the ones who digress, for they are violating the principles of right and learning to look upon transgression in small matters as no transgression at all. They forget the words of Christ. \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\" Luke 16:10.",
