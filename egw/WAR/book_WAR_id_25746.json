    "word": "By the blessing of the Lord the work has been started, and now the help of every one is needed. The students must be taught how to begin. The educators must be men and women who have had experience, and who will lead the students in the right way at every step they advance. Teach Bible manners; teach purity of thought the strictest integrity. This is the most valuable instruction that can be given. Keep Jesus, the Pattern, ever before your students by your example. This will act a prominent part in restoring the moral image of God in those under your charge. Teachers, you have no time, no duty to teach students the forms and ceremonies of this age of corruption, when everything is perverted to outward appearance and display. This must never find a place in our school. This reform is not to be brought in as essential.",
