    "word": "The habits formed in childhood and youth have more influence than any natural endowment, in making men and women intellectually great, or dwarfed and crippled; for the very best talents may, through wrong habits, become warped and enfeebled. To a great extent, the character is determined in early years. Correct, virtuous habits, formed in youth, will generally mark the course of the individual through life. In most cases, those who reverence God and honor the right, will be found to have learned this lesson before the world could stamp its images of sin upon the soul. Men and women of mature age are generally as insensible to new impressions as the hardened rock; but youth is impressible, and a right character may then be easily formed.",
