    "word": "When those who controvert the truth of God send for men to oppose truth with falsehood and error, this is the time to watch the influence their words have upon the congregation. Those who do not want a knowledge of the truth will greedily partake of the dish of pleasing fables presented to them. They will listen diligently to the falsehoods and ravening of the wolves in sheep's clothing. They are of those who rejoice in iniquity. They infuse into the hearts of those who do not want God's way the same wicked opposition that is in their own hearts. And they will act out the same spirit toward God's commandment-keeping people in this time as the Jews did when they refused to believe the truths which Christ unfolded before them. Christ presented before this people the prophecies of the Old Testament Scriptures, showing them that by their rejection of Him they were fulfilling those prophecies. But they continued in their evil course, and followed to the end the works which stand registered against them in the books of heaven, and which have brought eternal infamy upon them as a nation.",
