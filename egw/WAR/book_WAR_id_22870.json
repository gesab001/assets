    "word": "Preston, Melbourne, July 15, 1892. The Lord has brought me through another night. I did not sleep well. The weather this winter has not been unpleasant, but the air is very penetrating, and I cannot manage to keep comfortably warm in these high rooms, with only a grate fire. I have had two severe chills, and this has greatly increased the lameness in my shoulders and hips. But notwithstanding this, I was able to spend most of yesterday writing on the life of Christ. I praise the Lord because I feel a nearness to my Saviour. My faith feeds on the rich promises of God, which are full of comfort and hope. \n\n\n     \"Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to Thy bosom fly, \n     While the billows near me roll, while the tempest still is high. \n     Hide me, O my Saviour, hide! Till the storm of life is past. \n     Safe into the haven guide, Oh, receive my soul at last. \n     Other refuge have I none; hangs my helpless soul on Thee; \n     Leave, Oh, leave me not alone! Still support and comfort me, \n     All my trust on Thee is stayed, all my help from Thee I bring. \n     Cover my defenseless head with the shadow of Thy wing.\"",
