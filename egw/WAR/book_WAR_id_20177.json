    "word": "\"I Rebuke and Chasten\".--Jesus is coming in to give the individual members of the church the richest blessings, if they will open the door to Him. He does not once call them Babylon, nor ask them to come out. But He says, \"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten\" (Revelation 3:19), (with messages of reproof and warning). These reproofs I am not ignorant of. I have given warnings because the Spirit of the Lord has constrained me to do so, and have uttered reproofs because the Lord has given me words of reproof. I have not shunned to declare the whole counsel of God, which has been given me for the church.",
