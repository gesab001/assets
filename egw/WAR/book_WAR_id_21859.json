    "word": "Our workers cannot be over-moderate and over-retiring. They must speak in season and out of season, seeking the acquaintance of those not of the truth. [Ephesians 5:1, 2, 8-10, quoted.] This is our individual work. No one can do this for us. There has been a kind of education that has led men from being taught and led of God. Man has looked no higher than man, who has no greater wisdom than himself unless he humbly seeks it of God, who is our Light, and Counselor, and exceeding great reward.",
