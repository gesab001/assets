    "word": "Take Problems to God, Not to Men.--Has the Lord directed you to carry your burdens and difficulties to men who have no more strength than you have? Will you make them your Intercessor? Shall man interpose between your souls and God? Men in responsibility, handling sacred things, bring all your trials and perplexities to God. Turn not away from your great Counselor, to human beings. I am charged with a warning: Exchange not One infinite in wisdom for finite man. \n\n\n                                  -364-",
