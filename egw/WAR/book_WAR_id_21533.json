Should the Saviour come at this time, would not many of us be afraid to meet Him? Could we hail Him with joy, saying, \"Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us\" (Isaiah 25:9)? Are we ready for His appearing? Is the soul temple cleansed of its defilement? Would we want Christ to come and find us in disunion, in strife with one another? Would we want Christ to come and find us in frivolous amusements, in concerts which some patronize? We want to be found waiting and watching, with our garments made white and clean in the blood of the Lamb.--Letter 29, 1882, pp. 5, 6. \n                                        (To W. H.
