    "word": "Sister Peck, Miss Gates, and Sister Boyd's daughter were driving from Sunnyside to the school with a horse which we have always considered\n227\nsafe and manageable, though awkward.

Under the management of Elder Haskell, the schoolboys made a log bridge over the creek. As the trap neared this bridge, those in it saw that a tree had fallen across the road, and Sister Peck, who had the lines, thought she would get out and lead the horse round it. But instead of standing still, the horse began to back, and tried to turn round toward home again.",
