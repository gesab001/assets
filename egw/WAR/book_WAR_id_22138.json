    "word": "It is Satan's studied plan to keep God out of men's thoughts. He has great success in carrying out this plan. He is constantly bringing forward inventions to keep the mind absorbed in pleasure and money-making. The minds of the great majority of men are so taken up with the things of time, with worldly devices, that the things of eternity make no impression on them. Irrespective of the warnings in the Word of God, they show a most surprising indifference to the laws of His kingdom.",
