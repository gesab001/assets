    "word": "The divorce obtained by your wife was no more than could be expected. The man who will give up his loyalty to God in order to obtain a wife will not be loyal to his wife, and you yourself have laid the foundation of your trouble. The course you have pursued in your home life has been a mistake from the beginning, and your wife has reason to consider that she and the children would be happier without your company. Were I to hear of any woman proposing to enter into the marriage covenant with you, I would feel it my duty to warn her against it, for you have in your disposition the attributes of a tyrant. You expect a woman to submerge her will in yours, preserving no individuality of her own. The spirit you manifested in your connection with your wife's mother was not as God would have it, but was directly against the principles contained in His holy Word. You are critical and exacting, and you have a harsh, cruel spirit. In your married life you have not pursued a course which would keep your wife's love or win her to the truth, and you need much of the softening influence of the spirit of the meek and lowly Jesus in your life, that you may not bring a reproach upon the truth which you profess.--Letter 17, 1896, pp. 1-6. (To a church member who had married out of the church, and been divorced, May 10, 1896.)",
