    "word": "Now, Elder Haskell, I want you to understand that I appreciate your interest in the scattering of the truth through a wide sale of Early Writings. [S.N. HASKELL ENCOURAGED ELLEN WHITE TO HAVE EARLY WRITINGS PUBLISHED BY A NON-SDA PUBLISHING CONCERN IN ORDER TO SECURE A BROAD CIRCULATION. A CONTRACT WAS DRAWN UP AND A DELEGATION BROUGHT IT TO HER TO SIGN. AS SHE PICKED UP THE PEN TO SIGN, SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP, THEN SAID SHE COULDN'T SIGN. AFTER THE MEN LEFT, W.C. WHITE REMONSTRATED WITH HER BECAUSE SHE WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE TERMS, BUT SISTER WHITE TOLD HIM THAT WHEN SHE LOOKED UP, AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO SIGN, SHE SAW AN ANGEL STANDING BEHIND THE MEN SHAKING HIS HEAD, \"NO.\"] I thank the Lord that I know you will not misunderstand me. I thank you for your kindly interest in my behalf. But I will closely watch and pray earnestly that the Lord will remove from me this pressure of debt without my taking a course that might seem unfair to the publishing houses. I know that your offer comes from the sincerity of your soul, and may the Lord bless you for your desire to help me, but I dare not venture to risk the consequences of the step you propose.--Lt 106, 1908. \n\n\n                                                     209",
