    "word": "When my husband recovered from his long and severe sickness, he took the work confused and embarrassed as it was left by unfaithful men. He worked with all the resolution and strength of mind and body that he possessed, to bring the work up, and to redeem it from the disgraceful perplexity it had been brought into by those who had their own interests prominent, and who did not feel that it was a sacred work in which they were engaged. God's hand has been reached out in judgment over these unfaithful ones. Their course and the result should prove a warning to others, not to do as they have done.",
