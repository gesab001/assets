    "word": "Day Four: Little did I think that I should ever be a pioneer missionary in the foreign land. . . . But when the call came to go to Europe, I responded. Afterwards, when we were recommended to go to Australia, I went, notwithstanding I was over sixty years old. Ten years I worked in that field before returning to America. I shall be seventy-five years old the twenty-sixth of November [1902]; and yet the missionary spirit is within me, and I feel . . . as if I could go to the ends of the earth, if only I could bring souls to a knowledge of the truth for this time.",
