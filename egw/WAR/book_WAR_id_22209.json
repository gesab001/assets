    "word": "It is not safe to do as did Saul--walk contrary to the Lord's commandments and then say, \"I have performed the commandment of the Lord,\" stubbornly refusing to confess the sin of disobedience. Saul's stubbornness made his case hopeless. We see that others are following his example. The Lord sends words of reproof in mercy to save them, but they will not submit to be corrected. They insist that they have done no wrong, thus resisting the Spirit of God. The Lord declares through Samuel, \"Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken, than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, He hath also rejected thee from being king.\" The stubborn heart is thus presented in the case of Saul to warn every soul who is in danger of doing as he did.",
