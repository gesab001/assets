    "word": "The Lord has not placed any one of his human agencies under the dictation and control of those who are themselves but erring mortals. He has not placed upon men the power to say, You shall do this, and you shall not do that. But there is a power exercised in Battle Creek that God has not given, and he will judge those \n\n\n                    - 4 - \n\nwho assume this authority. They have somewhat of the same spirit that led Uzzah to lay his hand on the ark to steady it, as though God was not able to care for his sacred symbols. Far less of man's power and authority should be exercised toward God's human agencies. Brethren, leave God to rule.",
