    "word": "An Army for the Lord\n     A Well-trained Army.--Men and women are not to be spiritually dwarfed by a connection with the church, but strengthened, elevated, ennobled, prepared for the most sacred work ever committed to mortals. It is the Lord's purpose to have a well-trained army, ready to be called into action at a moment's notice. This army will be made up of well-disciplined men and women, who have placed themselves under influences that have prepared them for service.--RH, June 2, 1903.",
