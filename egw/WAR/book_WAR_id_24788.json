    "word": "\"O God, I thank Thee for Thy gracious word, Thy blessed, Thy special promise, that I, Lord, shall be converted unto Thee. And so, Lord, I put myself into Thy hands this moment, to be converted, to be molded and fashioned according to Thine own mind and by Thy Holy Spirit. O Lord, I pray that Thy \n\n\n                                   - 39 - \n\ndivine wish may be met, and that I shall ever be a channel for the flowing of that holy oil which Thou hast mentioned, and which Thou dost long to pour upon bereaved and sore and morning hearts. And Lord, I pray Thee that Thou wilt now convert me through and through. Make me, Lord altogether like Jesus, only like Jesus, that I shall be kind and courteous, gentle and careful, toward all my brethren and all to whom Thou dost send me.",
