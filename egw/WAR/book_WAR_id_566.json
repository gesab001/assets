    "word": "Do Not Foster Love of Praise.--Children need appreciation, sympathy, and encouragement; but care should be taken not to foster in them a love of praise. . . . The parent or teacher who keeps in view the true ideal of character and the possibilities of achievement cannot cherish or encourage self-sufficiency. He will not encourage in the youth the desire or effort to display their ability or proficiency. He who looks higher than himself will be humble, yet he will possess a dignity that is not abashed or disconcerted by outward display or human greatness.",
