    "word": "The Lord's church is to Him the dearest object on earth. Creation itself was originated in the purpose of \n\n\n                                     -54- \n\nGod that He might glorify Himself in the redemption of His people. Your work is not to shape itself. It is not to be separated from the church. Neither are you in any way to demerit the ministry and exalt the work you are doing above the church. You are not to allow the students to suppose your work is separate, because in doing this you will show that you are not a co-worker with God. You may carry things in such a way that those connected with you will be led to think that should you be taken away, all that you had advised, planned, and set in operation would have to go forward just as you had planned.",
