    "word": "I have been deeply pained as I have considered the situation of the work in New York. After I sent the telegram in response to the one from Elder Jayne, regarding the work of Elder Franke and advising that he labor elsewhere, I was very sorry. . . . A great burden came upon my soul. That night matters were presented to me in this light: New York will be worked. Openings will be found in parts of the city in which there are no churches, where the truth will find standing-room. There is a vast amount of work to be done, and the Lord has given Brother Franke a message to the people who are dead in trespasses and sins. Most startling messages will be borne by men of God's appointment, messages of a character to warn the people, to arouse them. And while some will be provoked by the warning, and led to resist light and evidence, we are to see from this that we are giving the testing message for this time.--Letter 159, 1901, p. 1. (To Brother Haskell, November 3, 1901.)",
