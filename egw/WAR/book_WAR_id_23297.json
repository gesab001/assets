    "word": "Much as I would be pleased to have you with me and receive your help, I have not yet got to the point where I can say, Come. As you seem to have so great a burden upon you, I must say, Work on in faith. If your brethren do not feel disposed to take in the situation, hold on and do your level best. Is it not enough that God has accepted your labors, although they have not been altogether free from mistakes? Then let not your heart be made sad because your brethren are not doing as God would have them to do. Go right forward. Though left nearly empty-handed, yet do your best, though but little interest is manifested in the welfare of these unfortunate colored people in the southern States who are under a cloud of woe and oppression.",
