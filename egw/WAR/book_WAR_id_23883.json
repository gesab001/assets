    "word": "Re-copied 7/15/28                               MS-10-1904 \n  by L.F.W. \n\n\n       Instruction Regarding the Medical Missionary Work \n\n\n     It is not safe to trust in Dr. Kellogg. I dare not do it. I have not written to him much, recently, but I may have to send something soon. I have not the least confidence in his present attitude toward many things. I learn that notwithstanding all I have written regarding \"The Living Temple\" a book that was written under the inspiration of the arch-deceiver; notwithstanding with many plain messages that I have delivered in the \"Review and Herald\" and in letters to our brethren in responsibility, Dr. Kellogg now admits only a few of the mistakes he has made, and still supposes that in former years I taught the same errors. This reveals a blindness beyond conception. All that I can now do is to watch developments closely. I can not see that it would do the least particle of good to say more than I have said.",
