    "word": "The Lord is proving and testing his people. Angels of God are watching the development of character, and weighing moral worth. Probation is almost ended, and you \n                                                                           18\nare unready. Oh! that the word of warning might burn into your soul. Get ready! get ready! Work while the day lasts, for the night cometh when no man can work. The mandate will go forth, He that is holy, let him be holy still, and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still. The destiny of all will be decided. A few, yes, only a few, of the vast number who people the earth, will be saved unto life eternal, while the masses who have not perfected their souls in obeying the truth, will be appointed for the second death. O Saviour, save the purchase of thy blood, is the cry of my anguished heart. I am in terrible fear for you, and for many who profess to believe the truth in Battle Creek. Oh! search, search diligently your own hearts, and make thorough work for the Judgment.",
