    "word": "Matthew 22:34-40. Here we have another case to the point. The lawyer asked Christ, \"Which is the great commandment?\" The answer was, that he should love God with all his heart, and his neighbor as himself. \"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\" Now it is impossible for us to love God with all our heart while breaking the fourth commandment, for this precept stands in the center of the decalogue. We should be as a family of obedient children, having the fear of God before us--not slavish fear, but filial fear. There is promised a reward for the obedient and also punishment to the disobedient. Should we decree that God's law is not worthy to be kept, are we not enemies of the Lord? Would He not regard us as such? We are God's children. He has placed sacred things in our trust, and if we say we love Him and do not obey, then we have not the love of God perfected in us. But should we have our duty pointed out to us, then we should walk in the light as obedient children. Probation is given us to test \n\n\n                                    -68- \n\nus. God will not compel us to be obedient but we must see our duty, and then as dutiful children walk in harmony with His requirements.",
