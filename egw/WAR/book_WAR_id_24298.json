    "word": "You in the office who profess to be Christians, put away your levity and your criticism, which are an offense to God. God has men upon whom He is laying burdens to connect with His work in the office. You can greatly mar their experience by your own lack of piety and by your want of respect for sacred things. God calls upon you to be men under the control of His Spirit that you may be guides to lead the youth heavenward. You need Jesus at every step. This time--1891--is a period when we may expect God to manifest His power to His people. The missionary enterprise will not be limited, but enlarged. Men must be in close connection with God, or the enemy will interpose himself between them and God, that they will take his suggestions as the voice of God.",
