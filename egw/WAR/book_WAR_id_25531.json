    "word": "In planning for the erection of the buildings that you propose to put up, do not follow the counsel of those who would invest means for the sake of display. Do not launch out into expensive investments. In laying plans for the sanitarium building, remember that this is to be a building for the sick and suffering. To those who plead for buildings of brick or stone, say, \"We believe that the Lord is soon to come, and we cannot consent to launch out into the erection of expensive buildings.\" For years the erection of such buildings has borne the rebuke of God, but His warnings were not heeded, and at last He permitted His judgments to fall upon the Sanitarium and the publishing house in Battle Creek.",
