    "word": "A Call To All Our People. \n\n     We shall call upon the people to help to the utmost of their ability just now. We shall call upon them to do a work which will be pleasing to God in purchasing the book. We shall ask that every available means be used to help to circulate this book. We shall ask that the whole field be supplied with canvassers. We shall call upon our ministers, as they visit the churches, to encourage men and women to go out as canvassers, to make a decided forward movement in the path of self-denial by giving part of their earnings to help our schools to get out of debt. Surely they can do this much to help the matter.",
