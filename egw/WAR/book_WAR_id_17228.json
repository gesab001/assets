    "word": "A true mother's heart of sympathy goes out for all with whom she comes in contact. With a determined effort she seeks to turn wayward souls to Christ. In His strength she is enabled to do much. And those who have no children have responsibilities to bear. In most cases they may receive to their homes children who are orphaned and homeless. These they may train for Christ's sake to practice those virtues so much needed in our world.--Manuscript 34, March 21, 1899, \"The Home Life.\"",
