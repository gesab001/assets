    "word": "The salvation of human beings means much more than many realize. It means that we are to choose God's way rather than our own. The Lord cannot save men while they refuse to humble themselves under the reproofs and warnings that He sends, strenuously asserting their own will, and following their own course of action.--Letter 133, April 30, 1905, to J. E. White.",
