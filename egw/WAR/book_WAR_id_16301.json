    "word": "From those who see the light and truth the message must go forth with a power that they do not have, and do not feel it essential that they should have.

There is a sleepy indifference upon the people who are right upon the borders of the eternal world. They have missionary work to do, decided testimonies to bear. The trumpet is to give a certain sound in warnings, in reproofs, in entreaties. All should put forth earnest labour in seeking to save perishing souls.",
