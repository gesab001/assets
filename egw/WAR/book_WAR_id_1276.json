The demands upon them as stewards are measured by the extent of their influence.  In their treatment of their fellowman, they should be as fathers,--just, tender, true.  They should be Christ-like in character, uniting with their brethren in the closest bonds of unity and fellowship.--Gospel Workers, p. 495.",
