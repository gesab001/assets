    "word": "Your father and myself took the train westward. We changed cars. . . . We had to wait three hours. The depot was small and not well ventilated. Two respectable-looking ladies seemed quite at home. They took out their pipes and commenced smoking. This was a little more than we could well endure. We found to our joy that the settees were moveable. We took a couple of these out upon the platform where there was pure air to feed our lungs. We here spread out our bread and fruit which had been provided for us by our friends. . . . We enjoyed our luncheon.--Letter 19a, 1875, pp. 2, 3. (To Edson and Emma White, June 24, 1875.)",
