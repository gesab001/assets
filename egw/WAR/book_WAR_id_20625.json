    "word": "Human beings in their suffering humanity are crying unto God, and their prayers are just as surely coming up before God as did the blood of Abel. Christlike men will not employ their time in devising to profit self, and promote their own interest. God is not indifferent to the pressing need of white or black in any place, wherever they may be. Who is saying, \"Be thou warmed, and be thou fed and clothed,\" yet do nothing to relieve the situation?\"--Letter 136, 1898, pp. 3, 5. (To Edson and Emma White, August 14, 1898.)",
