    "word": "Christ took the very course he designed to take toward the afflicted one. He needed health of soul before he could appreciate health of body. \"When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, why reason ye in your hearts? Whether is it easier to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk. But that ye may know that the Son of God hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto you, Arise, take up thy couch, and go into thine house. And immediately he arose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house glorifying God.\" He was healed of the leprosy of sin, healed of the maladies that afflicted his body, healed every whit. \"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, we have seen strange things today.\" What an evidence was this to the priests, rulers and Pharisees.",
