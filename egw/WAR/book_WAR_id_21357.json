    "word": "We have a great deal more to do to care for the inward training that we may have the spirit of Christ. We do not want to find any with the spirit of murmuring and complaining. If you have Christ's spirit you will find that when you are wounded you will not rise up in rebellion. What we want is the inward training. I want the spirit of Christ abiding in me, and Christ says, \"If any man will hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me\" (Revelation 3:20). We have been piling up the rubbish before the door of our hearts and this must all be cleared away. Christ cannot enter there until we do. \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock,\" He says. Clear away the barriers that have been piled up around the door of the heart. He wants you to clear them away and He will come in. . . . \n\n\n                                     -259-",
