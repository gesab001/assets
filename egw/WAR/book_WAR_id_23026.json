    "word": "By some the truth has been preached for a lifetime, but the understanding, darkened by defects of character which are not overcome, prevents them from discovering truth in its matchless loveliness. There yet remain many things for the teachers of present truth to discover. They need to understand some truths in a new aspect--their breadth and their harmony and bearing in relation to other truths that are now dim to the comprehension. If we will search with a humble, contrite spirit, revived by the lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, we will see with the same sight by which Moses endured the seeing of the Invisible. The oil of grace in the vessel with the lamp will enable us to discover wondrous things out of God's Word. A vigorous search will reward the Bible student, and make him a man after the similitude of God. It is the ignorance of minds that are supposed to be wise that makes them so well satisfied with their knowledge of God's Word.",
