    "word": "My husband has been highly favored in being connected with one whom God is leading, counseling, and teaching, by pointing out the way and warning against dangers. To this is due, in a great measure, his success. Those less favorably situated cannot be expected to steer as clear of mistakes as he has done. To contrast their course with his is scarcely just and fair. Too much already \n                                                                           28\nhas been made public in regard to the weaknesses of ministers and others professing the truth. This has injured the cause of God by giving impressions to those not of our faith, that either we were a weak, inefficient people or that uncharitableness existed to a great degree among us. The latter has been the case. These things have worked against us. We should just as zealously guard the reputation of our ministering brethren as we would have them guard our reputation. We should do unto them exactly as we would have them do unto us under similar circumstances. The golden rule has been violated again and again by my husband.",
