    "word": "After spending one week in Melbourne, we shall go on to Sydney. Elder Corliss and wife, W.C.W. and wife, and myself will rally to the help of the brethren in the suburbs of Sydney. Some of the outposts about Sydney have had the message. We shall soon advance to Sydney, and put forth a protracted effort. We shall furnish two or three tents for different localities in the city, and will bring all the talent that we can command into the work. The Lord will give fitness for the work. We ourselves must drink of the water of life, if we would refresh souls who are thirsting for the water of salvation. You can see what is before us. I see no letup in this warfare for us. May the Lord God of Israel plan our battle for us, and qualify us to do a work which will bear the signature of heaven.",
