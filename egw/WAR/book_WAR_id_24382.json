    "word": "Will those who profess to believe the truth listen to the words of Jesus? He has said, \"I am come that ye might have life, and that ye might have it more abundantly.\" \"I am the bread of life.\" \"I am the good Shepherd, and I lay down my life for the sheep.\" Will those who are called by his name believe that the children of God are very precious in his sight? Let us consider what the Lord has done for us. Shall not the love manifested toward us be appreciated, shall it not be permitted to melt our hearts, to humble our pride to the dust? Such was the breadth and length and height and depth of the Saviour's love, that he willingly laid aside his honor, his high command in heaven, and clothed his divinity with humanity, in order that he might become man's substitute and surety.",
