    "word": "Importance of Religious Services \n\n\n     You may work with earnestness in the performance of your mechanical duties, and then, without interest or earnestness, go to religious service, showing that you have no heart in such service. How can such professors grow? It is impossible. They ever remain dwarfs in religious things, and when the judgment shall sit and the books be opened, their names come under the head of slothful servants,--weighed in the balance and found wanting.",
