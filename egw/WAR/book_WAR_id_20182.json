    "word": "Having complied with the Word of God, do not depend on your feelings for evidence of acceptance with God. \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" (Hebrews 11:1). If you have complied with the conditions, believe God, whether or not you feel any different. Christ declared, \"As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. . . . If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love\" (John 14:31;  15:10). Let all who understand the abiding claims of the law of God, yield implicit obedience to every requirement given in the Word. The convictions of the Holy Spirit are warnings which it is dangerous to disregard.",
