    "word": "Some medical men are unfit to act as physicians to women because of the attitude they assume toward them. They take liberties until it becomes a common thing with them to transgress the laws of chastity. Our physicians \n\n\n                                   - 24 - \n\nshould have the highest regard for the directions given By God to His church when they were delivered from Egypt. This will keep them from becoming loose in manners and careless in regard to the laws of chastity. All who will live by the laws that God gave from Sinai may be safely trusted.",
