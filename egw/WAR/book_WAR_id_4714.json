    "word": "Be careful to maintain the elevated character of the missionary work. Let all, both men and women connected with the missions, be constantly inquiring, \u201cWhat am I? and what ought I to be and to do?\u201d Let all consider that they cannot give to others what they do not possess themselves; therefore they should not settle down content with their natural ways and habits, seeking to make no change for the better. Paul says he had not attained, but, \u201cI press toward the mark.\u201d [Philippians 3:14.] There must be constant reformation, unceasing advancement, if we would perfect a symmetrical character.",
