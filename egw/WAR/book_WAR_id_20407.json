    "word": "Monday, October 6, 1873. We arose early and commenced preparations for our homeward journey. We packed all things on the wagon, and Sister Hall, my husband, and myself rose and walked a little until we had traveled about twelve miles over very rough road, through woods of fallen timber. Willie rode an Indian pony. We halted to take dinner, but as we began to search for the bag of provisions we found by some means it had left us and we had no dinner except a pie and a small loaf of bread. We sent Willie back to find our bag of supplies, fearful he might have to return the entire distance.",
