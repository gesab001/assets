    "word": "Every church should be a working church. We should make ourselves useful, and do the little duties around us and that will prepare us for the greater responsibilities. When Christ ascended on high He left His disciples to carry forward the work. However unpleasant it may be, we should take up the humble duties of life. Christ says, \"Whosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Mark 8:34. What is the cross of Christ? It is not an ornament to the neck, but something that cuts right across our pathway. Satan is constantly watching for our souls. He seeks to lead us from the cross of Christ.",
