    "word": "There are dangers to be guarded against on the right hand and on the left. There will be inexperienced ones, newly come to the faith, who need to be strengthened, and to have a correct example set before them. Some will not make a right use of the doctrine of justification by faith. They will present it in a one-sided manner. Others will seize the ideas that have not been correctly presented, and will go clear over the mark, ignoring works altogether. Now, genuine faith always works by love. It supplies a motive power. Faith is not an opiate, but a stimulant. When you look to Calvary, it is not to quiet your soul in the non-performance of duty, not to compose yourself for sleep, but to create faith in Jesus, faith that will work, and purify the soul from all the slime of selfishness. When we lay hold of Christ by faith, our work has but just begun. Every one has corrupt and sinful habits, that must be overcome through vigorous warfare. Every soul must fight the fight of faith. If he is a follower of Christ, he cannot be sharp in deal, he cannot be hard-hearted, devoid of sympathy; he cannot be coarse in speech; he cannot be a surmiser of evil, an accuser of the brethren; he cannot be full of pomposity and self-esteem; he cannot be overbearing, nor can he use harsh words, and censure and condemn.",
