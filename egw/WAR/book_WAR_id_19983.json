    "word": "\"If, after carrying on manual training for one year, the managers of the school find that there has been a loss, let them seek to discover the reason for this, and guard against it in the future. But let not the spirit of censure prevail; for the Spirit of Christ is grieved when words of unkind criticism are spoken to those who have done their best. In the Word of God there is encouragement as well as caution. God forbid that the hands of those who are trying to carry forward this line of work should be weakened.\"--Counsels, pp. 315, 316.",
