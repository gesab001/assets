    "word": "I often in my mind look toward Takoma Park, [MABEL (MRS. WORKMAN) WAS AT THAT TIME SERVING AS MATRON AT THE COLLEGE IN TAKOMA PARK.] a place that has been of great interest to me. Your grandfather, I think, never saw this beautiful spot. The Lord selected this place for us for the establishment of our printing house and our school and sanitarium. Here a work of education may be carried on in God's order. Here principal and teachers should pledge themselves to become true Bible teachers, keeping ever before them the glory of God. If those who hold positions of responsibility in this work are guided by the counsel of God's Word, all difficulties will be wisely and successfully met.",
