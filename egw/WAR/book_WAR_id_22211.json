    "word": "Those who do such things have set themselves up as judges through admitting evil thoughts. One who engages in this work communicates to his hearers a measure of his own spirit of darkness and unbelief; his evil surmisings sow in their minds the seeds of bitterness and suspicion toward one whom God has delegated to do a certain work. If they think one makes a mistake, it is seized upon, magnified, and reported to others, and thus many are led to take up the reproach against their neighbor. They watch eagerly for all that is wrong, and close their eyes to, and are unable to appreciate, all that is commendable and righteous.",
