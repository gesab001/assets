    "word": "The work of the Lord must be carried forward intelligently. Clear, well-defined plans must be laid for the spread of our message. Men are needed who will manifest the spirit and the mind of Christ. He calls for men who are consecrated to Him, body, soul, and spirit, who will carry out His will in meekness and humility, respecting the counsels given by His spirit. Let every man stand in his lot and place, looking to Christ as his Guide and Counselor, and yoking up with his brethren in service for the Master.",
