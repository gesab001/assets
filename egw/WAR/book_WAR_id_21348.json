These men were just as sincere as those who criticized, men of correct principles--but who did not harmonize with their views concerning the law in Galatians. I knew how the Lord regarded their spirit and action, and if they did thus in ignorance, through perverted ideas, they have had all the opportunity God will ever give them to know He has given these men a work to do, and a message to bear which is present truth \n\n\n                                    -224- \n\nfor this time.
