    "word": "The publishing institution was built up by sacrifice, but by the example men in responsible places have given to the people, this spirit has been lost. The Lord has not stirred hearts to give for the advancement of the cause, and selfishness has leavened the churches. Unfaithful stewardship has been revealed in the payment of large wages to men who have made God's work and cause a matter of merchandise by which to enrich themselves. Those at the very heart of the work have displeased the Lord, and he has turned away from his people. Temptations came to the people, and back sliding was the result. If they had called together the men of the conference and demanded an investigation of matters - which it was their right to do - decisive measures would have been taken to stop the existing evil. But this was not done. Had they changed the order of things, and brought in the same principles which were revealed in the work when the first buildings were erected, the spirit of self-sacrifice would have been retained, and the work have moved onward and upward. God's people would have understood that the way and work of the Lord can not prosper when his people are unwilling to sacrifice self. Heavenly intelligences would have helped them to climb to higher levels, to understand by experimental knowledge that they were to be laborers together with God. God desires that his people shall be conquerors, moving bravely through all difficulties. God is faithful. He will make his people complete in him.",
