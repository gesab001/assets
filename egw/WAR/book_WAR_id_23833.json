    "word": "God will be with His people just as long as they follow His directions. If He says to one, Go to Nineveh, and warn the inhabitants of that wicked city of their danger, He sends His angels with His servant to protect him till his work is done. But we need to remember that in our association and connection with the depraved, there are bounds and barriers which cannot safely be overstepped. We need to be guarded, lest the atmosphere surrounding our souls shall become clouded, and through Satan's deceptive power we shall lose all sense of the difference between righteousness and holiness and defilement and sin.",
