    "word": "I had an easy carriage, but the toggling of it was after the backwoods style--ropes for lines, wire for traces, and all things in the same order. But the carriage was easy. We made the journey to the depot. . . . I had just got under the shelter of the depot piazza when the rain came down much heavier. I then tried to take off my rigging, which was a gentleman's rubber coat held together by the buttonholes with strings. In this way I was protected. I had on no hat, but a little shawl over my head. The hat was in safety with Sister Rousseau and Maude, in a tin hat box. I scarcely knew myself, I was so togged up, but I felt grateful to my heavenly Father that we had progressed thus far toward home. We were soon on the cars and came on to Granville safely. We felt that we were under the protecting care of our heavenly Father. We saw swollen streams, the rivers rising nearly to the bridges and the carriage roads, but we were all safe and comfortable. . . .",
