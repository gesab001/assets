    "word": "I mean to devote any book in the future, that will be the most suitable for the school purposes, to sustain the school for colored people. I am to act my part, and I\n90\ncall upon those who have a sense of duty to act your part and show by your works a faith in God and His promises to go forward and lift the banner high and encourage-but not one discouraging word where the work is the most discouraging. Let the workers who have a mind to work be sustained and built up and helped in every way possible. If the white people who have sympathetic hearts will undertake this kind of [work], many will frame excuses why they should not do the work. If others will not [work], do not ease your own conscience by complaints that should never be heard from sanctified lips and from pure hearts who are dependent upon the very same Redeemer that every white and colored soul is dependent upon in order to be saved.",
