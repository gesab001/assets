    "word": "North Fitzroy, January 5, 1892 \n\n                Unity and Humility Among the Workers \n\n\n     The stewards of God have not done their duty. If they had, the work would be far in advance of what it is today. But we labor under far less difficulty than the world's Redeemer had to encounter. We should feel that we are stewards of His grace, trusted with our Masters goods. If we do our best, exercise our entrusted capabilities with the sole purpose of doing our Master's work and promoting His glory, the smallest talent, the humblest service, may become a consecrated gift, made acceptable by the fragrance of His own merit.",
