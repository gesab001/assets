    "word": "\"And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward. But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it, and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.\" God would have Moses understand that he would work for his people--that their necessity would be his opportunity. When they should go as far as they could, he must bid them to still go forward; that he should use the rod God had given him to divide the waters.",
