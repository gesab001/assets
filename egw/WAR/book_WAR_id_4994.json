    "word": "In these words Christ draws a contrast between the self-seeking practices of the world, and the unselfish ministry of which He has given an example in His own life. For such ministry He offers no reward of worldly gain or recognition. \"Thou shalt be recompensed,\" He says, \"at the resurrection of the just.\" Then the results of every life will be made manifest, and every one will reap that which he has sown.",
