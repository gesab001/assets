    "word": "By love of money, desire for the supremacy, dishonesty, we not only rob God of the fruit of his vineyard, but we practice selfishness toward our brethren \n                                                                           151\nand toward those who are weighing and measuring the influence exerted by the one who claims to love God and obey the truth. God has placed men and women in positions of trust that they may represent him. He has given them talents that they may work in his service. But in their selfishness men misuse these talents. The talent of means is the most dangerous and the most deceptive when put to a wrong use. God's word declares that the love of money is the root of all evil.",
