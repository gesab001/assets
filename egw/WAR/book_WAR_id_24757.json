    "word": "The Work Before Us \n\n     I say to our people, Let not those on whom we must depend to do gospel missionary work in places where the truth should be represented, be drawn away by any pretense from their work. The cause of God needs the very best workers. God's workers are ever to cherish a clear idea of what constitutes pure and undefiled religion. In the cities where the truth is to be established there will be needed workers of Bible faith and practice. The work of God is to be carried forward in the South, and the youths whose talents makes them most desired in Battle Creek are to be ready to step into the places prepared for them in institutions where they can obtain a training for work without being thrown into companionship of worldly people, who know not God, and whose wrong sentiments will leaven the mind of those with whom they are brought in contact. We cannot afford to allow the minds of our youth to be thus leavened; for it is on these youth that we must depend to carry forward the work in the future.",
