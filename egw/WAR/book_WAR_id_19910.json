    "word": "The course pursued by these unconsecrated ones toward Marcus resulted in his leaving the Office. Marcus was a true gentleman. He possessed excellent traits of character. He had a high sense of the Christian religion. The coldness, and backslidings, and lack of principle, exhibited by those who had for years professed the Christian religion, distressed and vexed him. Unbelief took possession of his soul. Those who labored in the Office are accountable for his leaving the Office. Marcus was treated with disrespect by some. His imperfect speech in our language excited the mirth of those who ought to have been a blessing to Marcus; and his imperfect English should have caused their hearts to magnify God that a stranger to Christ and the truth had been united with them to do a work that those who could speak the English language readily could not do. They should have seen the providence of God in converting this educated Jew to the Christian religion to do his part in proclaiming the message to all nations, and tongues, and people.",
