    "word": "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be when the Son of man shall be revealed. The Lord is removing his restrictions from the earth, and there will be death and destruction, and increasing crime, and evil, cruel workings against the rich who have exalted themselves above the poor. Those who have not God's protection will find no safety in any place or position. Human agents are being trained, and are using their inventive power to put in operation all the most powerful machinery to wound and kill. Instead of our enlarging and erecting additional buildings in Battle Creek or other places where our institutions are already established, there should be a limiting of the wants. Let the means and workers be scattered to represent the truth and give the warning message in \"regions beyond.\"",
