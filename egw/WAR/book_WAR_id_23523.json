    "word": "I have a warning to give to this body assembled in this house in General Conference. [THESE WORDS FROM P. 510 OF THE 1890 DIARY MAY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 8, 1891. THE GENERAL CONFERENCE SESSION CONVENED ON MARCH 5 AND CONTINUED FOR THREE WEEKS.] There is danger of our institutions creating plans and ways and means that mean not success, but defeat. I dare not let this Conference close and those assembled return to their homes without telling you to consider carefully every proposition presented, every plan laid before you. Give not hastily to these plans your \"yea\" and \"amen,\" and be not carried away with propositions that appear innocent, but whose end is disaster and forfeiture of the favor of God. . . .",
