    "word": "If the Minister Tempts.--The slightest insinuations, from whatever source they may come, inviting you to indulge in sin or to allow the least unwarrantable liberty \n                                                                           336\nwith your persons should be resented as the worst of insults to your dignified womanhood. The kiss upon your cheek, at an improper time and place, should lead you to repel the emissary of Satan with disgust.
