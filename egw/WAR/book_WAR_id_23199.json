    "word": "Christ is the Good Shepherd, with earnest, unwearied steps seeking for the lost sheep. He attended the great yearly festivals of the nation, and to the multitudes, absorbed in outward ceremony, He spoke of heavenly things, bringing eternity within their view. He gained the attention of high and low, rich and poor. To all He brought treasures from the storehouse of wisdom. He delighted and comforted the poor and lowly with the assurance of God's love for them. He spoke to them in language so simple that they could not fail to understand, and His words lifted their minds to the heavenly Father, full of grace and tenderness.",
