Preserve the dignity of the truth. It will grow to large proportions. Many countries are waiting for the advanced light the Lord has \n                                                                           4\nfor them; and your faith is limited, it is very small.

God will work with great power if you will walk in all humility of mind before Him. It is not faith to talk of impossibilities. Nothing is impossible with God. The light of the binding claims of the law of God is to test and prove the world. . . .",
