    "word": "In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ said, \"When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward\" [Matthew 6:5]. The hypocrites, while praying, are seen of men, but their pretended prayers bring no returns from above.",
