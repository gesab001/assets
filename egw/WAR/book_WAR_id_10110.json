    "word": "Christ had foretold that deceivers would arise, through whose influence \"iniquity\" should \"abound,\" and \"the love of many\" should \"wax cold\" (Matthew 24:12). He had warned the disciples that the church would be in more danger from this evil than from the persecution of her enemies. Again and again Paul warned the believers against these false teachers. This peril, above all others, they must guard against; for by receiving false teachers, they would open the door to errors by which the enemy would dim the spiritual perceptions and shake the confidence of those newly come to the faith of the gospel.",
