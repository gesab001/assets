    "word": "There are those who are premature in their desire to reform things that to them appear faulty. They think that they should be chosen to take the place of those who have made mistakes. They undervalue what these workers have done while others were looking on and criticizing. By their actions they say: \"I can do great things. I can carry the work forward successfully.\" To those who think they know so well how to avoid mistakes, I am instructed to say, \"Judge not, that ye be not judged.\" [Matthew 7:1.] You might avoid mistakes on some points, but on other things you are liable to make grave blunders, which would be very difficult to remedy, and which would bring confusion into the work. These mistakes might do more harm than those your brethren have made.",
