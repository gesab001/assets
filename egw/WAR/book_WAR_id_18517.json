    "word": "The Lord designs that the means entrusted to us shall be used in building up his kingdom. His goods are committed to his stewards, that they may be carefully traded upon, and bring back a revenue to him in the saving of souls unto eternal life. And these souls in their turn will become stewards of truth, to co-operate with the great firm in the interests of the kingdom of God.",
