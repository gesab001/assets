    "word": "The Lord has need of faithful stewards in connection with His work, and this He has not had. There has been much confusion and evil working in the Committee and Board meetings.

The men who have devised and planned are not the ones who should have been in trust, for they were no more qualified to grasp and manage the large responsibilities than are children to guide the steamships over the broad ocean.",
