    "word": "I have waited long for others to feel the importance of placing before the world the warnings in Volume Four. I have waited for them to bring the matter before our canvassers. But no one seems to feel that they have any special duty in the matter. Now I present it to you, my brethren, in the name of the Lord. I think that many of you do not know what it contains, and I ask you to study it carefully and prayerfully. Then you will see the force of my words; you will see the necessity of urging that it find a place in every family among us, and that it be carried to the world.",
