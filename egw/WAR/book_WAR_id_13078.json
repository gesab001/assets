The apostle Paul, looking down through the ages, had written words of encouragement and warning for the tried, waiting ones at this crisis: \"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.\" Hebrews 10:35-39.",
