    "word": "During the General Conference of 1901, the Lord warned me against sentiments that were being gathered and then held by Brethren Prescott and [E. J.] Waggoner. Instruction was given me that these sentiments received have been as leaven put into meal. Many minds have received them. The ideas of some regarding a great experience called and supposed to be sanctification, have been the alpha of a train of deception which will deceive and ruin the souls of those who receive them. Because of some overdrawn expressions \n\n\n                                   -357- \n\nfrequently used by Brother E. J. Waggoner at the conference, I was led to speak words intended to counteract their influence. If ever there was a time when our brethren should blend in unity it is now. You are engaged in an important work in Washington. I am very anxious that the work in that place shall be carried forward exactly as the Lord would have it. But Satan is surely presenting some false theories which you must not receive. Elders Waggoner and Prescott are out of the way.--Letter 269, 1903, pp. 1, 2 (Dec. 14, 1903).",
