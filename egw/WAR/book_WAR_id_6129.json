    "word": "My soul is burdened as I look over the destitute fields here in Europe, and see the poverty of many, and the difficulties they must meet in keeping the Sabbath, and then think how the way to reach souls is blocked up for want of means. The Lord has made provision that all may be reached by the message of truth, but the means placed in the hands of his stewards for this very purpose has been selfishly devoted to their own gratification. How much has been thoughtlessly wasted by our youth, spent for self-indulgence and display, for that which they would have been just as happy without. Every dollar which we possess is the Lord's. Instead of spending means for needless things, we should invest it in answering the calls of missionary work.",
