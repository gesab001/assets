    "word": "The Lord guards every man's interest. He was always the poor man's friend, and would have his interests sacredly guarded. There is a most wonderful dearth of the love of Christ in the hearts of nearly all of those who are handling sacred things. I would echo from one part of the earth to the other, that the love of Christ should be cultivated; it should well up in the soul of the Christian like streams in the desert, refreshing the heart, bringing gladness, peace, and joy into their own as well as into other lives. No man liveth unto himself. If there is the least of depression practised toward the poor, or unjust dealing with them either in large or small things, God will hold the actor accountable. The very first work, my brethren, is to secure the blessing of God in your own hearts. This is where the work begins. Then take the blessing into your homes; let the atmosphere of cheerfulness and kindness prevail; put away your criticisms, overcome your exacting spirit. The atmosphere that surrounds you in your homes will also envelop you in the office. Wherever the love of Jesus reigns, there is pity, tenderness, and thoughtful care for others. The most precious work that my brethren can engage in is that of forming a Christlike character that they may enter into the mansions which Christ has gone to prepare for them. I cannot be a party to any unjust dealing with any of God's children.",
