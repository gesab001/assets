    "word": "But men's natural appetites have been perverted by indulgence. Through unholy gratification they have become \"fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\" Unless the Christian watches unto prayer, he gives loose reign to habits which should be overcome. Unless he feels the need of constant watching, ceaseless vigilance, his inclinations, abused and misguided, will be the means of his backsliding from God.",
