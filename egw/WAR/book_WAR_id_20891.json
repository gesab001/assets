    "word": "At one time light came that we should go to Portsmouth. But we had no money. We got all ready and were waiting when a man came riding very fast to our door. Jumping from his wagon, he said, \"There is somebody here that wants money. I have come fourteen miles at the highest speed that my horse would go.\" Said my husband, \"We are all ready to start to attend an important meeting, but were waiting for money. We shall not have time to catch the cars now unless you take us.\" He did so, and we had just time to reach the cars, step upon the platform without purchasing tickets when the car started. This was the way the Lord educated us to trust in Him. In this way the truth has entered many places. Our faith and trust in God has been tested and tried again and again. For years we labored constantly to carry forward the work under the pressure of feebleness and great poverty. We have tried to the best of our ability to save means in every way possible that the work of God might go forward.",
