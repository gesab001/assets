    "word": "My brother, you must no longer disparage the messengers and the message God has sent you in regard to the principles of healthful living. Testimony after testimony has been given which should have brought about great reforms, but at home and abroad your life has been a decided witness against the warnings which the Lord has sent. And nothing brings such discouragement upon the Lord's watchmen as to be connected with those who have mental capacity, and who understand the reasons of our faith, but by precept and example manifest indifference to moral obligations.",
