    "word": "Arouse, Arouse, Arouse! \n\n     My brethren and sisters, have you improved your opportunities to bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord? God wants you to co-operate with Him in this work. Will you do it? May God help every father and every mother to arouse to the responsibilities that rest upon them. You must not let mischief come to your children; you must not see it coming, and say no word of warning to them. I am now grown old, and my children are men; but I could not today see one of them going into wrong ways and say nothing to him about it. I would be responsible if I did not counsel them in regard to the way of the Lord.",
