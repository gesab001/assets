    "word": "NEGLECT OF PRAYER IS PROGRESSIVE.\u2014Beware how you neglect secret prayer and a study of God\u2019s word. These are your weapons against him who is striving to hinder your progress heavenward. The first neglect of prayer and Bible study makes easier the second neglect. The first resistance to the Spirit\u2019s pleading prepares the way for the second resistance. Thus the heart is hardened, and \n182\nthe conscience seared.\u2014(Messages to Young People, 96.)",
