    "word": "Let us see what comes of not being self-centered, and not taking time to brood over our ailments and afflictions. We will take time to consider that there is somebody in the world besides ourselves, and we will begin to work in Christ's lines, our spirits will become anointed and His righteousness will go before us. Then if ye do these things \"thy light shall break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily.\" And it is a double health. It is not only bodily health, but spiritual health and power, spiritual sinew and muscle. \"Thine health shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee: and the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward\"--the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He has taken away our sins because we have repented of our transgression of the law of God. Our sin is taken away and in its place the righteousness of God is imputed unto us. Here the vacuum is supplied by blessing of God. That is what supplies the place. \"Thy righteousness shall go before thee.\" Jesus Christ our righteousness. \"And the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.\" If the righteousness of God goes before in the path that we travel, we have got a most glorious wake behind us. God's people are blessed. They stand out distinguished by light and love and power, and the world sees that there is somebody who will work according to the law of God.",
