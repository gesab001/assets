    "word": "God speaks to nations and to cities, sending them messages of mercy, which, if accepted, would save them from great calamities. If they would be guided by his voice, he would be their protector, their front guard and their rear ward. But like the Jews they know not the \n207\ntime of their visitation. In their pride of heart they refuse his guidance, and are left to walk in their own counsels, and, like God's ancient people, to reap the harvest which they have sown.",
