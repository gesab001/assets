    "word": "God designs that his precious word, with its messages of warning and encouragement, shall come to those who are in darkness, and are ignorant of our faith. Do not feel that the responsibility rests upon you to convict and convert the hearers. It is the power of God alone that can soften the hearts of the people. His heavenly intelligences co-operate with your efforts in presenting the words of life and salvation to those who are ready to perish. The message of warning is to be given to all, and will be to them a witness, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. You are \n\n\n                     - 4 - \n\nto hold forth the word of life, that all may have an opportunity of receiving the truth if they will. If they turn from the truth of heavenly origin, it will be their condemnation.",
