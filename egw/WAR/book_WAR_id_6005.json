    "word": "My brethren in the ministry, I entreat of you to be just as kind and forbearing toward those who are new in the faith, as you wanted others to be toward you when you first came to the knowledge of the truth. In meekness and love teach them to bear responsibilities, and to labor for others. Jesus loves them just as much as he does you, and is just as willing to help them if they will learn to trust in him. If you see imperfections in them, do not discourage them and drive them from the truth by manifesting an overbearing, critical spirit. This is not the spirit of Christ. What does God say? \u201cCome now, and let us reason together.\u201d He does not say, You are defective, and I will have nothing to do with you. \u201cThough your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.\u201d \n     Wednesday morning, Sept. 16.",
