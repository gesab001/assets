    "word": "Talk faith, and make your faith perfect by your works. Even though you feel that some of your brethren do not manifest that faith that works by love and purifies the soul, you have opportunities to obtain a rich experience. Move steadily forward, putting forth all the powers of sanctified intellect. Keep ever in view the great Pattern, Christ Jesus. Work out your own salvation, revealing in your life the work of the grace of God. No man can do your work for you. Pray in faith. You and your wife have had a valuable experience. The history of the Redeemer is full of meaning to us. \"He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not. Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed\" [Isaiah 53:3-5]. \n\n\n                                  -77-",
