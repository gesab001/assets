    "word": "May the petition of this congregation come up before Thee at this time as a power before Thy throne. We know that our Saviour is presenting His hands before Thee, saying, \"I have graven them upon the palms of My hands.\" Oh, God, I plead with Thee, for Christ's sake, that Thou wilt accept our petitions for these that are going away. They know not what is before them; but they have Thy promise that Thy righteousness shall go before them, and that the glory of the Lord shall be their rearward.",
