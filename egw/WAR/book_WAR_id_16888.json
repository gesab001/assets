    "word": "This song and the great deliverance which it commemorates made an impression never to be effaced from the memory of the Hebrew people. From age to age it was echoed by the prophets and singers of Israel, testifying that Jehovah is the strength and deliverance of those who trust in Him. That song does not belong to the Jewish people alone. It points forward to the destruction of all the foes of righteousness and the final victory of the Israel of God. The prophet of Patmos beholds the white-robed multitude that have \u201cgotten the victory,\u201d standing on the \u201csea of glass mingled with fire,\u201d having \u201cthe harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb\u201d (Revelation 15:2, 3). . . .",
