    "word": "The misapplication of noble talents in Solomon\u2019s case should be a warning to all. Goodness alone is true greatness. Everyone will transmit a heritage of good or of evil. On the southern eminence of the Mount of Olives were the memorial stones of Solomon\u2019s apostasy. . . . Josiah, the youthful reformer, in his religious zeal destroyed these images of Ashtoreth and Chemosh and Moloch, but the broken fragments and masses of ruins remained opposite Mount Moriah, where stood the temple of God. As strangers in after generations asked, \u201cWhat mean these ruins confronting the temple of the Lord?\u201d they were answered, \u201cThere is Solomon\u2019s Mount of Offense, where he built altars for idol worship to please his heathen wives.\u201dLetter 8b, 1891.",
