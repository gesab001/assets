    "word": "The necessity of working for the women of the W.C.T.U. has never been fully and squarely met. The problem has never received the consideration it ought to have received. If the workers in the W.C.T.U. can obtain the true faith, and set their feet in the right path, what a work will be done. But there is to be no driving on our part, no warfare, no use of the two-edged sword, which cuts every way. This people have been rich in good works. When the light of present truth is given them through carefully prepared methods, when the golden oil is received into the willing hearts of our workers, the treasures of truth and grace will be communicated from one to another. By the women of the W.C.T.U. the law of God is misunderstood. If they can be enlightened in (413) regard to this point, we shall see that their educated ability will do much more than it is now doing to create working forces for the advancement of truth and righteousness.",
