    "word": "With a Hook Properly Baited.--The intelligent, the refined, are altogether too much passed by. The hook is not baited to catch this class, and ways and methods  are not prayerfully devised to reach them with truth that is able to make them wise unto salvation. Most  generally the fashionable, the wealthy, the proud, understand by experience that happiness is not to be  secured by the amount of money that they possess, or by costly edifices, and ornamental furniture and pictures. They want something they have not. But this class are attracted toward each other, and it is hard to find access to them; and because of this many are perishing in their sins who long for something that will give them rest and peace and quietude of mind. They need Jesus, the light of righteousness.",
