    "word": "There are those who have entered the medical profession who should have chosen some other calling. They are unsympathetic. They seem to think the proper way to do is to withhold all words of sympathy, and gird up their compassion so that not a particle of it shall be drawn out. They are cold and uncommunicative, and leave no warm, cheering influence. They seem to think words of tenderness and compassion are an evidence of weakness. If they could once be put in the place of the suffering one whose will and spirit are humbled and weakened by suffering, who longs for tender sympathy, for words of assurance, they would be better prepared to appreciate his feelings. If the physician would state plainly the nature of the disease in words that the patient can understand, and express the belief that he can soon give him relief, this would go far toward putting him in an easy state of mind, and incline him to rest his case in the hands of one who he thinks really knows what to do to relieve him.",
