    "word": "I now say, Let all beware of men. Let not those connected with our institutions follow the lead of any man, to carry out the policy of the world; for thus they place themselves under the influence of the enemy, and unless the Lord shall interpose, they will have no power to escape from the snare. The Lord is in earnest with us. In His Word He has declared that many shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. They will go to great lengths in departing from God.",
