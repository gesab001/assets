SISTER WHITE, IN REFERRING TO IT, SAID, \"Once more the inhabitants of the earth were presented before me; and again everything was in the utmost confusion. \n                                                                           9\nStrife, war, and bloodshed, with famine and pestilence, raged everywhere. . . . Then men's hearts failed them for fear, 'and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.'\" WHEN PEACE WAS DECLARED IN EUROPE MEN WERE STILL HOPEFUL THROUGH A LEAGUE OF NATIONS TO BRING ABOUT THE REIGN OF PEACE, BUT AS THE FINAL CONFLICT OPENS ALL HOPE IS GIVEN UP. THEIR HEARTS WILL THEN FAIL THEM FOR FEAR.",
