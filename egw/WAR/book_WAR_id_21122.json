    "word": "The allegation that Mrs. White, on returning to America, asked to be shown the buildings during a visit to Chicago is apparently based only on Stewart's assertion that this took place. By way of evidence that this charge of Stewart's is not well founded, we need only mention that Mrs. White did not concede at this or any other time that perhaps a slight mistake had been made. She did explain that she indeed thought buildings had been erected, but this was not until 1903. (See EGW Letter 135, 1903 to S. N. Haskell, March 6, \n\n\n                                   -351- \n\n1903.) Even then, in 1903, she said: \"I understand that someone said that the testimony that I bore in regard to this was not true,--that no such building was erected in Chicago. But the testimony was true. The Lord showed me what men were planning to do.\"--Letter 135, 1903, p. 2.",
