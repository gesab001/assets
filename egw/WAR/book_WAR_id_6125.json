    "word": "The interest and labors of the church must be extended more earnestly and decidedly to both home and foreign missions. Those who have been successful in using their talents to secure earthly treasures should now employ these capabilities to advance God's cause and build up his kingdom. Their tact and ability sanctified to God, will be accepted, and he will make it effective in the grand work of turning men from error to truth. There should be deep heart-searching with our young men and women to see if they have not a work to do for the Master. There is a work to be accomplished which money cannot do. Destitute fields must be supplied with earnest laborers, with those whose hearts are warm with the love of Christ and with love for souls. All who enter the missionary field will have hardships and trials to endure; they will find hard work, and plenty of it; but those of the right stamp of character will persevere under difficulties, discouragements, and privations, holding firmly to the arm of the Lord. They will show a zeal that will not flag, a faith that will not yield, a resolution that will not weaken. They are doing no more than God requires, when they dedicate themselves, soul, body, and spirit, to his service, becoming partakers with Christ in his sufferings. If they share his self-denial and cross-bearing, they will be partakers also in his joy,\u2014the joy of seeing souls saved through their instrumentality in the kingdom of glory.",
