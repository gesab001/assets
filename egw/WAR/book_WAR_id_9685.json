    "word": "Silent Messenger Their Only Preacher.--I was shown that the truth once published now, will stand, for it is the truth for the last days; it will live, and less need be said upon it in future. Numberless words need not be put upon paper to justify what speaks for itself and shines in its clearness. Truth is straight, plain, clear, and stands out boldly in its own defense; but it is not so with error. It is so winding and twisting that it needs a multitude of words to explain it in its crooked form. I saw that all the light they had received in some places had come from the paper; that \n\n48 \n\nsouls had received the truth in this way, [THE REVIEW AND HERALD, WHICH AT THAT TIME, 1853, WAS PUBLISHED SEMIMONTHLY.] and then talked it to others; and that now in places where there are several, they had been raised up by this silent messenger. It was their only preacher. The cause of truth should not be hindered in its onward progress for want of means.--EW 96.",
