    "word": "Our Sanitarium was erected to benefit suffering humanity, rich and poor, the world over. Many of our churches have but little interest in this institution, notwithstanding they have sufficient evidence that it is one of the instrumentalities designed of God to bring men and women under the influence of truth, and to \n                                                                           11\nsave many souls. The churches that have the poor among them should not neglect their stewardship, and throw the burden of the poor and sick upon the Sanitarium. All the members of the several churches are responsible before God for their afflicted ones. They should bear their own burdens. If they have sick persons among them, whom they wish to be benefited by treatment, they should, if able, send them to the Sanitarium. In doing this, they will not only be patronizing the institution which God has established, but will be helping those who need help,-caring for the poor as God requires us to do.",
