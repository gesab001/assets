    "word": "The licentiate and profligate is attended by an ever-wary fiend. He is like a haunted being. He is a slave to passion, the chains of which he is unwilling to break. And at last he is left of God without conviction, without mercy, without hope, to destroy himself. He is left to the natural process of corrupting practices which degrade him below the brute creation. His sinfulness has ruined his mechanism of the living machinery, and nature's laws transgressed become his tormentor.",
