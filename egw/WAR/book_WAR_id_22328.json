    "word": "But shall we be silent? The sinner does not wish to have facts presented to him that condemn his practices, for he must either resist the pleadings of God through the human agent, or surrender his way and will to the ways and will of God. But although he does not desire to be warned, the work of warning goes on, that those who are spiritually sick, poor, blind, and naked, may be aroused to their condition. As we warn the spiritually lost, so continuous efforts must be put forth for the salvation of the slaves of appetite, and passion, and overwork.",
