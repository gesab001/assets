    "word": "Brethren, give no place to the devil. Do all you possibly can to break the deception that is upon Brother McCullagh. Oh, that he would see how unwilling he has been to counsel with his brethren, or to be corrected in any way. His case is extremely perilous, because in his home there is a channel through whom the enemy works. I greatly desire that Brother and Sister McCullagh shall be saved, but unless Sister McCullagh shall see herself what manner of spirit she is of, she will ever be an hindrance to her husband. The Lord loves Brother McCullagh because his soul is precious, but He will never excuse sin. If Brother McCullagh will accept of the working of the Holy Spirit, the Lord will pardon him, He will take away his natural and hereditary tendencies. But God will not compel obedience from any soul. The Lord will work with him, if he will repent and be converted, and will give him His Holy Spirit, which will enable him to overcome and receive the overcomer's reward.",
