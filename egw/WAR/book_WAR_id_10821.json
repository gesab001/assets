    "word": "Coming Calamities.--A world is represented in the destruction of Jerusalem, and the warning given then by Christ comes sounding down the line to our time: \"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring\" (Luke 21:25). Yes, they shall pass their borders, and destruction will be in their track. They will engulf the ships that sail upon their broad waters, and with the burden of their living freight, they will be hurried into eternity, without time to repent.",
