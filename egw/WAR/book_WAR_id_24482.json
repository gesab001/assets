    "word": "Coldness and selfishness will take possession of the soul if we will give it any encouragement. We want not to exemplify the attributes of Satan in anything. We want to be partakers of the divine nature, refreshed in soul and spirit by drinking of the living water that makes glad the city of God. Talk it, pray it, act it, the love of Jesus for fallen humanity. Let every soul become imbued and radiant with the word and Spirit and love of God, and he a medium through which the light and blessing may be communicated to our world. Let this loveless, Pharisaical religion of forms and ceremonies be cleansed away from the heart and life of every Christian, and let the sweet influence of the Spirit of God have a controlling power upon every soul. Ye are the light of the world, to shine amid the moral darkness of the world. We \n                                                                           1277\nmust be imbued with the love of Jesus; all this selfish spirit toward brethren must be rooted out.",
