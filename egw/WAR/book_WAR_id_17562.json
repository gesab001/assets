    "word": "If you engage in this work of mercy and love, will the work prove too hard for you? Will you fail and be crushed under the burden, and your family be deprived of your assistance and influence? Oh, no; God has carefully removed all doubts upon this question, by a pledge to you on condition of your obedience. This promise covers all that the most exacting, the most hesitating, could crave. \"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily.\" Only believe that He is faithful that hath promised. God can renew the physical strength. And more, He says He will do it. And the promise does not end here. \"Thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.\" God will build a fortification around thee. The promise does not stop even here. \"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am.\" If ye put down oppression and remove the speaking of vanity, if ye draw out your soul to the hungry, \"then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday: and the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought [famine], and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\"--Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 33-35. \n                                                                           32",
