    "word": "Maintaining a High Moral Standard \n\n     Some who have influence, who are apparently working for the interest of the sanitarium, encourage by their own course of action a disregard of rules and of order; and the influence of such persons goes a long way toward encouraging insubordination, especially in the direction of courtship and marriage. The parties are unfitted for their duties; they live an unreal life, indulge in too high and romantic visions of bliss, and in their desire to please each other they become unfaithful.",
