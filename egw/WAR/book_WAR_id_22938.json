    "word": "There is great danger of the young man, whom he called A, of becoming that which you do not now dream of. But your course which you have entered upon is one of temptation at every step. Yielding to follow the temptations of Satan you are engaging in foolish and hurtful lusts. This is beneath the dignity of a soul bought by the blood of Jesus Christ, capable through the provisions Christ has made in his behalf of becoming a child of God, an heir to an immortal inheritance, an eternal substance in the kingdom of God. Your course is now toward perdition. You \n\n\n                                     -53- \n\nare sacrificing health and happiness, and if you follow on, you will reap that which you have sown and it is a terrible, forbidding harvest.",
