    "word": "If you lay your hand upon the work of the great instrumentality of God--to write your superscription upon it and put your mould upon it--it will be dangerous business for you, and disastrous to the work of God. It will be as great a sin in the sight of God as when Uzzah put forth his hand to steady the ark of God. All that God requires of you who have entered into other men's labors, is humbly to do your individual duty. You are to deal justly toward all those employed for the work by the people, you are to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God. This you have not done. Your works testify against you. If you fail to do this, whatever may be your position, whatever your responsibility--if you have as much authority as did Ahab--you will find that God is above you and His sovereignty must and will be supreme.",
