    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     There are in the ministry, men who gain apparent success by swaying minds through a human influence. They play upon the feelings at will, making their hearers weep, and in a few minutes laugh. Under this kind of labor, many are moved by impulse to a profession of Christ, and there is thought to be a wonderful revival. But when the test comes, it is seen that the work is not enduring. When the feelings were stirred, many were borne along by the tide that seemed to be setting heavenward. But in the strong current of temptation they quickly float back as driftwood. The laborer is self-deceived, and thus he misleads his hearers.",
