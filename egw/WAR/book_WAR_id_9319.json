    "word": "The disciples were to carry their work forward in Christ\u2019s name. Their every word and act was to fasten attention on His name, as possessing that vital power by which sinners may be saved. Their faith was to center in Him who is the source of mercy and power. In His name they were to present their petitions to the Father, and they would receive answer. They were to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Christ\u2019s name was to be their watchword, their badge of distinction, their bond of union, the authority for their course of action, and the source of their success.\u2014(Acts of the Apostles, 28.)",
