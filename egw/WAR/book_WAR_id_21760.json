    "word": "MR No. 952 - Material for Piper Biography\n\n     The girl, Nina Piper, has been with us several weeks. She is a remarkable girl among the girls. She is a sincere Christian. They have a large family and it is hard to support them. Mr. Piper has been a drunkard and poverty has been their experience. I pay the girl seven shillings per week and she is getting herself some clothing. But she was very sad when we decided to go to Napier. She had been told by her father that she must go out to work and earn her food and clothes. He has work now and has not drunk for two or three years, but he is not a Christian. I thought it would cost too much money to have her go with us, but as the time drew near when we must go, I told Emily my mind was ill at ease. I could perhaps get a girl in Napier, but she might be frivolous and want to be with the boys. She might be wasteful. She might be one who would be ill satisfied with the work, and Nina is feeling she is so privileged. She is willing to work hard and is saving, quiet, not forward. She answers well for us. I did not want Emily to do the housework, for she has more than she can do now. I could not lay any extra burden on Sister Wilson, for she must go with her husband, and we decided that we will not in the end save anything to go at a venture and leave a good girl behind. \n\n\n                                     -137-",
