    "word": "Mr. Johanneson was training his children in singing, and we enjoyed the music of their little voices blending together in sacred songs. If parents generally would give more time to the education and training of their children, having really a home school for them, their families would be far happier. Children who are gifted with the talent or love of music may receive impressions that will be lifelong by a judicious use of these susceptibilities as the medium for religious instruction. Less time should be spent in the ornamentation of \n191\nclothing, and far more attention should be given to making the character lovely. It is the inward adorning that will endure; the influences which give direction to these young lives will be far-reaching as eternity.",
