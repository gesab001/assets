    "word": "Sister _____, you have thought that you had difficulties to bear at home, but could you not bear them in the spirit of Christ? You have had a hard, unruly spirit, and have felt that you were wronged by your husband. You have committed great wrongs against your own soul, and have made yourself very unhappy. You have never had a happy disposition; you have ever been determined to have your own way. The warmth of pure affection has been chilled, and now you have taken a step in utter disregard of the fifth commandment.",
