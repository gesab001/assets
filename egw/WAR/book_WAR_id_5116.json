    "word": "Berquin was repeatedly warned of the danger that threatened him in France, and urged to follow the steps of those who had found safety in voluntary exile. The timid and time-serving Erasmus\u2014who with all the splendor of his scholarship failed of that moral greatness which holds life and honor subservient to truth\u2014wrote to Berquin: \u201cAsk to be sent as ambassador to some foreign country; go and travel in Germany. You know Beda and such as he\u2014he is a thousand-headed monster, darting venom on every side. Your enemies are named legion. Were your cause better than that of Jesus Christ, they will not let you go till they have miserably destroyed you. Do not trust too much to the king's protection. At all events, do not compromise me with the faculty of theology.\u201d",
