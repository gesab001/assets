Burden Loma Linda, California \n\n\n     In the night season I seemed to be conversing with you, and encouraging you to go forward in the name of the Lord, preparing your school to give the education most needed at this time. The education that is to be given by our people in the large cities of Southern California is set before me day and night. The people in these cities are to be made to understand what constitutes \"higher education.\" Higher education means conformity to the plan of salvation.",
