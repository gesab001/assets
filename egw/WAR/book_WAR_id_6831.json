    "word": "\"My brethren and sisters in Australasia, there is in every city and every suburb a work to be done in presenting the last message of mercy to a fallen world. And while we are trying to work these destitute fields, the cry comes from far-off lands, 'Come over and help us.' These are not so easily reached, and perhaps not so ready for the harvest, as the fields within our sight, but they must not be neglected. We want to push the triumphs of the cross. Our watchword is to be, 'Onward, ever onward!' Our burden for the 'regions beyond' can never be laid down until the whole earth shall be lightened with the glory of the Lord.",
