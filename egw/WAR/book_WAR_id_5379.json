    "word": "That voice which penetrates the ear of the dead, they know. How often have its plaintive, tender tones called them to repentance. How often has it been heard in the touching entreaties of a friend, a brother, a Redeemer. To the rejecters of his grace, no other could be so full of condemnation, so burdened with denunciation, as that voice which has so long pleaded, \u201cTurn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?\u201d [Ezekiel 33:11.] Oh that it were to them the voice of a stranger! Says Jesus: \u201cI have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded. But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof.\u201d [Proverbs 1:24, 25.] That voice awakens memories which they would fain blot out,\u2014warnings despised, invitations refused, privileges slighted.",
