    "word": "We need the truth presented in new places. From the light given me of God, it is a mistake to locate our camp meetings in one place. It is not wisdom to hold our large camp meetings over and over on the same ground. Carry the camp meetings to other localities, in or near the cities, where the citizens shall have an opportunity to listen to the reasons for our faith. It may be thought wisdom to calculate the saving of a little money, but what is that to be considered in comparison to giving the people the opportunity to hear the message of warning and giving them an opportunity to become enlightened. Cut down the expenses in some other lines rather than to deprive the cities of the great good and the increased knowledge they might gain of Bible truth.",
