    "word": "The slaying of the Passover lamb was a shadow of the death of Christ. Says Paul: \u201cChrist our Passover is sacrificed for us.\u201d 1 Corinthians 5:7. The sheaf of first fruits, which at the time of the Passover was waved before the Lord, was typical of the resurrection of Christ. Paul says, in speaking of the resurrection of the Lord and of all His people: \u201cChrist the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ\u2019s at His coming.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:23. Like the wave sheaf, which was the first ripe grain gathered before the \n21\nharvest, Christ is the first fruits of that immortal harvest of redeemed ones that at the future resurrection shall be gathered into the garner of God.\u2014GC 399.",
