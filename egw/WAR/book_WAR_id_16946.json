    "word": "No one can search the Old and New Testaments in the Spirit of Christ without being rewarded. \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,\u201d the Savior says, \u201cand I will give you rest. Take my yoke [of obedience] upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d The Great Teacher\u2019s invitation is before you. Will you willingly respond to it? You cannot draw near, placing yourself as a learner at the feet of Christ, without having your mind enlightened, and your heart quickened with a pure, holy admiration. You will then say, \u201cBlessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d",
