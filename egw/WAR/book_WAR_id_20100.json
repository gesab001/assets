    "word": "God calls upon men in the medical profession not to feel that they are to stand apart from the disciples of the church, that they may carry out their own selfish projects. Our faith is misrepresented by men who are out of Christ, and many souls are misled. The stumbling blocks must be taken out of the way, or those who have not submitted themselves to the discipline of the church, must change their course. If they determine to leave the fellowship of the church, let a voice of warning follow them, that the people may know that they are not in harmony with the brethren, and the church will not be responsible for their course of action, or cover their transgressions. In this way many who sincerely believe the truth may be prevented from being led away to put confidence in men whose course of action God disapproves.",
