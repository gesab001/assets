I have been wanting to write you for some time. And I have so much wished [during] this cold winter weather that you were all in California. We have had most lovely weather in January. Dr. Chamberlain and I would take our canes and climb the mountains in St. Helena. As she was sitting upon a rock on the twenty-third of January, with the warm sun shining upon her, with no outward wrappings on, bareheaded, I remarked I would be glad if her friends in Battle Creek could see her in the warm sunshine on the hillside. It was like a June day in the east.",
