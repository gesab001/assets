I saw that it was right that some of them should move to the West; that the brethren in those rugged New England States had had more experience, and were more inured to trials and hardships than those in the West; that it was in the order of God that some should move; but that there were those who had it in mind to make such a move for the sake of gain. This should not be their object. The object should be to glorify God, and to advance his cause. And to accomplish this they must live out their faith, and show a regard for present truth above everything else. I saw that it would be in the order of God for brethren in the East to associate with those in the West; and if they were standing in the counsel of God, they could be of great benefit to the western brethren by their example and experience.",
