    "word": "You frequently grow impatient at the words of counsel and caution that God addresses to you through his servants. You will not think that there can be danger in your pathway until you are entangled, and can see afterward that you have made a mistake; then you become discouraged. Your case was opened before me in Switzerland, as you well know. I saw you were in danger from your hereditary tendencies, and your habits of life. You are of that nature that you should fear to follow your strong and sometimes fierce impulses. The more experience you gain in spiritual things, the more deeply you will realize your own weakness, and feel your need of clinging close to the Lord as your counselor. One of the deplorable defects \n\n\n                      [9] \n\nof the original apostasy was the loss of man's power to govern his own heart, and when there is a separation from the Source of your strength, when you are lifted up in pride, you cannot but transgress the law of your moral constitution. It is then that you break away from the control of conscience, and perverted habit and practices gain the ascendency over reason; impulse bears sway, and carries you away from the control of principle. You indulge in disloyal feelings, and you need to be restored to yourself almost as much as you need to be restored to your God. You do not heed warnings as you should, because you do not think them applicable to your case. I tremble for your safety.",
