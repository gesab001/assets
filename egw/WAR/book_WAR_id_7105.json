    "word": "With earnest longing, God's people await the tokens of their coming King. . . . Light is gleaming upon the clouds above the mountaintops. Soon there will be a revealing of His glory. . . . The heavens glow with the dawning of eternal day, and like the melody of angel songs the words fall upon the ear; \"Stand fast to your allegiance. Help is coming.\" Christ, the almighty Victor, holds out to His weary soldiers a crown of immortal glory; and His voice comes from the gates ajar: \" . . . You are not warring against untried enemies. I have fought the battle in your behalf, and in My name you are more than conquerors\" (ibid., pp. 632, 633). \n                                                                           375",
