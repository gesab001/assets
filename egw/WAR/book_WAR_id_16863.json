    "word": "But to hallow the name of the Lord means much more than this. We may, like the Jews in Christ's day, manifest the greatest outward reverence for God, and yet profane His name continually. \"The name of the Lord\" is \"merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, . . . forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\" Exodus 34:5-7. Of the church of Christ it is written, \"This is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.\" \n                                                                           107\nJeremiah 33:16. This name is put upon every follower of Christ. It is the heritage of the child of God. The family are called after the Father. The prophet Jeremiah, in the time of Israel's sore distress and tribulation, prayed, \"We are called by Thy name; leave us not.\" Jeremiah 14:9.",
