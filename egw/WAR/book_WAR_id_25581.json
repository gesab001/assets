    "word": "The truth of God revealed in his word is to be a living, abiding principle. It is not to be looked upon as an influence among many others. It will exercise a power over the life and conduct until the whole being is assimilated to the image of the perfect pattern, and the human agent is complete in Jesus Christ. \"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him, rooted and built up,\" not in self, not after man's ideas, but \"in him established in the faith as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.\" Your greatest danger will be that you will not see the need of contemplating the character of Christ with a set purpose to imitate his life, and conform your character to his character. You are to show a marked difference between your character and that of the world. \"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, and ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.\" \"Epaphras who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you always laboring for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.\" \n                                                                           392",
