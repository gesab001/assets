    "word": "Elder Dammon had the most positive evidences that the visions were of God. He became my enemy only because I bore a testimony reproving his wrongs and his fanatical course, which wounded the cause of God. The prejudices they have fostered against me are unreasonable and wicked. The very same course that the Jews pursued toward Christ, my professed Advent brethren feel it a virtue to pursue toward me, when every argument fails against the truth. There is one bond of union between all those who oppose God's law; that bond is to use their smut and blacking against me, and present me as their unanswerable argument. They say I am possessed of a demon.",
