    "word": "Shall selfishness and case of those who have earthly comforts and attractive homes allure us? Shall we cease as moral agencies to use our powers to the saving of souls? Shall our voices be indistinct? Then God will put his curse upon us that have had so great light, and inscribe upon the walls of our homes, \"Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.\" He will put a tongue in the stones, and they will speak: but God commands of you in Battle Creek to go forth. Resolve not in your own strength, but in the strength and grace given of God that you will consecrate to God, now, just now, every power, every ability. You will follow Jesus because he bids you, and you will not ask where, nor what reward shall be given? It is well with you, if you obey, \"Follow me.\" Your work is to lead every one to the light by judicious, well-put-forth effort; under the guardianship of the divine Leader, will to do, resolve to act, without a moment's delay, to make terms with God.",
