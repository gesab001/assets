    "word": "After the Lord had laid bare the indifference and disregard to the priest and Levite toward their fellow man, He introduced the good Samaritan. He journeyed along the way, and when he saw the sufferer, he had compassion on him; for he was a doer of the law. This had been an actual occurrence, and was known to be exactly as represented. Christ . . . inquired which one of the travelers had been a neighbor to him that fell among thieves . . . . The Samaritan, who was one of a despised people, cared for his suffering brother, and did not pass by on the other side. He treated his neighbor as he would desire to be treated were he in a similar condition.",
