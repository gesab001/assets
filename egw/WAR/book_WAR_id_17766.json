    "word": "Jesus wants every minister to whom He has committed a sacred trust to remember His injunctions, to consider the vastness of His work, and to place the obligation of preaching the gospel to the world upon the large number to whom it belongs. \"Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem\" (Luke 24:46, 47). The power of God was to go with those that proclaimed the gospel. If those who claim to have a living experience in the things of God had done their appointed duty as God ordained, the whole world would have been warned, and the Lord Jesus would have come to our world with power and great glory.--Home Missionary, Aug. 1, 1896.",
