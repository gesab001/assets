    "word": "I have been instructed that the canvassing work is to be revived, and that it is to be carried forward with increasing success. I feel very thankful to our heavenly Father for the interest that my brethren and sisters have taken in the sale of \"Christ's Object Lessons.\" By the sale of this book great good has been accomplished; and the work should be continued. The effort to circulate \"Object Lessons\" has demonstrated what can be done in the canvassing field. This effort is a never-to-be-forgotten lesson of how to canvass in the prayerful, trustful way that brings success. Many of our larger books could be sold if our canvassers should take up this work earnestly and energetically, filled with the realization that these books contain instruction that God desires to go to the world. Accompanied by the power of persuasion, the power of prayer, the power of the love of God, the canvasser-evangelist's work will not, can not be without fruit.",
