    "word": "In regard to the case of Bro. Gage, I was shown that he was in need of a more thorough experience. He commenced to take the responsibilities of life too early, before he could realize the importance attached to these responsibilities. Had he waited a few years, until his mind had become more matured, how would now be far in advance of what he is. His past experience has lessened the confidence of his brethren in his judgment. Bro. Gage was young, needing parental care and instruction when he commenced life for himself. He earned his money readily, and realized not its worth, but spent it just as readily as he earned it. \n                                                                           32\nHe did not educate himself to habits of economy. He spent means for things unnecessary. His character was not really formed. He has a quick mind, can discern readily the bearing of things, and comes to conclusions at once, hence he is in danger of not making allowance for those who cannot see and understand as readily as himself. He was not settled, with a firm religious experience when he came to Battle Creek. His mind was too boyish; yet I saw that he had, considering the errors and difficulties existing in the church in Battle Creek, pursued a praiseworthy course. The young could have been greatly injured by his influence had he not conscientiously restrained himself from engaging with them in their various enterprises for amusement. He could have helped forward many things which would have gratified the youth in their unconsecrated state, and injured his own influence. He did not do this. He sought to stand with those who were seeking to preserve their peculiar character distinct from the world.",
