    "word": "Thou hast presented before us a great work that must be carried forward in behalf of those that are in the truth, and in behalf of those that are in ignorance of our faith; and oh, Lord, as Thou hast given to every man his work, we beseech of Thee that the Holy Spirit may impress the human mind in regard to the burden of work that shall rest upon every individual soul, according to Thine appointment. We want to be proved; we want to be sanctified through and through; we want to be fitted up for the work; and here, right here in this session of the conference, we want to see a revelation of the Holy Spirit of God. We want light, Lord--Thou art the Light. We want truth, Lord--Thou art the Truth. We want the right way--Thou art the Way.",
