    "word": "Brother S_____ has been greatly blessed by God. The Lord used him to start the work at H_____. But he is not to think, because of this, that he is fitted to carry the school work forward on the broad, elevated place on which it must be carried. Others, whose education and training fit them for it, must take up the work in its advanced stages, and carry it onward and upward. But the Lord does not value the less those who in self-sacrifice and self-denial prepared the way for the work to advance.",
