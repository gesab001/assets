    "word": "Ministers do great harm by allowing their forbearance toward the erring to degenerate into toleration of their sins.--Ministers of the gospel sometimes do great harm by allowing their forbearance toward the erring to degenerate into toleration of sins and even participation in them. Thus they are led to excuse and palliate that which God condemns; and after a time they become so blinded as to commend the very ones whom God commands them to reprove. The only safe-guard against these dangers is to add to patience godliness,--to reverence God, His character and His law, and to keep His fear ever before the mind. By communion with God, through prayer and the reading of His Word, we should cultivate such a sense of the holiness of His character that we shall regard sin as He regards it.--AA 504.",
