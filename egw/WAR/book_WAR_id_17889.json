    "word": "There has been among the believers, dissension, unbelief, and jealousy, and on the part of some, a firm resistance of light from heaven. I have been shown that those who have resisted light will never see clearly again, unless they humble their hearts before God, and confess their backslidings, their prejudice, their hatred of the light which God has sent, which, if accepted, would make them wise unto salvation. Formality, worldly wisdom, worldly caution, worldly policy, will appear to many to be the very power of God, but when accepted, it stands as an obstacle to prevent God's light, in warnings, reproof, and counsel, from coming to the world.",
