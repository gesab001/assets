No matter what their origin, no \n257\nmatter what their former position, whether they followed the plow, worked at the carpenter's trade, or enjoyed the discipline of a college; if God has accepted them, let every man beware of casting the slightest reflection upon them. Never speak disparagingly of any man; for he may be great in the sight of the Lord, while those who feel great may be lightly esteemed of God because of the perversity of their hearts.\u2014 Vol. 4, p. 608.",
