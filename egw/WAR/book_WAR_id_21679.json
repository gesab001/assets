He has assured me that when at any time I have written to you in plainness, it has been to save you from making mistakes, and to place you under the leading of the Holy Spirit. Here I must leave the matter. Nothing has been overstated in regard to the dangers which threaten you.--Letter 129, 1899, p. 2. (To J. H. Kellogg, August 29, 1899.)",
