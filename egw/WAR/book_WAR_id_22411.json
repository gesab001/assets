    "word": "The religious affections need to be educated and trained and enlisted in revealing the principles of the Word of God by being brought into practical life, and will evidence in gifts and offerings made to extend the knowledge of the truth. We have the last message of warning, the last call of mercy, to give to our world, and this message will be far-reaching in its influence. And if we have an abiding Christ, our words and works will tell in its beneficial action upon ourselves, and be an active agent in the saving of souls and in glorifying God.",
