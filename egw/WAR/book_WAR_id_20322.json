White's attitude toward secular music.] \n\n                  Music, Well Selected and Well Rendered \n\n     For about an hour the fog did not lift and the sun did not penetrate it. Then the musicians, who were to leave the boat at this place, entertained the impatient passengers with music, well selected and well rendered. It did not jar upon the senses as the previous evening, but was soft and really grateful to the senses because it was musical.--Letter 6b, 1893. (Regarding the landing in New Zealand in Feb., 1893.) \n\nReleased 1964.",
