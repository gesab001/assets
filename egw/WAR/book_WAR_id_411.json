    "word": "Provide Conveniences to Lighten Wife's Labor.-- Brother E's family live in accordance with the principles of strictest economy. . . . Brother E had conscientiously decided not to build a convenient woodshed and kitchen for his large family, because he did not feel free to invest means in personal conveniences when the cause of God needed money to carry it forward. I tried to show him that it was necessary for the health as well as the morals of his children that he should make home pleasant and provide conveniences to lighten the labor of his wife.",
