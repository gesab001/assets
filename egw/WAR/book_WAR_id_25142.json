    "word": "In an article dated March 12, 1902 (MS-44-'02) I read: \"Those who have true wisdom, will plan to establish our sanitariums (835) in the country, where the patients can have the benefit of out-of-door life, where they can sit in the sunshine, \n\n\n                              -476- \n\nor, when the sunshine is too warm, under the shade of the trees. The patients are to be given the advantage of the Lord's health-giving remedies to be found out-of-doors. And the treatments given them in other lines are to be conducted on the same natural, health-restoring principles.\"",
