    "word": "Fathers, spend as much time as possible with your children. Seek to become acquainted with their various dispositions, that you may know how to train them in harmony with the Word of God. Never should a word of discouragement pass your lips. Do not bring darkness into the home. Be pleasant, kind, and affectionate toward your children, but not foolishly indulgent. Let them bear their little disappointments, as everyone must. Do not encourage them to come to you with their petty complaints of one another. Teach them to bear with one another, and to seek to maintain each other's confidence and respect.",
