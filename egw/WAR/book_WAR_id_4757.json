He was \u201cdespised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\u201d [Isaiah 53:3.] He was to them as a root out of dry ground, with no form or comeliness that they should desire him. But he declared, \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim \n393\nliberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.\u201d [Isaiah 61:1.]",
