    "word": "From the light God has given me, I know that he has not inaugurated such a work for our people to do as Dr. Kellogg had started in Chicago. In every city there should be missionaries, evangelists, appointed to work for the lower classes, who through abuse are ruining themselves. But all the resources are not to be used in this work, or the work of bringing the truth to other cities and missionary fields afar off from America will not be accomplished. God's money has been used lavishly in some places, so that there is not means to invest in sustaining the gospel ministry in all parts of the world by voice and by the press. Both must be linked together, and God's standard must be raised in new territory. New fields must be worked, the warning must be given. A representation of the work to be done is given in the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah.",
