    "word": "The Lord has revealed to us that the Laodicean message applies to the church at this time, and yet how few make a practical application of it to themselves. God has wrought for us; we have no complaint to make of Heaven, for the richest blessings have been proffered us, but our people have been very reluctant to accept them. Those who have been so stubborn and rebellious that they would not humble themselves to receive the light God sent in mercy to their souls, became so destitute of the Holy Spirit that the Lord could not use them. Unless they are converted, these men will never enter the mansions of the blest. Some have been preaching the word whose labors are tainted with impurity and licentiousness. They have done far more harm than good. Unless they shall turn from their evil ways, they will perish with the wicked. Others have carried the truth in a very indifferent manner; they have had no real burden for the work; they have gone backward rather than forward. It is high time for these to retrace their steps; for they have lost their first love. The Lord's injunction to them is, \"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; Or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove they candlestick out of thy place, except thou repent.\" \n\n\n                                                      157.",
