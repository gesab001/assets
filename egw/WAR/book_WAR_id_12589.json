    "word": "I saw that in christian parents there should always be a fixed principle with them to be united in the government of their children. I saw there was a fault in this respect with some parents--a lack of union. The fault is sometimes with the father, but oftener with the mother. The fond mother pets and indulges her children. The father's labor calls him from home often, and from the society of his children. The mother's influence tells. Her example does much towards forming the character of the children.",
