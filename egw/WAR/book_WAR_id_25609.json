Ellen White certainly utilized this method, penning thousands of letters. A good portion of the letters were of a personal nature, but because of their rich counsel many appeared in denominational periodicals, the Testimonies to the Church volumes, pamphlets, and later posthumous collections. Mrs. White wrote letters to further God\u2019s work; encouraged individuals to personal holiness; warn church members of dangers in their path; open the mysteries of God; urge a particular course; share visions; and raise money for church causes.",
