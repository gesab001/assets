    "word": "If these brethren [critics] had been in the work from the beginning, if they had taken part in the stern battles that have been fought, they would understand that nothing but the miracle-working power of God has accomplished the work that has been accomplished. We have seen His power as we have advanced from point to point; and we praise Him with heart and soul and voice. Oh how we appreciated the loving mercies of our God as He led us on step by step. If these brethren had met to worship God in the loft of the sawmill at Avondale,--a rough, rude room, stored with the school furniture,--and in that disagreeable place had felt the power of God, going home with souls warmed with His love, they would appreciate every stroke that has been made, looking upon the work done with hearts swelling up with grateful thanksgiving and joyous praise.",
