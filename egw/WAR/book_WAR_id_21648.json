    "word": "MR No. 897 - Two Spirits Present at the Minneapolis Meeting and Following it\n\n     The Holy Spirit Present at Various Meetings Attended by EGW--A meeting was conducted at Potterville by the Michigan ministers. I was urged by Brother Van Horn to attend the meeting. I was glad to do this, hoping that the prejudice would be removed. The Lord gave me of His Holy Spirit at that meeting. The Lord seemed to be close by my side and I had freedom when bearing my message to the people. On this occasion, when only our brethren were present in the morning meeting, I spoke plainly, stating the light that the Lord had been pleased to give me in warnings and in reproof for His people.--Ms. 30, 1889. p. 6.",
