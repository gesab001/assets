    "word": "The Lord desires His people to have a right understanding of the work to be done, and, as faithful stewards, to move forward wisely in the investment of means. In the erection of buildings, He desires them to count the cost to see whether they have enough with which to finish. He also desires them to remember that they should not selfishly gather all the means possible to invest in a few places, but that they should work with reference to the many other places where institutions must be established.",
