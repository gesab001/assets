    "word": "God desires every man to know His will. He sees that often men are not of themselves sufficient to decide what should be done, and He sends cautions to save those who are in danger of making grave mistakes. Those only who heed His warnings will know of a certainty that they are walking in the way of the Lord. The heart and the life must be right if we would understand His purposes, and walk in fellowship with the Holy Spirit.",
