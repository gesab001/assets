    "word": "Can we measure the love of God? Paul declares that \"it passeth knowledge.\" Then shall we who have been made partakers of the heavenly gift be careless and indifferent, neglecting the great salvation wrought out for us? Shall we allow ourselves to be separated from Christ, and thus lose the eternal reward, the great gift of everlasting life? Shall we not accept the enmity which Christ has placed between man and the serpent? Shall we not eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God, which means to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God? Or shall we become earthly, eating the serpent's meat, which is selfishness, hypocrisy, evil-surmising, envy, and covetousness? We have a right to say, \"In the strength of Jesus Christ I will be a conqueror. I will not be overcome by Satan's devices.\" \n                                                                -",
