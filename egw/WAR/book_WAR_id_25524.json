    "word": "Oh, how I wish that we would honor Christ by realizing what he wants to do for us, and taking him at his word. If we would do this, we should be sunshiny Christians. By beholding Christ, we would be changed into his likeness. But we shall never grow in grace by beholding the faults and mistakes and defects of someone else. Instead, we will become spiritually dwarfed and enfeebled. Let us keep looking to Christ, thinking of what he has done for us and of what he has promised to do. Thus we shall be changed into his likeness. This is true religion. In the future we shall have to contend with difficulties tenfold greater than any we have yet had. Do you ask why I say this? Do you not realize that his time is short? He is working and planning with intensity of effort to place obstacles in the way of God's people, and to hinder their progress. We have the powers of darkness to meet. At this time, more than ever before, willing, unquestioning, obedience is needed, if we come off conquerors.",
