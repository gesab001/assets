    "word": "I have had light to the effect that the position taken by Brother S. and his sympathizers is not true, but one of the \"lo, heres,\" and \"lo, theres\" that will characterize the days in which we are living. As a sample of the way in which Brother S. has compiled this pamphlet, I will give the following incident: I wrote a private letter to one of our ministers, and in kindness, thinking that it might be a help to Brother S., this brother sent a copy of it to him; but instead of regarding it as a matter for his personal help, he prints portions of it in the pamphlet as an unpublished testimony, to sustain the position he had taken. Is this honorable? There was nothing in the testimony to sustain the position Brother S. holds; but he misapplied it, as many do the Scriptures, to the injury of his own soul and the souls of others. God will judge those who take unwarrantable liberties and make use of dishonorable means in order to give character and influence to what they regard as truth. In the use of private letter sent to another, Brother S. has abused the kindly efforts of one who desired to help him. The parties publishing the pamphlet on the Loud Cry, and the fall of all the churches, give evidence that the Holy Spirit of God is not working with them. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"",
