    "word": "Our brethren are not to be called to Battle Creek to hold a council for the examination of doctrines, while the men who profess to know the truth remain surrounded by a cloud of unbelief.

By the large investments of means in the Battle Creek Sanitarium, many have been robbed of the help that God designed them to have.",
