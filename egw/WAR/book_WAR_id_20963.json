    "word": "While we are to guard against needless adornment and display, yet all about our persons and our buildings is to be neat and attractive. Our young people are to be taught the importance of presenting an appearance above criticism, so that the world cannot speak of us as cheap and common. They are to be taught that while our work must be carried forward with strict economy, it is not therefore to lose the charm of good taste and perfect order.--Ms 127, 1901, pp. 2, 3. (\"Nature of Buildings,\" November 26, 1901.)",
