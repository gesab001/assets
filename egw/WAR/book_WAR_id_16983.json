    "word": "In infinite mercy a last warning message has been sent to the world, announcing that Christ is at the door and calling attention to God\u2019s broken law. But as the antediluvians rejected with scorn the warning of Noah, so will the pleasure lovers of today reject the message of God\u2019s faithful servants. The world pursues its unvarying round, absorbed as ever in its business and its pleasures, while the wrath of God is about to be visited on the transgressors of His law.",
