    "word": "MR No. 1591 - Counsel to Parents of a Wayward Son\n\n     (Written February 5, 1890, from Battle Creek, Michigan, to Brother and Sister Lindsay. Portions of this letter appear in Child Guidance.) \n\n\n     Your letters I have read with interest and sympathy. I would say your son now needs a father as he has never needed one before. He has erred; you know it, and he knows that you know it, and words that you would have spoken to him in his innocency with safety and which would not have produced any bad results, would now seem like unkindness and be sharp as a knife. I am a mother of boys, and I know in this age, when the enemy of God and his workmanship is seeking to destroy the youth under his hellish banner, he will make every effort to lead them into temptation and into sin. Then they become desperate and discouraged as this sin is kept ever before them.",
