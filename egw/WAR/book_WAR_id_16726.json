    "word": "Recently, open air meetings have been held by our brethren at Calistoga [California]. . . . The next one will be held near St. Helena, if a suitable place can be found. We desire to do all we can to warn those around us of the soon coming of the Saviour. I believe much good will be accomplished as we take up this work. My heart is drawn out for those in darkness, who know not the truth. . . .",
