    "word": "During my stay in Nashville, I saw the necessities of the work there, and its great need of help. I visited the sanitarium conducted by Dr. Hayward and Brother Hansen. For several years Brother Hansen has had treatment-rooms in Nashville. Recently the Medical Department of the Southern Union Conference purchased his business, and Dr. Hayward, from Graysville, joined Brother Hansen in the work. They have treatment-rooms, a health food store, and physicians' offices in a large house in the city. They have also rented a house three miles out of the city, for the accommodation of patients and nurses. I visited both of these places, and found them full of sick people receiving help.",
