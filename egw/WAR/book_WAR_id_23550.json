    "word": "God help us to work unitedly and as we never have worked before, is my prayer. There is need now of faithful Calebs, whose voices will be heard in clear, ringing notes, saying of the immortal inheritance, \"Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able.\" We need now the courage of God's faithful servant of old. Not one wavering, uncertain note should come from the watchers' trumpets. They must be true to the sacred, solemn work that has been entrusted to them, and lead the flock of God in right pathways onward and upward to victory.--Manuscript 18, 1888. See RH Extra, Dec. 24, 1889. (MR 900.34)",
