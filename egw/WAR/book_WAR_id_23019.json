    "word": "There remain in our ranks a few faithful men and women who have passed through many experiences, and have witnessed the fulfillment of many prophecies. But there are others who have not had so long an experience; and among these are some who are refusing the light God has given, and are choosing their own way. Even men who have been standing in positions of trust, have resorted to the arm of the law when a \"Thus saith the Lord\" counterworked their scheming and underworking. Those who have placed their dependence on lawyers, on the counsels of unconsecrated men, have been unfaithful stewards. God has kept an accurate record of their actions, in the recordbooks of heaven; and every artful, unjust transaction will one day appear. The consequences of every wrong act will be fully revealed.",
