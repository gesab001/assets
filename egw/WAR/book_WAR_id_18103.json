    "word": "The Warning Repeated \n\n                   -\n\n         St. Helena, Cal., July 15, 1905. \n\n     I have a warning for our people in all our churches. For years messages have been coming to the leader of our medical missionary work, telling him that he was not carrying that work forward in straight lines. He mingles with it his own spirit, and brings in ingenious inventions to do a work that God has forbidden his denominated people to do. There is a work being carried on through lawyers that is not after the divine similitude. This is manifest in efforts to get possession of property that he does not and should not control.",
