    "word": "MR No. 216 - Distributing the Light\n\n     Let all be fully prepared to disseminate the light by word and by pamphlet. There should be hundreds of little tracts scattered as the leaves of autumn. Many \"Echoes\" have been sold. This is well so far as it goes, but light on many more subjects is to come before the people. There is a great need of leaflets and tracts, some containing short articles, others presenting the messages of warning, the second advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Sabbath, treated in brief, and its relation to the truth of the doctrines substantiated by the Scriptures should be circulated. . . .",
