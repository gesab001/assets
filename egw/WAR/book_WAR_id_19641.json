    "word": "One thing is certain, I have held my peace as long as I shall do so. Now the only thing I can do is to put before our people, in some form, the light which God has seen fit to give me in your case. If the testimonies have no influence upon you, they may at least guard the flock of God from deception. You may say you will give up your credentials and step out of the work; better, far better, to do this than to cast such an influence as you are now exerting upon the work of God. But what would gladden my heart, and please the dear Saviour, who gave his life for you, is for you to humble yourself under the hand of God. You are a very weak man, but God can give you strength, that you may finish your course with joy. I warn you, my brother, to prepare for the judgment. Let not the blood of the souls of the flock and the blood of your children be upon your garments. Never boast of your endowments, or position, or achievements. All our talents are from God, to be rendered back with interest. From him come all the gifts you have misapplied. May the Lord help you to see and repent of your abuse of his blessings before it is forever too late.",
