    "word": "I would speak words of warning to the brethren of our churches, for I fear that many are acting the part of the slothful servant who hid his lord's talent in the earth. His sin was the sin of neglect, the sin of failing to improve the great treasures of knowledge that were committed to his trust. God has given precious light to His people with which to enlighten the world, and are not many treating it with indifference, and acting as though the heavenly gift were of little consequence? . . .",
