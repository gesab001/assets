    "word": "Those who had accepted the light concerning the mediation of Christ and the perpetuity of the law of God, found that these were the truths brought to view in the third message. The angel declares, \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\" Revelation 14:12. This statement is preceded by a solemn and fearful warning: \"If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His indignation.\" Revelation 14:9, 10.

Again those who were seeking for the truth returned to the study of the prophecies.",
