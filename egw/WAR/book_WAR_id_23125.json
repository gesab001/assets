    "word": "Who is responsible for trusting to his own human wisdom and working directly opposite to the way the Lord has marked out that he should work? Had you had discernment you would have lived out your profession and your prayer made at that time while at Fresno. If you had been worked by the Holy Spirit, there would have been a work done showing zeal in proportion to the importance of the truths we are handling. The Lord would have given grace if you had humbled yourself and become meek and lowly of heart, and you might have been the instrument of warning hundreds and thousands through your words in writing and in ministry in speaking, and angels of God would have cooperated with the human instrument.",
