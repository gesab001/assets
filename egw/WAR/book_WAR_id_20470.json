    "word": "Thinkers, Deep, Needed.--Many obtain a surface knowledge of truth or Bible doctrine, and then stop, thinking they know it all. But do they know it all?--No; no: God's word is, Go forward. Because young men measure themselves among themselves, and reach a standard which others have reached, they are satisfied to stop learning. But the voice of God bids them go forward. Fifty times as much might be accomplished in self-education than now is if the minds of men and women were awake to their own possibilities and privileges. Education of self means more than the colleges can give you. Men of true education are scarce. Men of talent are numerous, but they do not improve their opportunities, and their talents do not increase. When men and women hunger after knowledge for the purpose of blessing their fellow men, \n\n\n                                     -364- \n\nGod will bless them. He will prepare the new bottles for the new wine. There will be an expansion, a development of the higher faculties, so that men will become deep thinkers. If the men who have talents would not settle down satisfied that they have sufficient for the great work; if they would dig deeper, there would not be such a dearth of laborers. We should have more spiritual teaching and the hidden treasure would by diligent effort be brought to the surface.--Ms 104, 1898.",
