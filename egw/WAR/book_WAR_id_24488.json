R. Henry, \n   Review and Herald, Battle Creek, Mich. \n     Dear Brother:--I am awakened this morning at an early hour to write to you things which I must bring before you directly. I am much burdened on your account. I tremble before God as I have a sense of things which have for years been presented before me, and which have existed for a period of years. There has been unrighteousness in your course of action toward your brethren in the faith. Satan has surely worked his will through you altogether too many times for the good of your brethren whom you did not harmonize with. Brother Eldridge has had a part in those transactions, and others have been swayed by your decisions, and have been led to harmonize with your injustice toward your fellowmen. In your councils your perverted, unsanctified ideas in regard to men and things have taken form in decisions that are unrighteous.",
