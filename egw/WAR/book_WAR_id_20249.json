They have been permitted to try their gift when they had not proper preparation, either in school education or in Bible knowledge, to warrant their going into the work, for they needed a great work done for them. First, every licentiate should be critically examined in his knowledge of the Scriptures before being sent into the field to teach others. This has not been done, and a very unsuccessful work has been done by many and they could bring in no report of success. This discouraged themselves and also disheartened the conference so that their time and labor was, they deemed, unworthy of much wages; and this discouraged them still more, and discouraged many from giving themselves to the work who, with the proper painstaking, thorough instruction and training, might \n\n\n                                    -137- \n\nhave made thorough workmen and able ministers. I spoke also of carefulness in regard to dress of those coming from America and going back to America. . . .",
