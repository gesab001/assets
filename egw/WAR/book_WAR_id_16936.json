    "word": "All that we are or can be belongs to God. Education, discipline, and skill in every line should be used for Him. . . . Whether the amount entrusted is large or small, the Lord requires that His householders do their best. It is not the amount entrusted or the improvement made that brings to men and women the approbation of heaven, but it is the faithfulness, the loyalty to God, the loving service rendered, that brings the divine benediction \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d This reward of joy does not wait until our entrance into the City of God, but the faithful servant has a foretaste of it even in this life.\u2014Signs of the Times, Jan. 23, 1893.",
