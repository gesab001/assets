    "word": "Principles for the Guidance of Men \n\n                   in Positions of Responsibility \n\n\n     While at Fresno, I passed through a peculiar experience. I seemed to be in an assembly where a number of brethren were in council. There seemed to be a cloud over the company. I could not discern faces, but I could hear voices. I thought that in one speaker I recognized the voice of Elder Daniells, but his manner of speech and his words seemed to be Brother E.R. Palmer's. At first I could not understand the things that were said by this speaker. Afterward I heard something said in regard to the way in which he thought the publishing work should be carried on. The assertion was made that this work should be placed on a more sure and elevated basis.",
