    "word": "\"In every branch of education there are objects to be gained more important than those secured by mere technical knowledge. Take language, for example. More important than the acquirement of foreign languages, living or dead, is the ability to write and speak one's mother tongue with ease and accuracy; but no training gained through a knowledge of grammatical rules can compare in importance with the study of language from a higher point of view. . . .The chief requisite of language is that it be pure and kind and true,-- 'the outward expression of an inward grace,'\"-- Ed., pp. 234, 235.",
