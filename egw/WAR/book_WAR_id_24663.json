Henry, \n      My Brother:- \n     I have a warning for you from the Lord. \"All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.\" \"The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.\" I feel very sad in regard to your case, for you are pursuing a course that is deciding your eternal destiny. You are in great trouble of mind, and you have given that mind to be worked by the powers of darkness. Satan is striving to destroy you, body and soul. When in Minneapolis, you took a turn that has influenced all your movements since then in the wrong direction. You must know that you are pursuing a course similar to that of Judas, who betrayed his Lord.",
