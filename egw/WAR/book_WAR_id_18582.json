    "word": "Isaiah says, \"Thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.\" This is the righteousness of Christ which goes before us, and the glory of the Lord is to be our rereward. Ye churches of the living God study this promise, and consider how \n                                                                           21\nyour lack of faith, of spirituality, of divine power, is hindering the coming of the kingdom of God. Were every one of you living missionaries, the gospel would be speedily proclaimed in all countries, to all peoples, nations and tongues. This is the work that must be done before Christ shall come in power and great glory. I call upon the church to pray earnestly, that you may understand your responsibilities. Are you individually laborers together with God? If not why not? When do you mean to do your God-appointed work?",
