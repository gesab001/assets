The Paradise Valley Sanitarium is in need of assistance. We have evidence that the money expended there has been used wisely and well. The strictest economy has been shown in all that has been done, and advantage has been taken of every opportunity to save means. At the beginning of our work, the manager heard of some furniture for sale by a family leaving the district. He went to see it, and found that they could obtain some first-class furniture for the same price they would have to pay for a cheaper grade. They gladly availed themselves of the opportunity, and thus obtained very cheaply enough furniture of the very best quality to furnish five rooms.",
