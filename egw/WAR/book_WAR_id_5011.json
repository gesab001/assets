    "word": "For seven years a man continued to go up and down the streets of Jerusalem, declaring the woes that were to come upon the city. By day and by night he chanted the wild dirge, \u201cA voice from the east; a voice from the west; a voice from the four winds; a voice against Jerusalem and the temple; a voice against the bridegroom and the bride; and a voice against all the people.\u201d This strange being was imprisoned and scourged; but no complaint escaped his lips. To insult and abuse he answered only, \u201cWoe to Jerusalem! woe, woe to the inhabitants thereof!\u201d His warning cry ceased not until he was slain in the siege he had foretold.",
