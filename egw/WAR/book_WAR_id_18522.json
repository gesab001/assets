    "word": "Sound an alarm throughout the length and the breadth of the earth. Tell the people that the day of the Lord is near, and hasteth greatly. Let none be left unwarned. We might have been in the place of the poor souls that are in the darkness of error. We might have been placed amidst barbarism. According to the light we have received above others, we are debtors to impart the same to them. The day star has risen upon us; let us flash the light upon the pathway of those in darkness.",
