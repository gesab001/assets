    "word": "Every gratification or indulgence secured by neglecting the divine call to earnest, self-denying duty, is sowing seed for a harvest of like kind. Every step in the path that God has forbidden is a step toward destruction. Whatever excuse Satan may frame, the neglect of your present opportunities and privileges of knowing God and Jesus Christ, whom He hath sent, will result in eternal loss. Every advantage gained by disobeying the will of God is purchased at an infinite sacrifice. The way of obedience to God, however hard and trying it may seem to you, is always the path of life.",
