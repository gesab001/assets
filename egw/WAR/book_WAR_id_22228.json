    "word": "People will come to Battle Creek in great numbers. But few, if any of them, are converted, and the Sanitarium is not in a condition to show the medical missionary work that is to be done for the world. The time has come when I must say that the effort to draw our young people to Battle Creek is one of the schemes of Satan to confuse the minds of the youth and those who are older. There are ministers of the gospel who have lost their bearings, and as they lead others to walk in strange paths they are doing a work similar to that which Satan thought to carry on when the children of Israel were about to enter Canaan. Beware, beware.",
