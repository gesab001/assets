    "word": "It is because so many of God's professed followers seek to be first that they cannot be trusted. Were they humble men, willing to be instructed and taught by God, they would be a power in showing the world the influence of truth upon the human character. Those who work in Christ's lines, never seeking to exalt self, will reveal steady progress and constant activity in missionary enterprises. They will not be satisfied unless church is added to church. Church members are not to center themselves in certain localities, forgetting that the Lord's vineyard is to be worked. They are to make aggressive warfare, planting the standard of truth in new places. God expects those in his service to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.",
