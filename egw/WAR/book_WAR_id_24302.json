    "word": "There is danger. I sound the signal trumpet of warning. God calls for you to humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, and He will lift you up. Draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you. Ministers high and low, you have no time to complain over your unsuccessful labor. Look unto Jesus. Take hold of His strength by living faith and make peace with God. You have too great a desire for praise of men.",
