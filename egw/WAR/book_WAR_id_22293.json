    "word": "I made remarks from James 1:3 and onward in regard to appropriating faith. I presented before them the precious promise, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering\" [verses 5, 6]. God requires heart service. To obey is better than sacrifice; without obedience and pure love the richest offering is too poor to be presented to the Owner of all things. The Lord gave me great freedom in presenting these ideas before the people, and I think they were received and appreciated.",
