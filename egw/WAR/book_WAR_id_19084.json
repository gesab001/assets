    "word": "In silence the people watch for the end of this fearful scene. Again the sun shines forth; but the cross is enveloped in darkness. Priests and rulers look toward Jerusalem; and lo, the dense cloud has settled upon the city, and over Judah's plains, and the fierce lightnings of God's wrath are directed against the fated city. Suddenly \n                                                                           86\nthe gloom is lifted from the cross, and in clear trumpet tones, that seem to resound throughout creation, Jesus cries, \"It is finished;\" \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.\" A light encircled the cross, and the face of the Saviour shone with a glory like unto the sun. He then bowed his head upon his breast, and died.",
