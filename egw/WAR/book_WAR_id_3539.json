    "word": "PAGE 238: CLOSE OF THE SECOND ANGEL'S MESSAGE.--WHILE WE UNDERSTAND CLEARLY THAT THE MESSAGES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND AND THIRD ANGELS ARE MESSAGES THAT HAVE THEIR APPLICATION TODAY, WE RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT IN THEIR INITIAL PROCLAMATION THE SOUNDING OF THE FIRST ANGEL'S MESSAGE WITH ITS DECLARATION THAT \"THE HOUR OF GOD'S JUDGMENT IS COME\" IS LINKED WITH THE PROCLAMATION OF THE EXPECTED ADVENT OF CHRIST IN THE 1830'S AND EARLY 1840'S. THE SECOND ANGEL'S MESSAGE HAD ITS INITIAL SOUNDING EARLY IN THE SUMMER OF 1844 IN THE CALL TO THE ADVENT BELIEVERS TO COME OUT OF THE NOMINAL CHURCHES THAT HAD REJECTED THE PROCLAMATION OF THE FIRST ANGEL'S MESSAGE. AND WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE SECOND ANGEL'S MESSAGE CONTINUES TO BE PRESENT TRUTH, THERE WAS A CLIMACTIC CLOSING UP OF THE SECOND ANGEL'S MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING OCTOBER 22, 1844. WHEN THE MESSAGES OF THE THREE ANGELS COME PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE WORLD AGAIN JUST BEFORE THE SECOND ADVENT OF CHRIST, THE ANGEL OF REVELATION 18:1 JOINS IN THE PROCLAMATION OF THE SECOND ANGEL IN THE MESSAGE THAT \"BABYLON IS FALLEN.\" \"COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE.\" SEE THE CHAPTER \"THE FINAL WARNING\" IN THE GREAT CONTROVERSY, PAGES 603-612.",
