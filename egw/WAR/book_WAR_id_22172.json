    "word": "I write these words, not to afflict your soul, but to warn you that you may guard against repeating the same experience, thinking it was one ordered of the Lord. God was seeking to lead you in the past, and it is necessary you understand this, that you may not place stumbling blocks before your own feet, over which you will stumble. I know not whether or not you will receive this as from God; but I beseech you for your own soul's sake, take these words written to you in love, and divest yourself of unbelieving, hard thoughts. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Lay aside fleshly reasonings. Let every soul now stand before God in his own nothingness, and draw nigh to God.",
