    "word": "Those who are ready and willing to invest in the cause of God, will be blessed in their efforts to acquire money.  God created the source of wealth.  He gave the sunshine, and the dew, and the rain, and caused vegetation to flourish.  He blessed men with mental and physical ability, and qualified them to acquire property, so that His cause might be sustained by His professed children.  The needy are all around us, and God is glorified, when the poor and the afflicted are aided and comforted.  It is no sin to acquire and control property as stewards for God, holding it only until He shall require it for the necessities of His work.",
