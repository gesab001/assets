    "word": "Sister Johnson has ever loved you too well, and you have been unwise and shown a preference for her, which has brought you in a position where for a time your influence is gone. It is now only by humility and devotion to God that you can regain the confidence you have lost. It will take time to heal the wound \n\n\n                                 -159- \n\nthat you have brought upon the cause of God. You have hurt yourself greatly. It will take time to do away the effect of the wrong course you have pursued. I saw that it was perfectly natural for Victor to feel very bitter toward you. You have said and done much of late in regard to him which he feels is cruel. You have something to do to take back things which you have said and done in order to get Victor away from the place. You should make things as straight with him as you can, that your skirts may be clean from his blood.",
