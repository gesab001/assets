    "word": "It is not to be looked upon as a trifling matter to have the light of present truth, and yet to be noncommittal. It is no trifling thing to say by attitude and sentiment, even though that sentiment is not expressed in words, \"My Lord delayeth his coming.\" The spirit and influence of the peace and safety sentiment is in our very midst, and the very atmosphere that surrounds the soul of many who profess to be believers in the soon coming of Christ is of a malarious character, calculated to soothe the very ones who would be stirred if we showed zeal and determination and stood at our post of duty to warn men of the speedy advent of our Lord....We must speak forth the truth, we must let our light shine forth in clear, steady rays, lest some soul shall stumble and fall because our light is eclipsed.",
