    "word": "What is the word that comes from the watchman on the walls of Zion? \"The morning cometh, and also the night\" [Isaiah 21:12]. Both are coming. The watchman has to give the note of warning. Every watchman on the walls is to take up the note and to sound it to the people. What do the people do--just sit and gape at the watchman? They have got, in their turn, to catch the trumpet sound, then to take it up and sound it through the churches; not call, \"Watchman, come here, come here,\" because of this note, of this warning here in our church. Give it yourself, because you are connected with God. Give it yourself, because you are the channel [of] light. Catch the words all burning from the throne of God and give them to the people. That is what you are to do. Instead of quarreling [about] who shall be the greatest; instead of dissension, instead of strife, God help you to be converted. What you want is to become as little children.",
