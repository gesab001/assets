    "word": "Without the divine working, man could do no good thing. God calls every man to repentance. Yet man cannot even repent unless the Holy Spirit works upon his heart.  But the Lord wants no man to wait until he thinks he has repented before he takes his step toward Jesus. The Savior is continually drawing men to repentance; they need only to submit to be drawn, and their hearts will be melted in penitence.",
