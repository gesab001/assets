    "word": "In a letter to the elector, after stating his purpose to leave the Wartburg, Luther said: \u201cBe it known to your highness that I am repairing to Wittenberg under a protection more powerful than that of an elector. I have no thought of soliciting the aid of your highness; and am so far from desiring your protection that it is rather my purpose to protect your highness. If I knew that your highness could or would take up my defense, I would not come to Wittenberg. No secular sword can advance this cause; God must do all, \n189\nwithout the aid or co-operation of man. He who has most faith is the most availing defense.\u201d",
