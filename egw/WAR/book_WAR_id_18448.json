    "word": "Medical missions must be opened as pioneer agencies to prepare the way for the proclamation of the third angel's message in the cities of the South. O, how great is the need for means to do this work! Gospel medical missions can not be established without financial aid. Every such mission calls for our sympathy and for our means, that facilities may be provided to make the work successful. These institutions, conducted in accordance with the will of God, would remove prejudice, and call our work into favorable notice. The highest aim of the workers is to be the spiritual health of the patients. Medical missionary work gives opportunity for carrying forward successful evangelistic work. It is as these lines of effort are united, that we may expect to gather the most precious fruit for the Lord.",
