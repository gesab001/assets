    "word": "When the Holy Spirit is allowed to mold our hearts and lives, there will be much more confidence expressed in the workers who are now struggling with difficulties in hard places.

We each need to realize our own weakness and be constantly on guard. Satan is watching to take us unawares, and many are ignorant of their own defects of character.",
