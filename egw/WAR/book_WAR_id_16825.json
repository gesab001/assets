    "word": "God is Himself the source of all mercy. His name is \"merciful and gracious.\" Exodus 34:6. He does not treat us according to our desert. He does not ask if we are worthy of His love, but He pours upon us the riches of His love, to make us worthy. He is not vindictive. He seeks not to punish, but to redeem. Even the severity which He manifests through His providences is manifested for the salvation of the wayward. He yearns with intense desire to relieve the woes of men and to apply His balsam to their wounds. It is true that God \"will by no means clear the guilty\" (Exodus 34:7), but He would take away the guilt.",
