    "word": "PRAYER IS A WEAPON AGAINST SATAN.\u2014Beware how you neglect secret prayer and a study of God\u2019s word. These are your weapons \n271\nagainst him who is striving to hinder your progress heavenward. The first neglect of prayer and Bible study makes easier the second neglect. The first resistance to the Spirit\u2019s pleading prepares the way for the second resistance. Thus the heart is hardened, and the conscience seared.\u2014(Messages to Young People, 96.)",
