    "word": "O, the solemnity of the day of God is upon us. The Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their iniquity, and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. A great work is to be done in God's moral vineyard. I can say from the heart, I have done all I could to help the work in this new field; I have borne agony of soul because there has been so little perception of the work to be done in these far off regions. If God has seen fit to send the truth to these countries, it is not that it shall be hindered, but the responses shall be made to our appeals for this field because there is an intelligent understanding of the whole field and an appreciation of the work done by the workers in these fields. It becomes those who act a part as Christ's representatives at this time not to dwell upon one portion of the work or of the vineyard, to the neglect of others portions of the field. All should share equally in attention, cultivation, and development. The great saving truths, vital with interest for this time, are to be proclaimed. These truths are to be the woof and warp of every discourse given, every plan devised, and every effort made, the sum, the substance, the core, the life of every appeal. The converting power of God must come to our people, not in spasmodic waves, but as a holy breathing from heaven, making known God's hidden treasure, the unsearchable riches of the Scriptures.",
