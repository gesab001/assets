    "word": "Shall we bear in mind that the presence of the Holy Spirit with us in the bed chamber, in the family circle, in the most difficult places we pass through, is shielding us from the shafts of the enemy, constantly counterworking his devisings and carrying forward his work as a reprover of sin, imparting and impressing the mind with the words of Christ, bringing all things to our remembrance, that He may restore the moral image of God in man? We need to dwell more constantly and earnestly upon the grace of the Holy Spirit. This we do not discern with our natural eyes, yet by faith we see its office work, and we cannot render to God supreme love and honor if we do not recognize the Holy Spirit which the Lord sends. The Holy Spirit represents Jesus Christ. He is our refuge unto whom we can run and be safe. He is always present with the human agent. \n\n                                                                --",
