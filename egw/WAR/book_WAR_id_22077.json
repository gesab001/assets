    "word": "God help us to move soundly, solidly, because we are eating and drinking the flesh and blood of the Son of God. \"Preach the word.\" Compared with the Word, everything else is weakness itself. The Word of God is the weapon of our warfare. Educate, train the people to be doers of the Word, and they will then abide in Christ, and Christ will abide in them. Then they will discern the delusions of Satan; they will not be ignorant of his devices.",
