All the arrangements with those in God's service should be conducted as a sacred transaction between man and his fellowman. Men have no right to treat the workers together with God as though they were inanimate objects to be handled about without any voice or expression of their own. I have been shown that men have sat on the auditing committees who have not had discrimination or judgment. Farmers who have no real understanding of the situation of the workers have again and again brought real oppression and want into families. Their management has given occasion for the enemy to tempt and discourage the workers, and in some cases have driven them from the field.
