    "word": "By His might and power He has kept His shield over you. When men refused to work in accordance with the light given, the Lord worked in other ways to bring about the prosperity needed for the carrying forward of His work. You must acknowledge His power as your wisdom and your sufficiency. God has greatly loved you, and again and again has preserved your life by spreading His shield over you. He has been your rock of defense. He desires you to have a clear perception that He has opened the way for you in Nashville, and that, by the advancement of the work in this place, the way might be prepared in other places.",
