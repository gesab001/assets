If those who are in command have not self-control, they place themselves below the servant.  God expects the steward whom he honors to represent the Master.  If he cannot represent the patience, the kindness, the long-suffering love, the honesty and self-denial of Christ; if he forgets that he is a servant, and lifts himself up, it would be well for the people to discharge him.--Manuscript 115, 1899 (Aug. 15, 1899).",
