    "word": "Our salvation depends upon our knowledge of God's will as it is contained in His Word. Never cease asking and searching for truth. You need to know what is truth. You need to know your duty. You need to know what you shall do in order to be saved. And it is God's will that you should know what He has said to you. But you must exercise faith. As you search God's Word, you must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him.",
