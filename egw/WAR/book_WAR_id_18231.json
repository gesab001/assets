    "word": "The Lord will save his own people in his own way, by such means and instrumentalities that the glory will be returned to him. To him alone belongs the praise. Let us beware how we give to human beings the credit for their success. It is the abundant grace of Christ that makes the feeble among his disciples strong and the strong mighty. It is from him that we receive the endowments that enable us to offer him acceptable service. If we are fully consecrated to him, we shall return to God all the glory. We shall make him our entire dependence.",
