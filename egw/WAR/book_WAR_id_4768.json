    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     The work of the Lord is a great work, and wise men are needed to engage in it. Men are needed who can adapt themselves to the wants of the people. If you expect to help the people, you must not take your position above them, but right down among them. . . . Those who instruct children should avoid tedious remarks. Short remarks and to the point will have a happy influence. If much is to be said, make up for briefness by frequency. A few words of interest, now and then, will be more beneficial than to have it all at once. Long speeches burden the small minds of children. Too much talk will lead them even to loathe spiritual instruction, just as overeating burdens the stomach and lessens the appetite, leading even to a loathing of food. The minds of the people may be glutted with too much speechifying. Labor for the church, but especially for the youth, should be line upon line, precept upon \n407\nprecept, here a little, and there a little. Give minds time to digest the truths you feed them. Children must be drawn toward heaven, not rashly, but very gently.\u2014Vol. 2, p. 419.",
