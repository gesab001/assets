Laban told him, \"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\" Jacob then rehearsed to Laban the ungenerous course he had pursued toward him, that he had only studied his own advantage.

Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\"",
