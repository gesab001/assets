    "word": "A straightforward plan is to be followed in dealing with believers in home and foreign fields. An unselfish equality is to be maintained among the working forces. Money is to be provided to support missionaries. An agent should be appointed to investigate the situation in foreign countries and to report. Those in places where the work has been established should bind about their supposed wants, that the work in foreign fields may go forward. In the institutions which have been established there will be a desire to grasp more and still more advantages. To make a larger plant, let them work economically, till they themselves succeed in doing this. But the Lord declares that this should not be. The means in his treasury is to be used in building up the work in the places where there are no conveniences. The workers in foreign fields should not be left to beg. The condition of every new mission field should be examined, that there may be equality in the distribution of means which come into our conference and benevolent institutions.",
