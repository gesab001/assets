    "word": "Says the prophet, \"Blessed is he that readeth\"-- there are some who will not read; the blessing is not for them. \"And they that hear\"--there are some, also, who refuse to hear anything concerning the prophecies; the blessing is not for this class. \"And keep those things that are written therein\"--many refuse to heed the warnings and instructions contained in the Revelation. None of these can claim the blessing promised. All who ridicule the subjects of the prophecy, and mock at the symbols here solemnly given, all who refuse to reform their lives, and prepare for the coming of the Son of man, will be unblest.",
