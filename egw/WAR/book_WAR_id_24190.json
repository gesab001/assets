We like the atmosphere, but there will have to be some things done to make us more comfortable--not much, but a little--if we stay through October. I would make a little shanty of wood. Lumber is cheaper here than at Battle Creek, and then wood is cheap and stoves would do the rest to keep us warm in rainy weather. When the sun shines it is beautiful.",
