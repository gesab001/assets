    "word": "Has the Lord given medical missionaries the work of disparaging the ministry and exalting their own work in contrast? We wish all to understand this. The Lord does not design His work to be done after the manner in which it has been carried forward for years in America. The unworthy and the unrighteous have received advantages which should have been given to others. The work has been swayed in wrong lines. Shall it continue thus? Shall there be no change? God says, Set things in order, and connect with Me. God has the salvation of the world before Him, not the salvation of those in one or two places. The gospel must be preached in all the world, for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come.",
