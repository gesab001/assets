    "word": "In order to be made whole, we must connect with the Source of our strength. If the Lord in His mercy heals our infirmities and diseases, we are not to be presumptuous or to think that we can indulge perverted appetite, heedless of His message to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul. Let us not mock God by perversity of spirit. When He works a miracle in our behalf to give us health, it is that we may devote our restored powers to His service.",
