    "word": "The human mind becomes dwarfed and enfeebled when dealing with common-place matters only, never rising above the level of time and sense to grasp the mysteries of the unseen. The understanding is gradually brought to the level of the things with which it is constantly familiar. The mind will contract its powers and lose its ability, if it is not exercised to acquire additional knowledge, and put to the stretch to comprehend the revelations of divine power in nature and in the Sacred Word.",
