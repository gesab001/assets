    "word": "\u201cThe beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.\u201d The atheistical power that ruled in France during the Revolution and the reign of terror, did wage such a war upon the Bible as the world had never witnessed. The Word of God was prohibited by the national assembly. Bibles were collected and publicly burned with every possible manifestation of scorn. The law of God was trampled under foot. The institutions of the Bible were abolished. The weekly rest-day was set aside, and in its stead every tenth day was devoted to reveling and blasphemy. Baptism \n274\nand the communion were prohibited. And announcements posted conspicuously over the burial-places declared death to be an eternal sleep.",
