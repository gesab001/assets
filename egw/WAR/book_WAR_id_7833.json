    "word": "A Sinful Emotion.--The law of God takes note of the jealousy, envy, hatred, malignity, revenge, lust, and ambition that surge through the soul, but have not found expression in outward action because the opportunity, not the will, has been wanting. And these sinful emotions will be brought into the account in the day when \"God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil\" (Ecclesiastes 12:14).--ST, Apr 15, 1886. (1SM 217.)",
