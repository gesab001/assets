    "word": "Battle Creek, Wednesday, March 2, 1859. Sister Kelsey and her son called on us. Sister Kelsey seems sad. She brought wheat to sell, and it is musty. Cannot dispose of it. She needs means to use. We prepared her a warm meal and had her sit down and partake of it before starting for the thirteen-mile ride home. It is chilly weather. I lent her a cloak; feared she would suffer. . . . She has been a kind friend to us and in time of need has assisted us liberally.",
