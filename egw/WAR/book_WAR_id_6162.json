    "word": "Jesus prayed to the Father with strong crying and tears. Paul exhorts believers to \"pray without ceasing\" (1 Thessalonians 5:17). \"In every thing, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God\" (Philippians 4:6). . . . God has a right to command our devotions; His authority is sacred and unquestionable. We are under obligation to pray because He requires it; and in obeying His requirements we shall receive a gracious and precious reward. . . .",
