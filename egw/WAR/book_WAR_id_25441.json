    "word": "The mixing largely of white or brown flour bread with milk in the place of water is not a healthful preparation. If the bread thus cooked is allowed to stand over, and is then broken open, there will frequently be seen long strings like cobwebs, and this, in warm weather, soon causes fermentation to take place in the stomach. Milk should not be used in place of water in breadmaking. All this is extra expense, and is not wholesome. The taste may be educated so that it will prefer bread prepared in this way; but the more simply it is  made, the better it will satisfy hunger, and the more natural will be the appetite to enjoy the plainest diet.",
