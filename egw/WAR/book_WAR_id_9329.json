    "word": "PRAYER ESPECIALLY NECESSARY AT CRITICAL MOMENTS IN OUR CONFLICT WITH SATAN.\u2014In the conflict with satanic agencies there are decisive moments that determine the victory either on the side of God or on the side of the prince of this world. If those engaged in the warfare are not wide awake, earnest, vigilant, praying for wisdom, watching unto prayer, . . . Satan comes off victor, when he might have been vanquished by the armies of the Lord. . . . God\u2019s faithful sentinels are to give the evil powers no advantage.\u2014(SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, 1094.)",
