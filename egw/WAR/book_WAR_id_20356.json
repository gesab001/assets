    "word": "I look forward to the city of God with great joy. In my girlhood light shown upon my pathway, and the glory of heaven was open before me. I gave myself to Christ and it is a pleasure to serve Him. No earthly attractions shall eclipse my mind from my duty to serve God. If the curtains of heaven could be rolled back and we could see the glories therein, this world would have no charms for us. Thank God strength will be imparted to every soul that will put his trust in God. God help us to overcome that we may receive the crown of life that is in store for the faithful, is my prayer.--Ms 41, 1886, pp. 1-6.
