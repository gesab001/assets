    "word": "The words \u201cThou art this head of gold\u201d made the deepest impression upon Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s mind. He determined to make an image that should excel the original. This image was not to deteriorate in value from the head to the feet, like the one he had been shown, but was to be composed throughout of the most precious metal.
