    "word": "For years the Lord has been presenting the situation of the church before you. Again and again reproofs and warnings have been given. Oct. 23, 1879, the Lord gave me a most impressive testimony in regard to the church in Battle Creek, especially in reference to Eld. Smith. Now he is found firm, persistent, stubborn, on the wrong side. He is not led by the Spirit of God in his decisions. The Lord has laid no such burden upon him. Human influences have molded his judgment. No greater evidence of this can be given than the course he has taken in regard to my testimony to the church. During the last month I was with you in Battle Creek, I carried a heavy burden for the church, while those who should have felt to the very depths of their soul, were comparatively easy and unconcerned. I knew not what to do, or what to say. I had no confidence in the course which many were pursuing; for they were doing the very things which the Lord had warned them not to do.",
