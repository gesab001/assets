    "word": "The apostle Peter understood the relation between the mind and the body, and raised his voice in warning to his brethren: \u201cDearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against \n54\nthe soul.\u201d [1 Peter 2:11.] Many regard this text as a warning against licentiousness only; but it has a broader meaning. It forbids every injurious gratification of appetite or passion. Every perverted appetite becomes a warring lust. Appetite was given us for a good purpose, not to become the minister of death by being perverted, and thus degenerating into \u201clusts which war against the soul.\u201d Peter's admonition is a most direct and forcible warning against the use of all stimulants and narcotics. These indulgences may well be classed among the lusts that exert a pernicious influence upon moral character.",
