    "word": "The Lord's servants are merely stewards at work. The Lord's part of the work is to do that which is entrusted to Him when His followers surrender themselves to Him to be worked by the Holy Spirit. When by faith men place themselves in the Lord's hands, saying, \"Here am I; send me,\" He undertakes this work. He does that which is entrusted to Him. But men must get out of the Lord's way. They must not hinder His purposes by their devising.",
