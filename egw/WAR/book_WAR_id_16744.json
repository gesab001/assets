    "word": "The city of God with all its attractions is saying, \"Come.\" If we can by a holy life, by entreaties, by prayers, by warnings, point the sinner to the way of escape and fasten their attention to the heavenly gates open to receive them; if by faith they can see that the entrance into life is an open door, everything is gained. The earthly attractions will fade away, the heavenly will win and charm the soul. . . .",
