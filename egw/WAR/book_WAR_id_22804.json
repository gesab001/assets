    "word": "Then we read, \"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be when the Son of man shall be revealed.\" The wicked will be destroyed, not by water but by fire. But before the Son of God shall come, He sends the warning that He is soon to come \"to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain\" [Isaiah 26:21]. Now, Christ says that just before His coming such a state of things will exist as existed in the old world. They did not repent before God but went right on \"eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away.\" Well, is it a sin to eat or drink? When we carry it to excess, it is a sin. When we carry the marrying and giving in marriage to excess, this also is a sin.",
