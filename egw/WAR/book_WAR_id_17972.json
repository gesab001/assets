    "word": "Knowing this, what manner of persons ought we to be? Shall we exalt human wisdom, and point to finite, changeable, erring men as a dependence in time of trouble? or shall we exemplify our faith by our trust in God's power, revealing the net of false theories, religions, and philosophies which Satan has spread to catch unwary souls? By thus doing the word of God, we shall be lights in the world; for if the word of God is practised, we show to all those who come within the sphere of our influence that we reverence and respect God, and that we are working under his administration. By a humble, circumspect walk, by love, forbearance, long-suffering, and gentleness, God expects his servants to manifest him to the world.",
