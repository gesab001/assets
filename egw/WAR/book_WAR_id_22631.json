    "word": "Whatever you accomplish, be it little or much, leave it with God, remembering that it is not left for man to measure the work or the reward of his fellow men. The Lord Jesus will give you the wages that are your due. Your reward will be in accordance with the spirit in which your work was done. Purity of motive, an earnest desire to glorify God, will bring to the earnest worker the same reward that comes to the one who accomplishes more. It is the principles by which the worker is governed that determine the reward.",
