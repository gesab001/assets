    "word": "7, 8 (Luke 3:7-9). Who Were Vipers?--The Pharisees were very strict in regard to the outward observance of forms and customs, and were filled with haughty, worldly, hypocritical self-righteousness. The Sadducees denied the resurrection of the dead and the existence of angels, and were skeptical in regard to God. This sect was largely composed of unworthy characters, many of whom were licentious in their habits. By the word \"vipers\" John meant those who were malignant and antagonistic, bitterly opposed to the expressed will of God.",
