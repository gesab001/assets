    "word": "The Lord is at hand. Heavenly intelligences united with sanctified influences of earth are to proclaim the third angel's message and sound the warning, The end of all things is at hand. \"For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry\" (Hebrews 10:37). A people are to be prepared to stand in the day of the Lord, and having done all, to stand. Those who crowd together in cities and villages are making a serious mistake. Those who thus neglect to extend their influence, by circulating wider and wider, reaching to the uttermost parts of the world are neglecting to stand at their post of duty. . . .",
