    "word": "The introduction of this class of matter has been distinctly pointed out to me as the most effective way of demoralizing the apprentices. It reveals a decided lack in those who have to do with these questions. Some in responsible positions are not controlled by the Holy Spirit. The Lord regards as unfaithful stewards those who have agreed to take into the Office for publication this class of literature. The apprentices working in the Office have been left unguarded by unfaithful shepherds. Seeds of evil have been sown in the hearts of the apprentices and in the hearts of all who have handled this literature,--seeds that will spring up and grow, \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" Thus error will continue to grow.--Ms 124, 1901, pp. 1-4. (\"Satanic Literature,\" December 9, 1901.)",
