    "word": "Those who drive the Lord's faithful messengers into corners, who discourage them, who stand between them and the people, that their message may not have the influence God designed it should, are answerable for the deceptions and heresies that come into the church as a result of their course. They have a fearful account to render to God. After the Lord has repeatedly warned His people, and they still refuse to hearken to His voice, and will not be instructed, their guilt becomes peculiarly abhorrent to Him. The record of their rebellion is written in a book before Him, and will confront them when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened.--Manuscript 10, Feb. 16, 1899, \"Words of Warning.\"",
