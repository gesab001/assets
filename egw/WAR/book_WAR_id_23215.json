    "word": "One subject of emulation swallowed up every other. Who should approach nearest the likeness of Christ? Which should do most to glorify God? The Spirit of life and light and sanctification and holiness pervaded every mind. Heart beat in unison with heart. Praise and thanksgiving were ascending upward to God. This is the fruit borne on the Christian tree. May the Lord help His people now at this present time to be the light of the world. The world needs the light of Christian example. The church is too much, altogether too much, like the world; therefore the light is not reflected from them to the world.",
