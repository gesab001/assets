    "word": "I was shown that Victor Johnson has truly loved his wife. She was dearer to him than any other one upon earth. When the divorce was in progress, his feelings were intense. He besought his wife to defer the matter. He promised amendment; promised to not trouble her, but go away and reform. She should have eagerly grasped at even that feeble hope that it was possible he might amend, and even if she had to suffer some time longer, given him another chance. There was an error in still pressing matters forward. Although those who were engaged in the matter thought they were taking the best course, yet they did not exercise the pitying love toward Victor that Jesus has shown them, and they should have considered that \"with what measure ye mete\" to others, \"it shall be measured to you\" again. --Manuscript 2, 1863. \n\nEllen G.
