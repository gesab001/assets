    "word": "On leaving Omaha we found ourselves--and numerous baskets and satchels --well disposed of in an elegant palace sleeper, only seventeen passengers in our car, no babies to cry, no invalids to exclaim, \"Please close the ventilators. Will you shut down that window!\" We are at perfect liberty to open and close windows for our convenience. There was nothing special to engage our attention Wednesday night but the prairie fires. These looked grand and awful. In the distance while the train is slowly moving onward, we see the long belts of lurid flame stretching for miles across the prairie. As the wind rises the flame rises higher and becomes more brilliant, brightening the desolate plains with their awful brightness. We see farther on, haystacks and settlers' homes guarded with furrows broken by the plow to protect their little homes. We saw dark objects in the distance guarding their homes from the fire fiend by throwing up embankments.",
