    "word": "Many were drawn into this snare by the misrepresentation of others, knowing not what they were doing, not understanding what they were stirred up about. A bewitching power attends all rebellion of whatever order. After they had taken the position with the more responsible ones in attempting to destroy the Son of God after His discourse at Nazareth, they would not repent and retract. Jesus gave them an opportunity after His character and His work were more fully known. He had wrought miracles. He had done works that no other man had done or ever could do, but they did not afterward repent and give Him glory.",
