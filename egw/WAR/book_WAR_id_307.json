    "word": "In the study of hygiene the earnest teacher will improve every opportunity to show the necessity of perfect cleanliness both in personal habits and in all one's surroundings. . . . Teach the pupils that a healthful sleeping room, a thoroughly clean kitchen, and a tastefully arranged, wholesomely supplied table will go farther toward securing the happiness of the family and the regard of every sensible visitor than any amount of expensive furnishing in the drawing room. That \"the life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment\" [Luke 12:23] is a lesson no less needed now than when given by the divine Teacher eighteen hundred years ago.",
