    "word": "Divine knowledge may become human knowledge. All our ministers should study closely the manner of Christ's teaching. They must take in His lessons. There is not one in twenty who knows the beauty, the real essence, of Christ's ministry. They are to find it out. Then they will become partakers of the rich fruit of His teachings. They will weave them so fully into their own life and practice that the ideas and principles that Christ brought into His lessons will be brought into their teaching. The truth will blossom and bear the noblest kind of fruit. And the worker's own heart will be warmed; yea, it will burn with the vivifying spiritual life which it infuses into the minds of others. Then all this tame sermonizing will come to an end, for frequently this is an exhibition of self rather than the fruit that the teacher bears who has been at the feet of Jesus and learned of Him.",
