    "word": "How could our brethren say that in \"Living Temple\" there was nothing contrary to the truths of God's Word? The Lord's watchmen should have been quick to see that evil was stealing into our ranks. They should have been wide awake to discern the approach of the enemy, and to give the alarm. The rebuke of God will rest upon those who willingly close their eyes that they may not discern the dangerous character of the fables that are stealthily finding place among us. The rebuke of God is upon the ministers and medical missionary workers who have been asleep on the walls of Zion, when as vigilant watchmen they should have warned the people of the Lord against the dangers threatening them.",
