    "word": "If our ministering brethren have not decided to put all there is of them into the work of God, it would be better for them not to be numbered among the laborers, as only failure and disappointment will attend their efforts. Satan and his agents are sharper than our workers. While he is planning and devising, and laying his nets to take souls unawares, our brethren are frequently taking things in a very easy manner, and Satan out-generals them almost every time. Now, if they would have the field preoccupied by God and by heavenly angels, and their own efforts, they must throw their whole being, soul, body, and spirit, into the work of God, and not make a pretense of doing the work, when it is not half done.",
