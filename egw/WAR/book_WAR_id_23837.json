    "word": "God's stewards are not to work selfishly only for that which is nearest them. They are not to use much-needed money in a vague, careless way, taking little pains to ascertain the results of the appropriations. Our brethren have sometimes placed gifts in the hands of responsible men, asking them to use it where it was most needed. These stewards could have gained the approval of God by sharing with needy mission fields some of the money thus placed in their hands. The sharing of these donations with needy fields would have evidenced that the Holy Spirit was working on human minds. Especially should the fields to which the Lord had called attention, have been assisted.",
