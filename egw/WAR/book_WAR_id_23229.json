    "word": "Christ says to you, Now is your day, now is your opportunity. Christ wept over the impenitent city and exclaimed, \"If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!\" Shall the irrevocable sentence be uttered against you, \"But now they are hid from thine eyes\"? Jesus beheld the city and wept over it. The impenitent city was not forsaken because Jesus wanted to leave it to its doom. The child of His care had brought dishonor to God, and in rejecting light, warnings, and entreaties, sealed its own doom, forged its own fetters, loaded its own cloud of wrath.",
