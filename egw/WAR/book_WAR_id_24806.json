    "word": "All should say, I will not fail. I will not through my influence betray myself or my companions into the hands of the enemy. I will heed the words of the Lord. \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.\" Ever remember that you have one by your side who says to you, \"Be not afraid. I have overcome the world.\" Bear in mind that Christ came as the Prince of heaven, and engaged in the warfare against the principles of sin. All who will unite with Christ will be workers together with God in this warfare.",
