    "word": "Jesus said to his disciples, \"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" His voice comes sounding down the lines of our time, \"Beware of that misrepresenting tongue, which is not content unless leagued with the disaffected, with those who are tempted to think that they have been misused.' Self, self, self is their theme. They have become envious and jealous, and Satan has helped them, putting his magnifying glass before their eyes, until a mote looks to them like a mountain, and they thing themselves the most abused persons in the world. With a beam on their own eye, they are very much interested in pulling the mote out of their brother's eye.",
