By figures and symbols I have been deeply impressed that we need not take upon ourselves any burdens that we do not know how to manage in detail. Satan is a cunning, deceptive general, and we must not give heed to everything that shall be devised by him. We need not feel compelled to work out the solution of every problem that we can not understand, in order to meet Satan's wiles. Nor am I to keep my mind reigned up to thwart Satan's devices. Why,--because God is supreme. He is our stronghold in time of trouble and perplexity. If we put our entire trust in Him, we shall find that He is an all-sufficient Guide.",
