    "word": "Men may make mistakes; they may misjudge and misconceive. Their imaginations and impressions may be faulty. But the Lord never makes a blunder. You are to look to Jesus, who is the author and finisher of your faith. There are many in the cause whose hearts and minds are not imbued with the spirit of the Master, and they are not doers of His word, or imitators of His example. But you are not to look to them for your pattern. You are to move steadfastly, firmly, forward, saying at every step, \"Be Thou my pattern.\" Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid. Jesus Christ is your foundation. Build upon Him, but be careful how you build. If you build with wood, hay, and stubble, \n\n\n                                     -76- \n\nyour work will be burned up, but if you build with precious material, compared to gold, silver, and precious stones, you will suffer no loss though your works may be tried by the fires of the last day.",
