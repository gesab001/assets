    "word": "Let the sin of pride be put away, let all superfluities of dress be overcome, and repentance toward God be exercised for the highhanded robbery toward Him, which has withheld money that should flow into the treasury to sustain the work of God in its mission fields. Let the work of reformation, of true conversion, be set before and urged upon the people. Let our works, our deportment, correspond with the work for this time, that we may say, \"Follow me as I follow Christ.\" Let us humble our souls before God by humiliation, fasting and prayer, repentance of sin, and putting it away.",
