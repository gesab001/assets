    "word": "The Lord hears the contrite prayer. He reads the hidden thought. We may pray in secret, where no man can see or hear, and He who seeth in secret will hear and reward us openly. Prayer is not intended to work any change in God. It brings us into harmony with God. It is not to take the place of duty. The prayer offered ever so often and ever so earnestly will never be accepted by God in place of your tithe money. Prayer will not pay your debts to God. The servant of Jesus Christ is to pray and rely upon God as did Daniel in the courts of Babylon.",
