    "word": "The way is now fully open for James to go forward in publishing the Present Truth. We love you and love to hear from you. We should have written you before but we have had no certain abiding place, but have traveled in rain, snow and blow with the child from place to place. I could not get time to answer any letters and it took all James' time to write for the paper and get out the hymn book. We do not have many idle moments. Now we are settled, I can have more time to write. Letter 4, 1850, p. 1. (To Brother and Sister Collins, February 10, 1850.)",
