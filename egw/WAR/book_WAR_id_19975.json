    "word": "\"Those children are most attractive who are natural, unaffected. . . . Vanity should not be encouraged by praising their looks, their words, or their actions. Nor should they be dressed in, an expensive or showy manner. This encourages pride in them, and awakens envy in the hearts of their companions. Teach the children that the true adorning is not outward. . . .",
