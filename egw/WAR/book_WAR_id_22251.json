    "word": "Please consider this before you spend on Gospel Wagon thousands of dollars. This money would erect humble houses of worship, something that the people really need, where they can meet to worship God. After an effort has been made in a certain place, do not leave that place without building a church. Then you must go farther. A school building should be erected, and a school teacher employed to educate the children. Thus the whole community may hear the last message of warning.",
