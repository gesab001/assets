    "word": "I write to the church: Be not unbelieving, but have faith. Receive the message sent to you from God. He has sent you light, not because he would afflict you and cause you pain, but because He loves you and would have you escape from the snares of the enemy which would entangle your souls. Let the good work of purification go forward. Meet the standard the Lord has given you. My brethren in Rockhampton, who I love in the Lord, I feel an intense desire that Satan shall not triumph over you, but that you should think soberly and righteously and make thorough work for eternity. Read the third chapter of First Thessalonians. The apostle had a great burden for his brethren in Thessalonica. He writes, \"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.\" (1 Thessalonians 3:5) \n                                                                           46",
