    "word": "Three Messages to Be Combined.--The three angels' messages are to be combined, giving their threefold light to the world. In the Revelation, John says, \"I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.\" [Revelation 18:2-5 quoted.] This represents the giving of the last and threefold message of warning to the world (MS 52, 1900).",
