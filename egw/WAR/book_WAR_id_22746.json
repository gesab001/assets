    "word": "The school men should say to the regular canvassers, \"We are glad of your interest in this work, and should be glad of your assistance, but the relief of our schools is not the only work in which we are interested. It is not the only work for this time. All our books on present truth, including health reform, are needed by the people. Therefore we urge you to go forward with your regular work. The Tract Societies that are handling Christ's Object Lessons without profit need an increased volume of regular business for their support, and the publishing houses that have given so many thousands of dollars in labor need a greatly increased volume of regular business, that they may sustain the strain brought upon them by their liberality. We beg of you therefore to throw your energies into the regular work as never before.",
