    "word": "A warning against such teaching is found in Paul's letter to the Colossians. The apostle declares that the hearts of the believers were to be \"knit together in love; and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the Father, and of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\" \"And this I say,\" he continues, \"lest any man should beguile you with enticing words... As ye have therefore received Jesus Christ the Lord, so walk ye in Him, rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality and power.\"",
