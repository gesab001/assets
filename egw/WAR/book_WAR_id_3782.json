Perhaps it appears that obedience to some plain requirement of God will cut off his means of support. Satan would make him believe that he must sacrifice his conscientious convictions. But the only thing in our world upon which we can rely, is the Word of God. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" Even in this life it is not \n                                                                           242\nfor our good to depart from the will of our Father in heaven. When we learn the power of His word, we shall not follow the suggestions of Satan in order to obtain food or to save our lives. Our only questions will be, What is God's command? and what His promise? Knowing these, we shall obey the one, and trust the other.--The Desire of Ages, p. 121. (1898)",
