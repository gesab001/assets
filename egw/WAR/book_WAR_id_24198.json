    "word": "There are those who are officiating in the great work who are not walking in the light; some are fashioned and molded in their experience by these men who ought to guide them and stand as faithful watchmen to give the trumpet a certain sound, but have been, in place of doing this, confusing minds and quenching the faith of God's people in the messages He has sent to them in reproof and warnings. The testimonies of His Spirit that would correct the erring are treated by them in such a manner as to leave many minds shrouded in uncertainty in regard to their true origin, and the voice of God is disregarded just as Satan wanted it should be.",
