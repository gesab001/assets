    "word": "I was shown that the same injudicious treatment has been exercised toward others. Some precious souls that could not justify the unchristian course pursued toward the doctor were crowded until they have separated from the church, and others have been cut off.

God calls upon these to repent, and learn of Christ the spirit of meekness, of self-denial, and love.",
