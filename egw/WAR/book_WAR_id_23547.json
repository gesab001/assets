    "word": "Brethren, years have passed in which every professed follower of Christ should have been engaged in most earnest work to press back the armies of the powers of darkness. Years have been lost because the people of God were not closely connected with the source of all power.

We are to idolize no man, exalt no man, but let God be our fear and our dread.",
