I was shown that he had injured his health and courage by taking his case in his own hands. I saw that his brethren  would be rewarded according to their works. Their neglect to move at all times in the counsel of God was a great loss to them; for their reward would be proportionate to their successful labors; and, if their errors and lack were not seen and corrected, their eternal interest was endangered. Every time, Satan gained the advantage over them. They placed themselves upon his ground, and opened their own souls to his temptations. I saw that my husband should have faith, hope, and courage, and talk faith, and hope, and courage. Then he would close a door that Satan loves to enter to harass, and annoy, and weaken his physical and mental strength. I saw that in some things my husband had misjudged the feelings and motives of his brethren.",
