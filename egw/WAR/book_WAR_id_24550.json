    "word": "The principles manifest in dealing with individuals, in restricting and repressing them, are not according to the mind of the spirit of God.

Be sure that you display the religion of love, not of bigotry. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" If you continue to advance in the same course you have pursued in dealing with God's heritage, such a condition of things will soon be produced that God will manifest the folly and unrighteousness of men.",
