Of the angels it is said, \u201cAre they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation?\u201d Christ sends His light to those who keep the windows of the soul open heavenward. Under the Holy Spirit's influence, they work the works of God. He who approaches nearest to obedience to the divine law will be of the most service to God. He who follows Christ, reaching out after His goodness, His compassion, His love for the human family, will be accepted by God as a worker together with Him. Such a one will not be content to remain on a low level of spirituality. He will constantly reach higher and higher. \u2014Letter 115, 1903. (Used in Our High Calling, page 182.)",
