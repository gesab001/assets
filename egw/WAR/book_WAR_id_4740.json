    "word": "Laborer for God, when weary and heavy laden, flee to Christ, who has promised you rest. He is the burdenbearer; he is your strength. Never allow yourself to believe that you are in yourself sufficient for the exigency of the times; never regard yourself as a graduated Christian. Your work is to discipline the mind, to store up knowledge, to perfect character while life lasts. Only thus can you be able to wage successfully the great warfare of life.",
