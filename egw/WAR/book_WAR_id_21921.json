    "word": "You will not do justice if you charge those who have carried the responsibilities with moving in accordance with worldly ambition, to glorify themselves, in building so largely. They thought they were working for the glory of God. Now is the time to help. Let all do something. Let all be as God's helping hand, lifting wholeheartedly. Encourage the oppressed to trust in the Lord, to have that courage which will not fail, but go forward. Let all do as they would wish to be done by were they in similar circumstances. As they do this work they will cooperate with ministering angels.",
