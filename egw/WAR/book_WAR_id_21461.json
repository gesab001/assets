    "word": "The message of the apostle James, depicting the misery of the rich who have done wickedly, is to be repeated as a message of warning and appeal. The instruction given in the first and second chapters of 1 Peter, exhorting \n\n\n                                 -219- \n\nbelievers to a godly life, is to be presented to the people. Let all be impressed with the fact that the time has come when all should work intelligently and earnestly for the accomplishment of the work of salvation. I am instructed to say to those who have long stood at the head of the work, and who for years have allowed many of our large cities to remain unworked: The Lord will call to account those who have worked out their own plans to do a large work in a few places, while they have left undone the work that should have been done in giving the last warning message to the many large cities of our land. There has been with some a spirit of forbidding, a desire to hold back from the work brethren who desired to have a part in it. Some in the blindness of their hearts have been hindering the work, and this has brought unbelief into many hearts. I am now counseled in regard to the need of employing all our energies and all our means for the advancement of the work. We need to use our influence in encouraging others to labor. Let the spirit of sanctified activity be encouraged rather than the spirit that would seek to hinder and forbid, and there will be seen advancement where in the past there has been failure to follow the will of the Lord.",
