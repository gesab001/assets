    "word": "\"Here [in our church schools] children are to be instructed in . . . practical missionary work. They are to enlist in the army of workers to help the sick and the suffering. Children can take part in the medical missionary work, and by their jots and tittles can help to carry it forward. Their investments may be small, but every little helps, and by their efforts many souls will be won to the truth.\"--Test., Vol. VI, p. 203.",
