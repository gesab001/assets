    "word": "The Work Must Not Stop [AN APPEAL MADE BY MRS. WHITE IN 1886. WRITTEN FROM EUROPE.] \n\n     If we indeed have the truth for these last days, it must be carried to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Erelong the living and the dead are to be judged according to the deeds done in the body, and the law of God is the standard by which they are to be tested. Then they must now be warned; God's holy law must be vindicated, and held up before them as a mirror. To accomplish this work, means is needed. I know that times are hard, money is not plenty; but the truth must be spread, and money to spread it must be placed in the treasury. . . .",
