    "word": "Chap. 41 - To U. Smith (unfinished)\n\nRome, N.Y. June 14, 1889 \n\nDear Brother Smith: \n     Last night I was awake at midnight with a heavy burden on my soul from you. I saw you walked upon a path that almost imperceptibly diverged from the right way. A noble personage stood beside me and said, \"Uriah Smith is not on the brink of a precipice but he is in the path that will shortly bring him to the brink and if he is not warned now it will soon be too late. He can now retrace his steps. He is walking like a blind man into the prepared net of the enemy but he feels no danger because light is becoming darkness to him and darkness light. His only hope is in being undeceived.\"",
