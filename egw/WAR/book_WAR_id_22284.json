    "word": "MR No. 1183 - Testimony for Monterey, Michigan\n\n     While at Battle Creek, Michigan [Dec. 23, 1860?], I was shown in vision the state of God's people in Monterey. I saw that a great work must be done for many of them in order for the Lord to be glorified in the midst of His people. Those who do not make an effort to arise and zealously repent of lukewarmness and backslidings, God will spew out of his mouth. The time has come for God's people to arise. They have had warning upon warning, which, for the time being, has had an effect, but, not realizing their danger and making thorough work, they slide back again into the same indifferent, careless state. There are things in the church which must be corrected, for God is displeased with His people.",
