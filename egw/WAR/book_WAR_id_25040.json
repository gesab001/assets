    "word": "Satan often finds a powerful agency for evil in the power which one human mind is capable of exerting on another human mind. This influence is so seductive, that the person who is being molded by it is often unconscious of its power. God has bidden me speak warning against this evil, that His servants may not come under the deceptive power of Satan. The enemy is a master worker, and if God's people are not constantly led by the Spirit of God, they will be snared and taken.",
