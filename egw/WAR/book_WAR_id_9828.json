    "word": "Canvassers to Warn the Cities While It Is Possible.-- Who can question that we are living in perilous times?

For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be\" (Matthew 24:37-39).",
