    "word": "I afterward felt deeply the words which the Lord gave me for you [the managers and teachers] and for the benefit of the students--words which I would not have spoken, had I known what was to follow. If your perceptions had not been greatly beclouded, you would have taken the words, which were given of God as a reproof and a rebuke upon all that kind of pleasure, which afterwards transpired. This testimony from God presented before the students duties of the highest order. The inspiration of God was upon me, and to efface, by the after performance, all the impressions made, was virtually saying, \"We want not Thy ways, Oh God; we want our own ways; we want to follow our own wisdom.\" I look at it all as an insult to the Lord Jesus.",
