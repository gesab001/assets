    "word": "We pass on quite rapidly to the Devil's Gate, a canyon where the sweet water has worn through the granite ridge. The walls are about 300 feet high. The water runs slowly, pleasantly moving over the rocks. We pass on while the mountaintops rise perpendicular towards heaven, covered with perpetual snows, while other mountaintops, apparently horizontal, are seen. Here in passing we get some view of the beauty and grandeur of the scenery in groups of mountains clothed with pines.",
