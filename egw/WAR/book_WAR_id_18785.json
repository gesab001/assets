    "word": "Why Christian schools are needed. \n\n\n     \"One reason why it was necessary to establish institutions of our own was the fact that parents were not able to counteract the influence of the teaching their children were receiving in the public schools, and the error there taught was leading the youth into false paths. No stronger influence could be brought to bear upon the minds of youth and the children than that of those who are educating them in principles of science. For this reason it was evident that schools must be established in which our children should be instructed in the way of truth. . . . In our institutions of learning there was to be exerted an influence that would counteract the influence of the world, and with no encouragement to indulgence in appetite, in selfish gratification of the senses, in pride, ambition, love of dress, and display, love of praise and flattery, and strife for high rewards and honors as a recompense for a good scholarship. All this was to be discouraged in our school. It will be impossible to avoid these things and yet send them to the public schools, where they would daily be brought into contact with that which would contaminate their morals. All through the world there was so great a neglect of home training that the children found at the public schools, for the most part, were profligate and steeped in vice\"--Jan. 9, 1894. \n                                                                           11",
