    "word": "We need to inquire at every step, \u201cIs this the way of the Lord?\u201d As long as life shall last there is need of guarding the affections and the passions with a firm purpose. There is inward corruption; there are outward temptations, and wherever the work of God shall be advanced, Satan plans to arrange circumstances so that temptation shall come with overpowering force upon the soul. As long as life shall last, there is need of guarding the affections and the passions with a firm purpose. . . .",
