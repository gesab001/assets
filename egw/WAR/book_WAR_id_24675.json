    "word": "Then dealing with men who needed all they could obtain with brain and pen to keep them from hunger and nakedness, you have followed principles of injustice. The Lord has left you and those who cherished the same spirit to reveal the motives that prompted you to action. Thus the testimonies of warning and reproof given you have been vindicated. The same spirit that led you to follow unjust measures when dealing with your fellow-men has led you to work away from the principles that the Lord designs shall rule in his cause and work, principles that the office of publication, at its establishment, was charged to maintain, until it should be no longer needed.",
