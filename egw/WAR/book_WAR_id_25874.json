    "word": "As you go out to sell \"Christ's Object Lessons\", will you not take the prospectuses for \"Desire of Ages\" and \"Great Controversy\", and call the attention of the people to them? Many of these books are lying on the shelves of our publishing houses in America. The Lord desires the people to have the light that they contain. In canvassing for these books, you will take light to the people, and you will help me to produce other books. I greatly desire that these books shall be circulated; for they contain knowledge given me by the Lord for the people. Let this work be carried forward zealously.",
