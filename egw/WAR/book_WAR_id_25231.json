    "word": "The division of the whole multitude will be made. \"When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats; and He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.\" Those who have done good and those who have done evil will receive a reward according to their works. Then shall Jesus say to those on His right hand, \"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Thus He welcomes them, to live hereafter in eternal communion with Himself. Every voice in the mansions of heaven echoes the welcome, \"Come, ye blessed of My Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\"--MS. 77, 1906.",
