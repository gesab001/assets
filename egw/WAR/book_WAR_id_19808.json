    "word": "If certain faculties are used to the neglect of others, the design of God is not fully carried out in us; for all the faculties have a bearing, and are dependent, in a great measure, upon each other. One cannot be effectually used without the operation of all the other faculties, that the balance may be carefully preserved. If all the attention and strength are given to one, while others lie dormant the development is strong in that one, and will lead to extremes, because all the powers have not been cultivated. Some are dwarfed, and the intellect is not properly balanced. All minds are not naturally constituted alike. We have varied minds, and strong points of character, and great weaknesses, upon some points. These deficiencies, so apparent, need not, and should not, exist. If \n                                                                           3\nthose who possess them would strengthen the weak points in their character, by cultivation and exercise, they would become strong.",
