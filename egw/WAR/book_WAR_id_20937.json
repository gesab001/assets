    "word": "MR No. 388 - The Shut Door\n\n     I saw that a paper was needed, and all should be interested in it. I saw that the burden of the paper was laid upon James, and that it was as important to publish the truth as to preach it. I saw that James should not be discouraged if all did not feel the interest in the paper that he did. I saw that Brother Bates had not the interest in the paper that he should have, and that his lack of interest has discouraged James. I saw that James should set his face as a flint and go forward. I saw the flock looking for the paper, and were ready like hungry children to eat the truth published in it.--Ms 15, 1850, p. 1. (Untitled, circa 1850.)",
