    "word": "Nashville also must have financial aid, that the work there may be established. A sanitarium building must be put up near Nashville, because with the present facilities for doing medical missionary work in that city, the workers can not correctly represent the reformatory work that is to be carried forward in decided lines. This institution should be erected as soon as possible.

They have done the very best they could, but they have not been able to accomplish what they might had they had the needed facilities.",
