    "word": "(207) Besides the main building, in which there are about sixty rooms that can be used by patients, there are four-roomed cottages sitting back on higher ground. Some of these are so arranged that each room is connected with a private veranda, where in warm weather, a bed can be rolled from the room through the large windows. Besides the four cottages with four rooms each, there is a two-story cottage with nine beautiful rooms, splendidly furnished. This of itself is quite a large building.",
