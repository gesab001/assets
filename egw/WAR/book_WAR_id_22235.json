    "word": "Elder J, through his stirring discourses, has been enabled to reach the worldly class, and to strike terror to the hearts of those dead in trespasses and sins. But when those convicted by his preaching have been brought thus far, they need other help. They need to be taught to study the word of God. They need to be led, step by step, to take their stand firmly on the true foundation. Different workers are needed in the ministry, just as different workers are needed in the erection of a building. The law of development must guide; the work must be carried forward from point to point.",
