    "word": "It will not be wise to erect large food factories anywhere. Should this be done, there would be danger that they would be destroyed by those who are carrying out Satan's plans, unless there is a compliance with these plans. I have received light on the subject of large food factories, and the outlook is not favorable. If the food work is carried forward as many have planned, the final results will be the destruction of property and the destruction of souls. -MS 44, 1903. Written April 28, 1903.",
