    "word": "The warning message of John was in the same lines as the warning to Nineveh, \"Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown\" (Jonah 3:4). Nineveh repented, and called upon God, and God accepted their acknowledgment of Him. Forty years of probation was granted them in which to reveal the genuineness of their repentance and to turn from sin. But Nineveh turned again to the worship of images; her iniquity became deeper and more desperate than before, because the light had come and had not been heeded.",
