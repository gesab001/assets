    "word": "A little child was the illustration chosen by Jesus to correct the false ideas held by the disciples in regard to greatness. Not outward exaltation, not high position, but spiritual excellence, spiritual purity, excellence of speech, meekness, and the carrying out of mercy, justice, and the love of God\u2014this is what the Lord requires of every soul. Men must be truly converted. Their natural defects of disposition must be changed for the virtues of Christ\u2019s character, else they will never enter the kingdom of heaven. They must be humble, charitable, kind, merciful; then they will be called, Blessed of the Lord. They must cherish a humble, submissive spirit, receiving, as would a little child, the lessons given by their Teacher and obeying every word proceeding from His mouth. Because of their love for Him, they are to love all who believe in Him. They are to exert a Christlike influence.",
