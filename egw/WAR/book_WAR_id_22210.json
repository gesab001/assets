    "word": "Every unkind criticism of others, every thought of self-esteem, is \"the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity.\" This lifting up of self in pride, as if you were faultless, and magnifying the faults of others, is offensive to God. It is breaking His law, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" \"Be kindly affectioned one toward another.\" We have no right to withdraw our confidence from a brother because of some evil report, some accusation or supposition of wrong. Frequently the report is made by those who are at enmity with God, those who are doing the enemy's work as accusers of the brethren.",
