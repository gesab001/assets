    "word": "Last night I was solicited to go to the meeting for youth in the tabernacle. Although I had sent for the doctor, because several of us were sick and I myself was sick, yet my interest was so great for the young I went to the meeting. I looked to find you and Homer present but you were not there. . . . We had a very precious meeting. Fifty came forward for prayers and many of them were seeking the Lord for the first time. I was sorry that you and Homer were not present. It might have been the time when the Lord would have impressed his heart and he would have heard the voice of the dear Saviour inviting him to open the door of his heart and let Jesus in. I watched everyone that came in, but you were not among them. . . .",
