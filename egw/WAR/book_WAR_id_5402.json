ACCORDINGLY . . . HE WROTE AN IMPERIOUS LETTER TO THE ASIATIC PRELATES, COMMANDING THEM TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE OF THE WESTERN CHRISTIANS WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF CELEBRATING THE FESTIVAL OF EASTER. THE ASIATICS ANSWERED THIS LORDLY REQUISITION . . . WITH GREAT SPIRIT AND RESOLUTION, THAT THEY WOULD BY NO MEANS DEPART, IN THIS MANNER, FROM THE CUSTOM HANDED DOWN TO THEM BY THEIR ANCESTORS. UPON THIS THE THUNDER OF EXCOMMUNICATION BEGAN TO ROAR. VICTOR, EXASPERATED BY THIS RESOLUTE ANSWER OF THE ASIATIC BISHOPS, BROKE COMMUNION WITH THEM, PRONOUNCED THEM UNWORTHY OF THE NAME OF HIS BRETHREN, AND EXCLUDED THEM FROM ALL FELLOWSHIP WITH THE CHURCH OF ROME.\u201d [MOSHEIM, ECCL. HIST., CENT. 2, PART 2, CHAP. 4., PARA. 9, 11.] THIS, SAYS BOWER, WAS \u201cTHE FIRST ESSAY OF PAPAL USURPATION.\u201d",
