    "word": "Our medical missionary work is to be to the third angel's message as the right hand to the body. Our sanitariums are one great means of doing medical missionary work. They are to reach the people where they are. The workers in our sanitariums are to be sympathetic, kind, and straight-forward in their dealings with one another and with the patients. Their words and acts are to be noble and upright. They are to receive from Christ light and grace to impart to those in darkness. By their efforts the sick and the sinful are to be pointed to the great Healer, and the prodigals who have left the Father's house are to be encouraged to return. God's word to these workers is, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end.\" \"Fear not, neither be discouraged; for I am thy God.\"",
