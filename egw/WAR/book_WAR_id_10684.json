    "word": "Chap. 8 - The Question of Influence\n-\n\n     Who Has Told Sister White?--Those who have disregarded the messages of warning have lost their bearings. Some, in their self-confidence, have dared to turn from that which they knew to be truth, with the words, \"Who has told Sister White?\" These words show the measure of their faith and confidence in the work that the Lord has given me to do. They have before them the result of the work that the Lord has laid upon me, and if this does not convince them, no arguments, no future revelations, would affect them. The result will be that God will speak again in judgment as He has spoken heretofore.--Review and Herald, May 19, 1903, p. 8.",
