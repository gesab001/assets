    "word": "Suppose a call should be made in Battle Creek for missionaries to go forth to establish themselves in cities and in villages, and even to go to foreign countries to do all that they possibly can in the name of Jesus. How many would respond? How many of those who should respond would have their character so molded by Jesus Christ that they would be chosen as those who could be trusted? How many who have listened to the appeals made in regard to the plainness of dress have heeded the appeals and admonitions of God, conforming to the light given of God? Should those who profess to believe the truth go into places \n\n\n                                  -161- \n\nwhere the truth has never been represented, would their outward appearance plainly contradict the truth? Those who have not been brought into harmony with the self-denial and self-sacrifice of Christ Jesus are not the ones to attempt this work, for they are not ready to labor for the salvation of others.",
