    "word": "The king did not heed the words of warning, and he greatly perverted his ways. The statement, \"Thou art this head of gold,\" flattered his vanity, and his rule became oppressive. He exalted himself, and determined that his kingdom should be like an image that was all gold. He cherished jealousy of other kingdoms, and after the light God gave him and had been made clear to his mind, he still perverted his course of action, and exalted himself before God. His rule that had been to a great extent just and merciful, because God had imparted wisdom, now manifested the vanity and oppression of the human heart. The reason God had given him was misapplied and misused in glorifying himself, and was finally dethroned. He followed the instincts of the beasts; he ate the food they ate, and acted as they did. For seven years the king was an astonishment to all his subjects. He was an example of what it is to be humbled of God, because he did not honor God, but made himself as God.",
