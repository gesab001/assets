    "word": "The object of the Health Institute among us is not for the purpose of obtaining money; although money is very necessary to carry forward this Institution successfully. Economy should be exercised by all in the expenditure of means, that money be not used needlessly. But there should be sufficient means to invest in all necessary conveniences which will make the work of helpers, and especially physicians, as easy as possible. And the directors of the Health Institute should avail themselves of every facility which will aid in the successful treatment of patients.",
