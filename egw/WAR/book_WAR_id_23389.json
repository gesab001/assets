    "word": "The warning message is to be carried to all parts of the world. Our books are to be published in many different languages. With these books, humble, faithful men are to go forth as colporteur-evangelists, bearing the truth to many who otherwise would never be enlightened. Those who take up this line of work are to go prepared to do medical missionary work. The sick and suffering are to be helped. Many for whom this \n\n\n                                     -445- \n\nwork of mercy is done will hear and accept the words of life. Many will be healed by the prayer of faith, and will rise to health to advocate the precious principles of health reform.--Ms 76, 1901. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nJune 13, 1991. Entire Ms.",
