He is desirous of communicating through those who seek Him with all the heart. While we put our entire trust in our Redeemer, we are perfectly safe. We have a large work to do, and we are to have respect unto the recompense of reward. \n\n\n                             -234- \n\nAnd more than this we are to use every God-given faculty, that others, through our influence and Christlike example, may have the same respect that we have.",
