    "word": "The spirit of self-sufficiency and selfish independence that has for years been coming into the hearts of our people is the work of the enemy, that he may cause our feet to slide; and we cannot afford to indulge it. May God help us to put it away! Begin right in your own homes; begin there to be truly courteous, as Christ was; be kind; live not to please yourselves. Then if you are Christians at home, you will carry the same spirit into the church. You will carry it into your councils, and will have evidence that Jesus is indeed your helper, your stronghold, your front guard and your rear-ward. The righteousness of Christ will go before you, and the glory of God will be your rear-ward.",
