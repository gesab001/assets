    "word": "There are two classes of poor whom we have always within our borders--those who ruin themselves by their own independent course of action and continue in their transgression, and those who for the truth's sake have been brought into straitened circumstances. Many of the Lord's poor are daily in suffering need, and in some cases their families may have to be provided for. There are many others who when helped will continue to make themselves special subjects of necessity. We are to love our neighbor as ourselves, and then toward all these classes we shall do the right thing under the guidance and counsel of sound wisdom. The Lord's poor subjects are to be helped in every case where it will be for their benefit. They are to be placed where they can help themselves. We have no question in regard to the cases of this class of poor. The best methods of helping them are to be carefully and prayerfully considered.",
