    "word": "The true Christian keeps the windows of the soul open heavenward. He lives in fellowship with Christ. His will is conformed to the will of Christ. His highest desire is to become more and more Christlike, that he may say with Paul: \"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me...\" (Galatians 2:20).",
