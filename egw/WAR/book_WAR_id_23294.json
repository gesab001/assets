    "word": "Brother [Joseph] Dudley erred greatly. He felt hard, bitter feelings towards Brother Butler. His feelings were unreasonable and unchristian. The church, failing to do their duty to Brother Butler and leaving him to suffer censure alone, which belonged to them, first discouraged him, then embittered his feelings. He felt that he had been unjustly used by those who should have helped him. He looked back at the conference at Battle \n\n\n                                     -264- \n\nCreek and thought that an honest course had not been taken. He was mistaken.",
