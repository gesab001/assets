    "word": "We are not to linger about the tomb, as though Christ were there. We are to remember that Christ is a risen Saviour. We have a living Christ; He is not lying in Joseph's new tomb.

He would have us walk before Him in obedience, with grateful thanksgiving. . . . When trial comes, do not think that some strange thing has happened unto you, but hear the voice of God saying in your test and trial, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. God desires you to hear His voice amid the \n\n\n                                    -148- \n\ncloud. It is a voice of peace and not of war, telling you to look to Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of your faith, a Saviour able and willing and longing to save to the uttermost all who come to God by Him.

The refining fire must purify the gold and silver from all dross, that those who claim to be Christians may offer to God an offering in righteousness. . . .",
