    "word": "Evils of Flesh Eating \n\n     Those who indulge in meat eating, tea drinking, and gluttony are sowing seeds for a harvest of pain and death. \n                                                                           576\nThe unhealthful food placed in the stomach strengthens the appetites that war against the soul, developing the lower propensities. A diet of flesh meat tends to develop animalism. A development of animalism lessens spirituality, rendering the mind incapable of understanding truth.",
