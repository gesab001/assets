    "word": "Let the believers heed the voice of the angel who has said to the church, \"Press together.\" In unity is your strength. Love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous. God hath a church, and Christ hath declared, \"The gates of hell shall not prevail against it\" (Matthew 16:18). The messengers the Lord sends bear the divine credentials. I have tender feelings toward you, but come to the light, I beseech of you.--Letter 16, 1893. (Published in Selected Messages, book 2, pp. 66-69.)",
