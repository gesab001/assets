He can turn things upside down, and destroy the things that man has built up in his most firm and substantial manner. . . .In fires, in floods, in earthquakes, in the fury of the great deep, in calamities by sea and by land, the warning is given that God's Spirit will not always strive with men.--Manuscript 127, Nov. 22, 1897, untitled manuscript.",
