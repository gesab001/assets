    "word": "16. God Bore Long for Sake of Good Amorites.--In the days of Abraham the Lord declared, \"The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\" He would not at that time allow them to be destroyed. In this is revealed the long-sufferance of God. The Amorites were at enmity against His law; they believed not in Him as the true and living God; but among them were a few good persons, and for the sake of these few, He forbore long. Centuries afterward, when the Israelites returned from Egypt to the promised land, the Amorites were \"cast out before the children of Israel.\" They finally suffered calamity because of continued willful disregard of the law of God (RH July 12, 1906).",
