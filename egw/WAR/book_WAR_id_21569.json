    "word": "Elder D might have lived had he encouraged and educated others to share the burdens with which he loaded himself down. He deprived them of an education they might have had, because he did so much himself and allowed them to rely upon his brain instead of doing their own thinking. Every man can be a man, a whole man. By patient, thoughtful effort, put forth with zeal and energy, all may overcome cowardice and ignorance and inefficiency. . . .",
