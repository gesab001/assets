    "word": "Oh, that we might catch a glimpse of the work God desires us to accomplish for the colored people in the South! Could the veil be removed, could we but realize the\n74\ndistressing condition of thousands suffering from physical and spiritual maladies, how earnestly would we plan to train suitable colored workers to go forth to minister to the needs of their own race! How gladly would we come up to the help of the Lord, by giving freely of our means for the establishment and maintenance of training centers where colored youth could be fitted for helpful service as true medical missionary evangelists! May God enable us to discern the opportunities now afforded us to lay broad plans for carrying forward this line of work in a manner befitting its importance.",
