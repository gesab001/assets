    "word": "After John's description in Revelation 16 of that miracle-working power which was to gather the world to the last great conflict, the symbols are dropped, and the trumpet voice once more gives a certain sound. \"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame\" [Revelation 16:15]. After the transgression of Adam and Eve, they were naked, for the garment of light and security had departed from them. The world will have forgotten the admonition \n\n\n                                  -97- \n\nand warnings of God, as did the inhabitants of the Noatic world; as did also the dwellers in Sodom. They awoke with all their plans and inventions of iniquity; but suddenly the shower of fire came from heaven and consumed the godless inhabitants. \"Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed\" [Luke 17:30].",
