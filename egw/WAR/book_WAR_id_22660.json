    "word": "There are a large number of professing Christians who do not really follow Jesus. They do not bear the cross by proper self-denial and self-sacrifice. Although making a great profession of being most earnest Christians, they weave into the fabric of their characters so many of the threads of their own imperfections that the beautiful pattern is spoiled. Of them Christ says: \"You boast of being rich and increased with supposed spiritual attainments. In reality you are neither cold nor hot, but are filled with vain conceit. Your life is a deception. Unless converted, you cannot be saved, for you would mar heaven with your unsanctified wisdom. I cannot endorse your spirit and your work. You do not act according to the divine Example. You are following a pattern merely of your own invention. Because you are lukewarm, I must spue you out of My mouth.\"",
