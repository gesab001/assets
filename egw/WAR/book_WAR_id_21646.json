    "word": "If you are transformed, and your character is formed after the character of Christ, it will be pleasing to God for you to remain in a position of responsibility. If you refuse to be transformed, if you look to men of the world, and cherish worldly ambition, turning from God to human beings, you will become an instrument of deception in the hands of Satan until at last you will have no power to break away from the snare. If you continue to work as you have been working, you will become one of the chief of sinners. But the eternal God has thoughts of mercy toward you, and He will abundantly pardon you through Jesus Christ if you will repent and turn to Him with full purpose of heart.",
