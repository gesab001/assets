    "word": "Brother A. C. [Bourdeau] had made some sacrifices--more, as far as means was concerned, than many of his ministering brethren. He had not been active as a laborer, but he had tried to carry out the testimony to move from Bourdeauville. [A TOWN LOCATED ABOUT 15 MILES EAST OF ST. ALBANS, VERMONT, NOW SPELLED BORDOVILLE.] This has been done at quite a sacrifice on his part. This should have been considered. Again, the suffering of his father called for the time and care of his son. One son was at a distance, while the one within reach was relied upon and his help positively demanded. A. C. Bourdeau was dealt with \n\n\n                                     -11- \n\nin a manner such as Brother Butler would not have borne [toward] himself. Justice, mercy, and love were not mingled with that labor.",
