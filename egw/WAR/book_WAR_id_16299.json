    "word": "Lift the cross higher, that many may behold, and look and live. Christ died for the world, and His command is, \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d The lord \n65\nwould give us no such commission without placing resources at our command sufficient for the work. Will men act the part of faithful stewards, appropriating God's means where He designed it should be used? Shall souls famishing for the bread of life be denied the heavenly manna? Who will sacrifice for Christ's sake? Who will present in its rich fulness the righteousness of Christ? Will the church who claim to believe the truth, the blood-bought church, do this work?",
