    "word": "Sound the note of warning, \"Come; for all things are now ready.\" In the time in which we are living skepticism, infidelity, speculation, and pharisaism abound to divert the mind from the vital questions at issue. False reports, false representations of character, calumny, and every species of reproach, will be originated by the great deceiver to throw discredit upon the word of God and those who advocate it. But what voice shall say, Quit the field; it costs too much in time, and calls for too great an outlay of means, and is a hard and unprofitable field? Oh, never let this voice call you away from the work. Among the American brethren we see that which pains our hearts. Self-indulgence abounds in the church, and the world finds large patronage from its members, because self-denial is not practiced. Money is expended for unnecessary things, and we know that this means the limiting of donations which should be applied to the great enterprise of building up the kingdom of Christ in our world. As the world advances and converts the church to its customs, and to its fashions, and leads the professed follower of Christ to indulge in its gratifications, the treasury of God is robbed in the withholding of tithes and offerings that should be given that there may be \"meat in mine house.\" The indolence that is seen in the churches and among those who claim to believe the truth, brings its curse of results, which are represented in the parable of the slothful servant who buried his talent in the earth, and misrepresented his Lord who had loaned him the talent for wise improvement. Oh, that all who have an intelligent knowledge of the truth would realize that their talents \n\n\n                                    -8- \n\nare loaned them of God to be improved by trading upon the Lord's goods! Those who put the Lord's money out to the exchanges will receive divine commendation.",
