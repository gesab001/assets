    "word": "A Prospective Convert and Jewelry.--Today I have had an interview with one who is just taking her stand for the truth, but she is much adorned with gold bracelets and rings. I think she is good material, and will bear to hear kindly advice. The word must be presented: \"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel. But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price\" (1 Peter 3:3, 4). I believe that this sister has received the truth and will practice the truth. If she loves the truth she will obey the words of Christ.--Letter 112, 1896, p. 3. (To Sister Wessels and Children, October 16, 1896.)",
