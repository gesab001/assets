    "word": "8\n     No one man's ideas, one man's plans, are to have a controlling power in carrying forward the work. One is not to stand apart from the others and make his plans and ideas the criterion for all the workers. There is to be with the individual members sent forth together, a board for counsel together. One is not to stand apart from the others and argue his own ways and plans, for he may have an education in a certain direction and possess certain traits of character which will be detrimental to the interests of the work if allowed to become a controlling power.",
