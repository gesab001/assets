    "word": "Wellington, N. Z., Tuesday, April 25, 1893 \n\n     We devoted some time--Elders Starr, Israel, W.C.W., and myself--in reference to what can be done in Wellington. Trials have been made which have resulted in nothing tangible. As Canright's books have been circulated here, a lying representation from this lying apostate has gone forth and those who read his pretentious claims are deluded. If all the circumstances were known, then blind eyes might be opened. The Great Controversy has been widely circulated here in this country, and (I am told) the readers think much of the book. And now Mrs. White is on the ground and the people will expect to hear her. If we make the effort it will cost about two hundred dollars. The rink can be secured. It will hold one thousand people. The halls where theatres are held are not considered proper places. We decided on this occasion to go forward in the name of the Lord and risk something.",
