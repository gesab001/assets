    "word": "The birds of the air are guided by instinct. They are obedient to the laws which govern their life. But the beings formed in the image of God fail to honor Him by obeying the laws of nature. By disregarding the laws which should govern the human organism, they disqualify themselves from serving God. God sends them warnings to beware of how they break His law in breaking the laws which govern their bodies; but habit is strong, and they will not heed.",
