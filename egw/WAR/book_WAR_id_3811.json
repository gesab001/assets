    "word": "Help in Every Emergency.--Every teacher of the truth, every laborer together with God, will pass through searching, trying hours, when faith and patience will be severely tested. You are to be prepared by the grace of Christ to go forward, although apparent impossibilities obstruct the way. You have a present help in every time of emergency. The Lord allows you to meet obstacles, that you may seek unto Him who is your strength and sufficiency. Pray most earnestly for the wisdom that comes from God; He will open the way before you, and give you precious victories if you will walk humbly before Him.--Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 7, p. 18.
