    "word": "We are laborers together with God; and not only are we to have respect unto the recompense of reward, but we are to labor zealously for the Redeemer's glory by bringing sheaves to the Master. Every soul saved will swell the triumphant anthems of praise which the redeemed will sing. In every fellow being we are to see the purchase of the blood of Christ. The Saviour's interest is identified with the interests of the souls He has ransomed by an infinite sacrifice.",
