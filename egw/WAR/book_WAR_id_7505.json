    "word": "Let not unbelief come in; for God's work is to go from city to city, from country to country. The plans of the enemies of God may be laid to defeat His work; but have faith that Jehovah will remove all obstructions to its progress. Talk faith, work in faith, and advance in faith. Obstacles will be removed as we lay hold of the promises of God. Let the Lord's people go forward, and their hearts will be made strong.",
