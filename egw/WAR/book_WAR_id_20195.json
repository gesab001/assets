    "word": "Superfluous tucks, ruffles, and ornaments of any kind should be avoided as contradictory to our profession of faith as followers of the meek and lowly Jesus.

We warn our Christian sisters against the tendency to make their dresses according to worldly styles, thus attracting attention. The house of God is profaned by the dress of professedly Christian women of today. A fantastic dress, a display of gold chains and gaudy laces, is a certain indication of a weak head and a proud heart.",
