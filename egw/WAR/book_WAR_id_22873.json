    "word": "It is the duty to rouse the soul to a sense of its privileges, and God expects corresponding returns in faithful service to Him. The soul is not to be always shrouded in clouds of doubts, but they are to make their calling and election sure. The Scripture makes the marks of true religion clear and decided if we will apply the close test Christ has given. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" The rewards of eternity, though purchased by Christ, shall be rigidly proportioned to their works. There must be no listlessness, no drifting with circumstances, with a feeling of security. There must be faith and hope and patience and longsuffering, gentleness, meekness, goodness, and mercy enlisted.--Letter 5, 1888. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. July 7, 1988. Entire Letter.",
