    "word": "\"My brethren, I entreat you not to let the work for the colored people be longer neglected. . . . Let our ministers say to the people, Our time in which to work is short. Make it possible to secure places from which the work for the colored people can be carried on. As the Lord's stewards, we are responsible for the welfare of the needy. . . . The needs of the work, and the motives that should prompt our gifts, should be presented to believers, and urgent calls made upon our churches.\"--Sept. 16, 1907.",
