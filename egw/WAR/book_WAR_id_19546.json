    "word": "Take a straightforward course, \"having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.\" \"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are called, that ye should inherit a blessing. For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good: let him seek peace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye, and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\" \n\n\n                    -31-",
