    "word": "The Lord lives and reigns.  Soon He will arise in majesty to shake terribly the earth. A special message is now to be borne, a message that will pierce the spiritual darkness and convict and convert souls. \"Haste thee, flee for thy life,\" is the call to be given to those who are dwelling in sin. We must now be terribly in earnest. We have not a moment to spend in criticism and accusation. Let those who have done this in the past fall on their knees in prayer, and let them beware how they put their words and their plans in the place of God's words and God's plans.--Testimony Vol. VIII, pp. 35, 36. \n                                                                           18",
