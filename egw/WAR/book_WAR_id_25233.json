    "word": "The Christian life is a warfare, not against believing brethren, but against the seducing spirit of the enemy, against the subtle, deceiving influence of the serpent, which creeps into our thoughts and minds. \"Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\" Make no provision for the flesh, to deceive, to falsify, to work just as Satan worked in Eden. He is watching his chance to develop if he can only have an opportunity. Give him no foothold. There is something we are charged to do: \"Resist the devil,\" and the promise is, \"he will flee from you.\" Why? Because the angel of God lifts up for you a standard against the enemy, and he flees.--Letter 327, 1905. \n\n                                               -",
