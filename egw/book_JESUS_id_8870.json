{"word": "\\93Give, and it shall be given unto you;\\94 for the word of God is \\93a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.\\94 The heart that has once tasted the love of Christ, cries out continually for a deeper draught, and as you impart, you will receive in richer and more abundant measure. Every revelation of God to the soul increases the capacity to know and to love. The continual cry of the heart is, \\93More of Thee,\\94 and ever the Spirit\\92s answer is, \\93Much more.\\94 For our God delights to do \\93exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.\\94 To Jesus, who emptied Himself for the salvation of lost humanity, the Holy Spirit was given without measure. So it will be given to every follower of Christ when the whole heart is surrendered for His indwelling. Our Lord Himself has given the command, \\93Be filled with the Spirit,\\94 and this command is also a promise of its fulfillment. It was the good pleasure of the Father that in Christ should \\93all the fullness dwell;\\94 and \\93in him ye are made full.\\94", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 19}
