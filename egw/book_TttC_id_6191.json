Christ, by precept and example, taught that the strictest integrity should govern our actions toward our fellow men. \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" Christ was continually portraying the defective lives of the Pharisees and reproving them. They professed to be keeping the law of God, yet in their daily acts were practicing iniquity. Many widows and orphans were robbed of their little all to gratify an avaricious desire for gain.",
