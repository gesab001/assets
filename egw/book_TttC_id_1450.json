    "word": "\"I DREAMED THAT I, WITH A NUMBER OF OTHERS, MEMBERS OF THE BATTLE CREEK CHURCH, WAS ON BOARD A TRAIN OF CARS. THE CARS WERE LOW--I COULD HARDLY STAND ERECT IN THEM. THEY WERE ILL-VENTILATED, HAVING AN ODOR AS THOUGH THEY HAD NOT BEEN VENTILATED FOR MONTHS. THE ROAD OVER WHICH THEY WERE PASSING WAS VERY ROUGH, AND THE CARS SHOOK ABOUT AT A FURIOUS RATE, SOMETIMES CAUSING OUR BAGGAGE TO FALL OFF, AND SOMETIMES THROWING OFF SOME OF THE PASSENGERS. WE HAD TO KEEP STOPPING TO GET ON OUR PASSENGERS AND BAGGAGE, OR REPAIR THE TRACK. WE SEEMED TO WORK SOME TIME AND TO MAKE LITTLE OR NO HEADWAY. WE WERE INDEED A SORRY-LOOKING SET OF TRAVELERS.",
