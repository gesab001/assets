{"word": "Sometimes community members can be successfully solicited to donate materials and labor to erect a house of worship.--Before this work was finished, the problem of providing a meeting-house at Cooranbong arose. This problem proved to be a perplexing one. It seemed that we had done about all we could, and that it would be impossible to raise means sufficient for erecting a suitable house of worship. Finally, during a council meeting in which the matter was receiving consideration, I offered to go through our settlement, and try to secure gifts of labor and material. Accompanied by my secretary, I visited the workmen living for miles around, and solicited help. Just at this time it happened that several of the carpenters who had been laboring on the school buildings, were temporarily out of employment; and these men generously responded, offering to work on the proposed meeting-house at a very low wage,--less than one half the usual rate. Several worked for nothing a portion of the time.--RH May 26, 1904.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 243}
