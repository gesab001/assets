{"word": "Some have no firmness of character. Their plans and purposes have no definite form and consistency. They are of but little practical use in the world. This weakness, indecision, and inefficiency should be overcome. There is in true Christian character an indomitableness that cannot be molded or subdued by adverse circumstances. We must have moral backbone, an integrity that cannot be flattered, bribed, or terrified.--Ministry of Healing, pp. 497, 498. (1905)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 480}
