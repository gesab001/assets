    "word": "To Brethren Entrusted With Responsibilities in the \n     Publishing Houses-- \n     I urge upon you the importance of attending our annual meetings, not merely the business meetings, but the meetings that will be for your spiritual enlightenment. You do not realize the necessity of having a close connection with heaven. Without this connection not one of you is safe; not one is qualified to do God's work acceptably.",
