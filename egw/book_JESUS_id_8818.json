{"word": "The saints will have crowns of glory upon their heads and harps of gold in their hands. They will play upon the golden harp and sing redeeming love, and make melody unto God. Their former trials and suffering in this world will be forgotten and lost amid the glories of the New Earth. And they will ever have the approving smiles of Jesus upon them, and their happiness will be complete. . . . The future abode of the saints will be all glorious. \n                                                                           358", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 357}
