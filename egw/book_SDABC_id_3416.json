    "word": "(Exodus 12:7, 12, 13; Ezekiel 9:4; 20:12, 20.) The Signature of God's Appointment.--The Israelites placed over their doors a signature of blood, to show that they were God's property. So the children of God in this age will bear the signature God has appointed. \n                                                                           969\nThey will place themselves in harmony with God's holy law. A mark is placed upon every one of God's people just as verily as a mark was placed over the doors of the Hebrew dwellings, to preserve the people from the general ruin. God declares, \"I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them\" (RH Feb. 6, 1900).",
