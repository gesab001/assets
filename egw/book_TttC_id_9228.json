    "word": "Deficiencies of Teachers \n\n     Many of our teachers have much to unlearn and much of a different character to learn. Unless they are willing to do this,--unless they become thoroughly familiar with the word of God and their minds are absorbed in studying the glorious truths concerning the life of the Great Teacher,--they will encourage the very errors the Lord is seeking to correct. Plans and opinions that should not be entertained will imprint themselves on the mind, and in all honesty they will come to wrong and dangerous conclusions. Thus seed will be sown that is not true grain. Many customs and practices common in school work, and which may be regarded as little things, cannot now be brought into our schools. It may be difficult for teachers to give up long-cherished ideas and methods; but if they will honestly and humbly inquire at every step, \"Is this the way of the Lord?\" and will yield to His guidance, He will lead them in safe paths, and their views will change by experience.",
