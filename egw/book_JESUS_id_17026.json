{"word": "The Lord God is bound by an eternal pledge to supply power and grace to every one who is sanctified through obedience to the truth. Jesus Christ, to whom is given all power in heaven and on earth, unites in sympathy with His instrumentalities--the earnest souls who day by day partake of the living bread \"which cometh down from heaven\" (John 6:33). The church on earth, united with the church in heaven, can accomplish all things.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 344}
