If these trusts are faithfully kept, great will be the reward of the faithful servant when the Master shall say: \"Give an account of thy stewardship.\" The earnest toil, the unselfish work, the patient, persevering effort, will be rewarded abundantly; Jesus will say: Henceforth I call you not servants, but friends, guests. The approval of the Master is not given because of the greatness of the work performed, because many things have been gained, but because of the fidelity in even a few things.

He prizes goodness and faithfulness more than the greatness of the work accomplished.",
