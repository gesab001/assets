{"word": "When souls are converted their salvation is not yet accomplished. They then have the race to run; the arduous struggle is before them to do, what? \"To fight the good fight of faith,\" to press forward to the mark for the prize of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus. There is no release in this warfare; the battle is lifelong, and must be carried forward with determined energy proportionate to the value of the object you are in pursuit of, which is eternal life. Immense interests are here involved. We are made partakers of Christ's self-sacrifice here in this life, and then we are assured that we shall be partakers of all its benefits in the future immortal life, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end. Think of this.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ML", "page": 313}
