{"word": "Choose Wise Men--For years the Lord has been instructing us to choose wise men,-men who are devoted to God,--men who know what the principles of heaven are,-men who have learned what it means to walk with God,--and to place upon them the responsibility of looking after the business affairs connected with our work.  This is in accordance with the Bible plan as outlined in the sixth chapter of Acts.  We need to study this plan; for it is approved of God.  Let us follow the Word.--Review and Herald, Oct. 5, 1905.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "ChL", "page": 53}
