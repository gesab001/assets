{"word": "At the time when Christ's work bore only the appearance of cruel defeat, when to the disciples the case seemed hopeless, certain Greeks came to the disciples, saying, \"We would see Jesus\" (John 12:21). This inquiry showed Christ, who was then standing in the shadow of the cross, that the sacrificial offering of Himself would bring all who believe into perfect harmony with God. By making this propitiation of man's sins, Christ's kingdom would be perfected and extended throughout the world. He would work as the Restorer. His Spirit would prevail everywhere.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 110}
