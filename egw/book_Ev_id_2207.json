{"word": "The Graces of Culture and Kindness \n\n     Our Great Example.--Christ carried out in His life His own divine teachings. His zeal never led Him to become passionate. He manifested consistency without obstinacy, benevolence without weakness, tenderness and sympathy without sentimentalism. He was highly social; yet He possessed a reserved dignity that did not encourage undue familiarity. His temperance never led to bigotry or austerity. He was not conformed to this world; yet He was not indifferent to the wants of the least among men. He was awake to the needs of all.--Manuscript 132, 1902.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 636}
