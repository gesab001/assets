{"word": "As soon as the discerning eye of John rested upon Jesus, his spirit was stirred with the deepest emotion. He knew that He was not like any other man that had received the ordinance at his hand. He had strong convictions that this was the Christ of whom Moses and the prophets had written. His heart went out to Christ with intense love and reverence that he had never felt before. The very atmosphere of His presence was holy and awe-inspiring. . . . His heart had never been stirred with such emotions as when in the presence of Christ. . . .", "paragraph": 6, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 33}
