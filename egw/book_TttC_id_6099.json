    "word": "By a lack of personal interest many things go to waste which a few moments' thoughtful attention at the right time would save. \"I forgot\" causes much loss to our offices. And some feel no interest in any work or in anything which does not come under their special branch of the work. This is all wrong. Selfishness would suggest the thought, \"It does not belong to me to care for that;\" but faithfulness and duty would prompt everyone to care for all that comes under his observation. \n                                                                           452\nThe example of the head workers in the bindery is followed by the hands employed; all become careless and reckless; and an amount is wasted equal to their wages. A caretaking person at the head of the work would save hundreds of dollars yearly to the office in that one department.",
