{"word": "Not to Dwell Upon Our Own Emotions.--It is not wise to look to ourselves and study our emotions. If we do this, the enemy will present difficulties and temptations that weaken faith and destroy courage. Closely to study our emotions and give way to our feelings is to entertain doubt and entangle ourselves in perplexity. We are to look away from self to Jesus.--MH 249 (1905).", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 760}
