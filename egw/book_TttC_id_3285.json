    "word": "Brother P has failed to see the vital importance of the question. He has not felt the burden pressing him to search diligently, independent of any man, to find out what is truth. He has thought too much of Elder P, and has not felt the necessity of learning of One who is meek and lowly of heart. He has not been teachable, but self-confident. Our Saviour has no words of commendation for those who are slow of heart to believe in these last days, any more than He had for doubting Thomas, who boasted that he would not believe upon the evidence which the disciples rehearsed, and which they credited, that Christ had indeed risen and appeared to them. Said Thomas: \"Except I shall see in His hands the print of the nails,\" \"and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.\" Christ granted Thomas the evidence that he had declared he must have; but He reprovingly said to him: \"Be not faithless, but believing.\" Thomas acknowledged himself convinced. Jesus said unto him: \"Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\"",
