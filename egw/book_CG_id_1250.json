{"word": "The Body Should Not Be Constricted.--The dress should fit easily, obstructing neither the circulation of the blood nor a free, full, natural respiration. The feet should be suitably protected from cold and damp. Clad in this way, we can take exercise in the open air, even in the dew of morning or evening, or after a fall of rain or snow, without fear of taking cold.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 425}
