{"word": "As legislator, Jesus exercised the authority of God; His commands and decisions were supported by the sovereignty of the eternal throne. The glory of the Father was revealed in the Son; Christ made manifest the character of the Father. He was so perfectly connected with God, so completely embraced in His encircling light, that he who had seen the Son had seen the Father. His voice was as the voice of God. . . . He says, \"I am in the Father, and the Father in me.\" \"No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\" \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father\" (John 14:11; Matthew 11:27; 14:9).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 38}
