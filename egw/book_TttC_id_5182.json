    "word": "Chap. 12 - Self-Exaltation\n\n     Dear Brother N: In my last vision your case was presented before me. I was shown that there are defects in your Christian character that must be overcome before you can perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord. You love the truth, \n                                                                           126\nbut you need to be sanctified by it. You are not selfish nor niggardly in hospitality or in sustaining the cause of truth; but there is one kind of selfishness which exists in your heart. You are wedded to your own opinion and extol your own judgment above that of others. You are in danger of exalting yourself above your brethren. You are exacting and are inclined to carry out your own ideas, independent of your brethren, because you consider your intelligence and experience superior to theirs. In this you fail to carry out the apostle's injunction: \"Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.\" You have your notions, your purposes, and your plans, and you imagine they can never be incorrect.",
