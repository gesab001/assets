{"word": "Chap. Thirty - Self-Reliance and Sense of Honor\n\n     Train Every Child to Be Self-reliant.--So far as possible, every child should be trained to self-reliance. By calling into exercise the various faculties, he will learn where he is strongest, and in what he is deficient. A wise instructor will give special attention to the development of the weaker traits, that the child may form a well-balanced, harmonious character.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 156}
