{"word": "The Sabbath-School\n     Some efforts have been made to interest children in the cause, but not enough. Our Sabbath-schools should be made more interesting. The public schools have of late years greatly improved their methods of teaching. Object lessons, pictures, and blackboards are used to make difficult lessons clear to the youthful mind. Just so may present truth be simplified, and made intensely interesting to the active minds of the children.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 324}
