{"word": "Freedom From Guilt Brings Freedom From Fear.-- Aaron as well as the people shrank away from Moses, and \"they were afraid to come nigh him.\" Seeing their confusion and terror, but ignorant of the cause, he urged them to come near. He held out to them the pledge of God's reconciliation and assured them of His restored favor. They perceived in his voice nothing but love and entreaty, and at last one ventured to approach him. Too awed to speak, he silently pointed to the countenance of Moses, and then toward heaven. The great leader understood his meaning. In their conscious guilt, feeling themselves still under the divine displeasure, they could not endure the heavenly light, which, had they been obedient to God, would have filled them with joy. There is fear in guilt. The soul that is free from sin will not wish to hide from the light of heaven.--PP 329, 330 (1890).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 478}
