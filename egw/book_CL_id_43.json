{"word": "Christian Qualities Better Gained in Retired Locations \n\n     There is not one family in a hundred who will be improved physically, mentally, or spiritually, by residing in the city. Faith, hope, love, happiness, can far better be gained in retired places, where there are fields and hills and trees. Take your children away from the sights and sounds of the city, away from the rattle and din of streetcars and teams, and their minds will become more healthy. It will be found easier to bring home to their hearts the truth of the Word of God.--Manuscript 76, 1905.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CL", "page": 13}
