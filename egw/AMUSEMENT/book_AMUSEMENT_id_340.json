{"word": "Satan's deceptive workings are constantly being carried on in every place. Those who truly love God will reveal their love for Him in every and under every circumstance. They will not condescend to engage in the foolish amusements and the entertainments of worldlings. They will not be persuaded to forget the Lord at any time. Christians may and should feel a holy indignation against the lightness and the folly of those who love not God. \"Consider thyself,\" and fall not into temptation by speaking idle, cheap, meaningless words. Speak words that reveal that you are a child of God, and that your heart is filled with His love.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 146}
