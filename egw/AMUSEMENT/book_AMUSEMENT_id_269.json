{"word": "What quality is this love? . . . A love for the soul that would part with selfish gratifications and practice stern self-denial in order to elevate, ennoble, and sanctify those with whom we associate. \"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.\" John 17:19. Do you love those with whom you associate well enough to forgo your desire for amusement and self-pleasing that you will not place these souls in the path of temptation, that you will not beckon them to pursue a course of fun and frolic which leads to the extinguishment of serious thoughts in regard to the salvation of their souls? Do you cultivate personal piety, . . . that your youthful friends may follow where you lead the way, upward and forward to obedience to God? . . . What is the quality of your love? Is it of a character to make your associates more Christlike? Will it have a tendency to bring solid timbers into their character building?", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 235}
