{"word": "Sinners talk of the amusements of the world and the pleasures of sin, but when death is staring them in the face, they say nothing in praise of the beautiful life of sin they have led. The terrible, dark future is before them and if they could only know that their names were written in heaven, what a weight would be lifted from their sin-burdened souls!  In every condition, under every circumstance, the Christian can say, \"The path of holiness is a good way.\"  However trying may be their position, they can say, \"The Lord is good; 'his mercy endureth forever'.\" Be of good courage, my sister. Trust wholly in God. He will sustain and comfort you in all your trials endured for His name's sake. . . . Good is the Lord and greatly to be praised.--Letter 9, 1873.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "DG", "page": 233}
