{"word": "Chap. Eighty-Three - The Lure of Pleasure\n\n     The Natural Heart Seeks Pleasure.--The natural mind leans toward pleasure and self-gratification. It is Satan's policy to manufacture an abundance of this. He seeks to fill the minds of men with a desire for worldly amusement, that they may have no time to ask themselves the question, How is it with my soul? The love of pleasure is infectious. Given up to this, the mind hurries from one point to another, ever seeking for some amusement.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AH", "page": 521}
