{"word": "This do-nothing system, I saw, had been the greatest curse to your wife and my husband. God gave employment to the first pair in Eden because He knew they would be happier when employed. From what has been shown me, this do-nothing system is a curse to soul and body. Light employment will not excite or tax the mind or strength any more than amusements.
