Students at school should have had their moral sensibilities aroused to see and feel that society has claims upon them, and that they should live in obedience to natural law, so that they can, by their existence and influence, by precept and example, be an advantage and blessing to society.

The first study of the young should be to know themselves and how to keep their bodies in health.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "FE", "page": 26}
