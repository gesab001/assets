{"word": "Some of the most popular amusements, such as football and boxing, have become schools of brutality. . . . Other athletic games, though not so brutalizing, are scarcely less objectionable because of the excess to which they are carried. They stimulate the love of pleasure and excitement, thus fostering a distaste for useful labor, a disposition to shun practical duties and responsibilities. . . . Thus the door is opened to dissipation and lawlessness, with their terrible results.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 238}
