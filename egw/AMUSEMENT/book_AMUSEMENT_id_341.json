{"word": "What said Christ to the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well? . . . \"The water that I shall give . . . shall be . . . a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" The water that Christ referred to was the revelation of His grace in His Word; His Spirit, His teaching, is as a satisfying fountain to every soul. Every other source to which they shall resort will prove unsatisfying. But the word of truth is as cool streams, represented as the waters of Lebanon, which are always satisfying. In Christ is fullness of joy forevermore. The desires and pleasures and amusements of the world are never satisfying nor healing to the soul. But Jesus says, \"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 184}
