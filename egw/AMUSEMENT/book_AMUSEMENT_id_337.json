{"word": "The Cities Are Hotbeds of Vice \n\n     The pursuit of pleasure and amusement centers in the cities. Many parents who choose a city home for their children, thinking to give them greater advantages, meet with disappointment, and too late repent their terrible mistake. The cities of today are fast becoming like Sodom and Gomorrah. The many holidays encourage idleness. The exciting sports--theater-going, horse-racing, gambling, liquor-drinking, and reveling--stimulate every passion to intense activity. The youth are swept away by the popular current.--COL 54 (1900).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 110}
