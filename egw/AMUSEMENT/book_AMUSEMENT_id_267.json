{"word": "The wise man says that wisdom's \"ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\" Proverbs 3:17. Many cherish the impression that devotion to God is detrimental to health and to cheerful happiness in the social relations of life. But those who walk in the path of wisdom and holiness find that \"godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.\" They are alive to the enjoyment of life's real pleasures, while they are not troubled with vain regrets over misspent hours, nor with gloom or horror of mind, as the worldling too often is when not diverted by some exciting amusement. . . . Godliness does not conflict with the laws of health, but is in harmony with them. Had men ever been obedient to the law of Ten Commandments, . . . the curse of disease that now floods the world would not be.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "FLB", "page": 229}
