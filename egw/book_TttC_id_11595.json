    "word": "Extract from a letter written in 1895 from Cooranbong, New South Wales.--God has a work for every believer who labors in the sanitarium. Every nurse is to be a channel of blessing, receiving light from above and letting it shine forth to others.  The workers are not to conform to fashionable display of those who come to the sanitarium for treatment, but are to consecrate themselves to God. The atmosphere that surrounds their souls is to be a savor of life unto life. Temptations will beset them on every side, but let them ask God for His presence and guidance. The Lord said to Moses: \"Certainly I will be with thee;\" and to every faithful, consecrated worker the same assurance is given. \n\n\n                                                         (145)",
