{"word": "It is coming in contact with difficulties that will give you spiritual muscle and sinew. You will become strong in Christ if you endure the testing process and the proving of God. . . . Remember when trials come that you are a spectacle to angels and to men, and that every time you fail to bear the proving of the Lord you are lessening your spiritual strength. You should hold your peace from complaining, and take your burden to Jesus, and lay your whole soul open before Him. Do not carry it to a third person. Do not lay your burden upon humanity. Say, \"I will not gratify the enemy by murmuring. I will lay my care at the feet of Jesus. I will tell it to Him in faith.\" If you do this you will receive help from above; you will realize the fulfillment of the promise, \"He is on my right hand that I should not be moved\" (see Psalm 16:8).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 282}
