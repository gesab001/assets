Eighty-One - Co-Ordination of Home and Church\n\n     Begin the Work of Grace in the Home.--Parents, begin the work of grace in the church in your own home, so conducting yourselves that your children will see that you are co-operating with the heavenly angels. Be sure that you are converted every day. Train yourselves and your children for life eternal in the kingdom of God. Angels will be your strong helpers. Satan will tempt you, but do not yield.
