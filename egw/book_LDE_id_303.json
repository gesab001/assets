There is no use in telling you that you must not wear this or that, for if the love of these vain things is in your heart your laying off your adornments will only be like cutting the foliage off a tree. The inclinations of the natural heart would again assert themselves. You must have a conscience of your own.--CG 429, 430 (1892).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LDE", "page": 88}
