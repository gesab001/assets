    "word": "In like manner, when God was about to open to the beloved John the history of the church for future ages, He gave him an assurance of the Saviour's interest and care for His people by revealing to him \"One like unto the Son of man,\" walking among the candlesticks, which symbolized the seven churches. While John was shown the last great struggles of the church with earthly powers, he was also permitted to behold the final victory and deliverance of the faithful. He saw the church brought into deadly conflict with the beast and his image, and the worship of that beast enforced on pain of death. But looking beyond the smoke and din of the battle, he beheld a company upon Mount Zion with the Lamb, having, instead of the mark of the beast, the \"Father's name written in their foreheads.\" And again he saw \"them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and \n                                                                           753\nover his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God\" and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb.",
