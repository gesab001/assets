His language is: \"What could have been done more to My vineyard, that I have not done in it?\" But this vine of God's planting has inclined to the earth and entwined its tendrils about human supports. Its branches are extended far and wide, but it bears the fruit of a degenerate vine. The Master of the vineyard declares: \"When I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?\"",
