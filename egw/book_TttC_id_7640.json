    "word": "God is love. He has a care for the creatures He has formed. \"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them \n                                                                           316\nthat fear Him.\" Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" What a precious privilege is this, that we may be sons and daughters of the Most High, heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. Then let us not mourn and grieve because in this life we are not free from disappointments and afflictions. If in the providence of God we are called upon to endure trials, let us accept the cross and drink the bitter cup, remembering that it is a Father's hand that holds it to our lips. Let us trust Him in the darkness as well as in the day. Can we not believe that He will give us everything that is for our good? \"He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\" Even in the night of affliction how can we refuse to lift heart and voice in grateful praise, when we remember the love to us expressed by the cross of Calvary?",
