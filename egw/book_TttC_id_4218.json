Paul commanded Titus: \"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.\" There are ever those who will despise the one who dares to reprove sin; but there are times when reproof must be given. Paul directs Titus to rebuke a certain class sharply, that they may be sound in the faith. Men and women who, with their different organizations, are brought together in church capacity have peculiarities and faults. As these are developed, they will require reproof. If those who are placed in important positions never reproved, never rebuked, there would soon be a demoralized condition of things that would greatly dishonor God. But how shall the reproof be given? Let the apostle answer: \"With all long-suffering and doctrine.\" Principle should be brought to bear upon the one who needs reproof, but never should the wrongs of God's people be passed by indifferently.",
