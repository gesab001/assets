    "word": "Chap. 45 - Comfort in Affliction\n\n     Dear Sister T: I have learned of your affliction, and hasten to pen a few lines. My dear sister, I have the very best of evidence that the Lord loves you. In the last view given me, I was shown your case among others. I saw that you had been affected in the past with the course of error which others had pursued; but while strictly conscientious, and ever anxious to know the right, you were extremely sensitive and viewed your case as worse than it was.",
