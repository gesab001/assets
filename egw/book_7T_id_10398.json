    "word": "In this work it is best to make small beginnings in many places and allow God's providence to indicate how rapidly facilities should be increased.

The establishment of these institutions will result in much good if all connected with them will suppress selfish ambition and keep ever in view the glory of God. Many of our people should be laboring in new fields, but let none seek notoriety. The minds of the laborers must be sanctified.",
