{"word": "What a comforting thought that Jesus is touched with the feelings of our infirmities! He has been tempted in all points as we are tempted, and just the right kind of help has been provided for us, that if we only put our feet in the prints of Jesus' footsteps, we will be safe. He has hallowed the path His feet have trod. We hear His inviting voice, \"Follow Me. I am the Light of the world. They that follow Me shall not walk in darkness. In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world\" (see Matthew 4:19; 8:12; John 16:33).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "UL", "page": 162}
