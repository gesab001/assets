{"word": "Work for those suffering as a result of their own course of action should not hinder the work of foreign missions.--Men's feelings may become greatly moved as they see human beings suffering as the result of their own course of action. There are those who are specially impressed to come into direct contact with this class, and the Lord gives them a commission to work in the worst places of the earth, doing what they can to redeem outcasts and bring them where they will be under the care of the churches. But the Lord has not called Seventh-day Adventists to make this work a specialty. He would not have them in this work engross many workers or exhaust the treasury by erecting institutions for the care of outcasts, thus hindering the work of foreign missions. God calls for one hundred missionaries where there is now one. These are to go forth to foreign countries.--14MR 164.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 32}
