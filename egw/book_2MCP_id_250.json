{"word": "We see monomaniacs all over the country. They are frequently sane upon every subject but one. The reason of this is that one organ [part] of the mind was specially exercised while the others were permitted to lie dormant. The one that was in constant use became worn and diseased, and the man became a wreck. God was not glorified by his pursuing this course. Had he exercised all the organs equally, all would have had a healthy development; all the labor would not have been thrown upon one, therefore no one would have broken down.--3T 33, 34 (1872).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 442}
