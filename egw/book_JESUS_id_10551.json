{"word": "Chap. 6 - Cautions for Aging Persons\n\n     Age No Excuse for Relaxing Self-Discipline \n\n     I have heard those who have been in the faith for years, say that they used to be able to endure trial and difficulty, but since the infirmities of age began to press upon them, they had been greatly distressed when brought under discipline.  What does this mean?  Does it mean that Jesus has ceased to be your Saviour?  Does it mean that when you are old and gray-headed, you are privileged to display unholy passion?  Think of this.  You should use your reasoning powers in this matter, as you do in temporal things.  You should deny self, and make your service to God the first business of your life.  You must not permit anything to disturb your peace.  There is no need of it; there must be a constant growth, a constant progress in the divine life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "RY", "page": 67}
