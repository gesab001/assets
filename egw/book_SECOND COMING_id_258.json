{"word": "No human language can portray the scenes of the second coming of the Son of Man in the clouds of heaven. . . . He will come clad in the robe of light, which He has worn from the days of eternity. Angels will accompany Him. Ten thousand times ten thousand will escort Him on His way. The sound of the trumpet will be heard, calling the sleeping dead from the grave. The voice of Christ will penetrate the tomb, and pierce the ears of the dead, \"and all that are in the graves . . . shall come forth.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SD", "page": 357}
