{"word": "David was deeply moved; he was distressed as he looked forward to the time when he should be aged. He feared that God would leave him and that he would be as unhappy as other aged persons whose course he had noticed, and would be left to the reproach of the enemies of the Lord. With this burden upon him he earnestly prays, \"Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.\" \"O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth; and hitherto have I declared Thy wondrous works. Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have showed Thy strength unto this generation, and Thy power to everyone that is to come\" (Psalm 71:9, 17, 18). David felt the necessity of \n\n750 \n\nguarding against the evils which attend old age.--1T 423 (1864).", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 749}
