{"word": "There is constant need of patience, gentleness, self-denial, and self-sacrifice in the exercise of Bible religion. But if the word of God is made an abiding principle in our lives, everything with which we have to do, each word, each trivial act, will reveal that we are subject to Jesus Christ. . . .

Our lives will be a power for good, because the Holy Spirit will fill our minds with the things of God. . . .", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "AG", "page": 248}
