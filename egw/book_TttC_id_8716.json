    "word": "Work, brethren, work while you have the opportunity, while the day lasts. Work, for \"the night cometh, when no man can work.\" How soon that night may come, it is impossible for you to tell. Now is your opportunity; improve it. If there are some who cannot give personal effort in missionary work, let them live economically and give of their earnings. Thus they can contribute money to send papers \n                                                                           733\nand books to those who have not the light of truth; they can help pay the expenses of students who are fitting for missionary work. Let every dollar that you can spare be invested in the bank of heaven.",
