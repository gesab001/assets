    "word": "When Brother F is humble and makes God his trust, he can do much good. Angels come to his help, and he is blessed with clearness and freedom. But after a time of special victory he has too often been lifted up and thought himself equal to anything, thought that he was something, when he was only an instrument in the hands of God. After such seasons angels of God have left him to his own weak strength, and then, though he himself was the one at fault, he would too frequently charge upon his brethren and the people the darkness and weakness he felt. While in this unhappy state of mind he frequently bears down upon this one and that one, and, even when his work is not half done, feels that he must remove and commence labor elsewhere.",
