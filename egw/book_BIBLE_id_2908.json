{"word": "Those who have accepted Bible truth are to keep the truth circumspectly. They are to follow on to know the Lord, gathering into their souls the light of heaven. But they must not stop there. They are to communicate the light and knowledge received. The Lord expects parents to make earnest, united efforts in the training of their children for Him. In the home they are to cultivate the graces of the Spirit, in all their ways acknowledging Him who through the sanctification of the Spirit has promised to make us perfect in every good work. When parents awaken to a true understanding of their neglected duties, they will marvel at the \n53\nspiritual blindness that has characterized their past experience. And when they become learners of Christ, they will be taught how to do their work acceptably. . . .", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PCP", "page": 52}
