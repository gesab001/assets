{"word": "Christ became one with humanity that humanity might become one in spirit and life with Him. By virtue of this union in obedience to the Word of God, His life becomes their life. He says to the penitent, \"I am the resurrection, and the life\" (John 11:25). Death is looked upon by Christ as sleep--silence, darkness, sleep. He speaks of it as if it were of little moment. \"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me,\" He says, \"shall never die\" (verse 26). . . . \"He shall never see death\" (John 8:51). And to the believing one, death is but a small matter. With him to die is but to sleep. \"Them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him\" (1 Thessalonians 4:14).", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "TMK", "page": 71}
