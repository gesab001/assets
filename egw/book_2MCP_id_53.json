{"word": "The Digestive Organs Affect Life's Happiness.--The digestive organs have an important part to act in our life happiness. God has given us intelligence that we may learn what we should use as food. Shall we not, as sensible men and women, study whether the things we eat will be in agreement or whether they will cause trouble? People who have a sour stomach are very often of a sour disposition. Everything seems to be contrary to them, and they are inclined to be peevish and irritable. If we would have peace among ourselves, we should give more thought than we do to having a peaceful stomach.--MS 41, 1908. (CD 112.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 387}
