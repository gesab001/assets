{"word": "Jesus, the Majesty of Heaven, humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; \"wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.\" This mighty Saviour has promised to come again, and to take his church to the mansions he has prepared for them. While he is in Heaven carrying on the work of intercession and atonement commenced on earth, his life and character are to be exemplified by his church upon earth. He has promised that, \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father.\" And again, \"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name.\" \"Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "3SP", "page": 261}
