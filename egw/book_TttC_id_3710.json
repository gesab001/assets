    "word": "Because time is short, we should work with diligence and double energy. Our children may never enter college, but they can obtain an education in those essential branches which they can turn to a practical use and which will give culture to the mind and bring its powers into use.

They may have the name of having a collegiate education, but in reality they are only educated dunces.",
