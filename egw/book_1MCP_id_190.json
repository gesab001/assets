{"word": "Children Who Are Pressed Too Hard Too Early.--In the schoolroom the foundation has been too surely laid for diseases of various kinds. But, more especially, the most delicate of all organs, the brain, has often been permanently injured by too great exercise. . . . And the lives of many have been thus sacrificed by ambitious mothers. Of those children who have apparently had sufficient force \n\n62 \n\nof constitution to survive this treatment, there are very many who carry the effects of it through life. The nervous energy of the brain becomes so weakened, that after they come to maturity, it is impossible for them to endure much mental exercise. The force of some of the delicate organs of the brain seems to be expended. And not only has the physical and mental health of children been endangered by being sent to school at too early a period, but they have been the losers in a moral point of view.--HL 43, 44, 1865.
