{"word": "Teach Children How to Meet Temptation \n\n                    [C.T.B.H. 63, 64] (1890) F.E. 152, 153 \n     365. Set a guard over the appetite; teach your children by example as well as by precept to use a simple diet. Teach them to be industrious, not merely busy, but engaged in useful labor. Seek to arouse the moral sensibilities. Teach them that God has claims upon them, even from the early years of their childhood. Tell them that there are moral corruptions to be met on every hand, that they need to come to Jesus and give themselves to Him, body and spirit, and that in Him they will find strength to resist every temptation. Keep before their minds that they were not created merely to please themselves, but to be the Lord's agent for noble purposes. Teach them, when temptations urge into paths of selfish indulgences, when Satan is seeking to shut out God from their sight, to look to Jesus, pleading, \"Save, Lord, that I be not overcome.\" Angels will gather about them in answer to their prayer, and lead them into safe paths.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CD", "page": 246}
