{"word": "Jesus feels every pang of sorrow felt by those who are consecrated to His service, and who, under great difficulties, are doing His work. Let us dwell upon the love of Jesus, that we may have courage and faith. The Lord lives and reigns. There will be unwise advisers who will try to confuse us, but let us look to Jesus, and trust in Him at all times. He has been our Helper, and He will continue to be our Helper. . . . I am sometimes greatly perplexed to know what to do, but I will not be depressed. I am determined to bring all the sunshine into my life that I possibly can.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 191}
