{"word": "Jesus is our pattern. If He would lay aside His humiliation and sufferings, and cry, \"If any man will come after Me, let him please himself, and enjoy the world, and he shall be My disciple,\" the multitude would believe and follow Him. But Jesus will come to us in no other character than that of the meek, crucified One. If we would be with Him in heaven, we must be like Him on earth. The world will claim its own; and whoever will overcome must leave what belongs to it.--Life Sketches, pp. 113, 114.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "RC", "page": 265}
