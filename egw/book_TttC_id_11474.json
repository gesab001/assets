    "word": "I address those who in accepting positions of trust in the publishing house have taken upon themselves the responsibility of seeing that the workers receive the right education. Seek to realize the importance of your work.

These judgments may be delayed, but they will come. If, because your own minds are not clear and elevated, you give the wrong bias to other minds, God will call you to account. He will ask: \"Why did you do the devil's work when you were supposed to be doing a good work for the Master?\"",
