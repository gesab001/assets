{"word": "Every act, every deed of justice and mercy and benevolence, makes music in heaven. The Father from His throne beholds and numbers the performer of them with His most precious treasures. \"And they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, when I make up My jewels.\" Every merciful act to the needy or the suffering is as though done to Jesus. Whoever succors the poor, or sympathizes with the afflicted and oppressed, and befriends the orphan, brings himself into a more close relationship to Jesus.--Review and Herald, Aug. 16, 1881.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ChS", "page": 268}
