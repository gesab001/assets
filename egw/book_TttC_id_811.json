    "word": "If you had been a prompt, thorough laborer, keeping pace with God's opening providence, the fruit now manifested would be of an altogether different character. Souls would be decided somewhere, either wholly for or against the commandments of God and other truths connected with the third angel's message. They would not be hanging on the skirts of Zion to weigh down those who would be right. But there has not been faithfulness manifested by you. Straight and thorough work has not been made. You have not encouraged in the church, by a pointed application of truth, the necessity of everyone practically, harmoniously carrying out his profession; and many are not as willing to exert themselves to do something to advance the truth, as they are to be gratified with listening to the truth. They love the cause in word and profession, but not in deed and in truth.",
