{"word": "Good Respiration Soothes the Nerves.--In order to have good blood, we must breathe well. Full, deep inspirations of pure air, which fill the lungs with oxygen, purify the blood. They impart to it a bright color and send it, a life-giving current, to every part of the body. A good respiration soothes the nerves; it stimulates the appetite and renders digestion more perfect; and it induces sound, refreshing sleep.--MH 272 (1905).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 484}
