{"word": "Will You Cooperate With God? \n\n     There is a blindness upon human minds that is willful. Jesus said, \"This people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them\" (Matthew 13:15). The work of God for the salvation \n                                                                           136\nof men is the one work of supreme importance to be carried forward in our world; but many do not see this, because their interest is more with the ranks of the enemy than with the loyal soldiers of Christ. They do not see the necessity of the cooperation of the human with the divine agency. The Lord has bidden us: \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure\" (Philippians 2:12, 13). This is the plan which God has revealed to us to guide us in all the plans and purposes of life. But while men pray, \"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\" (Matthew 6:10), many reject the very means by which God would establish His kingdom.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "2SM", "page": 135}
