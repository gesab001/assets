    "word": "\"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end; while it is said,\n\n          Today if ye will hear His voice, \n          Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. \n\nFor some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.\" Hebrews 3:12-16.",
