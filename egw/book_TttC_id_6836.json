    "word": "Nothing is more essential to communion with God than the most profound humility. \"I dwell,\" says the High and Holy One, \"with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.\" While you are so eagerly striving to be first, remember that you will be last in the favor of God if you fail to cherish a meek and lowly spirit. Pride of heart will cause many to fail where they might have made a success. \"Before honor is humility,\" and \"the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.\" \"When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.\" \"Many are called, but few are chosen.\" Many hear the invitation of mercy, are tested and proved; but few are sealed with the seal of the living God. Few will humble themselves as a little child, that they may enter the kingdom of heaven.",
