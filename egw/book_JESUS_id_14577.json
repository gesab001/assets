{"word": "If the brethren and sisters were in the place they should be, they would not be at a loss to find something to say in honor of Jesus, who hung upon Calvary's cross for their sins. If they would cherish more of a realizing sense of the condescension of God in giving his only beloved Son to die, a sacrifice for our sins and transgressions, and the sufferings and anguish of Jesus to make a way of escape for guilty man, that he might receive pardon and live, they would be more ready to extol and magnify Jesus. They could not hold their peace; but with thankfulness and gratitude, would talk of his glory, and tell of his power. And blessings from God would rest upon them by so doing. Even if the same story was repeated, God would be glorified.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "ExV54", "page": 36}
