{"word": "Controversy Leads to Combativeness.--The special, deceptive work of Satan has been to provoke controversies, that there might be strivings about words to no profit. He well knows that this will occupy the mind and the time. It raises the combativeness and quenches the spirit of conviction in the minds of many, drawing them into diversity of opinions, accusation, and prejudice, which closes the door to the truth.--RH, Sept 11, 1888. (Ev 155).", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 498}
