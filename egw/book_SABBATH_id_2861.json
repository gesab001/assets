{"word": "How God bore with the Jewish nation while they were murmuring and rebellious, breaking the Sabbath and every other precept of the law! He repeatedly declared them worse than the heathen. Each generation surpassed the preceding in guilt. The Lord permitted them to go into captivity, but after their deliverance His requirements were forgotten. Everything that He committed to that people to be kept sacred was perverted or displaced by the inventions of rebellious men. Christ said to them in His day, \"Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?\" And these were the men who set themselves up as judges and censors over those whom the Holy Spirit was moving to \n                                                                           76\ndeclare the word of God to the people.
