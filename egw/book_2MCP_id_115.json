You are to do a work that will not produce friction in your mind. You are to keep your conscience in the fear of God, according to the Bible standard, and you are to make steady improvement, that you may not be in any way unfitted for the work God has given you to do.--Lt 92, 1903.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 403}
