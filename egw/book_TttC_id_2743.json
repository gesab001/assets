    "word": "From the light which the Lord has given me, our sisters should pursue a very different course. They should be more reserved, manifest less boldness, and encourage in themselves \"shamefacedness and sobriety.\" Both brethren and sisters indulge in too much jovial talk when in each other's society.

They do not strengthen the soul in God, but bring great darkness; they drive away the pure, refined, heavenly angels and bring those who engage in these wrongs down to a low level. \n                                                                           456",
