{"word": "It weakens those who know the truth for our ministers to expend on them the time and talent that should be given to the unconverted. In many of our churches in the cities the minister preaches Sabbath after Sabbath, and Sabbath after Sabbath the church members come to the house of God with no words to tell of blessings received because of blessings imparted. They have not worked during the week to carry out the instruction given them on the Sabbath. So long as church members \n                                                                           19\nmake no effort to give to others the help given them, great spiritual feebleness must result.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "7T", "page": 18}
