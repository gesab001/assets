    "word": "Let me tell you that children are born to evil. Satan seems to have control of them. He takes possession of their young minds, and they are corrupted. Why do fathers and mothers act as though a lethargy were upon them? They do not mistrust that Satan is sowing evil seed in their families. They are as blind and careless and reckless in regard to these things as it is possible for them to be. Why do they not awake, and read and study upon these subjects? Says the apostle: \"Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience,\" etc. Here is a work which rests upon every one who professes to follow Christ; it is to live upon the plan of addition.",
