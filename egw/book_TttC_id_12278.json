    "word": "Wherever Christ went, He scattered blessings in His path. How many who claim to believe on Him have learned His lessons of kindness, of tender pity, of unselfish love? Hear His voice speaking to the weak, the weary, the helpless: \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" Matthew 11:28. There was no wearying of His patience, no repressing of His love.",
