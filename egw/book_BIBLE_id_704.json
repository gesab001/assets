{"word": "Chap. 51 - The Holy Spirit In Our Schools\n\n\n\"Though gavest also Thy good\nSpirit to instruct them.\"\n\nThe Teacher's Need Of The Holy\nSpirit's Aid\n\n     The Holy Spirit has been given us as an aid in the study of the Bible. Jesus promised, \"The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\" John 14:26. When the Bible is made the study book, with earnest supplication for the Spirit's guidance, and with a full surrender of the heart to be sanctified through the truth, all that Christ has promised will be accomplished. The result of such Bible study will be well-balanced minds. The understanding will be quickened, the sensibilities aroused. The conscience will become sensitive; the sympathies and sentiments will be purified; a better moral atmosphere will be created; and new power to resist temptation will be imparted. Teachers and students will become active and earnest in the work of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CT", "page": 357}
