{"word": "Personal piety will qualify any worker, for the Holy Spirit takes possession of him, and the truth for this time becomes a power, because his everyday thoughts and all his activities are running in Christ's lines. He has an abiding Christ; and the humblest soul, linked with Christ Jesus, is a power, and his work will abide. May the Lord help us to understand His divine will, and do it heartily, unflinchingly, and there will be joy in the Lord.--Home Missionary, Nov. 1, 1897.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "YRP", "page": 182}
