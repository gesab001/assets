{"word": "Age Difference a Factor.--Another cause of the deficiency of the present generation in physical strength and moral worth is men and women uniting in marriage whose ages widely differ. . . . The offspring of such unions in many cases, where ages widely differ, have not well-balanced minds. They have been deficient also in physical strength.
