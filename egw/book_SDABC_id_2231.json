    "word": "Wicked Will Feel Agony of Cross.--Those who reject the mercy so freely proffered, will yet be made to know the worth of that which they have despised. They will feel the agony which Christ endured upon the cross to purchase redemption for all who would receive it. And they will then realize what they have lost--eternal life and the immortal inheritance (RH Sept. 4, 1883).",
