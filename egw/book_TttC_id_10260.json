    "word": "Work for Church Members \n\n     We have a message from the Lord to bear to the world, a message that is to be borne in the rich fullness of the Spirit's power. Let our ministers see the need of seeking to save the lost. Direct appeals are to be made to the unconverted. \"Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\" the Pharisees asked Christ's disciples. And the Saviour responded: \"I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\" Matthew 9:11, 13. This is the work He has given us. And never was there greater need of it than at the present time.",
