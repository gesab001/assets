{"word": "Many attend religious meetings, receive instruction from the servants of God, and are greatly refreshed and blessed; and yet, because they do not feel the necessity of praying and watching thereunto on the homeward journey, they return to their homes no better than when they left them. As they realize their loss, they frequently feel inclined to complain of others, or to murmur against God, but do not reproach themselves as the cause of their own darkness and sufferings of mind. These should not reflect upon others. The fault is in themselves; they talked, jested, and visited until they grieved away the heavenly Guest, and they have only themselves to blame. It is the privilege of all to retain Jesus with them. If they do this, their words must be select, seasoned with grace, and the thoughts of their hearts must be disciplined to dwell upon heavenly things.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "HS", "page": 146}
