{"word": "PRAYER SUSTAINED JESUS\\92 SPIRITUAL LIFE.\\97It was not on the cross only that Christ sacrificed Himself for humanity. As He \\93went about doing good\\94 (Acts 10:38), every day\\92s experience was an outpouring of His life. In one way only could such a life be sustained. Jesus lived in dependence upon God and communion with Him. To the secret place of the Most High, under the shadow of the Almighty, men now and then repair; they abide for a season, and the result is manifest in noble deeds; then their faith fails, the communion is interrupted, and the lifework marred. But the life of Jesus was a life of constant trust, sustained by continual communion; and His service for heaven and earth was without failure or faltering.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Pr", "page": 172}
