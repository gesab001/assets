{"word": "29: Communion\n \n\n     The Lord's Supper was the point of transition between two great festivals.--The symbols of the Lord's house are simple and plainly understood, and the truths represented by them are of the deepest significance to us. In instituting the sacramental service to take the place of the Passover, Christ left for His church a memorial of His great sacrifice for man. \"This do,\" He said, \"in remembrance of Me.\" This was the point of transition between two economies and their two great festivals. The one was to close forever; the other, which He had just established, was to take its place, and to continue through all time as the memorial of His death.--RH May 31, 1898.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PaM", "page": 169}
