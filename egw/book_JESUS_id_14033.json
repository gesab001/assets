We must receive nourishment from the living vine. Deprived of the strength and nourishment of the vine, we are as members of the body without a head, and are in the very position Satan wishes us to be in, that he may control these members as pleases himself. He works \"with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie.\" Spiritualism is a lie. It is founded upon the great original lie, \"Thou shalt not surely die.\" Thousands cut off the Head, and the members act without Jesus for their head, and the result is, another guides the body. Satan controls them.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "4bSG", "page": 90}
