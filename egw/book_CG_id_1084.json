{"word": "Chap. Sixty-Two - Eating to Live\n\n     God Appointed the Inclinations and Appetites.-- Our natural inclinations and appetites . . . were divinely appointed, and when given to man, were pure and holy. It was God's design that reason should rule the appetites, and that they should minister to our happiness. And when they are regulated and controlled by a sanctified reason, they are holiness unto the Lord.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "CG", "page": 378}
