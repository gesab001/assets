    "word": "How munificent was the Gift that God gave to the human race. He \"so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). The Lord Jesus gave His life for the world, that man might have a perfect example. Laying off His royal robe and kingly crown, He came to earth as a man. He was tempted in all points as man is tempted, but not once did He fail to follow the path He had chosen. He was kept by the power of God, upheld by the One who will be the helper of all who love Him and keep His commandments.",
