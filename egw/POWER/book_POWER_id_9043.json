    "word": "When this time of trouble comes, every case is decided; there is no longer probation, no longer mercy for the impenitent. The seal of the living God is upon His people.

The decree has been passed by the highest earthly authority that they shall worship the beast and receive his mark under pain of persecution and death.",
