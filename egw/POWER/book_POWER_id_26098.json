    "word": "The Lord is now proving every man's fidelity. Some will surrender soul, body, and spirit to the Lord. The church is made up of large and small vessels, and a large revenue is brought to the Lord from the goods He has lent. But God alone can judge the capabilities of His servants. He alone has the power to discern the time and the talents employed for Him. If those entrusted with few talents are faithful in their work, they receive just as large a reward as the one to whom a larger number of talents was entrusted.",
