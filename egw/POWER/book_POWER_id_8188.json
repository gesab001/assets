    "word": "\u201cAS A SPEAKER, MRS. WHITE IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE FEW LADIES WHO HAVE BECOME NOTE-WORTHY AS LECTURERS IN THIS COUNTRY DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. CONSTANT USE HAS SO STRENGTHENED HER VOCAL ORGANS AS TO GIVE HER VOICE RARE DEPTH AND POWER. HER CLEARNESS AND STRENGTH OF ARTICULATION ARE SO GREAT, THAT, WHEN SPEAKING IN THE OPEN AIR, SHE HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN DISTINCTLY HEARD AT THE DISTANCE OF A MILE. HER LANGUAGE, THOUGH SIMPLE, IS ALWAYS FORCIBLE. WHEN INSPIRED WITH HER SUBJECT, SHE IS OFTEN MARVELOUSLY ELOQUENT, HOLDING THE LARGEST AUDIENCES SPELL-BOUND FOR HOURS WITHOUT A SIGN OF IMPATIENCE OR WEARINESS. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF HER DISCOURSES IS ALWAYS OF A PRACTICAL CHARACTER, BEARING CHIEFLY ON FIRESIDE DUTIES THE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION OF CHILDREN, TEMPERANCE, AND KINDRED TOPICS. ON REVIVAL OCCASIONS SHE IS ALWAYS THE MOST EFFECTIVE SPEAKER. SHE HAS FREQUENTLY SPOKEN TO IMMENSE AUDIENCES IN THE LARGE CITIES ON HER FAVORITE THEMES, AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN RECEIVED WITH GREAT FAVOR. ON ONE OCCASION, IN MASSACHUSETTS, TWENTY THOUSAND PERSONS LISTENED TO HER WITH CLOSE ATTENTION FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR.\u201d",
