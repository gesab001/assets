    "word": "\u201cWhen we were brought before the governor for examination, he demanded by what authority we were sent to preach. We referred him to Joel 2, and Revelation 14:6-8, and told him further that the Spirit of God came upon us with such power that we could not resist it. After a number of questions he angrily said, \u2018I will cure you of your foolishness.\u2019 He then lashed us till his strength failed, when he threw the scourge to his private secretary, and ordered him to continue the lashing. After being severely punished in this way, we were returned to our cell. The same treatment was repeated the next day. The governor ended by saying, \u2018If you do not cease your preaching, I will shut you up where neither sun nor moon can ever shine upon you.\u2019",
