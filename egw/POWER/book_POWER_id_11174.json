    "word": "As our pattern we have One who is all and in all, the chiefest among ten thousand, One whose excellency is beyond comparison. What saith the Divine Teacher?-- \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" Matthew 5:48. Would Christ tantalize us by requiring of us an impossibility?--Never, never! What an honor He confers upon us, in urging us to be holy in our sphere, as the Father is holy in His sphere. And through His power we are able to do this; for He declares, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\" Matthew 28:18. This unlimited power it is your privilege and mine to claim.",
