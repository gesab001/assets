    "word": "Our work is to be carefully studied, and is to be in accordance with our Saviour's plan. He might have had armies of angels to display His true, princely character, but He laid all that aside, and came to our world in the garb of humanity, to suffer with humanity all the temptations wherewith man is tempted. He was tempted in all points as human beings are tempted, that He might reveal that it is possible for us to be victorious overcomers--one with Christ as Christ is one with the Father. \"He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:11, 12).",
