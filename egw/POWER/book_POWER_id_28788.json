    "word": "\"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted.\" They doubted that He had risen from the dead, in spite of the most powerful (272) facts in proof of it. The Jews did not deny the resurrection of Christ for want of evidence to prove it, nor did they hire soldiers to tell a lie because they believed the falsehood or could substantiate it. They did it to keep the people from knowing the truth. False teachers are always afraid to have the truth come before the people. This knowledge they wish to hide, to keep the people from becoming acquainted with the facts. They desire preeminence, and the truth would spoil their history and their character.",
