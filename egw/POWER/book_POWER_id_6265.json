    "word": "The history of the early church testified to the fulfillment of the Saviour's words. The powers of earth and hell arrayed themselves against Christ in the person of his followers. Paganism foresaw that should the gospel triumph, her temples and altars would be swept away; therefore she summoned her forces to destroy Christianity. The fires of persecution were kindled. Christians were stripped of their possessions, and driven from their homes. They \u201cendured a great fight of afflictions.\u201d [Hebrews 10:32.] They \u201chad trial of cruel mockings \n40\nand scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment.\u201d [Hebrews 11:36, 37, 38.] Great numbers sealed their testimony with their blood. Noble and slave, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, were alike slain without mercy.",
