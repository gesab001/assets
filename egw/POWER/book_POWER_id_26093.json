    "word": "The word of the Lord to you is, Who has made man? Did you, who treat him as your machine, give him flesh and blood, nerve and muscle? Did you create the mind, the intellect, with which he is to serve Me in My appointed way? Who entrusted man with talents, that he might make the best use of them, and return them to God? I, the Lord, have created man. I, the Lord, gave him reasoning powers. I, the Lord, redeemed him with the blood of My only begotten Son. By creation and by redemption he is Mine. I will demand of him the talents which I loaned him to do My service.",
