    "word": "While we will not violate the Sabbath, which a despotic power will seek to compel us to do, we will be wise in Christ\u2014Christ\u2019s wisdom\u2014and not in our own spirit. A consistent, substantial, lovable Christian is a powerful argument for the truth. We must say no words that will do ourselves harm, for this would be bad enough, but when we speak words, and when we do presumptuous things that imperil the cause of God, we are doing a cruel work, for we give Satan advantage. We are not to be rash and impetuous, but always learning of Jesus and how to act in His Spirit, presenting the truth as it is in Jesus. . . .",
