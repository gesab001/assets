    "word": "\u201cHere we were put in a room which had been left by its previous occupant in so filthy a condition as to be not only unhealthful but indecent. In the morning we were conducted to an antechamber, and exposed to a powerful stream of cold water. We tried to protect our heads by covering them with our hands; but as soon as we lifted our hands for this purpose, our attendant gave us a blow on the head. Finally my comrade fell to the floor in a swoon, and as he fell, his crutch [he was lame] struck me in the side with such force that I also fell, completely exhausted. We lay in the water until we regained our strength, when the same treatment was repeated. This done, we were again \n205\ntaken before the doctor, who noticed that we trembled from cold and exhaustion, and said, \u2018I will soon warm you up.\u2019 He produced a large bundle of sticks, and beat us with them until he could do so no longer.",
