    "word": "In all your work you should do as the husbandman does in producing the fruits of the earth. Apparently he throws away the seed; but, buried in the soil, the seed, in dying, germinates. The power of the living God gives it life and vitality, and there is seen, \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" Study this wonderful process. Oh, there is so much to learn, so much to understand, that it seems as though we cannot learn everything during this life--and we cannot. But if we now improve our minds to the utmost of our ability, we shall through the eternal ages carry forward the study of God's ways and works, continually reaching higher and still higher.",
