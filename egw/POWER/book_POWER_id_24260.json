    "word": "These mountains clad with forest trees and high towering rocks of every conceivable form are beautifully adorned with the fir, hemlock, and beech. The combination of colors is as beautiful as a bouquet. Interspersed with these are pure white blossoms resembling the snowball. All the beauties and the marvelous greatness of things in nature are open to our senses that we may better understand the love of God for man, and learn lessons of His wisdom and His power. These things which my eyes behold draw me personally and trustingly to my heavenly Father, for I recognize Him as the source of all our blessings. . . .",
