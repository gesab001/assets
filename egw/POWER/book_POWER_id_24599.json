    "word": "Brother Butler, we may expect great things of the Lord. Let us make our mark high. Let faith be mingled with all our efforts. We cannot do anything \n\n\n                                       -37- \n\nunless God shall help us. He has help in store for us, abundant blessing and power, if we will only believe it and strive for it. Our ministers may be clothed with his righteousness if they desire it. If they will comply with the requirements in the Word of God, they may every day walk with God, and be gaining a rich experience in the things of God.",
