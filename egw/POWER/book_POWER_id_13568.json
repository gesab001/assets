    "word": "You must have living faith in your hearts; the truth must be preached with power from above. You can reach the people only when Jesus works through your efforts.

If your own souls were vitalized by the solemn, pointed truths you preach, cold-heartedness, listlessness, and indolence would disappear, and others would feel the influence of your zeal and earnestness.",
