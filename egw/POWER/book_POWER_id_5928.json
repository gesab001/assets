    "word": "I have described what canvassers ought to be; and may the Lord open their minds to comprehend this subject in its length and breadth, and may they realize their duty to represent the character of Christ by their patience, courage, and steadfast integrity.

Even your enemies, as much as they war against your doctrines, will respect you; and when you have gained this much, your simple words will have a power, and will carry conviction to hearts.\u2014 Test. 32, p. 152.",
