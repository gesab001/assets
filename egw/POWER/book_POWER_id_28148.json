    "word": "Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. The living stones in the temple of God do not attract the man of the world. He does not understand their position in the building, and sees nothing in them that he appreciates. He sees talent and sharpness of character and begrudges every particle of it. Whatever the Christian may do religiously, conscientiously, for Christ's sake, is not understood or appreciated because the world know not the power of the truth, and know not the Lord or Jesus Christ.",
