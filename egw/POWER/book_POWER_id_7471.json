    "word": "This country, though old, is sparsely settled. With an area more than fifteen times larger than that of Denmark, it has only two and a half times as many inhabitants. Outside the great cities the people are primitive in their habits. While they are characterized by general intelligence, they are slow to accept changes or to make improvements. The styles of living, the means of transportation and locomotion, the marriage and funeral customs, and the religious ceremonies, all show how old usages retain their power. Yet the inhabitants of Sweden are generally more willing to listen to new doctrines than are those of Norway or Denmark.",
