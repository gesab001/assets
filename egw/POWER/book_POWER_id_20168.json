    "word": "Jacob, in the great crisis of his life, turned aside to pray. He was filled with one overmastering purpose--to seek for transformation of character. But while he was pleading with God, an enemy, as he supposed, placed his hand upon him, and all night he wrestled for his life. But the purpose of his soul was not changed by peril of life itself. When his strength was nearly spent, the Angel put forth His divine power, and at His touch Jacob knew Him with whom he had been contending. Wounded and helpless, he fell upon the Saviour's breast, pleading for a blessing. He would not be turned aside nor cease his intercession, and Christ granted the petition of this helpless, penitent soul, according to His promise, \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\" Isaiah 27:5. Jacob pleaded with determined spirit, \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\" Genesis 32:26. This spirit of persistence was inspired by Him who wrestled with the patriarch. It was He who gave him the victory, and He changed his name from Jacob to Israel, saying, \"As a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\" Genesis 32:28. That for which Jacob had vainly wrestled in his own strength was won through self-surrender and steadfast faith. \"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\" 1 John 5:4. \n                                                                           145",
