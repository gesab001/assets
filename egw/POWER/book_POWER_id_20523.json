    "word": "Although Jesus gave evidence of His divine power, yet He was not permitted to teach His lessons without interruption. The rulers sought to hold Him up to ridicule before the people. They would not allow Him to state His ideas and doctrines in a connected way, but, although frequently interrupted, light flashed into the minds of hundreds, and when the rulers heard the words of Jesus, that were clothed with power and held the people spellbound, they were angry, and said, \u201cThou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil.\u201d Jesus met these charges with quiet dignity, fearlessly and decidedly claiming that covenant rights were centered in Himself, and were not received through Abraham. He declared, \u201cBefore Abraham was, I am.\u201d The fury of the Jews knew no bounds, and they prepared to stone Him, but the angels of God, unseen by men, hurried Him out of their assembly.\u2014ST May 26, 1890.",
