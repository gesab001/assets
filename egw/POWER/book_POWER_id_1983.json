    "word": "The God whom we serve is no respecter of persons. He who gave to Solomon the spirit of wise discernment is willing to impart the same blessing to His children today. . . .

Such a one will learn from the Great Teacher not only what to do, but how to do it in a way that will meet with the divine approval.",
