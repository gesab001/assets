    "word": "It is our work to bar every path that leads to temptation. The Lord desires us to close the door against Satan's entrance. I fear that we do not always remember the wiliness of the foe with whom we have to contend. He has a masterly mind and a keen insight. Let us in our work remember the harm it is in his power to do if we give him the opportunity.--Lt 10, 1901.",
