    "word": "If these persons would make the word of God their study and their guide, they would see that no man \"liveth to himself.\" They would learn from the Inspired Record that God has placed a high value upon the human family. The works of His creation upon each successive day were called good; but man, formed in the image of his Creator, was pronounced \"very good.\" No other creature that God has made has called forth such exhibitions of His love. And when all was lost by sin, God gave His dear Son to redeem the fallen race. It was His will that they should not perish in their sins, but live to use their powers in blessing the world and honoring their Creator. Professed Christians who do not live to benefit others, follow their own perverse will rather than the will of God, \n                                                                           563\nand they will be called to account by the Master for their abuse of the blessings which He has given them.",
