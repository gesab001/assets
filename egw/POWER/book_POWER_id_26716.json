    "word": "\"Sanctify them through thy truth\" [verse 17], Christ prayed. Error never sanctifies. The Holy Spirit is the great sanctifying power. Truth is the medium of sanctification. By reading and feasting upon the Word of God, by practicing the truth at all times, we receive power to glorify God. But the ministry of the Word is of no value to the receiver unless he has that faith which works by love and purifies the soul.",
