    "word": "The men of Ashdod began to be greatly afflicted. The Lord destroyed them, and they remembered the plagues brought upon Egypt, and their mutilated god, and they were convinced that it was because they kept the ark of God that these distressing afflictions came upon them. God would evidence to the idolatrous Philistines, and also to his people, that the ark was strength and power to those who were obedient to his law, and to the disobedient and wicked it was punishment and death.",
