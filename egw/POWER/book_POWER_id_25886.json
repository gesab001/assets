    "word": "Please read the commission given by Christ to His disciples just before His ascension. While many professed Christians are bringing a reproach upon the cause of God and counterworking the work of Christ, we are to do all we possibly can to advance the work by consecrating our talents of means and influence to the Master's service. We cannot afford to neglect our God-given opportunity to lay up treasure in heaven \n\n\n                                    -29- \n\nby doing all in our power to place the truth before those who know it not. If the church would seek to understand the great work to be done, if every member would become surcharged with the power of the Holy Spirit, they would have an efficiency that Satan and his angels could not resist.",
