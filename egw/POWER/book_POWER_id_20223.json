    "word": "Thousands who are now of no use in God\u2019s cause should be digging up their buried talents, and putting them out to the exchangers. Those who think that they will surely reach heaven while they follow their own ways and imaginations might better break the seal, and reexamine their title to the treasures of heaven. The men and women who feel at ease in Zion might better become anxious about themselves, and inquire: What am I doing in the Lord\u2019s vineyard? Why am I not yoked up with Christ, a laborer together with God? Why am I not learning in Christ\u2019s school His meekness and lowliness of heart? Why have I no burdens to bear in the service of Christ? Why am I not a decided Christian, employing all my powers in laboring for the salvation of the souls who are perishing around me? Saith not the Word, \u201cWe are labourers together with God: ye are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s building\u201d? Shall I not with God\u2019s help build a character for time and eternity, and promote godliness in myself and in others through the sanctification of the truth?\u2014Review and Herald, Aug. 21, 1900.",
