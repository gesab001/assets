    "word": "The Son of God himself descended from heaven in the garb of humanity, that he might give power to man, enabling him to be a partaker of the divine nature, and to escape the corruption \n\n\n                      - 36 - \n\nwhich is in the world through lust. His long, human arm encircled the race, while with his divine arm he grasped the throne of the Infinite. By living, not to please himself, but to please his Heavenly Father, by spending his life in work for others, by doing good, and seeking to save suffering humanity, Christ gave practical lessons of self-denial and self-sacrifice.",
