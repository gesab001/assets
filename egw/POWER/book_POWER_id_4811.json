    "word": "A terrible doom awaits the sinner, and therefore it is necessary that we know what sin is, in order that we may escape from its power. John says, \"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law\" (1 John 3:4). Here we have the true definition of sin; it is \"the transgression of the law.\" How often the sinner is urged to leave his sins, and come to Jesus; but has the messenger who would lead him to Christ clearly pointed out the way? Has he clearly pointed out the fact that \"sin is the transgression of the law,\" and that he must repent and forsake the breaking of God's commandments? . . .",
