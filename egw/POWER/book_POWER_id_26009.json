    "word": "Our adorable Redeemer left the royal courts of heaven because He saw that men needed His presence upon the earth, and that they could not come to a correct knowledge of the truth without it. He brought divine power and infinite knowledge to man. But \"wonder O heavens, and be astonished O earth!\" Men refused to accept the light brought to them from heaven by Jesus Christ, choosing their own ways, their own defective knowledge. And when the Majesty of heaven came to the earth as a teacher, the Jews wanted to instruct Him, and were filled with envy, jealousy, and madness because He would not accept their traditions and the manner of their teachings. Had they received the Messenger of heaven, what a vastly different history would now be recorded of them! They made their own history. The hearts of men are perverse.",
