    "word": "Elder Olsen, I urge you to be of good courage. I beseech you to confide wholly in God. I entreat you to carry every burden to Jesus. He can and He will give you help and spiritual power. But have faith in God. Do not be depressed. Do not mourn in secret places, as I have done because of the pastors of the flock, because of the unfaithfulness of the watchmen on the walls of Zion.
