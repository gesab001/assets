    "word": "Brother Jones, be careful in your words. You know the truth, and I urge you for Christ's sake to practice the truth. You need the converting power of God every day. May the Lord help you, my brother, for He has greatly blessed you. You need the spirit of meekness and gentleness, of patience and forbearance, and of love for your brethren. Take heed how you build, for the structure will be tested. \n\n\n                                    -199-",
