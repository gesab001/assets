    "word": "MR No. 1332 - God's Church the Light of the World\n\n     Matthew 5:13-16. \"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.\" The aggressive power of the gospel is in proportion to the genuine faith and piety and example of the believers. The church is to be the Lord's light bearer to shine amid the moral darkness of a corrupt and sinful generation. There can be nothing in the world that is so dear to God as His church. Nothing is guarded by Him with such jealous care. Nothing offends God more than for the church to be in a disunited state, because it bears to the world a very bad testimony and example.",
