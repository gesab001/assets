    "word": "My prayer is daily that I may speak with a sanctified tongue. Every Christian is to declare the attributes of the character of Christ. He looks upon Christ, His goodness, His patience, His compassion, and His love, and he cheerfully employs all his powers and all his faculties in His service. False motives and spurious principles decidedly lead away from Christ. Their seeming good works cannot bear the test and trial, and when brought into strait places self breaks forth in words of criticism and harsh words of condemnation of that which he should approve. \n\n\n                                   -220-",
