    "word": "Chapter XXIX. - Moses Sinned.\n\n     Again the congregation of Israel was brought into the wilderness, to the very place where God proved them soon after their leaving Egypt. The Lord brought them water out of the rock, which had continued to flow until just before they came again to the rock, when the Lord caused that living stream to cease, to prove his people again to see if they would endure the trial of their faith, or again murmur against him. When the Hebrews were thirsty, and could find no water they became impatient and did not remember the power of God which had, nearly forty years before, brought them water out of the rock. Instead of trusting in God, they complained of Moses and Aaron, and said to them, \"Would God we had died when our brethren died before the Lord.\" That is, they wished that they had been of that number who had been destroyed by the plague in the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.",
