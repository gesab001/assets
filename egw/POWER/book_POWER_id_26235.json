    "word": "\"Resist the devil.\" Be not seduced by his flattering presentations. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. All the good resolutions we make in our own strength are as ropes of sand. But when we come to God in sincerity, and give ourselves to Him, He will strengthen us to stand against the wiles of the enemy. In the power of Jesus Christ, resist the enemy, and he will flee from you.",
