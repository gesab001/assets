    "word": "10 (Luke 4:8). Command Compelled Satan.--Jesus said to this wily foe, \"Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\" Satan had asked Christ to give him evidence that He was the Son of God, and he had in this instance the proof he had asked. At the divine command of Christ he was compelled to obey. He was repulsed and silenced. He had no power to enable him to withstand the peremptory dismissal. He was compelled without another word to instantly desist and to leave the world's Redeemer (RH Sept. 1, 1874).",
