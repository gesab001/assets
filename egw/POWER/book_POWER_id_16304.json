    "word": "Judas Betrays Jesus\n \n\n     Then Judas, with his band of armed men, appeared. He approached His Master as usual, to salute Him. The band surrounded Jesus; but there He manifested His divine power, as He said. \"Whom seek ye?\" \"I am He.\" They fell backward to the ground. Jesus made this inquiry that they might witness His power and have evidence that He could deliver Himself from their hands if He would.",
