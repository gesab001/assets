    "word": "\"Do All To the Glory of God\" \nWe do not mark out any precise line to be followed in diet; but we do say that in countries where there are fruits, grains, and nuts in abundance,\n236\nflesh food is not the right food for God's people. I have been instructed that flesh food has a tendency to animalize the nature, to rob men and women of that love and sympathy which they should feel for everyone, and to give the lower passions control over the higher powers of the being. If meat eating was ever healthful, it is not safe now. Cancers, tumors, and pulmonary diseases are largely caused by meat eating.",
