    "word": "Christ said, \"I sanctify Myself that they also may be sanctified.\" Those who follow His example will be men of power. They will be \"strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might.\" Ignorance in regard to the subject of health and purity is sinful, and yet we are far behind the light that has been given. The strange abandonment of principles which should have a vital connection with physical health, is simply appalling. Instead of seeking for more knowledge on this subject, some seem to desire to stop every crevice through which light might come to them.",
