    "word": "In Healdsburg, the Lord wrought through you, not because you were perfect, but notwithstanding your \n\n\n                      [12] \n\nimperfections. Self soon was mingled with your work. When you realized that the Spirit and power of God were working with the people, if you had humbled yourself, if you had walked carefully and softly before God, feeling your unworthiness and his goodness, the influence you left in Healdsburg would have been far better than it now is. You charge all your financial embarrassment to circumstances.",
