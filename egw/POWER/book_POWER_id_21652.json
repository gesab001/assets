    "word": "The words Christ has spoken, the spirit he has revealed in all his lessons to his disciples, are as the bread of life, the flesh and blood of the Son of God. He said, \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" But all he has said is contested by the confederacy of evil, nevertheless precious truth must be presented in its native force. The deceptive errors that are widespread, and that are leading the world captive, are to be unveiled. Every effort that is possible is being made to ensnare souls with subtle reasonings, to turn \n\n\n                          - 27 - \n\nthem from the truth to fables, and to prepare them to be deceived by strong delusions. But while these deceived souls turn from the truth to error, do not speak to them one word of censure. Seek to show these poor, deluded souls their danger, and to reveal to them how grievous is their course of action toward Jesus Christ, but let it all be done in pitying tenderness. By a proper manner of labor some of the souls who are ensnared by Satan may be recovered from his power. But do not blame and condemn them. To ridicule the position held by those who are in error will not open their blind eyes, nor attract them to the truth. The followers of Christ may receive divine illumination daily, and have clear conceptions of the great mercy and love of God toward us poor sinners. As we behold the love of Christ, we shall begin to reflect it. \"God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\" In Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. How are they hid?-- Under the veil of humanity and deep humiliation. The abundance of his knowledge covers all the treasures of wisdom; for in Christ all fulness dwells.",
