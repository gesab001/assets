    "word": "But there is danger of allowing one line of the work to absorb all the power and the means. There is danger of loading down everyone with this class of work, because of the intensity with which it is carried on. This work has no limit; it can never be got through with, and it must be treated sensibly, as a part of the great whole. It must not be allowed to consume the means that should sustain the ministry of the word.--Letter 3, 1899, p. 12. (To J. H. Kellogg, Jan. 5, 1899.)",
