    "word": "Hundreds of Workers \n     Souls are perishing, and hundreds of workers are now needed. Men will be moved by the Holy Spirit to leave their ordinary employment and enter the barren fields that have never heard the last message of mercy. Many will be endowed with power from on high. They will work wisely, not expending means lavishly, but studying how souls can be brought to the knowledge of the truth by the opening of the Scriptures in house-to-house labor. This work men and women will take hold of for the love of Christ. --Letter 110, 1901",
