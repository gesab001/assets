    "word": "God has permitted the light of health reform to shine upon us in these last days, that by walking in the light we may escape many dangers to which we will be exposed. Satan's temptations are powerful upon the human family to lead them to indulge appetite, gratify inclination, and live a life of heedless folly. . . . In this fast age, the less exciting the food the better. Temperance in all things and firm denial of appetite, is the only path of safety.",
