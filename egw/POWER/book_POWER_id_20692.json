    "word": "God is preparing humble, contrite men to be valuable workers. He is giving them an experience that human wisdom cannot explain. He works upon minds by His own wisdom. Supposed mistakes are permitted to appear, that in unexpected ways (which human wisdom cannot comprehend) great glory may come to God. He is accomplishing His work in His own way. He consults His own purposes, not man's theories. The power with which He works through any man is proportionate to the man's earnestness and sincerity. In all that He does, He seeks the highest good of those who are laborers together with Him.--Letter 162, April 12, 1903, to a conference executive.",
