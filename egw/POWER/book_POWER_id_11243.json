    "word": "Truth that is in the heart is not a cold, dead letter.... There is fullness of joy in the truth. There is a nobleness in the life of the human agent who lives and works under the vivifying influence of the truth. Truth is sacred and divine. It is stronger and more powerful than anything else in the formation of a character after the likeness of Christ. When it is cherished in the heart, the love of Christ is preferred to the love of any human being. This is Christianity. Thus truth--pure, unadulterated truth--occupies the citadel of the being. This is the life of God in the soul. \"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.\" Ezekiel 36:26.",
