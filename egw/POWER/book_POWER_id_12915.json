    "word": "In the dead of the night, at a signal from Gideon's war horn, the three companies sounded their trumpets; then, breaking their pitchers and displaying the blazing torches, they rushed upon the enemy with the terrible war cry, \"The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon!\" ...

No words can describe the terror of the surrounding nations when they learned what simple means had prevailed against the power of a bold, warlike people.--Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 546-553.",
