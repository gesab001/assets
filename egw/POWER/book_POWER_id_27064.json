    "word": "When I arrived at Battle Creek, I learned that our leading brethren had asked the Lord in prayer to send me direct to Battle Creek. Meetings were being held in the various rooms of the Tabernacle. [ON JAN. 13, 1891, ELLEN WHITE WROTE, \"E. J. WAGGONER CAME IN LATE LAST EVENING AND WE HAD A TALK IN REGARD TO THE MINISTERS' MEETINGS NOW BEING HELD. HE REJOICED THAT THERE WAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE PERVADING THE MEETINGS THAN WAS IN THE MINISTERIAL INSTITUTE LAST YEAR\" (MS. 40, 1891, P. 12). THESE MEETINGS, AT WHICH ELLEN WHITE WAS A FREQUENT SPEAKER, CONTINUED UNTIL FEBRUARY 27, ONE WEEK BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE 1891 GENERAL CONFERENCE SESSION.] One morning I was awakened before daylight. It was as if a voice spoke to me, Attend the morning meeting. [ELLEN WHITE IS OBVIOUSLY REFERRING TO THE MEMORABLE MEETING OF MARCH 8, 1891. SHE TELESCOPED EVENTS SOMEWHAT AS SHE RECALLED THE EXPERIENCE THROUGH WHICH SHE PASSED 14 YEARS EARLIER.] I \n\n\n                                   -70- \n\narose and dressed, and walked across the road to the meeting. As I went into the room, the brethren were in prayer. I united my prayer with those of the rest, praying with great earnestness. The Spirit of the Lord was in the meeting and my soul was deeply stirred. After the season of prayer, I arose to speak and bore a decided testimony with the Spirit and power of God, relating my experience in Salamanca and telling them what the Lord had revealed to me in the vision of the night.",
