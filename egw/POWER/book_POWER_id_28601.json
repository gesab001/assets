    "word": "God has instructed me that our workers need to experience the deep moving of the Spirit of God; many are in need of a fuller conversion. On the day of pentecost, in response to the continued prayers of the disciples, the Holy Spirit descended from heaven with the sound as of a rushing mighty wind. For ages the heavenly influences had been held in restraint; but in response to the fervent prayers of these humble men, they descended with power to co-operate with human agencies.

All heaven bent to listen to the lowly seekers after God.",
