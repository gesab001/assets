At your board meetings angels of God have covered their faces, that they might not behold the wrongs devised. Yet I have still an appeal to make: Stop where you are. You have no more right to the large wages you demand than have I or your brethren. If you obtain them by fraud, by carrying your case to worldly men, please read your Bible, and see what it says on this subject.--Letter 41, 1898, p. 15. (To A. R. Henry, May 16, 1898.)",
