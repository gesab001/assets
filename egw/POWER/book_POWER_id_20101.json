    "word": "We must present an unbroken front in union and in faith. We must be strong in the Lord and in the power of His grace. . . . It is through disunion that the enemy comes in and sows his seed. We need the truth on every point. We need less of our own words and more of the Word of God. We are near the close of time, and we cannot afford to make a mistake. Truth will bear away the victory. We must \"love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous\" (1 Peter 3:8). We must practice Christian politeness. A soft answer to cruel thrusts turns away wrath. . . .",
