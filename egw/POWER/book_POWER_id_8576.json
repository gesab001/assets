    "word": "Christ was crucified, and in His death the powers of hell seemed to prevail. But even when on the cross the Saviour cried, \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" He was conqueror over the power of darkness. When the words, \"It is finished,\" came from His pale, trembling lips, darkness like the darkness of midnight hid His dying agony from the eyes of the spectators. Through long hours of agony He had been gazed upon by the jesting multitude. Now He was mercifully hidden by the mantle of God.",
