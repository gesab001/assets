    "word": "The Conflict of Two Leaders \n\n     Here are two opposing elements, with two different leaders. One party is under the control of Satan. He is their captain. Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, is the leader of the other party. He laid off His royal robe and kingly crown, and clothed Himself with the garment of humanity, that He might stand at the head of the human race, bearing the trials that we must bear, and meeting the temptations that we must meet. The power of the temptations brought against Him was as much greater as He is higher and purer than we are, and yet not for an instant during His sojourn in this earth did He swerve from His loyalty to God. He lived a life pure and undefiled, unmarred by spot or stain of sin. It was in His right to place one hand upon the throne of God in heaven, while with the other He laid hold of fallen human beings, and has raised them from their degradation. To all who receive Him He gives power to become the sons of God.",
