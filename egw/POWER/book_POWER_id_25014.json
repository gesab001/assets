    "word": "I will say that there has not been a thing thought, said, or done against me, but that I will freely forgive. It was not against me, but against the Lord Jesus. I will do in my power to confirm and strengthen in the faith our tempted brethren and sisters. A sinful disposition has led them astray, but Christ knows our every weakness. He will pardon their every transgression and sin, if they will put them away from heart and mind, and lay them upon the Sin-bearer. Do not, I beseech of you, Brother and Sister McCullagh, link yourselves up with Satan. Bind your souls up with God. I will do all in my power to help you, and the Lord has unlimited power for you. \n\n\n                                    -355-",
