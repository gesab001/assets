    "word": "Paul's Experience. \n\n     We would do well to study carefully the first and second chapters of 1 Corinthians. \"We preach Christ crucified,\" the apostle declared, \"unto the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men: and the weakness of God is stronger than men. For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are: that no flesh should glory in His presence. But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is \n                                                                           18\nwritten, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\" The human being who undertakes to become wisdom for another will find himself coming short.",
