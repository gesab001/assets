    "word": "There is a life beyond. An eternity. A life of happiness. No death can enter there. There will be no malarial taint there. No sickness, or pain or sorrow. Do you not want to be there? The streets are paved with gold, and you will see the King in His glory. I must be there. I must see the King in His majesty. Don't lead people to believe they can go there and take their sins right along. The characters must be changed here. We must learn to sing the songs of redemption here, if we ever sing the songs of redemption in heaven. Sing of God's goodness. Talk of His power.--Manuscript 20, Nov. 25, 1888, \"A Good Sermon.\"",
