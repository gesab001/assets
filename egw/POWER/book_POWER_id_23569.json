    "word": "Bro. and sister Smith have a work before them to properly educate their children. They should call to mind the sin of Eli, and shun his example. Bro. Smith has not taken upon himself the responsibility which rests upon a father to control his children. He is the head of the family, and as priest of his household. The most powerful sermon that can be given the unbelieving world in recommendation of our faith is a well-disciplined family. Children that are educated to habits of self-denial and self-control, and are taught to be courteous, kind, and affectionate, will make an impression upon minds that nothing else can. A family of children who are coarse, unruly, selfish, passionate, and disobedient, show to bad advantage, and is a bad recommendation to the truth \n                                                                           46\nadvocated by their parents. Sister Smith's undue affection for her children is a selfish and idolatrous love, which makes her partial to her children, and blinds her eyes in a great measure to the many faults which need to be corrected in them. It is not enough to merely entreat our children as did Eli, \"Why do ye so wickedly?\" but to decidedly restrain them. The little daughter has been gratified and indulged, until she is ruler in the house. She is coming up with a strong will undirected, and her strong passions uncontrolled. She will be a grief to her parents unless they now do the work they have so long neglected.",
