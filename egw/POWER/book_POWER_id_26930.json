    "word": "No one, however responsible the position he occupies, is to take glory to himself. If he loves God with all the heart and his neighbor as himself, he will follow the example of Jesus Christ. As God's workmen bear responsibilities and carry burdens in the great harvest field let them remember that true success comes from God alone, and that every particle of the praise and glory belongs to Him. We are God's husbandry, God's building. We are to understand that power and efficiency come only from our heavenly Father. Under the generalship of Christ we are to do the work allotted to us. Each member of the church must have a living connection with its great Head.",
