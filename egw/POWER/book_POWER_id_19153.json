    "word": "We have increased light. We have a solemn, weighty message to bear to the world, and God designs that His chosen disciples shall have a deep experience, and be endowed with the power of the Holy Spirit. \"The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\" This was a lesson that David never forgot, and in his dying testimony to Solomon he said, \"And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee; but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off forever.\"",
