    "word": "God has given you talents, both in faculties and in opportunities. You are to employ these entrusted capabilities in His service. Years are passing into eternity. What are you doing? Are you making returns to God in the improvement and increase of your talents for His service? You must give an account to God for every jot of your influence, for influence is a power for good or for evil. If weighted with the Spirit of truth, you can surround your soul with an atmosphere that will be to those with whom you associate a savor of life unto life. If true to God, you will be indeed a colaborer with Him. You will be as a branch of the living Vine, vitalized by the nourishment which flows through the parent stock.",
