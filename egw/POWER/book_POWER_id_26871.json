    "word": "The believers in the truth are guarded jealously as the heart of God. In the fierce conflict before us, mind with mind, truth in collision with error, principle with principle, this world will witness scenes that are intensely interesting, of immense importance. In many churches the truth will be sacrificed and error presented in its place. Those who cease to occupy the elevated position as watchmen, receiving the word from God and giving the warning to the people, are not aware that they are ranging themselves under the black banner of the power of darkness, with the enemies of God and the truth. The people receive the words from their lips and in their turn repeat the same errors to those brought in connection with them. Thus the wine of Babylon is received and all nations become drunken with the spiritual poison. We see that those who will not receive the truth are preparing to resist its influence. They refuse to be recast in faith and character. They are unwilling to be remodeled in the image of Christ's character.",
