    "word": "One man's mind, one man's judgment, is not to be a controlling power. . . . \"Counsel together, counsel together,\" has been repeated to me by the heavenly angels for the past forty-five years. At the same time you must constantly feel the need of higher counsel. Do not fail to seek wisdom from God. Unless you do go to God for wisdom, and understand for yourselves the way of the Lord, you will not be able to understand things clearly. You must have the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit to give you clear views of Jesus and His love.--Letter 34, 1891.",
