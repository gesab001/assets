    "word": "My dear sister in Christ Jesus, you cannot keep yourself one moment. You are kept by the power of God through faith. Let your faith rest in His merits, rely upon His mercy, trust in the sufficiency of His grace to keep you every moment. Never allow the enemy to obtain an advantage over you because you do not think you are good enough to be called a child of God. By faith you are constantly to repose in the righteousness which God has provided you through His Substitute, Jesus Christ the Righteous. He forgiveth sins and pardoneth iniquities and transgressions. He takes away our sin, and in its place imputes His own righteousness. What a blessing this is for us! It is only as you take God at His word, and accept Jesus Christ as your Redeemer that you preserve the honor of God and show that you are \"kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time\" (1 Peter 1:5).",
