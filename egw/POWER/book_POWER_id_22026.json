Through the means of our sanitariums the sick and suffering in the highways and the byways of life are to learn of the healing power of Christ. Those who have received the light are to show in their lives that they are God's medical missionaries. By being partakers of the divine nature, they are to become colaborers with Jesus Christ in every line of work that will bring relief to suffering humanity.",
