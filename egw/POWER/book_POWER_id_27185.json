    "word": "The proper cooking of food is a most essential acquirement, especially where meat is not made the staple article of diet. Something must be \n\n\n                                     -281- \n\nprepared to take the place of meat, and these foods must be well prepared so that meat will not be desired. Culture on all points of practical life will make our youth useful after they shall leave school to go to foreign countries. They will not then have to depend upon the people to whom they go to cook and sew for them, or build their habitations. And they will be much more influential if they show that they can educate the ignorant how to labor with the best methods and to produce the best results. This will be appreciated where means are difficult to obtain. They will reveal that missionaries can become educators in teaching them how to labor. A much smaller fund will be required to sustain such missionaries, because they have put to the very best use their physical powers in useful, practical labor combined with their studies, as essential acquirements in education. And wherever they may go, all that they have gained in this line will give them a welcome and standing room. If the light God has given were cherished, students would leave our schools free from the burden of debt, because they can be useful and their help is of value.",
