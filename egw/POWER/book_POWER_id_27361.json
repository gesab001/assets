    "word": "\"Who art thou, O great mountain?\" Satan is constantly at work to make as forbidding as possible the establishment of the kingdom of \n\n\n                 -131- \n\nGod in our world. There will be difficulties to obstruct the work of God, for Satan through his masterly power will use unconsecrated hearts to present the characters of the professed people of God to the world as a stumbling block. The precious trusts which they hold are not practiced in their lives. While there are those who will advance, there are others who think so much of their individual selves that they cannot see that which needs to be done at the right time. There is no harmony of spirit or action. They magnify the difficulties. But as those who seek to carry out God's plans advance, the great mountain becomes a plain. \"Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.\"",
