    "word": "HAD MRS. W. BEEN SPARED THE BLOW WHICH MADE HER AN INVALID IN HER CHILDHOOD; HAD SHE GROWN TO WOMANHOOD WITH HEALTH AND STRENGTH TO OBTAIN A FINISHED EDUCATION; AND HAD SHE COME BEFORE THE PEOPLE, UNDER THESE FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES, AS A SPEAKER AND WRITER, THE UNBELIEF OF OUR TIMES, SO READY TO SEIZE UPON OBJECTIONS, WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE CREDIT OF HER WORK TO THE WOMAN, AND NOT TO THE LORD. BUT FOR THE SPECIAL WORK CONNECTED WITH THE LAST MESSAGE, AT THIS TIME OF UNPARALLELED SKEPTICISM, GOD CHOSE A FEEBLE MEANS, THAT HIS POWER MIGHT BE CLEARLY MANIFESTED, AND THAT THE GLORY OF HIS WORK MIGHT NOT BE GIVEN TO THE INSTRUMENT. THE WORDS OF PAUL ARE APPLICABLE: \u201cYE SEE YOUR CALLING, BRETHREN, HOW THAT NOT MANY WISE MEN AFTER THE FLESH, NOT MANY MIGHTY, NOT MANY NOBLE, ARE CALLED: BUT GOD HATH CHOSEN THE FOOLISH THINGS OF THE WORLD TO CONFOUND THE WISE; AND GOD HATH CHOSEN THE WEAK THINGS OF THE WORLD TO CONFOUND THE THINGS WHICH ARE MIGHTY.\u201d 1 CORINTHIANS 1:26, 27.",
