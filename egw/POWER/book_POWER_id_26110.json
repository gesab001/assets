    "word": "There are men in responsible places who have but a limited knowledge of what the soul demands. Men are placed there who are deficient in many ways. But the most dangerous men in all our ranks are those who do not work righteousness. The Holy Spirit does not work them. They are worked by a power from beneath. And yet these men suppose that they can manufacture laws and rules, build up and tear down, and carry all they can grasp under their own control, without God. They should tremble and be afraid because of their course of action.",
