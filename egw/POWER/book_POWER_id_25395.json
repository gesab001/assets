    "word": "These words are very precious unto me, \"He that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst. . . . Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day\" [John 6:35, 54]. Christ explains His meaning: \"The flesh profiteth not; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" [verse 6]. Yes, the Word is the living bread. Eat of it daily. It will be a sustaining power to do all that you must do. It will infuse immortal vigor into your soul, perfect your experience, and bring to you those joys which are real, and which abide forever.",
