    "word": "Every article you write may be all truth, but one drop of gall in it will be poison to the reader. One reader will discard all your good and acceptable words because of that drop of poison. Another will feed on the poison, for he loves such harsh words; he follows your example and talked just as A. T. Jones talks. Thus the evil is multiplied. Make it your aim to speak the truth in \n\n\n                                    -200- \n\nlove. Then the Lord Jesus by His Spirit will supply the force and the power. That is the Lord's work. Beware lest with the sacred you mingle the common fire--A. T. Jones--in your service. Your common utterances are as common fire in the service of God. We must not mingle self with anything we do for God.-- Letter 91, 1899. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 12, 1988. Entire Letter.",
