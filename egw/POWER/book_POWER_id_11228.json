    "word": "The solemn, earnest prayer of Christ . . . . reaches down along the line to our time. What a position is this for fallen man to attain through obedience--oneness with God through Jesus Christ! To what heights we are permitted to rise if we will have respect unto the recompense of the reward! We are to receive power from God that human nature, under the divine working, may not always be perverted and not always be under the depraving, corrupting influence of sin. Human nature, through Jesus Christ, becomes allied to angels--yes, even to the great God.",
