    "word": "Other instances of a similar nature are recorded in the Scriptures. The daughter of the Syrophenician woman was grievously vexed with a devil, whom Jesus cast out by his word. [Mark 7:26-30.] One \"possessed with a devil, blind and dumb,\" [Matthew 12:22.] a youth who had a dumb spirit, that ofttimes \"cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him,\" [Mark 9:17-27.] the maniac, who, tormented by \"a spirit of an unclean devil,\" [Luke 4:33-36.] disturbed the Sabbath quiet of the synagogue at Capernaum, were all healed by the compassionate Saviour. In nearly every instance, Christ addressed the demon as an intelligent entity, commanding him to come out of his victim and to torment him no more. The worshipers at Capernaum, beholding his mighty power, \"were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.\"",
