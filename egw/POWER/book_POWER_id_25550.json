    "word": "You were not in the early experience of the people of whom you have written, and who have been laid to rest from their labors.

You have made prominent before the world the errors of the brethren but have not represented the fact that God worked to correct those errors and to set the objectionable matters right. Opposers will be glad to multiply the matter which has been furnished to their hand by our people. You have arrayed the errors of the early apostles, the errors of those who were precious in the eyes of the Lord in the days of Christ.",
