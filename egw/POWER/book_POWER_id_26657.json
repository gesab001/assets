    "word": "I thank the Lord for the privilege of standing in the sanitarium chapel before a full house of interested listeners. I went from my room in weakness, and I stood before the people not in my own strength, but in the strength that the Lord gives me. It was as if I were leaning on the arm of my Saviour.
