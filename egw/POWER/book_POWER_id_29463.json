    "word": "Every student should aspire to obtain a fitness by the inward adorning of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price. Therefore he should in this life make diligent use of every opportunity and privilege to obtain all the knowledge possible for a qualification for that higher life in the future world. God requires of every youth the full development and cultivation of all his powers. Every faculty of mind, soul, and body is to be taxed to the highest to understand the Word of God, and have a correct knowledge of the people and their manners, who are chosen the elect of God, and who will receive the \"Well done\" from the lips of their Master, and compose the family of God in heaven. This is work that every one \n\n\n                              -52- \n\ncan do. Some are incapable of managing or organizing, but these can cooperate with those who have a talent for this.",
