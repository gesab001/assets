    "word": "Well-Balanced Effort\n     God has committed to each of us sacred trusts, for which he holds us accountable. He desires us so to educate the mind that we may be able to accomplish the greatest good, and reflect the glory to the Giver. We are indebted to God for all the powers of the mind. These powers can be cultivated, and so discreetly directed and controlled as to accomplish the purpose for which they were given. It is duty so to educate the mind as to bring out the energies of the soul, and develop every faculty. When all the faculties are in exercise, the intellect will be strengthened, and the purpose for which they were given will be accomplished.",
