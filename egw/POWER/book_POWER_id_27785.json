    "word": "We have seen evidences in this meeting how far apart has been faith and the righteousness of Christ, from the religious life of those even who claim to be keeping the commandments of God. There has been the great want of a knowledge of Jesus Christ. The want in the religious experience is the acceptance of Jesus Christ as presented in the gospel. Many have not yet received Christ. They have accepted a theory of the truth, and have been in a large degree left to this kind of experience. And how hard it has been to impress the minds with the necessity of justification by faith! \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\" John 1:12.",
