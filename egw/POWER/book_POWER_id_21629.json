    "word": "FURTHER COMMENTS AND EXTRACTS. \n\n     WE MUST REALIZE THAT WE ARE PLACED UNDER GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES TO GOD AND TO HIS CAUSE BY SUCH EARNEST AND SOLEMN ADMONITIONS AS THE FOREGOING. THERE CAN BE NO EXCUSE FOR US FOR CONTINUING IN A WRONG WAY. THE REASON OF OUR LACK OF SUCCESS AND OUR LACK OF POWER WITH GOD IS POINTED OUT, SO THAT WE ARE NOT LEFT IN THE DARK. OUR SINS AND OUR WRONG WAYS HAVE BEEN FAITHFULLY SET BEFORE US, BUT WE ARE NOT LEFT WITHOUT HOPE; FOR THE REMEDY HAS ALSO BEEN POINTED OUT. NOW IT IS OUR PRIVILEGE TO REPENT OF SIN, AND TO KNOW THE POWER OF GOD'S SAVING GRACE. THE HOLY SPIRIT AWAITS OUR DEMAND AND RECEPTION. WHAT MORE CAN THE LORD DO FOR US THAN THAT WHICH HE HAS ALREADY DONE? BUT OUR DANGER IS THAT WE WILL NOT MAKE APPLICATION OF THESE ADMONITIONS TO OUR INDIVIDUAL SELVES. I WOULD INTREAT YOU IN THE NAME OF THE MASTER TO GIVE HEED TO THIS BLESSED INSTRUCTION. GOD GIVE US TRUE, GODLY SORROW, SHOULD BE OUR PRAYER. (SEE 2 CORINTHIANS 7:10, 11).",
