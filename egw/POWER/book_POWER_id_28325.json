    "word": "Oh what can we say to awaken the soul's interest to make no compromise with Satan; but make thorough work for repentance before it is everlastingly too late? How can we make them consider that there are limits to the forbearance of God, and that it is possible for them to pass the limit of the forbearance of God, as did Judas and Saul? God allows nations a certain period of probation; but there is a point they can reach and can pass, and then iniquity accumulated will receive not mercy, not longer forbearance, but an outbreak of the indignation of God, and be visited with punishment unmixed with mercy. God will arise in mighty power, and show, though slow to anger, He will not acquit the wicked. The wickedness of each generation is not forgotten. Each century of increased profligacy has treasured up wrath, and Christ said unto those who resisted all His mercy, all the blessings He presented to them, addressing the rejecters of His salvation, \"Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers,\" for the blood of all the prophets which had been shed from the foundation of the world should be required of the nation He addressed. They had the beacon warning in the jealousies, in the hatred, in the despisings of warnings and messages sent to them and God's punishment came upon them for their cruelty, and notwithstanding all this, those who separated from God repeated the history of their fathers, and thus it is in our day.",
