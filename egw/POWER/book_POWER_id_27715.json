    "word": "Young men, Jesus calls you, saying, \"Follow Me.\" Those who follow Him will not walk in darkness, for Christ is the light of life. Our older ministering brethren must drop some of their responsibilities or else they will go down in the silence of the grave. The aged standard-bearers may act as worthy counselors and living witnesses, but their younger and stronger brethren should bear the heavy burdens. John says, \"I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, . . . and ye have overcome the wicked one.\" You whose eyes are not dimmed, whose brain power has not been worn by constant taxation, should plan, devise, and execute, treating the aged workers with tenderness, as fathers, and looking up to them as counselors and guides. Young workers should respect the age and experience of their older brethren.",
