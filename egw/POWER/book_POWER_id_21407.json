    "word": "The fields are opening everywhere, calling for the living preacher. At home and abroad are openings that there seems no way to fill.

All cannot be preachers of the Word, but in their own homes all might do something for Christ. They could do a good work among their neighbors. If they would put their minds and hearts to the work, they might devise plans by which they could be useful in a small way, whatever their position.",
