    "word": "Will you become acquainted with Jesus Christ? He is your best Friend. Educate your children to become acquainted with Jesus. In their very youth is the time to impress this lesson upon them. How much time are you spending in this work? If you are neglecting this work your children will not stand around the great white throne of God as subjects of Christ. Now here is the open door; fathers and mothers, you can do this work yourself. I have wrestled day and night with God in prayer--\"Give me my children.\" I cannot give my children to the powers of the enemy, but I have felt that I must have their influence in this work of saving souls, and thus we could be missionaries for God. And they stand by my side in this great work. I feel grateful to God for this.",
