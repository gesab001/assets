    "word": "Dr. Kellogg has felt afraid to trust responsibility with some of the physicians, because he saw in them inefficiency in some respects. They were not thorough and care-taking. Men of reasoning powers are greatly to blame if they continually make mistakes. These involve serious consequences. While Dr. Kellogg carries the greatest, heaviest responsibilities, he should have men by his side who will do as he instructs them. He should not do so much himself; for he is only a mortal man, and his powers have been taxed to the utmost limit again and again. He should lay upon others responsibilities which they should carry.",
