    "word": "Sanctification, Habitual Communion With God. God will more than fulfill the highest expectations of those who put their trust in Him. He desires us to remember that when we are humble and contrite, we stand where He can and will manifest Himself to us. He is well pleased when we urge past mercies and blessings as a reason why He should bestow on us higher and greater blessings. . . . He is honored when we set apart the seventh day as sacred and holy. To those who do this the Sabbath is a sign, \"that they may know,\" God declares, \"that I am the Lord that doth sanctify them.\" Sanctification means habitual communion with God. There is nothing so great and so powerful as God's love for those who are His children by adoption.--Manuscript 80, 1900, pp. 8, 9. (\"A Holy People,\" July 4, 1900.)",
