    "word": "Your leaven of distrust, your want of confidence, your power of accusing, closes against you the door of admittance. Within this door nothing can enter that can possibly mar the happiness of the dwellers here by marring their perfect trust in one another. Those who have educated themselves to pick flaws in the characters of others have thus revealed a deformity of character which makes families unhappy, which has turned souls from the truth to choose fables. You cannot join the happy family in the heavenly courts, for He will wipe all tears from their faces. You can never see the King in His beauty if you are not yourself a representative of the loveliness of Christ's character.",
