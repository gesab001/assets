    "word": "Last Sabbath was a trying day to me. As soon as meeting commenced my burden grew heavier. My heart ached almost to bursting. I was obliged to leave the room and not come in again until meeting closed. I cried aloud for a long time, but tears would not relieve me. I thought I must leave Connecticut and made up my mind to go to western New York. Last Sunday we were at Brother Ralph's and we engaged in prayer for the special teachings of God how to move, whether to go to N.Y. or stay in Connecticut. The spirit came and we had a powerful season. Brother and Sister Ralph were both laid prostrate and remained helpless for some time. I was taken off in vision and saw concerning the state of some here and also saw there would be a conference at your place and that it was duty of my husband to attend and that a conference should be holden in Paris, Maine, and souls would be strengthened and comforted there. I then saw it was not duty to go to New York, but that we must tarry and abide where we were, so our minds are made up what to do, and may God give me strength to endure the trials I shall have to pass through here. \n\n\n                                    -324-",
