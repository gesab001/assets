    "word": "God has, in the natural world, placed in the hands of the children of men the key to unlock the treasure-house of his word. The unseen is illustrated by the seen; divine wisdom, eternal truth, infinite grace, are understood by the things that God has made. Then let the children and youth become acquainted with nature and nature's laws. Let the mind be developed to the utmost capacity, and the physical powers trained for the practical duties of life; but teach them also that God has made this world fair because he delights in our happiness; and that a more beautiful home is preparing for us in that world where there will be no more sin. The word of God declares, \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, \n                                                                           62\nneither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\"",
