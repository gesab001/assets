    "word": "Chapter 3 \n\n     6-9 (Romans 8:15-21; see EGW on Hebrews 8:6, 7). The Law Ordained to Life.--The law of God, spoken in awful grandeur from Sinai, is the utterance of condemnation to the sinner. It is the province of the law to condemn, but there is in it no power to pardon or to redeem. It is ordained to life; those who walk in harmony with its precepts will receive the reward of obedience. But it brings bondage and death to those who remain under its condemnation. (RH April 22, 1902).",
