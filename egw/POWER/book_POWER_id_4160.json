    "word": "THEY ARE TO CEASE WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME, WHEN WE SHALL NO LONGER SEE THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY, BUT FACE TO FACE. THE PERFECT DAY, WHEN THE JUST ARE MADE PERFECT AND SEE AS THEY ARE SEEN, IS YET IN THE FUTURE. IT IS TRUE THAT THE MAN OF SIN, WHEN ARRIVED AT MANHOOD, HAD PUT AWAY SUCH \"CHILDISH THINGS\" AS PROPHECIES, TONGUES, AND KNOWLEDGE, AND ALSO THE FAITH, HOPE, AND CHARITY OF THE PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANS. BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE TEXT TO SHOW THAT GOD DESIGNED TO TAKE AWAY THE GIFTS WHICH HE HAD SET IN THE CHURCH, TILL THE CONSUMMATION OF HER FAITH AND HOPE, TILL THE SURPASSING GLORY OF THE IMMORTAL STATE SHOULD ECLIPSE THE MOST BRILLIANT DISPLAYS OF SPIRITUAL POWER AND KNOWLEDGE EVER MANIFESTED IN THIS MORTAL STATE.",
