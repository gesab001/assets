    "word": "The sermon Satan preached to Eve upon the immortality of the soul--\"Thou shalt not surely die\"--they have reiterated from the pulpit, and the people receive it as pure Bible truth. It is the foundation of Spiritualism. The word of God nowhere teaches the soul of man immortal. Immortality is an attribute of God alone. 1 Timothy 6:16. \"Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.\"",
