    "word": "In a letter dated January 15th, 1910, she said: \"My mind has been burdened in behalf of the large cities of the East, like New York City, where you labored last summer. There is the important city of Boston, near which is situated the Melrose Sanitarium. I know of no place where there is greater need of rebuilding of the first works than in Boston, and in Portland, Maine, where the first messages were given in power, but where now there is but a little handful of our people. . . . I have not a word to say to hinder you from following the guiding hand of God, but I beg of you to bear in mind the neglected cities. The Lord God of Israel is calling for these cities now to be worked. Results will be seen as an interest is created.\"",
