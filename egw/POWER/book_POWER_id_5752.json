    "word": "The people should not regard their ministers as mere public speakers and orators, but as Christ's ambassadors, receiving their wisdom and power from the great Head of the church. To slight and disregard the word spoken by Christ's representative, is showing disrespect, not only to the man, but also to the Master who has sent him. He is in Christ's stead; and the voice of the Saviour should be heard in his representative.",
