    "word": "When Paul prayed that the thorn in his flesh might be removed, the Lord answered his prayer, not by removing the thorn, but by giving him grace to bear the trial. \"My grace,\" He said, \"is sufficient for thee.\" Paul rejoiced at this answer to his prayer, declaring, \"Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me\" (2 Corinthians 12:9). When the sick pray for the recovery of health, the Lord does not always answer their prayer in just the way they desire. But even though they may not be immediately healed, He will give them that which is of far more value --grace to bear their sickness.",
