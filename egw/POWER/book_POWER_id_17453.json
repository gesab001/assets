    "word": "The thrones and kingdoms of the world and the glory of them were offered to Christ if He would only bow down to Satan. Never will man be tried with temptations as powerful as those which assailed Christ. Satan came with worldly honor, wealth, and the pleasures of life, and presented them in the most attractive light to allure and deceive. \"All these things,\" said he to Christ, \"will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me.\" Christ repelled the wily foe and came off victor.",
