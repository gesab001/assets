    "word": "As men and women who profess godliness, are we obeying the Word of God? Is the leaven of truth hidden in the heart, working in the character, and conforming the entire being to the will and ways of God? Our churches need the converting power of God. The leaven of evil which works in disobedience and denial of the truth must be eradicated, and the leaven of the word of God [must be] implanted in the heart. This will work with its vital properties, restoring the lost image of God in man.",
