    "word": "We have just received letters from you, and Willie has just read them to Brother Sisley and myself. I regard your reasoning and statements as correct.

It is our work to speak the truth in love, and not to mix in with the truth the unsanctified elements of the natural heart, and speak things that savor of the same spirit possessed by our enemies. All sharp thrusts will come back upon us in double measure when the power is in the hands of those who can exercise it for our injury.",
