    "word": "The sooner the ranks are purged from all this class, the more surely shall we see the salvation of God and the power of the truth in our midst. It is because we are loaded down with those who have not been partakers of the divine nature, who have failed to escape the corruption that is in the world through lust, that we have so much weakness and feebleness in our midst. We must arouse. We must cleanse the cup of Israel of its moral defilement.-- Letter 5, 1886. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D.C. June 4, 1987. Entire Letter.",
