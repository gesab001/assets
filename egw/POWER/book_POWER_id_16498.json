If you speak to them about it, they say, \"My father uses it, and if it does him good, it will me.\" They point to the minister or the Sunday school superintendent, and say, \"If such good men as they use it, surely I can.\" How can we expect anything else of the children, with their inherited tendencies, while the older ones set them such an example?--Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, page 18.",
