    "word": "But the leaders of Israel turned from the fountain of true knowledge. They studied the Scriptures only to sustain their traditions and enforce their man-made observances.

They disputed over technicalities, and practically denied the most essential truths. God's Word was robbed of its power, and evil spirits worked their will.",
