    "word": "Before men can be truly wise, they must realize their dependence upon God, and be filled with his wisdom. God is the source of intellectual as well as spiritual power. The greatest men, who have reached what the world regards as wonderful heights in science, are not to be compared with the beloved John or the great apostle Paul. It is when intellectual and moral power are combined that the greatest standard of manhood is reached. God will accept such a man as a worker together with himself in the training of minds.",
