    "word": "As God's human agents, we are to do the work that he has given us. To every man he has given his work, and we are not going to give ourselves up to conjecture as to whether or not our earnest endeavors will prove successful. All that we as individuals are responsible for, is the unwearied, conscientious discharge of duty that some one must do, and if we fail to do that which is placed in our way, we cannot be excused of God. But having done the best we can, then we are to leave all results with God. But it is required of us that we exercise more mental and spiritual power. It is your duty, and it has been your duty every day of the life God has graciously granted you, to pull at the oars of duty; for you are a responsible agent of God.",
