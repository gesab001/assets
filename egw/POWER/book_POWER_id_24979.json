    "word": "Only by accepting Christ as a personal Saviour, can human beings be uplifted. Beware of any theory that would lead man to look for salvation from any other source than that pointed out in the Word. Only through Christ can men, sunken in sin and degradation, be led to a higher life. Theories that do not recognize the atonement that has been made for sin, and the work that the Holy Spirit is to do in the hearts of human beings, are powerless to save. Christ lived the unpolluted life in this world to reveal to human beings the power of His grace that will be given to every soul that will accept Him as his Saviour. Man's pride would lead him to seek for salvation in some other way than that pointed out in the Scriptures. He is unwilling to be accounted as nothing, unwilling to recognize Christ as the only One who can save to the uttermost all who will accept Him as their Saviour. To this pride Satan appealed in the temptation which he brought to our first parents. \"Ye shall be as gods; ye shall not surely die,\" he said. And by a belief in Satan's words, they placed themselves on his side. \n\n\n                                 -240-",
