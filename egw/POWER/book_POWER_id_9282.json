    "word": "The Physician to Conserve Strength \n\n     Some who have chosen the medical profession are too easily led away from the duties resting upon the physicians. Some by misuse enfeeble their powers, so that they cannot render to God perfect service. They place themselves where they cannot act with vigor, tact, and skill, and do not realize that by the disregard of physical laws they bring upon themselves inefficiency and thus they rob and dishonor God.",
