    "word": "I am instructed to warn our physicians and ministers not to become exalted, but to walk as children, wholly consecrated to God's service, wholly dependent on Him. My brethren, my prayer for you is \"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him; the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe according to the working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principality, and power and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.\"",
