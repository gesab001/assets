    "word": "President Not to Dictate \n     Again and again I repeat the warning: Never place as president of a conference [a] man who supposes that such a position gives him the power to dictate and control the consciences of others. It is natural for man to have a large estimate of self; old habits wrestle for the supremacy; but the man who occupies a position of trust should not glorify himself.",
