    "word": "\"And of some have compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh\" [Jude 18, 17, 21-23]. Let those who claim to have great light and spiritual knowledge be careful that their garments are not defiled. \"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever\" [Jude 24, 25].",
