    "word": "Now is the time to work, just now. There is not a moment to lose. All national, denominational, and sectarian distinctions between rank and rank, between caste and caste, are lost. The message is to be proclaimed in the highways and byways and hedges. Every human agent is merging his character under one of two heads--the Prince of Life and the prince of darkness. To those who receive Christ He gives power to become loyal sons of God. They keep His commandments. The benediction rests upon them, \"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city\" (Revelation 22:14). The commandment breakers are left outside with the false shepherds whom they believed, and with \"whosoever loveth and maketh a lie\" (Revelation 22:15).",
