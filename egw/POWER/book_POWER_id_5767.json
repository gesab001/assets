    "word": "Communion with God imparts to the soul an intimate knowledge of his will. But many who profess the faith know not what true conversion is. They have no experience in communion with the Father through Jesus Christ, and have never felt the power of divine grace to sanctify the heart. Praying and sinning, sinning and praying, their lives are full of malice, deceit, envy, jealousy, and self-love. The prayers of this class are an abomination to God. True prayer engages the energies of the soul, and affects the life. He who thus pours out his wants before God feels the emptiness of everything else under heaven. \u201cAll my desire is before thee,\u201d said David, \u201cand my groaning is not hid from thee.\u201d \u201cMy soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?\u201d \u201cWhen I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me.\u201d [Psalm 38:9; 42:2, 4.]",
