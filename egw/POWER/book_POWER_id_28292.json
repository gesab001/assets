Van Horn;                                    V-61-1893 \n     Dear Brother, \n     I am happy to report that I am much improved in health. The conference just closed has been in every sense a success. The Lord has placed his own imprint upon minds, and many have received instruction that is of the highest value to them. The Lord has given me his grace and power to sustain me in all my labors, both in speaking and in writing.",
