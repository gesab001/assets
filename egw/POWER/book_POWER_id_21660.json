    "word": "That God who walked with Enoch was our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. He was the light of the world then, just as he is in 1895. Those living then were not without teachers to instruct them in the paths of life; for Noah and Enoch were Christians. The gospel is given in precept in Leviticus. Implicit obedience is required now, as then. How important it is that we understand the importance of this word! Only two classes will be developed in this world--the obedient and the disobedient. This must be made apparent in all our labors. If we could only bear in mind that Christ, in disguise, is constantly by our side! \"I am at your right hand to help you.\" We are to be his witnesses to convince the sinner of sin. No one can be compelled against his will, but he can be convinced. Christ is the miracle-working power that can do this. \n\n\n                          - 42 -",
