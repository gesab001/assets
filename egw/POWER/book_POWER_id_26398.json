They wound their souls, and will carry the scars through their lifetime. The evildoer may see his sins and repent; God may pardon the transgressor; but the power of discernment which ought ever to be kept keen and sensitive to distinguish between the sacred and the common is, in a great measure, destroyed. Too often human devices and imaginations are accepted as divine. Some souls will remain in blindness and insensibility, ready to grasp cheap, common, even infidel sentiments, while they turn against the demonstrations of the Holy Spirit.",
