    "word": "The same creative energy that brought the world into existence is still exerted in upholding the universe and continuing the operations of nature. The hand of God guides the planets in their orderly march through the heavens. It is not because of inherent power that year by year the earth continues her motion round the sun and produces her bounties. The word of God controls the elements. He covers the heavens with clouds and prepares rain for the earth. He makes the valleys fruitful and \"grass to grow upon the mountains;\" Psalm 147:8. \n                                                                           186\nIt is through His power that vegetation flourishes, that the leaves appear and the flowers bloom.",
