    "word": "The Attractions of the Christian Life.--We want to do all in our power to win souls by presenting the attractions of the Christian life. Our God is a lover of the beautiful. He might have clothed the earth with brown and gray, and the trees with vestments of mourning instead of their foliage of living green; but He would have His children happy. Every leaf, every opening bud and blooming flower, is a token of His tender love; and we should aim to represent to others this wonderful love expressed in His created works.",
