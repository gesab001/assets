    "word": "I hope that now, as never before, you will all,-- ministers and church members--come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty powers of darkness. But I have written so much matter that I need not write largely to you. I will inquire why some of our ministerial brethren are so far behind in proclaiming the exalted theme of temperance? Why is it that greater interest is not shown in health reform? There are many who nourish and keep alive a constant prejudice against Dr. Kellogg. He is doing a large work. Why do they not fill their places in the ministry as well, as zealously as he is filling his place? Why do not the ministers of our churches do the very work that ought to have been done years ago? I am glad (118) that some one has taken up the work that has been so neglected.",
