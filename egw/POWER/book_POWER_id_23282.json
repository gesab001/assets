    "word": "Some of our ministers have worn themselves out by loud speaking and long sermons, and they \n\n\n                      -5- \n\nhave been looked upon as martyrs to the cause, when they were victims of unwise habits. Brethren, your voice is a talent given you of God, by which you are to glorify your Creator. It can be put to the highest use, or perverted and abused. You can use it in such a way that the vital organs will be enfeebled and injured. Every power God has given should be used with discretion, that physical vigor may be preserved. The minister must have strength for work in the pulpit, and in the homes of those who are interested or in need of personal effort.",
