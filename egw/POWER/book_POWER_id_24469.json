    "word": "When the lips of a speaker move under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the words of God find utterance in warnings, in reproofs, in appeals. This power is not of the speaker. It is a power given him by God, that he may reach those who are dead in trespasses and sins, and arouse them to see the need of receiving life from God. God works through His faithful servants, who do not shun to declare the whole truth in the power of the Spirit. Their work bears His endorsement.--Ms 161, 1897, pp. 5, 6.
