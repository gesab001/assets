    "word": "Genuine faith is followed by love\u2014love that is manifested in the home, in society, and in all the relations of life\u2014love which smooths away difficulties, and lifts us above the disagreeable trifles that Satan places in our way to annoy us. And love will be followed by obedience. All the powers and the passions of the converted person are brought under the control of Christ. His Spirit is a renewing power, transforming to the divine image all who will receive it.",
