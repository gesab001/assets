    "word": "Now, my brother, I have not thrown you aside; I have not lost my interest in you; but I do urge upon you to face the mirror. Sin is offensive to God. We must live so near to Jesus that we shall protest against iniquity and disobedience of God's requirements. While self is strictly disciplined, God will give wisdom and power to aid in disciplining others. Thus all the influence will be exerted on the side of pure, faultless, undeviating obedience, and no exception will be made on any policy principle, and no unsanctified influence will be tolerated to weaken and demoralize a church. Oh, how I dread to write these things to you. But I dare not withhold them, lest my soul will be chargeable with your sin.",
