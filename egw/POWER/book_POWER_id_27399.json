    "word": "By their treatment of His Word, the popes have exalted themselves above the God of heaven. This is the reason that in prophecy the papal power is specified as the \"man of sin.\" Satan is the originator of sin. The power that he causes to alter any one of God's holy precepts, is the man of sin. Under Satan's special direction the papal power has done this very work. Although those standing at the head of the papacy claim to have great love for God, He looks upon them as haters of Him. They have turned the truth of God into a lie. Tampering with God's commandments and placing in their stead human traditions, is the work of Satan, and will divorce the religious world from God; for He declares, \"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third \n\n\n                -183- \n\nand fourth generation of them that hate Me.\" God will fulfill this word. \"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\" (Galatians 6:7). Pharaoh sowed obstinacy, and reaped obstinacy. He himself put this seed into the soil. There was no more need for God by some new power to interfere with its growth, than there is for Him to interfere with the growth of a grain of corn. All that is required is that a seed shall be left to germinate and spring up to bring forth fruit after its kind. The harvest reveals the kind of seed that has been sown.",
