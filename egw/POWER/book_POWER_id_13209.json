    "word": "\"I am the way, the truth, and the life,\" Christ declares: \"no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\" (John 14:6). Christ is invested with power to give life to all creatures. \"As the living Father hath sent me,\" He says, \"and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.\" \"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:57, 63). Christ is not here referring to His doctrine, but to His person, the divinity of His character. \"Verily, verily, I say \n                                                                           250\nunto you,\" He says again, \"The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man\" (John 5:25-27).",
