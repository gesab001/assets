    "word": "I am speaking to the students here today because I want to encourage them. They have a battle to fight; they have a strong prejudice to work against. If they will do this righteously and patiently, not cherishing the feeling that they are misused, God will greatly bless them. Students, remember that Christ loves you; that God so loves you that He gave His only begotten Son to die for you, that you might be brought into the faith. \u201cAs many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\u201d",
