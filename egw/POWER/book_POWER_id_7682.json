    "word": "Young people desire companionship, and just in proportion to the strength with which their feelings and affections fasten upon those with whom they associate, will be the power of those friends to be either a blessing or a curse to them. Then let parents beware. Let them guard every influence of association. \"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed\" (Proverbs 13:20). The youth will have associates and will feel their influence. . . .",
