    "word": "\"The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy\" (James 5:11). . . . He looks upon His redeemed heritage with pity. He is ready to pardon their sins if they will surrender and be loyal to Him. In order to be just, and yet the justifier of the sinner, He laid the punishment of sin upon His only begotten Son. . . . For Christ's sake He pardons those that fear Him. He does not see in them the vileness of the sinner; He recognizes in them the likeness of His Son, in whom they believe. In this way only can God take pleasure in any of us. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1:12).",
