    "word": "Bro. Andrews, you fail to turn your powers to the best account. Your strength to concentrate your mind upon one subject to the exclusion of all others, is well in a degree; but this faculty is constantly cultivated, which wears upon certain organs that are called into exercise to do this work, which will tax them too much, and you will fail to accomplish the greatest amount of good, and will shorten life. All the faculties should bear a part of the labor, working harmoniously, each balancing the other.",
