    "word": "Let the Christian physician remember that he has pledged himself to represent Christ to others in practice, in character. If he does not strictly guard himself, \n\n\n                        -25- \n\nif he allows the barriers to be broken down, Satan will overcome him with his specious temptations. There will be a blemish in his character which will tell in its evil workings upon other minds, and leave a moulding influence upon other characters. God says, \"I know thy works.\" The moral palsy of evil and sin will not only destroy the soul of the one who departs from strict principles, but will have the power to reproduce the same in others.",
