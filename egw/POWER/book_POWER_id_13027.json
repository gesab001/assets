    "word": "\"MY SICKNESS HAS TAUGHT ME MY OWN WEAKNESS, AND MY SAVIOUR'S PATIENCE AND LOVE, AND HIS POWER TO SAVE. WHEN PASSING SLEEPLESS NIGHTS, I HAVE FOUND HOPE AND COMFORT IN CONSIDERING THE FORBEARANCE AND TENDERNESS OF JESUS TOWARD HIS WEAK, ERRING DISCIPLES, AND REMEMBERING THAT HE IS STILL THE SAME--UNCHANGEABLE IN MERCY, COMPASSION, AND LOVE.  HE SEES OUR WEAKNESS; HE KNOWS HOW WE LACK FAITH AND COURAGE; YET HE DOES NOT CAST US OFF.  HE IS PITIFUL AND OF TENDER COMPASSION TOWARD US.\"",
