Nov. 25, 1890 \n\nDear Brother Smith: \n     I am about closing the sixty-third year of my life, and I am very solemnly impressed that the account or record of my past has gone out of my power and the inquiry comes with earnestness, What do the books testify of me? I want to be a faithful steward of the grace of Christ. His rich blessing has rested upon me while on this journey and during the night season again and again have I been shown your position has been a dangerous one. The Lord bears long with the erring but when He does visit for their transgressions, then \"He will require the past.\"",
