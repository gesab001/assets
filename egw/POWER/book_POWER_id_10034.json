    "word": "The Will to Be Directed, Not Broken.--A child may be so trained as to have, like the beast, no will of his own. Even his individuality may be merged in the one who superintends his training; his will, to all intents and purposes, is subject to the will of the teacher. Children who are thus educated will ever be deficient in moral energy and individual responsibility. They have not been taught to move from reason and principle; their wills have been controlled by another, and the mind has not been called out that it might expand and strengthen by exercise. \n\n688 \n\nThey have not been directed and disciplined with respect to their peculiar constitutions and capabilities of mind to put forth their strongest powers when required.",
