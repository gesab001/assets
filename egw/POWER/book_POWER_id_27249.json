    "word": "\"These things have I spoken unto you,\" the Saviour continued, \"that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full\" (John 15:11). I think there was something said when the disciples heard that. Do you not think that if we had that full joy, we would do as we did when we first felt the sanctifying power of God upon our hearts? When we were looking for the coming of the Lord in the early days of this message, we would praise Him in our prayers and in our conversation. There was not one particle of fanaticism among those who truly loved the Lord and were seeking His glory.",
