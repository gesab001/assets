    "word": "This is why Satan is making such mighty efforts to secure men and women in his snare. He has come down with great power, knowing that his [time] is short. His special work now is to secure professing Christians in his ranks, that he may through them allure and destroy souls. The enemy is playing the game of life for every soul. He is working to remove everything of a spiritual nature from us, and in the place of the precious graces of Christ [to] crowd our hearts with all the evil traits of the carnal nature--hatred, evil surmising, jealousy, love of the world, love of self, love of pleasure, and pride of life. We need to be fortified against the incoming of the foe, who is working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, for if we are not watchful and prayerful, these evils will enter the heart and crowd out all that is good.",
