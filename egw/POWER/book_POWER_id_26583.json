    "word": "\"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\" These words outline our work. Christ has purchased us with His blood. He has opened before us a life of labor and progression. He points us to a path of unlimited advancement. We should improve every opportunity of gaining spiritual understanding. We are to consecrate ourselves to His service, praying the prayer He taught His disciples, and doing all in our power to answer this prayer.",
