We Gain Victory in His Power.--The issue of the battle does not rest upon the strength of mortal man. \"The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.\" In the power of Him who rides forth conquering and to conquer, weak, finite man may gain the victory (MS 151, 1899).",
