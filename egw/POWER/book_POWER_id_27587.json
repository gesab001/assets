    "word": "In this age, a time of Satanic wonders, everything conceivable will be said and done to deceive if possible the very elect. Let believers say nothing to extol Satan's power. The Lord will distinguish His commandment keeping people with signal marks of His favor, if they will be molded and fashioned by His Spirit, and build up in the most holy faith, hearkening strictly to the voice of His Word.",
