    "word": "The Majesty of heaven, while engaged in His earthly ministry, was often in earnest prayer. Frequently He spent the entire night thus. His spirit was sorrowful as He felt the power of the darkness of this world, and He left the busy city and the noisy throng to seek a retired place for intercession with His Father. The Mount of Olives was the favorite resort of the Son of God. Frequently, after the multitude had left Him for the retirement of the night, He rested not though weary with the labors of the day. . . . While the city was hushed in silence and His disciples had retired to obtain refreshment in sleep, His divine pleadings were ascending to His Father from the Mount of Olives, that His disciples might be kept from the evil influences which they would daily encounter in the world, and that His own soul might be strengthened and braced for the duties and trials of the coming day. All night, while His followers were sleeping, was their divine Teacher praying, while the dew and frost of night fell upon His bowed head. . . .",
