    "word": "The coming of Christ to usher in the reign of righteousness, has inspired the most sublime and impassioned utterances of the sacred writers. The poets and prophets of the \n300\nBible have dwelt upon it in words glowing with celestial fire. The psalmist sung of the power and majesty of Israel's King: \u201cOut of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence. . . . He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.\u201d [Psalm 50:2-4.] \u201cLet the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad\u201d \u201cbefore the Lord; for he cometh,  for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.\u201d [Psalm 96:11, 13.]",
