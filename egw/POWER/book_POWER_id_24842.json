    "word": "Tuesday night a great burden came on me. I could not sleep. Elder Smith was before me and my supplications went up to heaven in his behalf all night. I was in a spirit of agony of wrestling with God, and great hope took possession of my soul for him. He is one of our old hands, one of our reliable men, and the Lord will give him His keeping power. What a change was in the meeting! The atmosphere seemed to be cleansed. Light was coming in to take the place of uncertainty and confused ideas.--Ms 54, 1890, pp. 1, 2.
