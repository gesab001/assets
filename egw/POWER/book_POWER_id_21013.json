    "word": "Christ's Words Understood--In view of all that lies before the believer, his piety should be \"always abounding.\"  He should labor for souls with all his intelligence and powers. Not for eloquence and honor is he to strive, but for simplicity of life and simplicity of speech. Christ had no need to explain any word that He made use of. All were simple, and all were understood by the most simple.--RH Jan. 7, 1909.",
