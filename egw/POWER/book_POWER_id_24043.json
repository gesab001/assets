    "word": "Insanity, Sin Species of.--All sin is selfishness. Satan's first sin was selfishness. He sought to grasp power, to exalt self. A species of insanity led him to seek to supersede God. And the temptation which led Adam to sin, was the false statement of Satan that it was possible for him to attain to something more than he already enjoyed--possible for him to be as God Himself. Thus seeds of selfishness were sown in the human heart.--Letter 165, 1901.",
