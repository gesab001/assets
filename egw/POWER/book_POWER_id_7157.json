To God\u2019s pilgrim people, so long left to sojourn in \u201cthe region and shadow of death,\u201d a precious, joy-inspiring hope is given in the promise of His appearing, who is \u201cthe resurrection and the life,\u201d to \u201cbring home again His banished.\u201d The doctrine of the second advent is the very keynote of the Sacred Scriptures. From the day when the first pair turned their sorrowing steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited the coming of the Promised One to break the destroyer\u2019s power and bring them again to the lost Paradise.",
