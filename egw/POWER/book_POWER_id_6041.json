    "word": "Wherever our ministers labor, in Europe or in America, they should seek to arouse the youth to prepare for active service in God's great field of battle. All who claim to be the servants of Christ have a work to do for Him. The very name of servant conveys the idea of hire, work, responsibility. To every one God has entrusted powers to be employed in His service. He has given to each his work, and He requires that every faculty shall be improved to His glory.",
