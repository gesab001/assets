    "word": "Let all remember that the mysteries of the kingdom cannot be learned by reasoning. True faith and true prayer--how strong they are!  The prayer of the Pharisee had no value, but the prayer of the publican was heard in the courts above, because it showed dependence reaching forth to lay hold of Omnipotence. Self was nothing but shame. Thus it must be with all who seek God. Faith expressed by prayer are as the two arms with which the needy suppliant lays hold upon the power of infinite love. Faith sees the advantage of making peace with God.",
