    "word": "Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist\" (Matthew 11:11). In the announcement to Zacharias before the birth of John, the angel had declared, \"He shall be great in the sight of the Lord\" (Luke 1:15). In the estimation of Heaven, what is it that constitutes greatness? Not that which the world accounts greatness; not wealth, or rank, or noble descent, or intellectual gifts, in themselves considered. If intellectual greatness, apart from any higher consideration, is worthy of honor, then our homage is due to Satan, whose intellectual power no man has ever equaled. But when perverted to self-serving, the greater the gift, the greater curse it becomes.",
