    "word": "Now I want to read Colossians 1:12: \"Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.\" There is something to be patient and long-suffering over-- \"who hath delivered us from the power of darkness.\" Yes, we should talk of deliverance, not of bondage; we should be joyful and not cast down. \"And hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.\" Why can we not act as subjects of His kingdom? May the love of Christ burn on the altar of our hearts, and may you love Christ as your Saviour, and your brethren as yourself.",
