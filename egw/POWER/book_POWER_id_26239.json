    "word": "Remember that God has given to every man according to his several ability. Whether his powers be few or many, they are to be devoted to God's service. The Lord expects everyone to use his ability in doing good. He who does not improve his talents is regarded by the Lord as a slothful, untrustworthy servant, unworthy of admittance into the heavenly courts. The good he might have done, the good that Christ gave His life to make it possible for him to do, he did not do. He has disappointed the Master. Upon him must fall the penalty of failing to fulfill God's purpose. Busied during his lifetime with the things of self, he forgot God.",
