    "word": "Let us be thankful for every favor. Let us try to be sunshiny Christians. The souls that I trouble about, fearing that they will not hold fast till the end, I will commit to God. That which is divinely real will shine amidst the moral darkness, because Christ's light shines upon it. To Him we owe constant praise and thanksgiving; for we are kept by His power through faith. We cannot keep ourselves.",
