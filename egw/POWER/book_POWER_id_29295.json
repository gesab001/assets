    "word": "Jesus Christ is our saviour today, and He is willing to work in our behalf, if we will not put our dependence upon some other power. If we are sustained by the living God, the superiority of His power will be manifested in His people. This is the testimony that I have borne all the way along, and it is the testimony that I shall continue to bear. We must exalt God who is our wisdom, our sanctification, and our exceeding great reward.",
