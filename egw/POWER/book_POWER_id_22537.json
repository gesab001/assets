    "word": "The mission of Christ was marked with humility, sympathy, and love. He was ever attentive to listen to, and relieve, the woes of those who came to him. Multitudes carried the evidences of his divine power in their own persons. Yet many of them soon after the work had been accomplished, were ashamed of the humble, yet mighty, Teacher. Because the rulers did not believe on him, they were not willing to suffer with Jesus. He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. There were but few who could endure to be governed by his sober, self-denying life. They wished to enjoy the honor which the world bestows. But many followed the Son of God, and listened to his instructions, feasting on the words which fell so graciously from his lips. His words were full of meaning, yet so plain that the weakest could understand.",
