    "word": "Our lives may seem disfigured and marred by failures and blots; but if their disfigurement is seen there is hope that something better will take the place of these objectionable features. God's wisdom must be exalted, man's wisdom must be laid in the dust. I hope you will discern your deficiencies in the light of divine truth. If self love exists it will prompt you to overestimate your ability and power. You should have a deep insight into your own heart that you may have a realization of your need, of the compassion of your heavenly Redeemer. Should the Lord treat you as you have sometimes treated your fellow laborers in the cause when you thought they needed correction, you would be indeed in a sad condition.",
