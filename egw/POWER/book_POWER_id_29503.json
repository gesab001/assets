    "word": "Your health depends upon the right use of your physical organism. Do not misuse or abuse any portion of your God-given powers, physical, mental, or moral. All your habits are to be brought under the control of a mind that is itself under the control of God. Unhealthful habits of every order, late habits of night, late hours in bed in the morning rapid eating, are to be overcome. The digestion begins in the mouth. Masticate your food thoroughly. Let there be no  hurried eating. Have your room well ventilated, and perform useful physical labor. To young ladies I would say, tightlacing is a sin, and will bring its sure results. The lungs, the liver, the heart, need all the room the Lord has provided for them. Your Creator understood how much room the heart and liver require in order to set their vital parts in the human organism. Let not Satan tempt you to crowd the delicate organs, so that they shall be trammeled in their work. Do not, because the fashions of this degenerate world are taken up as desirable, so crowd the life forces that they have no freedom. Satan suggested all such fashions, that the human family might suffer the sure results of abusing God's handiwork.",
