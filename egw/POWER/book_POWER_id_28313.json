    "word": "It is difficult to know the best way to work in many of the places we visit, especially when they have had work done in them that amounts to but very little. We find many obstacles to be met and overcome, which thing we could not possibly do in our own strength, or in our own finite judgment. We feel not at all discouraged, for why should we? The Lord has given us large and rich promises fitting for every circumstance and occasion. Here is one, \"If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God, that giveth to all \n                                                                           1175\nmen liberally, and upbraideth not: (our weakness and inefficiency) and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.\" This is the work and we as individuals are required to do our part. And we have God's pledged word that He will do His part in our necessities. \"But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\" \"For the promise is unto you and your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\" We find that Palmerston and Wellington have been poorly worked.",
