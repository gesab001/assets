    "word": "And yet how true are the words of the apostle: \"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.\" Many Christians do not have works corresponding to the name they bear.

They follow out their own purposes as eagerly as do the world, and thus they cut off their power to help in establishing the kingdom of God. . . .",
