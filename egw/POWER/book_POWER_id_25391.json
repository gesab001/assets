    "word": "Those who really love Jesus will seek to labor in His spirit and strive to conform their own lives and characters to the great Pattern. In reforms, the Spirit of Christ must continually abide with the reformer. Men may be attracted and won into the ranks of Christ and reform; but they cannot be forced or driven by censure, reproach, or harsh measures. A course of Christian forbearance, of candor, and of consideration and courteousness toward all who do not see the truth as we do, will be a power for good.",
