    "word": "MR No. 509 - A Lesson from Pentecost\n\n     The day of Pentecost came. Great additions were made to the church. In one day five thousand were converted. The disciples began to think that they had a great work to do in Jerusalem, in shielding the members of this church from the snares and opposition of the enemy. They did not realize that strength to resist temptation is best gained by active service. They did not educate the new church members to become workers together with God in carrying the gospel message to those who had not received the glad tidings of salvation through Christ. Instead, they were in danger of remaining with the church that they had raised up, and of being satisfied with what had been accomplished. The Lord permitted persecution to come upon His church, to scatter His representatives abroad, where they could work for others. Stephen and several other Christians died martyrs to their faith; the church members were scattered; and the gospel was proclaimed with power \"in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\"--Ms 126, 1902, pp. 11, 12.
