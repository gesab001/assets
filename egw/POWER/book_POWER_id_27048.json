    "word": "I spoke in the afternoon with special freedom. The house was full. I again made the call for volunteers in the Lord's army. I begged that souls would leave the black banner of the powers of darkness, the black banner of Satan, and stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel. Five seats were filled. Many were seeking the Lord for the first time. A large number were students from the school. What a precious sight! If there is joy in heaven in the presence of the angels over one sinner that repenteth, what joy must there be in heaven over more than a score of souls coming to Jesus! This was a very solemn scene, and many hearts in the congregation were deeply moved. There was unmistakable evidence that the presence of the Lord Jesus was in the meeting.",
