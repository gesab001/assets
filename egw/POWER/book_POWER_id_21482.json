    "word": "In rebuilding the house of the Lord, Zerubbabel had been encompassed with manifold difficulties. In former years, adversaries had \"weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,\" \"and made them to cease by force and power\" (Ezra 4:4, 23). But the Lord interposed in behalf of the faithful builders, and now He speaks through His prophet, Zechariah, to Zerubbabel, saying, \"Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it\" (Zechariah 4:6, 7).",
