    "word": "Hushai had not been called to the council, and he would not intrude himself unasked, lest suspicion should be drawn upon him as a spy; but after the assembly had dispersed, Absalom, who had a high regard for the judgment of his father's counselor, submitted to him the plan of Ahithophel. Hushai saw that if the proposed plan were followed, David would be lost. And he said, \"The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.\" . . . He suggested a plan attractive to a vain and selfish nature, fond of the show of power. . . . \"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.\" But there was one who was not deceived--one who clearly foresaw the result of this fatal mistake of Absalom's.",
