    "word": "Faith and love are the essential, powerful, working elements of Christian character. Those who possess them are one with Christ, and are carrying forward His mission. . . . We are to sit at Christ's feet as continual learners, and to work with His gifts of faith and love. We shall then wear Christ's yoke, and lift His burdens, and Christ will recognize us as one with Him; in heaven it will be said, \"Ye are labourers together with God.\" Will our youth remember that without faith it is impossible to please God? and it must be faith that works by love and purifies the soul.",
