    "word": "God has given to men a declaration of his character, and of his method of dealing with sin. \u201cThe Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.\u201d [Exodus 34:6, 7.] \u201cAll the wicked will he destroy.\u201d \u201cThe transgressors shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off.\u201d [Psalm 145:20; 37:38.] The power and authority of the divine government will be employed to put down rebellion; yet all the manifestations of retributive justice will be perfectly consistent with the character of God as a merciful, long-suffering, benevolent being.",
