    "word": "Every Believer Will Be a Worker \n\n\n     \"God is testing the devotion of His churches and their willingness to render obedience to the Spirit's guidance. . . . The standard of righteousness is to be exalted. The Spirit of God is moving upon men's hearts, and those who respond to its influence will become lights in the world. Everywhere they are seen going forth to communicate to others the light they have received, as they did after the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. \n                                                                           16\nAs they let their light shine, they receive more and more of the Spirit's power.\"",
