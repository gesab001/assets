    "word": "Chapter III - The Apostasy\n     The apostle Paul, in his second letter to the Thessalonians, foretold the great apostasy which would result in the establishment of the papal power. He declared that the day of Christ should not come, \u201cexcept there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.\u201d [2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4, 7.] And furthermore, the apostle warns his brethren that \u201cthe mystery of iniquity doth already work.\u201d [2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4, 7.] Even at that early date he saw, creeping into the church, errors that would prepare the way for the development of the papacy.",
