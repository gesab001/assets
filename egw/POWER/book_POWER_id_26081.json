    "word": "Sister Johnson had no right to enlist your sympathy as she has. She is more at fault than yourself in going to you with her family troubles. You have \n\n\n                                 -158- \n\nplaced too much confidence in her. You have [a] too exalted opinion of her. She does not bear all the Christian graces you think she does. And for months her mind has been directed in the wrong channel. Satan has poisoned her mind, her thoughts, and she has had a powerful influence upon you, Brother Albert, and you have not known what you were doing.",
