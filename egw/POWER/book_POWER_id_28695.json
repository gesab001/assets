    "word": "\"Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples. . . . If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love, even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.\" These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.\" Into every department of God's work there is to be brought hope, courage and joy,--the joy of Christ. Then spiritual things will be spiritually discerned. The joy of the Lord is as far above every other joy as holiness is above unholiness. It gives strength to the physical, mental, and spiritual powers.",
