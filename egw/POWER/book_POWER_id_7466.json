    "word": "A Beautiful City\n     Copenhagen is a large city for the little kingdom of Denmark. It possesses an excellent harbor, and being situated on the narrow straits connecting the Baltic with an arm of the North Sea, it is on the highway through which passes much of the commerce of Sweden, Germany, and Russia. It is the residence of the king, and the head-quarters of the Danish army. In the midst of the city, and surrounded on all sides by massive stone blocks, are wide, open spaces containing many acres, which are reserved as training-grounds for soldiers. In the early morning we hear the measured tread of large companies of soldiers marching along the streets, and wherever we go on the streets we see companies of tall, athletic young men dressed in the light, jaunty uniform of the king's guards. The king of Denmark is allied with some of the most powerful nations of Europe. While we were in Copenhagen, he was receiving a visit from his son-in-law, the czar of Russia. One of his daughters is wife of the prince of Wales; another is married to the duke of Cumberland. The crown prince is married to a Swedish princess; another son has married a French princess; while one of his sons is the king of Greece.",
