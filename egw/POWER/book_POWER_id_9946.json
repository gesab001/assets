    "word": "Law of Divine Administration.--The Christian is to be a benefit to others. Thus he himself is benefited. \"He \n\n568 \n\nthat watereth shall be watered also himself\" (Proverbs 11:25). This is a law of the divine administration, a law by which God designs that the streams of beneficence shall be kept, like the waters of the great deep, in constant circulation, perpetually returning to their source. In the fulfilling of this law is the power of Christian missions.--7T 170 (1902).",
