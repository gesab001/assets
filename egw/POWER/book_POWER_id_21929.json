    "word": "At the Berrien Springs meeting the Lord showed him special favor. God gave me power to present messages of admonition and encouragement. The two forces met, the Satanic influences and the influence of Christ. But Satan fought hard to hold his advantage, and he whom Christ sought to rescue is now in a more dangerous condition than before the meeting. Every ray of light rejected leaves him more surely fastened in Satan's toils.",
