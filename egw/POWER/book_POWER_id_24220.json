    "word": "The Lord sustained me through the camp meeting. I attended some counsel meetings which called out from me the reason why the Holy Spirit does not work among us. It is the unbelief of God and the lack of confidence in one another. It is the work of the power of darkness to lead us to suspect our brethren and stand apart as criticizers. At one meeting I think I read and talked to the ministers for two hours. I needed to brace up all I possibly could to do the work the Lord had appointed me to do.--Letter 7, 1899, pp. 1, 2. (To Elder and Mrs. S. N. Haskell, January 22, 1899.)",
