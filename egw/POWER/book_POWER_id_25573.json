    "word": "All the faculties should be cultivated, all the powers of the mind exercised. Perception, judgment, memory, and all the reasoning powers should have equal strength in order to have a well-balanced mind. In that case you would be a whole man. Otherwise you are in danger of being but a \n\n\n                                 -342- \n\npart of a man. If certain faculties are used to the neglect of others, the design of God is not fully carried out in us, for all the faculties have a bearing and are dependent in a great measure upon each other, and one cannot be effectually used without the operation of all the faculties, that the balance may be carefully preserved. If all the attention and strength is given to one while others lie dormant, the development is strong in that one and will lead to extremes, because all the powers have not been cultivated. Some are dwarfed, and the intellect is not properly balanced.",
