    "word": "My husband has been upon the point recently of separating his interest from these institutions, and of taking up the work of publishing on his own responsibility. This, God would not approve. His interest must remain with the institutions. He has labored faithfully for them, not receiving in times past that which was his just due, that he might give an example to others. He has placed his wages for his labor, which has been continuous and wearing, three times nearly costing him his life, upon the level of a common working hand. God would not have him feel that he must now bear the responsibilities of these institutions. He has not physical or mental power to do the planning and executing for this great work. He should feel that he is in a great measure released from this.",
