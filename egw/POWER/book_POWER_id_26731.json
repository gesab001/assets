    "word": "The use of drugs in our institutions, to the extent to which they are used, is a libel upon the name of hygienic institutions for the treatment of the sick.

I would not speak thus plainly unless I felt that it was necessary.--Letter 1, 1892. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 12, 1990. Entire Letter.",
