    "word": "We are to instruct and guide souls to look to Christ's example, to realize their obligation to Him, whose they are by creation and by redemption. He is the owner of every man and woman and child who comes into the world. This He became by paying the redemption price. If fallen human beings will consent to become sons and daughters of God in willing obedience, they will become one with Christ. The Saviour has bought them by giving His life to pay the penalty of sin. . . . Those who are truly converted will reveal the saving grace of Christ by laboring for these souls blinded by Satan. In their own lives God's workers are to show forth the power of truth and righteousness. The world is soon to meet the great Lawgiver over His broken law. Those only can hope for pardon who turn from transgression to obedience.",
