    "word": "The Lord suffers impediments to arise, that his wisdom and power may be humbly, \n\n\n                    - 3 - \n\nearnestly, and perseveringly sought, and be distinctly manifest. Nothing will so quickly and decidedly separate the soul from God, and bring defeat, as for man to lift up his soul unto vanity, and speak proudly and boastingly, and in a masterly manner to his fellow men, who are the property of God. \"Ye are not your own; ye are bought with a price, even the precious blood of the Son of God.\" The Lord alone is to be exalted. Let every human agent keep in his place, and not seek to get into the place where God should be. There has been altogether too much trusting in men.",
