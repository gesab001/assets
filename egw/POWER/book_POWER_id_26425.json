    "word": "He who has the truth can afford to be calm, dignified, and just. It is true that some who advocate the truth for this time put on a coat of mail, and deal out hard thrusts that wound and bruise the soul. Such an advocate makes manifest the fact that he feels bitterly against anyone who does not see as he sees and feel as he feels. He fancies he is maintaining principles; but he does not cause the one who is in error to discern his error or to become an advocate of truth. By his manner, by his temper, by his overbearing words, he puts it out of his power to convince the opposers of truth. His manner was so offensive and his answer was so disgusting, that he closed up the ears of his hearers to the truth.",
