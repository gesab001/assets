    "word": "Humiliation, confession and most earnest prayer will bring about that which all the devising of men, be they high or low, cannot accomplish.

If ever there was a time when self-sacrifice must be made, when earnest sincere prayer must be offered, when diligent work must be done, it is now. Satan has come down with great power to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.",
