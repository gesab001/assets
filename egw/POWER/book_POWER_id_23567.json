    "word": "Brother and Sister Smith. \n\n     December 10, 1871, I was shown in regard to Brn. Andrews and Smith that it was not natural for them to take responsibilities, and that they should encourage care-taking habits. If they had done this in years past, they would now be of greater service to the cause of God. The Lord \n                                                                           35\nqualified Bro. Smith to be a strong helper in his cause. If he would feel the importance of making God his trust, he would have grace to endure, and power from the Lord to fortify him, that when tempted of Satan he would have discernment to understand his devices. But he has allowed his surroundings to cripple him. Sister Smith has been a great hindrance to her husband. Had she manifested a confidence and faith in the work of God, and in those whom God has chosen to lead out in this work, she would have been just the help Bro. Smith needed. But she has deceived herself, and deceived Bro. Smith. He felt at times that his courage was gone, and has assigned as a cause other than the true one. Had Bro. and sister Smith regarded the warnings and reproofs given them, they would have been saved many perplexities and sad disappointments.",
