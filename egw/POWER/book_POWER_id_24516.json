    "word": "You manifest strong faith in the truth and express it. You express strong faith in God and what He will do for His people. But on one point you cannot trust the Lord; that is, to do your part only and leave the Lord to do His part. You take the work out of the hands of God to do yourself. You seem to think that the Lord has not power to bless a short discourse to the good of the hearer. While you may give the whole counsel of God, it is not all to be given in one discourse, but to extend over a period of labor when you engage in a protracted effort.",
