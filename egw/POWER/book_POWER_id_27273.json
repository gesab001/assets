    "word": "Do you believe it? I can testify this is so. By my past experience I can testify that I would not have one trial less, one sorrow less, for Paul says, \"Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen\" [2 Corinthians 4:17, 18]. We want to look at the things of eternal interest, that we may think seriously in regard to what use we have made of our reasoning powers, whether we have tried to strengthen them with idle things that we cannot take with us when we shall be caught up to meet Christ in the air.",
