    "word": "God\u2019s handiwork in nature is not God Himself in nature. The things of nature are an expression of God\u2019s character and power; but we are not to regard nature as God. The artistic skill of human beings produces very beautiful workmanship, things that delight the eye, and these things reveal to us something of the thought of the designer; but the thing made is not the maker. It is not the work, but the workman, that is counted worthy of honor. So while nature is an expression of God\u2019s thought, it is not nature, but the God of nature, that is to be exalted.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, pp. 411-413.",
