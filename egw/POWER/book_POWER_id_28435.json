    "word": "The two great powers in controversy are working, one from beneath, the other from above. Every man is under the secret influence of the one or the other, and his acts will reveal the character of the inspiration from which they proceed. Those who are united with Christ will work always in Christ's lines. Those who are in union with Satan will work under the inspiration of their leader, opposed to the Holy Spirit's power and action. The will of man is left free to act, and by action is revealed what spirit is moving upon the heart. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"",
