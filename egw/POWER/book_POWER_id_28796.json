    "word": "A word in season is to be spoken to every one in need. To the unbelievers, we must be as the light of the world, as a city set on a hill, which cannot be hid.

In this lower school the truth of the Word will prepare men for the heavenly school. All are to be learners, and in the humble walks of life are to exemplify the mighty power of God.",
