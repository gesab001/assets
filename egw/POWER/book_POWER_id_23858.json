    "word": "Christ was acquainted with the Scriptures, for He met all the temptations of the devil with \"It is written.\" Arguments and reasons would have been of no avail, but \"It is written\" showed that Christ, the tempted One, had His feet upon solid, immovable rock. We are to learn these lessons from the Word, hanging them in memory's hall, and thus preparing to meet Satan with the only weapon which will repulse him--\"It is written.\" All things written in the law and in the prophets are true, and they carry the proof of it in themselves. Nothing is gained by endeavoring to prove by argument the divine origin of the Bible. It is its own expositor. It carries its own keys; scripture unlocks scripture. If we do not see the truth in the Bible, it is because our opinions and prejudices have not been laid at the door of investigation. \"If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them\" [2 Corinthians 4:3, 4]. \"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God\" [1 Corinthians 1:18].--Ms 40, 1895, p. 2.
