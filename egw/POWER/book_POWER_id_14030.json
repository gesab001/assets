See EGW on 2 Corinthians 11:14.  {5BC 1136.11}  \n     17, 18 (Isaiah 6:8; Philippians 2:6-8; see EGW on Mark 16:6). Christ Man's Surety.--Not one of the angels could have become surety for the human race: their life is God's; they could not surrender it. The angels all wear the yoke of obedience. They are the appointed messengers of Him who is the Commander of all heaven. But Christ is equal with God, infinite and omnipotent. He could pay the ransom for man's freedom. He is the eternal self-existing Son, on whom no yoke had come; and when God asked, \"Whom shall I send?\" He could reply, \"Here am I; send Me.\" He could pledge Himself to become man's surety; for He could say that which the highest angel could not say,--I have power over My own life, \"power to lay it down, and . . . power to take it again\" (YI June 21, 1900).  {5BC 1136.12}  \n     18.

Caiaphas Prophesied Unknowingly.--[John 11:50, 51 quoted.] These words were uttered by one who knew not their significance. He had lost the sense of the sacredness of the sacrifices and offerings. But his words meant more than he or those connected with him knew. By them he bore testimony that the time had come for the Aaronic priesthood to cease forever. He was condemning One who had been prefigured in every sacrifice made, but One whose death would end the need of types and shadows. Unknowingly he was declaring that Christ was about to fulfill that for which the system of sacrifices and offerings had been instituted (RH June 12, 1900).",
