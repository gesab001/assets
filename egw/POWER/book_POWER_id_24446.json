    "word": "The Lord would have His sons and daughters reach the highest efficiency in His service; in order to do this, they must maintain the most clear and practical views with regard to the agencies connected in the Lord's economy with the working out of their salvation, else they will often dwell in darkness and doubt, and in their warfare beat the air; for they seem to have lost sight of the Saviour. The Power is of God, not of us; out of weakness we may become strong.--Letter 47, 1892, pp. 5, 6. (To Brother Morrison, December 22, 1892.)",
