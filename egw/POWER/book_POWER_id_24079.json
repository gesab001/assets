    "word": "In the afternoon we met in the office chapel. There was a large number present. Elders Olsen and Waggoner led the meeting. The Lord gave me a spirit of prayer. The blessing of God came upon me, and all knew that the Spirit and power of God were upon me, and many were greatly blessed. I spoke with earnestness and decision and many bore testimony and some confessions were made; but the break was not complete, and we did not have that complete victory I desired.",
