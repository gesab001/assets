Hirschmiller.) \n\n\n     I have read your letter, and I would say to you, Look not at your sinful life, for there is no hope to be found in doing this. Look to your crucified Redeemer. He assumed human nature, and was tempted in all points like man is tempted, that we might know how to meet the foe. He waits to impart to each member of the human family power to become a partaker of the divine nature, power to overcome the corruption that is in the world through lust. [John 3:14-18, quoted.]",
