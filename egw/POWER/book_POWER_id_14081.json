    "word": "Rulers are God's servants, and they are to serve their time as His apprentices. It is for their good that they faithfully follow the plain \"Thus saith the Lord,\" keeping the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment. They are to exercise their powers without partiality and without hypocrisy, refusing to be bought or sold, scorning all bribes, and standing in moral independence and dignity before God. They are not to connive at one act of dishonesty or injustice. They are not to do a base, unjust action themselves, nor to sustain others in acts of oppression. Wise rulers will not permit the people to be oppressed because of the envy and jealousy of those who disregard the law of God. . . . All need to keep eternity in view, and not to act in such a way that God cannot ratify their judgment in the courts of heaven (RH Oct. 1, 1895).",
