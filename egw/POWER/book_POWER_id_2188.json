    "word": "Angels were filled with amazement and awe, as they knew the world's Redeemer was passing through inexpressible suffering to achieve the redemption of man. He who was equal with God in the royal courts, was before them emaciated from nearly six weeks of fasting. Solitary and alone He had been pursued by the rebel chief, who had been expelled from heaven. He had endured a more close and severe test than would ever be brought to bear upon man.

The angels brought messages of love and comfort from the Father and the assurance that all heaven triumphed in the full and entire victory He had gained in behalf of man.",
