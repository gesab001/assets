    "word": "Christ served as a true son, an obedient son. He declared, \"I have kept My Father's commandments.\" We can be greatly honored by being in copartnership with Christ. \"Take My yoke upon you,\" He says, \"and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly \n\n\n                                     -62- \n\nin heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" The obedience of which Christ has left us an example is perfect and complete. He lived the law in human nature, that human nature may receive Him by faith, and through the power given become the sons of God. God's love is magnified in His law by restricting and binding about the impulse to work against the attributes of God, and His great love magnifies the law and makes it honorable. He came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him.",
