    "word": "It means much to be true to God. He has claims upon all who are engaged in His service. He desires that mind and body be preserved in the best condition of health, every power and endowment under the divine control, and as vigorous as careful, strictly temperate habits can make them.

All our energies and capabilities are to be constantly strengthened and improved during this probationary period. . . .",
