If we consecrate to God body, soul, and spirit, He will do just as He said--He will be found of all those who \n\n\n                                 -97- \n\nseek Him diligently. With the presence and blessing of God we shall certainly improve our talents. I sought to impress upon the young that God had made every provision, that they should individually be found in Christ, wanting in nothing. A stammering, humble prayer, if offered in faith, and an appeal made to the sinner, if full of love, if not positively and critically correct in language, if it carry with it the spirit of Jesus Christ, is wholly acceptable to God. Individually we may, if we will, be a power for God, if our hearts are contrite, meek and lowly. We cannot have light and truth to increase with us unless we let it shine.--Letter 35a, 1895, p. 2. (To A. T. Jones, July 8, 1895.)",
