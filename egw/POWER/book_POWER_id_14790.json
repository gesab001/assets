    "word": "All the plan of redemption is expressed in these precious words: \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever \n                                                                           22\nbelieveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Christ actually bore the punishment of the sins of the world, that his righteousness might be imputed to sinners, and through repentance and faith they might become like him in holiness of character. He says, \"I bear the guilt of that man's sins. Let me take the punishment and the repenting sinner stand before thee innocent.\" The moment the sinner believes in Christ, he stands in the sight of God uncondemned; for the righteousness of Christ is his: Christ's perfect obedience is imputed to him. But he must co-operate with divine power, and put forth his human effort to subdue sin, and stand complete in Christ.",
