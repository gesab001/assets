    "word": "If young men and women would grow up to the full stature of Christ Jesus, they must treat themselves intelligently. . . . Unhealthful habits of every order--late hours at night, late hours in bed in the morning, rapid eating--are to be overcome. Masticate your food thoroughly. Let there be no hurried eating. Have your room well ventilated day and night, and perform useful physical labor. . . . By properly using our powers to their fullest extent in the most useful employment, by keeping every organ in health, by so preserving every organ that mind, sinew, and muscle shall work harmoniously, we may do the most precious service for God. \n                                                                           172",
