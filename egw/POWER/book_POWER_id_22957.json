    "word": "Sister White's Gift to the Schools. \n\n     The time has come when the Lord would have all the powers of his people brought into exercise to relieve the situation of our schools. In order to help in this cause, I have proposed giving my book on the parables. I feel very anxious that the General Conference shall act unselfishly in regard to this book, which is to be published to help the schools. This is a time when the Conference should stand before the people in a better light than it has hitherto done.",
