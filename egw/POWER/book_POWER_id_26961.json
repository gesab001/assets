    "word": "The Lord has no use for them. They cannot be laborers together with Him while cherishing the spirit which in the past has exercised a controlling Power over them. They have felt little respect for those who have stood under the direction of God, receiving counsel from One mighty in wisdom, regarding the foundation and upbuilding of His great work. The consecration, the vital piety and humility which God requires, does not exist. Self is exalted, and Jesus, the blessed and only Potentate, the Mediator between God and man, does not work with them. Satan's insinuations are credited, and God's plain command in regard to mercy and tender compassion is ignored.",
