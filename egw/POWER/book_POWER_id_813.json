    "word": "How joyfully David triumphs in God and his relation to Him. \u201cWho is a rock save our God? . . . The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.\u201d He is my strength, my power. He is the source and foundation of all my blessings. He is to be as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. He is my strength, my support. He it is who keeps me safe. In Him will I trust. . . .",
