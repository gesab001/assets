    "word": "Daniel was closely connected with the Source of all wisdom, and this knowledge was to him more precious than the gold of Ophir. He kept his religious training equal with the advantages which were within his reach of becoming a wise and learned man in the sciences. Daniel worked with his entrusted capital of talent. He was aroused by the situation in which he found himself, in the king's court of Babylon. He cooperated with God to use every power God had given him, that he should not be second in anything. And we read, \"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill \n\n\n                                   -111- \n\nin all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams\" (Daniel 1:17). Because Daniel was connected with God, the secrets of the Lord were opened to him, for they are \"with them that fear Him\" (Psalms 25:14).",
