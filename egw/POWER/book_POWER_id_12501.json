    "word": "Preach With Tongue and Hoe.--If you go out as a canvasser and meet a man toiling in the field, join him in labor. Take the hoe, or whatever instrument he may be using, and work by his side while you are talking with him. Tell him that you know he is busy and that you have no desire to hinder him. Let me assure you that the sermon which you preach with the hoe will be in harmony with the sermon which you preach with your tongue, and the two together have a power which words alone could never have. Work in humility, and the Lord will work with you.--MS 126, 1902.",
