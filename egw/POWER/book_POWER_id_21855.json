    "word": "By empowering His people to employ the argument of His name, Christ places the merits of His virtue within the reach of those who are meek and lowly. He will imbue them with His Holy Spirit, giving them power to plead for themselves, as well as to grasp His promises in their behalf. Thus man and God become united in one. Those who have gained this experience do not utter accusations against others. They are too earnestly engaged in making sure that they themselves shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.",
