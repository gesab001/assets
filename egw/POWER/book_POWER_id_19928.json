    "word": "God has a people who will not receive the mark of the beast in their right hand or in their forehead. God has a place for His people to fill in this world, to reflect light. You are God's sentinels. Christ says of His people, \"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid\" (Matthew 5:14). . . . God made His law for all the universe. He created man, He gives the bounteous provisions of nature, holds our breath and life in His hand. He is to be recognized, His law honored, before all the great men and the highest earthly powers.--Review and Herald, April 15, 1890.",
