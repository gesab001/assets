    "word": "Benefits of Exercise--Thousands are sick and dying around us who might get well and live if they would, but their imagination holds them. They fear that they will be made worse if they labor, when this is just the change they need to make them well. Without this, they can never improve. They should exercise the power of the will, rise above their aches and debility, engage in useful employment, and forget that they have aching backs, sides, lungs, and heads. Neglecting to exercise the entire body, or a portion of it, will bring on morbid conditions. Inaction of any of the organs of the body will be followed by a decrease in the size and strength of the muscles, and will cause the blood to flow sluggishly through the blood vessels. Many think they are unable to perform their own domestic duties and so depend upon others. Sometimes it is exceedingly inconvenient for them to obtain the help they need. They frequently expend double the strength required to perform the task in planning and searching for someone to do the work for them. If they would only bring their mind to do these little acts and family duties themselves, they would be blessed and strengthened in it. . . .",
