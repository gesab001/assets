    "word": "The workers are not to stand apart from one another, but work together in everything that interests the cause of God. And one of the most important things to be considered is self-culture. There is too little attention given to this matter. There should be a cultivation of all the powers to do high and honourable work for God. Wisdom may be gained in a much larger measure than many suppose who have been labouring for years in the cause of God, which no man has yet attained. There are men who have narrow ideas, narrow plans, and work in a narrow groove.",
