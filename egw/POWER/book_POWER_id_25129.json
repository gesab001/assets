    "word": "What Being Saved Means--\"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth\" (Matthew 28:18). This power was given Him by the Father. In His life and character He had magnified and highly exalted the law. It was not relaxed one iota to reconcile man to God. Instead of annulling the law by His death, Christ showed its immutability and changeless character. But through Christ's sacrifice a way was prepared for the fallen race to receive pardon. All who are made partakers of His divine nature will be crowned in honor and glory with Him. By the suffering of the Son of God, who bore the penalty of transgression, it was made possible for the minds of repentant sinners to be elevated and made loyal. Through His power they may be brought to the divine level, into sanctified and holy surrender to the mind of God. This is Christ's work. This is why He died for a guilty world.",
