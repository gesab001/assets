    "word": "How pleasing it would be to our Saviour, whose children we are, if all would cherish love for one another, and make every exertion in their power to see eye to eye, to be at agreement. Jesus said, \"The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one even as we are one: I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.\" \n                                                                           1006\n\"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" In what way is our light shining? The influence of our work upon the world, will be affected to a great degree by the attitude we maintain toward one another. When you publish to the world that there is variance among those who are warning the world of Christ's soon coming, what will be the effect upon those to whom we would give the message of truth? Will it increase their faith in the work that is committed to us?",
