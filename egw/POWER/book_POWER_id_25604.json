    "word": "I hear the muttering of the dragon from Marion [Iowa], but I expected worse than this because it is not the men who do this but Satan behind them. They are merely men, but agents of Satan. It is his power we meet in them. Jesus I have made my fortress, my strong tower, and I am not at all afraid. \n\n\n                                    -4- \n\nI am not engaged in doing my work. If I were, I should expect it would come to nought. But it is the work of God, and I have not a fear, nor a doubt, as to the final triumph of this work although assailed by Satan and his legions of angels.",
