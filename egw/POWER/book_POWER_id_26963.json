    "word": "Can you expect that in Oregon or Upper Columbia, with your interests divided, you can secure thoroughness and efficiency, with fewer advantages and workers who are not so thoroughly trained?

The means that God has entrusted to His servants to be wisely invested for advancing the interests of His cause, may through selfish desires be diverted to building up partition walls, to separate the interests and divide the strength of sister conferences that should be closely united.",
