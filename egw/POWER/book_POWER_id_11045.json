    "word": "We need divine help if we would keep our lights burning. But Jesus died to provide that aid. He extends the invitation: \u201cLet him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.\u201d Cling to the arm of Infinite Power; then you will find Him \n297\nprecious to your soul, and all heaven will be at your command. \u201cIf we walk in the light, as he is in the light,\u201d we shall have the companionship of holy angels. To \u201cJoshua\u201d it was said, \u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge,...I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.\u201d And who are \u201cthese that stand by\u201d? They are the angels of God. Joshua must have a living, confiding trust in God every day; and then angels would walk with him, and the power of God would rest upon him in all his labors.",
