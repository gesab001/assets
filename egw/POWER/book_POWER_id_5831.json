    "word": "Ministers should dare to be true, Paul wrote to Timothy: \u201cLet no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in \n141\nconversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\u201d \u201cMeditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.\u201d [1 Timothy 4:12, 15, 16.] The word and will of God are expressed in the Scriptures by inspired penmen. We should bind them as frontlets between our eyes, and walk according to their precepts; then we shall walk safely. Every chapter and every verse is a communication from God to man. In studying the word, the soul that hungers and thirsts for righteousness will be impressed by the divine utterances. Skepticism can have no power over a soul that with humility searches the Scriptures.\u2014Vol. 4, p. 442.",
