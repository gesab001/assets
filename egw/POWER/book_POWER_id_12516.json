They should instruct the members of the church how to take hold of and successfully carry forward this branch of the work [missionary correspondence], [ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE, I.E., IN 1869, A GROUP OF SPIRIT-FILLED SDA WOMEN IN SOUTH LANCASTER, MASSACHUSETTS, ORGANIZED THEMSELVES AS THE VIGILANT MISSIONARY SOCIETY. ONE OF THEIR PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES WAS TO GATHER NAMES AND CONDUCT MISSIONARY CORRESPONDENCE \"WITH PEOPLE OVER THE WHOLE UNITED STATES AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES.\" THEIR SOCIETY WAS THE NUCLEUS OF THE CONFERENCE TRACT AND MISSIONARY SOCIETY, WHICH STEPHEN HASKELL ORGANIZED IN THE LOCAL CONFERENCE IN NEW ENGLAND AND WHICH EXTENDED TO THE GENERAL CONFERENCE. WITHOUT \"MISSIONARY CORRESPONDENCE,\" ET CETERA, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR A SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER (ABC).] which is to our tract and missionary society like a wheel within a wheel. The movement of this inner wheel keeps in healthful, powerful action the outer wheel. Let this inner wheel cease its action, and the result will be seen in diminished life and activity in the tract and missionary society.--ChS 131.",
