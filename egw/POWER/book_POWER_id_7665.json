    "word": "So it is in spiritual things. . . . There is to be a copartnership, a divine relation between the Son of God and the repentant sinner. We are made sons and daughters of God. \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God\" (John 1:12). Christ provides the mercy and grace so abundantly given to all who believe in Him. He fulfills the terms upon which salvation rests. But we must act our part by accepting the blessing in faith. God works and man works. Resistance of temptation must come from man, who must draw his power from God. Thus he becomes a copartner with Christ.",
