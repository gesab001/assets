    "word": "Satan is wrestling and battling for our souls. He casts his hellish shadow right athwart our pathway. . . . Look away from his power to the One that is mighty to save to the utmost. Why doesn\u2019t your faith plow through the shadow to where Christ is? He has led captivity captive and given gifts unto His followers. He will teach you that Satan claims every soul that does not join with him as his property.",
