    "word": "The business connected with the work of God in any and every branch, requires men who are working in harmony with God; for power and success in the work can be attained only through the co-operation of the human and the divine. Without the best of evidence that one understands heavenly and eternal things, he should not be authorized to minister in matters connected with the work that concerns the salvation of souls for whom Christ has died. Unsanctified hands and brains have had altogether too much power entrusted to them, and very unwise moves have been made, that are not in accordance with the will and ways of God.",
