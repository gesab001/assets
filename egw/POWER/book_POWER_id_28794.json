    "word": "The manager and the pastor have their appointed work to do. The Lord calls upon His servants to attain unto perfection of Christian character in every line of effort. We are to see \n\n\n                              -168- \n\nthat our hearts are under the control of the Holy Spirit, --under the control of a power out of and above ourselves.
