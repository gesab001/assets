    "word": "Who will at this time make most earnest decisions to be wholly for the Lord God of Israel? Shall the Lord again cause the idols of your choice-beautiful buildings--to be consumed by fire? Shall the reason be taken away because the God-given powers of the mind have been exercised in strange division? By their unsanctified projects, men have burdened themselves and retarded the progress of the cause of God, till it is years behind where it should be. Our cities are still unwarned. \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but ye would not.\" Satan prepares the way for the doing of many things that God has not commanded. If all had used their powers to the glory of God, the knowledge of the truth would have been more widely extended than it is.",
