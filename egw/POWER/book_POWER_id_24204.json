    "word": "We are too easily satisfied with limited, special, far-between blessings. We are to lay hold of God by faith and labor to bring souls to Christ. We are too dull in our doctrinal discourses upon the truth as it is in Jesus. . . . Come in consecration to holier ground, and still holier. . . . Let the truth take hold of the spiritual part of our own nature, and then the current of divine power will be communicated to those whom we address.--Letter 230, 1899.",
