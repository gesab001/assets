    "word": "The workers at Washington and Mountain View need a deep, earnest heart purification through the power and grace of the Holy Spirit or they will never enter the gates of the city of God. They need to realize their need of cleansing from everything like self-importance, or they will become confused in regard to the Lord's work that must go forth in truth and righteousness. Many are self-exalted, and are in danger of taking up with spiritualistic views that are misleading, and that will in the great day of God be found valueless. Great light such as Christ gave to the people is to be given to you, and by you to others.",
