    "word": "Let those who labor for souls remember that they are pledged to cooperate with Christ, to obey His directions, to follow His guidance. Every day they are to ask for and receive power from on high. They are to cherish a constant sense of the Saviour's love, His efficiency, His watchfulness, His tenderness. They are to look to Him as the shepherd and bishop of their souls. Then they will have the sympathy and support of the heavenly angels. Christ will be their joy and crown of rejoicing. Their hearts will then be controlled by the Holy Spirit. They will go forth clothed with holy zeal, and their efforts will be accompanied by a power proportionate to the importance of the message they proclaim.--Review and Herald, Oct. 27, 1910.",
