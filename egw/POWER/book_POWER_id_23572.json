    "word": "We do not know where to find the people of Battle Creek. They may have an overwhelming array of light and evidence, and we flatter ourselves that they will conscientiously follow the light, when in a few weeks we see them further back than before. The influence of two or three sisters on the wrong side will have more power upon a class of minds than the most direct testimony. If we take merely this one question, reform dress, and see how many of the church have treated this subject, we can judge how they would treat light and truth upon other points. We dare not venture to encourage the permanent location of a school at Battle Creek until men and women shall move into Battle Creek with firm religious principle and a genuine experience, who will be found on the right ground, and who can be intrusted to keep the fort, and who will exert an influence upon the cause that will lead the youth and those susceptible of the influence of the truth away from the world instead of leading them to join their hands with the world.",
