    "word": "And work for the outcasts is not the only work that is to be done. It is not the Lord's will that the greatest amount of labor shall be put forth for those who all their lives have been abusing their physical, mental, and moral powers till they have injured themselves almost beyond recovery. They have been piling upon the foundation wood, hay, and stubble, which will all be consumed, and if they themselves are saved, it will be as by fire.",
