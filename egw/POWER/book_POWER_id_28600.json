    "word": "In the Power of the Spirit \n\n     The Spirit of God is to be our efficiency in the work laid upon us. We must now move forward courageously; for we have no time to lose. Those who strive will win the victory. In His mediatorial work Christ gives to His servants the presence of the Holy Spirit.
