    "word": "The converting power of God needs to come upon men who deal with sacred things. God has borne long with our individual perversities, and has not given us up to our own way to be filled with the fruit of our own doings, and we should learn to be patient with the perversities and errors of others. We shall reveal what is in our hearts by the words we speak. The connection between the heart and the words of our mouth is very intimate, and by our words we shall be individually judged in the last day. \"Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned\" [Matthew 12:36, 37].",
