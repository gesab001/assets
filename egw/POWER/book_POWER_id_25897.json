    "word": "Jesus came to seek and save that which was lost, but teachers do not always follow His example. They do not manifest love and forbearance to the very ones who most need it. Do not place teachers over the young who have no managing ability, for their efforts will tend to disorganization. Those who have mental resources and physical energies, who are well balanced by the grace of God, and can bring all their qualifications into active, practical use, relying wholly upon God, can be a power for good in our schools. The influence of this class will be as lasting as eternity.--Letter 19, 1892. \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. May 1, 1986. Entire Letter.",
