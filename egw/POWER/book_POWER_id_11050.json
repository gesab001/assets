    "word": "When you remember that Christ has paid the price of His own blood for your redemption and for the redemption of others, you will be moved to catch the bright rays of His righteousness, that you may shed them upon the pathway of those around you. You are not to look to the future, thinking that at some distant day you are to be made holy; it is now that you are to be sanctified through the truth. . . . Jesus says, \u201cBut ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me. . . unto the uttermost part of the earth\u201d (Acts 1:8). We are to receive the Holy Ghost. . . . The Holy Spirit is the Comforter that Christ promised to His disciples to bring all things to their remembrance whatsoever He had said unto them.",
