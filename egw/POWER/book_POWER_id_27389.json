    "word": "We are not kept by our intelligence, by our words, or by our riches. In these we find no safety. We are kept only by the power of God through faith unto salvation. We are living in a period of time \n\n\n            -175- \n\nduring which we must by faith be allied with an infinite God or else we cannot overcome the strong powers of darkness seeking to destroy us.

He has not left us destitute.",
