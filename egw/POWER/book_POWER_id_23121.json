Business interests, social endearments, ease, \n                                                                           11\nhonor, reputation, must be held in subjection to the claims of Christ. We often think we make great sacrifices for the truth, but we do not in reality. The great apostle to the Gentiles, we think, from our standpoint, made sacrifices when he turned from wealth, social distinction, and high honorary titles, to link his name and destiny with that of a peculiar people, everywhere spoken against, but he says he counted all things but loss that he might win Christ. Was he a loser by the exchange? He says he was abundant in labors, in deaths oft, five times he received forty stripes save one, he was stoned, was a night and a day in the deep, in perils by land and by sea, in the city and in the wilderness, from robbers and from his own countrymen; that he performed his mission in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness; and yet, sounding along the line, comes down to us from the old hero of faith the words, \"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"",
