    "word": "\"O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\" Christ has already proved Himself to be our ever-present Saviour. He knows all about our trials, and in the hour of need can we not pray that God will give us His Holy Spirit to bring to mind His manifestations of power in our behalf? Can we not believe that He is as willing to help us as on former occasions? His past dealings with His servants are not to fade from our minds, but the remembrance of them is ever to strengthen and uphold us.",
