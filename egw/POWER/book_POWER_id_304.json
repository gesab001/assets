    "word": "Chap. Four - Far-Reaching Influence of the Home\n\n     The Christian Home Is an Object Lesson.--The mission of the home extends beyond its own members. The Christian home is to be an object lesson, illustrating the excellence of the true principles of life. Such an illustration will be a power for good in the world. . . . As the youth go out from such a home, the lessons they have learned are imparted. Nobler principles of life are introduced into other households, and an uplifting influence works in the community.",
