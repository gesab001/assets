    "word": "This school is not to copy after the plan on which many of our schools have been conducted in the introduction of worldly customs and ideas. Physical, mental, and spiritual powers are to be combined to make this school like the schools of the prophets. The study of the Bible is to occupy a large place; its precepts and principles are to be prayerfully and daily studied, that teachers and students may be prepared for the higher school in the heavenly courts.",
