He had to contend against the powers of darkness that He might not be overcome. We have the same battle to fight, the same victories to win. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, \n\n\n                               -122- \n\nthat whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16).
