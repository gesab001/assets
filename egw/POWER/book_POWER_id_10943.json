    "word": "Money cannot buy it, intellect cannot grasp it, power cannot command it; but to all who will accept it, God\u2019s glorious grace is freely given. But men may feel their need, and, renouncing all self-dependence, accept salvation as a gift. Those who enter heaven will not scale its walls by their own righteousness, nor will its gates be opened to them for costly offerings of gold or silver, but they will gain an entrance to the many mansions of the Father\u2019s house through the merits of the cross of Christ.",
