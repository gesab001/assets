    "word": "\"I beseech you,\" says Paul, \"that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.\" \"Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace.\" Ephesians 4:1, 3. We are amid the perils of the last days, and in this evil time everyone is held responsible by the Holy Spirit for his personal position before the church and the world. It is an individual work that each is required to do to cast himself upon the Lord. The name of Jesus is all powerful. It is accepted of the Father, always. No other name will He honor. It is through faith in His name that we are saved. We are complete in Him. Jesus will not sanction sectarianism or a legal religion, which is so prevalent even among those who claim to believe present truth. Christ and His righteousness is our only hope. Christ is our only hope, and He is everything to us. Self must die. Jesus must be to us all and in all. Let self be put out of sight. Let Jesus abide in our hearts by faith, and we will be strong in His strength.",
