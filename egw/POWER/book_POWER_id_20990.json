    "word": "No Abrupt Actions nor Prescribed Rules--Jesus found access to minds by the pathway of their most familiar associations. He disturbed as little as possible their accustomed train of thought, by abrupt actions or prescribed rules. He honored man with His confidence, and thus placed him on his honor. \n                                                                           103\nHe introduced old truths in a new and precious light. . . . The truth came from His lips beautiful in its simplicity, yet clothed with dignity and power.-- Ev 140.",
