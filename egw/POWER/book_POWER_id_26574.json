    "word": "God's way is to give man something he has not. But you have said, I want it not. God's way is to make man something he is not. Man's way \n\n\n                                     -113- \n\nis to get an easy place, and indulge appetite and selfish ambition. God's plan is to set man to work in reformatory lines, then he will learn by experience how long he has pampered fleshly appetites, and ministered to his own temperament, bringing weakness upon himself. God's way is to work in power. He gives the grace if the sick man realizes that he needs it. Man is too often satisfied to treat himself according to the methods of quackery, and he vindicates his manner of working as right. God proposes to purify and refine the defiled soul; then He will implant in the heart His own righteousness and peace and health, and man becomes complete in Him. Then the issues of life, proceeding from the heart, are represented as a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.",
