    "word": "I had an appointment at Petone, seven miles from Wellington, and I feared very much to undertake the journey. We went in an easy hack and I endured the ride well. I rose to speak, but could not speak on the subject I had purposed to for another subject was given me. I took for my subject, \"As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be when the Son of man shall be revealed.\" The discourse was a warning in regard to the closing scenes of this earth's history. The power of God came upon me; I felt it thrilling through every nerve of my body; and the people knew that the words came in the demonstration of the Spirit and power of God. Since that time I have been very much improved in health. The Lord honored my faith, and he has had compassion upon me.",
