    "word": "\"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; from such turn away; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. Ever learning (ever presenting some new theory) but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.\" (2 Timothy 3:1-7)",
