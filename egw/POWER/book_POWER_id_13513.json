    "word": "Usefulness Increased by Church Ties.--Why are believers formed into a church? Because by this means Christ would increase their usefulness in the world and strengthen their personal influence for good. In the church there is to be maintained a discipline which guards the rights of all and increases the sense of mutual dependence. God never designed that one man's mind and judgment should be a controlling power. He never designed that one man should rule and plan and devise \n                                                                           17\nwithout the careful and prayerful consideration of the whole body, in order that all may move in a sound, thorough, harmonious manner.",
