    "word": "Those who have had great privileges and opportunities, and who have failed to improve their physical, mental, and moral powers, but who have lived to please themselves, and have refused to bear their responsibilities, are in greater danger and in greater condemnation before God than those who are in error upon doctrinal points, yet who seek to live to do good to others, corresponding to the knowledge which they have. Do not censure others, do not condemn them. As free moral agents under the government of God, our responsibility and obligation are not limited by the knowledge we actually possess, but the knowledge we might and ought to have had if we had advanced in faith, and obtained the rich Christian experience that would have corresponded with our advantages.",
