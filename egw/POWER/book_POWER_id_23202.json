    "word": "Our ministers in responsible places are men whom God has accepted. No matter what their origin, no matter what their format position, \n                                                                           25\nwhether they followed the plow, worked at the carpenter's trade, or enjoyed the discipline of a college; if God has accepted them, let every man beware of casting the slightest reflection upon them. Never speak disparagingly of any man; for he may be great in the sight of the Lord; while those who feel great may be lightly esteemed of God because of the perversity of their hearts. Our only safety is to lie low at the foot of the cross, be little in our own eyes, and trust in God; for he alone has power to make us great.",
