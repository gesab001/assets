    "word": "As there is no healing power in any human being, we must trust in God, who loves us and who gave Himself for us. Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. You have a pitiful, loving, compassionate Redeemer who loves you, who blesses you. He will not leave or forsake you. He who understands the present and future history of all will do that which is for our best good and His name's glory. . . .",
