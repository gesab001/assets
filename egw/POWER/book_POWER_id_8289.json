    "word": "All who have responsible positions must realize that they must first have power with God, in order that they may have power with the people. Those who devise and execute plans for our institutions must connect with heaven, if they would have wisdom, foresight, discernment, and keen perception. The Lord is left out of the question altogether too much, when everything depends upon His blessing. God listens to the appeals of His self-denying workers who labor to advance His cause. He has even condescended to talk with feeble mortals, face to face.",
