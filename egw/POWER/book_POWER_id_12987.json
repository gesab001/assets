    "word": "How many there are who are now taking a course which must erelong lead to just such visitations of judgment. They live on day by day, week by week, year by year, for their own selfish interest.  Their influence and means, accumulated through God-given skill and tact, are used upon themselves and their families without thought of their gracious Benefactor.  Nothing is allowed to flow back to the Giver.  Indeed, they come to regard life and its entrusted talents as their own; and if they render back to God that portion which He justly claims, they think that they have placed their Creator under obligation to them.  At last His patience with these unfaithful stewards is exhausted; and He brings all their selfish, worldly schemes to an abrupt termination, \n                                                                           81\nshowing them that as they have gathered for their own glory, He can scatter; and they are helpless to resist His power.",
