    "word": "Is the kingdom of God enthroned in your heart by Christ's presence abiding there? or is self still a controlling power within? Whose subjects are you? If a selfish spirit continues to keep you out of Christ's service, pray, \"Thy kingdom come. They will be done in earth as it is in heaven.\" Pray, oh, pray most earnestly, \"Put Thy Spirit, Lord, Thy Holy Spirit, within my heart, that I may be sincere in keeping my baptismal vow.\" Pray that the intercession of Christ in your behalf shall not be in vain. Pray that unbelief shall no longer lead you to claim to be in God's service, while in the life-practice, because of a perverted will, you reveal that you are not bearing the fruit of the Spirit. Pray for the power to demonstrate to the world that you are dead to sin, and that your life is indeed hid with Christ in God. . . .",
