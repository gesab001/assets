    "word": "But anyone who places himself in a position of peril from any motive but obedience to the will of God, will fall under the power of temptation. We are in constant peril if we expose ourselves in a way that our reason tells us is unnecessary. When any one places himself where he has no call from God to be, Satan is on the ground before him, to make the most of his opportunities. We are only safe in the place which serves every soul--in the cleft of the rock covered by God's hand.--Letter 22, 1899, pp. 1-3. (To J. J. Wessels, February 3, 1899.)",
