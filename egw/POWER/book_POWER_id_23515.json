    "word": "Religion should dictate and guide you in all your pursuits, and should hold absolute control over your affections. If you yield yourselves unreservedly into the hands of Christ, making his power your strength, then will your moral sense be clear to discern the quality of character that you may not be deceived by appearances and make great mistakes in your friendship. You want your moral power keen and sensitive, that it may bear severe tests and not be marred. You want your integrity of soul so firm that vanity, display, or flattery, will not move you.",
