    "word": "This work Christ did to show men that He was the tabernacle of witness, that the Word had been made flesh. In the human encampment, amongst the erring and sinful, Christ pitched His tent. He lived close to the poor and the lowly, yet He was the King of glory. He would make all familiar with His character, that we might be partakers of the divine nature, and thus become one with Him in faith and practise. He declares, \"All things are delivered to Me of My Father.\" \"All things that the Father hath are mine.\" \n\n\n                            -113- \n\n\"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\" Why was this wonderful transfer made but that Christ might be the world's Redeemer, the incarnate Saviour!",
