    "word": "Chap. 57 - Testing Truths\n  \n   Truth for This Time--We are to dwell in our doctrinal discourses upon the truth as it is in Jesus. Present the truth for this time as an important message, from another world. Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary. Come in consecration to holier ground, and still holier. Preach the truth with the power of God sent down from heaven. Let the truth take hold of the spiritual part of our own nature, and then the current of divine power will be communicated to those whom we address. Bear in mind you must have increased faith. Our faith is too small. What can give us the aid the crisis demands is the intelligent knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. We want His nature--all our faculties and powers strengthened and vitalized by the Spirit of Christ.-- Lt 230, 1899.",
