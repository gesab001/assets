    "word": "The power of God has been placed at the disposal of the church. There is power for every one who holds the beginning of his confidence firm unto the end. \"The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God.\" It is by complying with Christ's invitation, \"Come unto Me,\" by wearing gladly His yoke of restraint, that we find rest. Thus haughty self-sufficiency is expelled, and the meekness and lowliness of Christ find a place in the daily life. When a man gives himself to God, Christ controls every part and fiber of the being, making that man a power for good.",
