The hours of probation will soon close. Is your work for the Master of that character that you will hear the \"Well done good and faithful servant?\" Remember that every soul making efforts in the divine life, finds every inch of ground disputed by antagonistic force, and he must gird himself for the conflict by earnest prayer, and fight the good fight of faith. He is called to wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. There is no strength to be invested in warring against each other.
