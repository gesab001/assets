    "word": "A most forcible and impressive illustration of the work of Satan and the work of Christ, and the power of our Mediator to vanquish the accuser of His people, is given in the prophecy of Zechariah. In holy vision the prophet beholds Joshua the high priest, \u201cclothed with filthy garments,\u201d standing before the Angel of the Lord, entreating the mercy of God in behalf of His people who are in deep affliction. Satan stands at his right hand to resist him.",
