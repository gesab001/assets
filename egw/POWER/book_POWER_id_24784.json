    "word": "Why should the illiterate man have this power, which the learned man has not? The illiterate one, through faith in Christ, has come into the atmosphere of pure, clear truth, while the learned man has turned away from the truth. The poor man is Christ's witness. He cannot appeal to histories or to so-called high science, but he gathers from the Word of God powerful evidence. The truth that he speaks under the inspiration of the Spirit, is so pure and remarkable and carries with it a power so indisputable, that his \n\n\n                                    -188- \n\ntestimony cannot be gainsaid. His faith in Christ is his anchor, holding him to the Rock of Ages. He can say, \"I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.\" (2 Timothy 1:12.) Yes, Jesus is able to keep that which is committed to him, against the day when he will be glorified and admired in all who believe.--Ms 53, 1905, pp. 10, 11.
