    "word": "God calls upon those who are handling sacred things to remember Nadab and Abihu, who disregarded His command to use only the sacred fire in His service. \n\n\n                                   -260- \n\nThrough indulgence of appetite, their minds were confused, and they handled the common fire instead of the sacred. I testify in the name of the Lord God of Israel, that His sacred work is not to be defiled by workers who mingle common fire with their service in business lines. My brethren, if you heed this entreaty, if you bring permanently into your work the pure, holy principles of heaven, then the great power of God will be your wisdom.",
