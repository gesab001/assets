    "word": "Muscles, Must Be Exercised to Preserve Vitality.--My brother, will you not co-operate with the great Healer? It is necessary that you exercise your muscles as well as your nerves. While you are here at Loma Linda, or wherever you may be, do not neglect physical exercise. The hands, the feet, all the muscular organs were created for action. And if you do not exercise these organs and your brain power proportionately, you will lose that vitality which you should preserve.",
