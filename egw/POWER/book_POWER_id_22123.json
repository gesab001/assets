    "word": "Of what use is it for those who do nothing to long to rise higher than they are? Let them work. Let them rise and advance. Keep step with the great Leader. If you have gone as high as your capabilities will allow you to go, why do you cherish dissatisfaction? Why complain that others do not appreciate you? If you think that you can stand in a higher position, prove yourselves worthy of that position, and still advance. Those who have sown the seeds of indolence will reap that which they have sown. Those who have sown the seeds of ignorance will also reap that which they have sown. It is hard study, hard toil, persevering diligence, that will obtain victories. Waste no hours, waste no moments. Work, earnest, faithful work, will be seen and appreciated. Those who wish for stronger minds can gain them by diligence. The mind increases in power and efficiency by use. It becomes strong by hard thinking. He who uses most diligently his mental and physical powers will achieve the greatest results. Every power of the being grows by action.",
