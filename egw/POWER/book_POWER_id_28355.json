    "word": "What power did I have, notwithstanding my position and relation to the work, to change the order of things in the councils and decisions made in Battle Creek by men, firm, and set, and determined to have their own way?

There is one who saith, \"I know thy works.\" What reason have I to have implicit confidence in decisions in these councils, who have treated the message and the messenger as they have done? Have I not every reason to believe if they could manage to place me in trying places they would do it? They have done it. I have thought I would hunt up all the expenses I have had to meet on my own account since coming to Australia, for calligraph work and preparation of articles for to get out matters that I have been awakened in the night season to prepare, and to give the figures to my brethren in your councils; but I will not take the trouble. God knows the whole history. I am sick and disgusted with the management of those things.",
