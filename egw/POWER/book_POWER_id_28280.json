Ings\n\n                                                          Lt 77, 1893 \n\n       Put Away Differences; Love One Another; Proclaim the Truth \n     (Written January 9, 1893, from George's Terrace, St. Kilda Road, Melbourne, NSW, to Elder William Ings.) \n\n\n     This afternoon I had a long conversation with Brother Foster, a member of the Prahran church, who is in perplexity and trial. He is a tailor by trade, and is a first-class workman. Before accepting the truth he had a position that commanded $30 a week. When he began to keep the Sabbath, he was permitted to retain his position, losing only the day's wages for the Sabbath. He is a man of good address, and has good ability to teach the truth. He left his position and went into the field as a laborer, but was sent alone into a hard field, and became discouraged and confused, and almost fell under the delusive power of Satan.",
