    "word": "Weight Lifting, and Lung Expansion.--I was instructed that there is great danger of overdoing the lift cure, the massage, and the testing to see who can excel in expanding their lungs to the utmost capacity.

Other causes are assigned for the feebleness of the vital organs, but in this testing of the lungs there has come to be a strife for supremacy, as a physician guards his point.",
