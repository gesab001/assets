    "word": "Man is utterly dependent on God for his spiritual health. He must work intelligently to cut away from his life practice every perverted appetite. He is not to say, \"Tea does not hurt me, tobacco does me no harm, wine and liquor do not hurt me.\" These are the very things that hurt the brain power and injure the digestive organs. Stimulating drinks of every kind, even that mild cup of tea, will leave an after effect. Brethren and sisters, when you go to meeting where your indulgences are not ready at your hand, you miss the stimulus and a headache is the result. You are obliged to make the humiliating acknowledgment that you must have your cup of tea in order to whip up your nerves to do their work. You carry with you the testimony that you are a slave to the habit of tea drinking. This is the lust that wars against the soul, stupefying the perceptive faculties.",
