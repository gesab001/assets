    "word": "MR No. 977 - The Power of the Holy Spirit\n\n     The Holy Spirit Necessary to Make Word Understood--Of the disciples of Christ we read that they understood not His disclosures in regard to His humiliation, His rejection, and His crucifixion. But when Christ was risen from the dead, they understood. When the Holy Spirit came upon them at the day of Pentecost, they understood. Look at the change wrought under the Holy Spirit's guidance in the faltering, stumbling, erring, misinterpreting, misunderstanding ones! Passages from the living oracles are seen in a new light. No comparison can be made with the disciple before the reception of the Holy Spirit, and the disciple renewed, converted, baptized by the Spirit of God.",
