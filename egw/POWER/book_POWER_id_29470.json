    "word": "Men are not left in absolute darkness. As the light of the world, Christ addresses the world. His light is not at all mingled with darkness. It is clearer, brighter, and far more penetrating than any other light. His light shineth in darkness, but the darkness comprehendeth it not. \"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believeth on his name.\" He is waiting and watching, taking the imperfect ideas of men, not extinguishing them but correcting their errors, supplying their defective ideas with correct ideas, and putting his own truth in the place of their erroneous principles.",
