    "word": "That night at Brother Palmer's I awoke in the greatest pain. My side and shoulder pained me so much that large drops of sweat stood on my breast and stomach. Your father took me in his arms and cried unto God in my behalf. I united with him as well as I could amid my pain. I soon experienced relief and slept. It has not troubled me since. Friday evening, although very weak, I spoke to the people with much freedom upon the sacred trust committed to the Christian and his high privilege to be fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.",
