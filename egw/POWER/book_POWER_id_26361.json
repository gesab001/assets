    "word": "I allow that you have taken hold of the truth, but cannot admit that the truth has yet taken hold of you. If I should admit this, I dishonor the cause of truth. I believe and know that there is power in the truth, and when it takes hold of an individual it commences to purify, to refine the taste, sanctify the judgment. It will make the receiver meek, patient under censure even if it is undeserved. It will make him forbearing, cheerful, contented, and happy, yet his life will be marked with sobriety. The truth works an entire reformation in [the] life, makes the receiver orderly, neat, and causes him to perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord.",
