    "word": "Divine power will cooperate with human effort. Dear reader, the gates are open, and the glory of God is shining for every soul who looks to Heaven in times of trial and perplexity. How many go to human friends when they are in trouble! But how vain is the help that man can give! Human aid is only as a broken reed. Christ has been manifested to the world as the One who can bind up the broken in heart, and comfort those that mourn. Heaven was opened to man through the sacrifice of the Son of God. \"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich.\" 2 Corinthians 8:9. He came into the world and bore the griefs and sorrows of men, that He might understand all the needs of fallen humanity. He was made a perfect Saviour through the sufferings that He bore in man's behalf, and we through His grace may become perfected, and be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ in the everlasting kingdom. \"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" Hebrews 4:16.",
