    "word": "THE SABBATH IS THE SIGN OF GOD; IT IS THE SEAL OF HIS LAW. ISAIAH 8:16. IT IS THE TOKEN OF HIS AUTHORITY AND POWER. IT IS A SIGN WHEREBY WE MAY KNOW THAT HE IS GOD, AND THEREFORE IT IS APPROPRIATELY SAID TO BE PLACED IN THE FOREHEAD. THE WORSHIPERS OF THE BEAST (REVELATION 13) ARE SAID TO RECEIVE HIS MARK IN THEIR FOREHEADS OR IN THEIR HANDS. AS THE FOREHEAD REPRESENTS THE INTELLECT, THE HAND REPRESENTS POWER, AS PSALM 89:48, \u201cSHALL HE DELIVER HIS SOUL FROM THE HAND OF THE GRAVE?\u201d COMPULSORY WORSHIP IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO GOD; HIS SERVANTS ARE SEALED ONLY IN THEIR FOREHEADS. BUT IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO WICKED POWERS; IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CRAVED BY THE ROMISH HIERARCHY. SEE CHAPTER 25 FOR PROOF ON THE NATURE OF THIS MARK. THE SIGN OR SEAL OF GOD IS HIS SABBATH, AND THE SEAL OR MARK OF THE BEAST IS IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO IT; IT IS A COUNTERFEIT SABBATH ON THE \u201cDAY OF THE SUN.\u201d ACCORDING TO REVELATION 14:9-12, THEY WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE MARK OF THE BEAST KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD; AND THE SABBATH IS IN THE FOURTH PRECEPT; THEY KEEP THE SABBATH OF THE LORD; THEY HAVE HIS SIGN OR SEAL. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SIGN IS SHOWN IN THIS, THAT THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE LAW WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE CREATOR FROM FALSE GODS. COMPARE JEREMIAH 10:10-12; ACTS 17:23, 24; REVELATION 14:6, 7, ETC. AND IT IS THAT PART OF HIS LAW FOR KEEPING WHICH HIS PEOPLE WILL SUFFER PERSECUTION. BUT WHEN THE WRATH OF GOD COMES UPON THE PERSECUTORS WHO ARE FOUND ENFORCING THE SIGN OR MARK OF THE BEAST, THEN THEY WILL REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SABBATH,\u2014THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD. THEY WHO TURN AWAY FROM THAT WHICH THE LORD SPOKE WHEN HIS VOICE SHOOK THE EARTH, WILL CONFESS THEIR FATAL ERROR WHEN HIS VOICE SHALL SHAKE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. HEBREWS 12:25, 26; Joel 3:9-16, AND OTHERS. SEE ALSO PAGES 639, 640 OF THIS BOOK.",
