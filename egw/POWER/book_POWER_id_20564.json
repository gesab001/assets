    "word": "The Work of Evil Angels Through Spiritualism\n     Satan has long been preparing for his final effort to deceive the world. . . . Little by little he has prepared the way for his masterpiece of deception in the development of Spiritualism. He has not yet reached the full accomplishment of his designs; but it will be reached in the last remnant of time. . . . Except those who are kept by the power of God, through faith in His Word, the whole world will be swept into the ranks of this delusion.\u2014GC 561, 562.",
