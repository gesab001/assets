    "word": "Sweden and the Thirty Years\u2019 War\n     Sweden is a weak and apparently unimportant country, in comparison with some of its powerful neighbors; but its history is not without events of thrilling interest. It was from Sweden that deliverance came to Germany in \n192\nher terrible struggle against the papal armies during the thirty years\u2019 war. The imperial forces had swept over the Protestant States of Germany, to the shores of the Baltic Sea, and were looking across its waters to a conquest which should extend the papal dominion over the countries of the North. The religion and the liberty of Christendom were on the point of being trodden out. For years the work of ruin had been going forward. Other nations looked on, but lifted no hand to interpose. Even England stood apart. And in Germany itself, some of the Protestant princes had so far lost the spirit of the Reformation that they contented themselves with appeals and protests, and lent no aid to their brethren struggling against such fearful odds.",
