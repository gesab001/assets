    "word": "Judge Not. \n\n                                St. Helena, Cal., Jan. 12, 1906. \n\nDear Brethren and Sisters in Battle Creek:-- \n     I wish to write you a few lines. I understand how the enemy is working, and I wish to say to every soul, \"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be  judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" There are times when we have to take a decided stand, but, in magnifying the Lord, be sure that you do not condemn and make charges against others. It would cause all the powers of hell to rejoice if our people were to become divided. The way has been preparing for contention and division. Some are in great danger of drifting into infidelity. Now, let your study be to save these imperilled souls. I have sorrow, great sorrow of heart, that they do not understand their bearings.",
