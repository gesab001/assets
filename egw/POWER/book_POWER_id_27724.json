    "word": "Then if we work for others we will not lack for something to talk about when we assemble together. We will not have to talk about our brethren and think of our self-sufficiency, for we will be working out of those things and getting to be workers for Jesus Christ. If this branch of the work could be taken up in every conference and church, I believe we should see in the year to come an elevation, a healthfulness, a different atmosphere in the church. There would not be so many tattlers and gossipers. There would not be so much time for idle tales, and we would see many souls converted to Christ. Why should we not feel an interest for those around us when Christ has given us such an evidence of His love? Why, brethren, God will not leave us. He will let His converting power be upon us. These things will enlarge as the waves from a pebble thrown in the water; the first are small, but they grow larger and larger till they reach the bank.",
