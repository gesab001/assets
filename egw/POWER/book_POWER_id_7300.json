    "word": "607. The people of this country have so little appreciation of the importance of industrious habits that the children are not educated to do real, earnest work. This must be a part of the education given to the youth. . . . We need schools to educate children and youth that they may be masters of labor, and not slaves of labor. Ignorance and idleness will not elevate one member of the human family. Ignorance will not lighten the lot of the hard toiler. Let the worker see what advantage he may gain in the humblest occupation, by using the ability God has given him as an endowment. Thus he can \n                                                                           137\nbecome an educator, teaching others the art of doing work intelligently. . . . The Lord wants the physical strength; and you can reveal your love for him by the right use of your physical powers, doing the very work which needs to be done. . . . There is science in the humblest kind of work, and if all would thus regard it, they would see nobility in labor. . . . Let the educated ability be employed in devising improved methods of work. This is just what the Lord wants. There is honor in any class of work that is essential to be done. Let the law of God be made the standard of action, and it ennobles and sanctifies all labor. . . . We are not to be dwarfed in any kind of service for God. Whatever he has lent us is to be used intelligently for him. The man who exercises his faculties will surely strengthen them; but he must seek to do his best. There is need of intelligence and educated ability to devise the best methods in farming, in building, and in every other department, that the worker may not labor in vain.--Sp. Inst. on Ed. Work, p. 5.",
