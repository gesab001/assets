    "word": "Sister Chamberlain's influence was needed there, but when she came she was not appreciated. Had Dr. Lay regarded her as he should, and showed her that respect which was her due, there would have been no trouble. But he felt jealous that she would assume more authority than he was willing she should. This erroneous feeling was enough to make Dr. Lay miserable, and place Sr. Chamberlain in an unenviable position. When it was decided to remove the care and burden of having the sole management of matters at the Institute from Dr. Lay, and place the burden on others, to release him, he did not feel pleased nor reconciled to the matter. He heard disrespectful speeches in regard to Sr. Chamberlain, which he could have nipped in the bud, but he assumed a stoical indifference, feeling like this: They have taken the responsibility from me; and it does not concern me. Here Dr. Lay was at fault. He knew that the matters did concern him. Any thing which he knew would, if permitted to go on, mar the unity of the Institution, did concern him, and he knew it; but it was a wrong, jealous spirit which led him to hold his peace. This spirit has prevailed to a greater or less degree all through the Institution. Just such a woman as \n                                                                           48\nSr. Chamberlain is needed there, and she should make advance steps until she can take her place by the side of any of the physicians; for she is eminently qualified for the station. She has the experience, she has the right organization, she has the vital powers, to make her an excellent physician.",
