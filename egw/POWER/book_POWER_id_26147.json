    "word": "Dear brethren and sisters, keep self humble, and in all things follow the Bible rule. Satan knows he cannot make us doubt the truth. The arguments of our enemies are powerless and effect nothing against the truth. Satan knows that his only way now is to try to separate very near friends and thereby weaken the children of God. United you'll stand. Divided you'll fall. Oh, press together; grieve not the angels of God who are watching over you. Let them not bear the tidings upward that you are disunited, each one pulling apart. Remember, now is the time that God is gathering His people into the unity of the faith. Will you not be co-workers with God, and press together?",
