    "word": "Powers of Speech Under Control of Reason.--Your influence is to be far-reaching, and your powers of speech should be under the control of reason. When you strain the organs of speech, the modulations of the voice are lost. The tendency to rapid speaking should be decidedly overcome. God claims of the human instrumentality all the service that man can give. All the talents entrusted to the human agent are to be cherished and appreciated and used as a precious endowment of heaven. The laborers in the harvest field are God's appointed agents, channels through which He can communicate light from heaven.--SpT Series A, No. 7, p 10, Jan 6, 1897. (Ev 668.)",
