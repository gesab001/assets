    "word": "I asked the Lord for strength to fill my appointment Sunday in the large hall. I was still unable to eat except a couple of small, dry crackers, but when on Sunday I stood before the hearers I was strengthened, blessed, and the grace of Christ was upon me. Remarks were made by some--\"No one would suppose Sister White was sick.\" The speaking did not tire me. I spoke more than an hour and was not in the least weary. Elder Robinson spoke in the evening with great freedom. We returned Monday and the power of the enemy was broken.",
