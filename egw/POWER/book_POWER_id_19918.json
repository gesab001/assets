    "word": "You [IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST BY MRS. STEWART, AN ARTIST, WHO ASKED ELLEN WHITE TO WRITE A DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM.] express a desire for me to describe things concerning the New Jerusalem. I positively decline to do anything of the kind. My powers would be inadequate to do this or even make an approach to it, and I advise you not to make any attempt to have a particular representation which will carry the impression that it is the representation of the New Jerusalem. The most eloquent representation of the New Jerusalem is but . . . [an] attempt to present it.",
