    "word": "The females who profess godliness generally fail in the direction of training the mind. They leave the mind uncontrolled, to go where it will. This is a great mistake. Many seem to have no power to think. They have not educated the mind to think; and because they have not done this, they suppose they cannot. Meditation and prayer is necessary to a growth in grace. Why there is no more stability is because of so little mental culture, so little reflection. They leave the mind in a state of inaction, and lean upon others to do the brain work, to plan, and think, and remember for you, and you will grow more and more inefficient. Some need to discipline their minds by exercise. They should force it to think. While they depend upon some one to think for them, and to solve their difficulties, and they refuse to tax the mind with thought, the inability to remember, to look ahead and discriminate, will continue.
