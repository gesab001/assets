    "word": "Here are the terms the Lord offers you, my dear children. Will you accept the conditions? The character of Christianity is intensely practical. \"The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power\" [1 Corinthians 4:20]. It bears the divine credentials. This practical religion does not put aside the truths of the Bible as too sublime for common life. Its principles are to control us in all the little things as well as the large things of life, supplying the motive to a high and holy course of action. The life of Christ is to be our example.",
