    "word": "Physicians as Well as Ministers Called to Self-Denial \n\n\n     I feel impressed to write to you this morning, and ask that you be sure to treat all men with equity. I have been instructed that there is danger of your taking a course with some physicians that will be an injury to them. We are to do all in our power to encourage ministerial talent, and also that of physicians by giving them every consistent advantage, but there is a limit beyond which we should not go.",
