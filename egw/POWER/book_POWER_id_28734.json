    "word": "For several months before I left California, I was engaged in work that was terribly wearing. At last my strength gave way, and for two or three weeks I wrote hardly anything. I feared that my brain power was seriously impaired. One day, just before leaving home, I was alone with God in my room, praying for His healing power to come upon me. All at once a change took place. The difficulty in my head left me instantly, and I was made whole. My head has endured the strain of the meeting here and the one at Berrien Springs.

But the Lord gave me special victories; angels of God stood by my side, and His spirit rested on me.",
