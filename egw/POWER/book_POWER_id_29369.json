    "word": "Men in every position of trust need to take their place in the school of Christ, and heed the injunction of the Great Teacher; \"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\" We have no excuse for manifesting one wrong trait of character. \"Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.\" In your dealing with others, whatever you see or hear that needs to be corrected, first seek the Lord for wisdom and grace, that in trying to be faithful, you may not be rude. Ask him to give you the gentleness of Christ; then you will be true to your duty, true to your position of trust, and true to God, a faithful steward, overcoming natural and acquired tendencies to evil.",
