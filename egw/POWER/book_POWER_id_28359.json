He fears to lose or weaken his influence over the strong, stubborn-spirited workers, and his voice is silent when it should be heard in behalf of truth and righteousness. He is an unfaithful steward. The power of discernment is marred, the clear conception of right and justice becomes confused, and the mind and will of God are hidden by the spirit and propositions of human beings under the control of the enemy.",
