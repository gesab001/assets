    "word": "\"When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel\" (1 Samuel 15:17)? Here Samuel points out the reason for Saul's appointment to the throne of Israel. He had a humble opinion of his own capabilities, and was willing to be instructed. When the divine choice fell upon him, he was deficient in knowledge and experience, and had, with many good qualities, serious defects of character. . . .

Under the influence of divine grace, every good quality would be gaining strength, while evil traits would as steadily lose their power.",
