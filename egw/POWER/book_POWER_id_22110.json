Every one who is converted to the truth should be instructed in regard to the Lord's requirements for tithes and offerings. As churches are raised up, this work must be taken hold of decidedly. All that men enjoy they receive from the Lord's great firm, and he is pleased to have his heritage enjoy his goods; but with all who stand under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel he has made a special contract that they show their dependence upon God and their accountability to him by returning to the treasury a certain portion as his own. This is to be invested in supporting the missionary work which must be done to fulfil the commission given by the Son of God just before he left his disciples: \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.\" \n                                                                           4",
