    "word": "A teacher's advantages may have been limited, so that he does not possess as high literary qualifications as he might desire; yet if he has true insight into human nature, if he has an appreciation of the magnitude of his work, and a genuine love for it; if he has a willingness to labor earnestly and humbly and perseveringly, he will comprehend the needs of his pupils, and by his sympathetic spirit will win their hearts and leads them onward and upward. His efforts will be so well directed that the school will become a living, growing power for good, full of the spirit of real advancement.",
