    "word": "I speak to all upon the island. Out of Christ you are lost, helpless, undone, and must perish. You see now why Christ has cautioned, warned, and entreated you to repent of sin, for it is that you shall not lose eternity \n\n\n                                    -74- \n\nout of your reckoning. When Christ gave His life for you, it was that He might place you on vantage ground and impart to you moral power. By faith you may become partakers of His divine nature, having overcome the corruption that is in the world through lust.",
