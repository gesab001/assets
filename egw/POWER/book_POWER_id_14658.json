    "word": "Men are not to rejoice in their wisdom, their strength, or their riches, but in the fact that they have a knowledge of Christ. This knowledge is the most excellent, the most precious, that we can possess. It is the pledge of everlasting life. For \"this is life eternal, that we might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" Money cannot buy it, intellect cannot grasp it, power cannot command it; but to all who will accept it God's glorious grace is freely given. But men may feel their need, and, renouncing all self-dependence, accept salvation as a gift. Those who enter heaven will not scale its walls by their own righteousness, nor will its gates be opened to them for costly offerings of gold or silver; but they will gain an entrance to the many mansions of the Father's house through the merits of the cross of Christ. . . .",
