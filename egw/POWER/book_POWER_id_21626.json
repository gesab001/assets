    "word": "\"Harlan Page consecrated himself to God, with a determination to live and labor to promote the Lord's glory, in the salvation of the perishing. 'When I first obtained hope,' he said on his dying bed, 'I felt that I must labor for souls. I prayed year after year that God would make me the means of saving some.' His prayers were signally answered. Never did Page lose an opportunity of holding up the lamp to souls. By letters, by conversation, by tracts, by prayers, by appeals, and warnings, as well as by a holy and earnest example, did he try to reclaim the wandering, or edify the believer. In factories, in schools, and elsewhere did this mechanic labor, and only the mighty power of grace can explain how one so humble could achieve so much. His life is a speaking comment on the words. 'God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise; God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things \n\n\n                        - 22 - \n\nthat are.' 'Our faith in eternal realities is weak,' he cried, 'and our sense of duty faint, while we neglect the salvation of our fellow-beings. Let us awake to our duties, and while we have tongue or pen devote them to the service of the Most High, not in our own strength; but with strong faith and firm confidence.'\"",
