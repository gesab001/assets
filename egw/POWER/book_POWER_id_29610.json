    "word": "Wherein lies the strength of the church? In unity, in humility, in perfect adherence to the Word of the Lord. In selfish superiority, men would take the throne, as if there was no God to direct and to give power to His workers. Let those connected with our publishing houses, our schools, and our medical institutions be men and women chosen of God and regenerated through His Holy Spirit. Let them seek for truth as for hidden treasure.",
