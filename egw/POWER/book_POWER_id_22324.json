    "word": "What I wished to say to the church in Fresno is, Everyone is accountable to God for his own course of action. If one has light, it is not to be placed under a bushel or a bed, but it is to shine forth through good works. \"Ye are the light of the world.\" They are not to be living epistles of E. P. Daniel's, but of Jesus Christ. He will give them his light, which they are to give to the world in clear, sharp rays. Every true Christian is Christ-like; he is a doer of the word of God. Fathers, mothers, children, neighbors, superior or inferior, must walk as Christ walked, in all humility, all purity, all meekness and forbearance and Christian fidelity, or else they are not Christians. The Christian's faith must be strong, his zeal consistent, his prayers fervent, and his faithful, incessant admonitions must be heard against all wrong; for he is responsible for the salvation of other souls. Teach it in the home and in the church, that all religious manifestations which do not proceed from heart-felt piety, must necessarily be utterly powerless for good. A religion which shines out in good works, emits a clear, sure, safe light.",
