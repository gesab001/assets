But Paul would not leave the prison in a private manner; he was not willing that the manifestation of the power of God should be concealed. He said unto them, \"They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.\" When these words were told to the magistrates, and it was known that the apostles were Roman citizens, the rulers were alarmed for fear they would make complaint to the emperor of their unlawful treatment. And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.",
