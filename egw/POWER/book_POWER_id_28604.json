While I can speak to you in words of warning, you may ask many questions that it is not my duty or in my power \n\n\n                                   - 34 - \n\nto answer. I can tell you, and all our teachers of faith and doctrine, Stick to the Word. 'Preach the Word; be instant in season, out of season: reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.' But never, never make a place for A. T. Jones. Guard this point jealously. Do not even once take any advantage to employ ridicule or to bring against any person or any position a railing accusation. It is plainly revealed in the Word--that this is not God's plan.",
