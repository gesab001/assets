C., to \"Brethren Paulson, Sadler, Jones, and Waggoner.\") \n\n\n     Proclaim this message, for it is your life. God will give you the power of His grace. He will give you the treasures of truth, and the Holy Spirit will make them shine in their original luster. Give to the world the message the Lord has given you. Remove not a pin or a pillar from the foundation of our faith. Preach the truth as it has been given by the Lord. This truth is powerful in the conviction of sinners.",
