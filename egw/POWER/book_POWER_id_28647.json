    "word": "We have a most important work to do,--the work of obeying Christ and bearing witness of Him. He said to His disciples, \"And ye also shall bear \n\n\n                                   - 78 - \n\nwitness because ye have been with me from the beginning.\" The disciples were to be honored by bearing witness concerning Christ's mission. They had been with Him constantly and had gained a most valuable knowledge to impart to others. We cannot be with Christ in person, as were His first disciples, but He has sent His Holy Spirit to guide us into all truth, and through this power we too can bear witness for the Saviour.",
