By unselfish, consecrated lives, through the power of the Holy Spirit working on our minds, we are to reveal, not our own ways and wills, but the power of the love of Him who gave Himself for us that we should be drawn out of and away from our own traits of character to the perfection of Christ's character.  He died that we should cultivate the attributes of his character, and elevate, purify and gladden the hearts and lives of others.--Letter 2, 1898, pp. 1, 2 (Mar. 17, 1898, to Leading Men in Our Churches).",
