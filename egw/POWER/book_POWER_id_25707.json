    "word": "I have isolated myself from the family since last Sabbath, I think it is--taking cold speaking in tents; in Omaha it commenced, and I spoke at College View five times, and I rode out one day in a very cold, powerful wind, and became chilled, then went back to Battle Creek and spoke five times, then stopped off at Fresno and spoke to a large audience. In Battle Creek Sabbath was 1500; on Sunday 1200. This was a great tax to me.",
