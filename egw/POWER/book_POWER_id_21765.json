    "word": "The spirit of domination is extending to the presidents of our Conferences. If a man is sanguine of his own powers and seeks to exercise dominion over his brethren, feeling that he is invested with authority to make his will the ruining power, the best and only safe course is to remove him, lest great harm be done, and he lose his own soul, and imperil the souls of others. \"All ye are brethren.\" This disposition to lord it over God's heritage will cause a reaction unless these men change their course. Those in authority should manifest the Spirit of Christ. They should deal as he would deal with every case that requires attention. They should go weighted with the Holy Spirit. A man's position does not make him one jot or tittle greater in the sight of God; it is character alone that God values.",
