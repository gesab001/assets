    "word": "The hidden ones have been scattered because of man's enmity against the law of Jehovah. They have been oppressed by all the powers of the earth. They have been scattered in the dens and caves of the earth through violence of their adversaries, because they are true and obedient to the laws of Jehovah. But deliverance comes to the people of God. To their enemies God will show himself as a God of just retribution.",
