    "word": "Christ sought for men wherever he could find them,\u2014 in the public streets, in private houses, in the synagogues, by the sea-side. He toiled all day, preaching to the multitude, and healing the sick that were brought to him; and frequently, after he had dismissed the people that they might return to their homes to rest and sleep, he spent the entire night in prayer, to come forth and renew his labors in the morning. . . . You need to bring your soul into close communion with God by earnest prayer mixed with living faith. Every prayer offered in faith lifts the suppliant above discouraging doubts and human passions. Prayer gives strength to renew the conflict with the powers of darkness, to bear trials patiently, and to endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ.",
