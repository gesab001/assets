    "word": "Said Christ, \"As the Father gave Me commandment, so I do.\" He came to our world on a mission from the Father. He came to bridge the gulf that sin had made between God and man. There was to be made a provision for a reconciliation, for a union with the human with the divine nature. Christ would sanctify all who believe in Him. In the gift of Christ to our world, God has provided for every one a power to overcome evil. He has given unto us \"exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust\" [2 Peter 1:4].",
