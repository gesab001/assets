    "word": "The angel inquired of Jacob, \u201cWhat is thy name?\u201d And when Jacob answered, he said, \u201cThy name shall be called no more Jacob [the supplanter], but Israel; for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\u201d Jacob received the blessing for which his soul had longed; his sin as a supplanter and deceiver was pardoned. The crisis in his life had passed. God shows, in his dealing with Jacob, that he will not sanction the least wrong in any of his children; neither will he cast off and leave to despair and destruction those who are deceived and tempted and betrayed into sin. Doubt, perplexity, and remorse had imbittered Jacob's life; but now all was changed, and how sweet was the rest and peace in God, in the assurance of his restored favor.",
