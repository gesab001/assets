    "word": "The Roman guard saw the resurrection of Christ, and testified to it. John's testimony in regard to the life, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ is clear and forcible. After Christ had ascended, John's testimony concerning Christ disturbed those in power. With power he bore witness that \n\n\n                                    -77- \n\nChrist was a risen Saviour. To please the Jews the Romans had crucified Christ, and now they sought still further to please them by placing John where his voice would not be heard by Jew or Gentile. He was banished to the Isle of Patmos.",
