    "word": "Doubles Power of Usefulness\nBy diligence in canvassing, by faithfully presenting to the people the cross of Calvary, the canvasser doubles his powers of usefulness. But while we present methods of work we cannot lay out an undeviating line in which everyone shall move, for circumstances alter cases. God will impress those whose hearts are open to truth and who are longing for guidance. He will say to His human agent: \u201cSpeak to this one or to that one of the love of Jesus.\u201d No sooner is the name of Jesus mentioned in love and tenderness than angels of God draw near to soften and subdue the heart.",
