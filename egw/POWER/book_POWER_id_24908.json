    "word": "It requires considerable effort to climb hills, to get upon the rock. And so we find that it will require the exercise of all our abilities, of \n\n\n                                    -69- \n\nevery spiritual nerve and muscle, to get upon the Living Rock, the Saviour of mankind. It will require all our mental and spiritual powers to understand the Word of God, to understand the incarnation of Christ, to understand the great plan of redemption. The mind may faint beneath the effort, and yet, there is an infinity beyond. You have only then touched the surface.",
