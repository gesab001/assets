    "word": "Never before have I carried so sad a heart as since I have seen the apostasy of men and women who have had great light, and an abundance of evidence of the truth for this time. This bring to me a grief that should be spared me, in these closing days of earth's history. But I have no power to change the seductive working of the enemy. The Scripture has said that such things will come. I accept the word of the Lord, and submit to the conditions that arise.--Letter 266, 1906, p. 1. (To J. E. and Emma White, August 5, 1906.)",
