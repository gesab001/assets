    "word": "\"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\" Praise God for this wonderful statement! The possibilities that it presents seem almost too great for us to grasp, and put to shame our weakness and our unbelief. Let us praise God that we can see our Saviour by faith. Let us grasp the great gift. Our only hope in this life is to reach forth the hand of faith, and grasp the hand outstretched to save. Daily we are to \"behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" If we would look away from self to Jesus, making him our guide, the world would see in our churches a power that it does not now see. \n\n\n                               (Signed) \n\n\n                                               Ellen G.
