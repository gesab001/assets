    "word": "God cannot work through us miraculously while we are unconverted. It would spoil us; for we would take it as an evidence that we were perfect before Him. Our fist work is to become perfect in His sight, by living faith claiming His promise of forgiveness. \"Ask what ye will,\" Christ declared to His disciples, \"and it shall be done unto you.\" . . . \"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.\" Those who see Christ by living faith, those who abide in Him, will have power to work miracles for His glory.--Ms 169, 1902, p. 14. (\"The Work of the St. Helena Sanitarium,\" July 14, 1902.)",
