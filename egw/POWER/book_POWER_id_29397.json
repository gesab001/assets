    "word": "The Lord\u2019s mercy and love are misrepresented by a policy that would hinder the message of His grace from going to any part of the world. Is man to be a dictator to his fellow man? Is he to take the responsibility of saying, You shall not go to such a place? Let us rather say to those who desire to labor, It is your privilege to work for souls on every occasion, and to make earnest request of God in their behalf. \u201cAnd whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.\u201d Put on charity which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which ye are also called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and the spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.\u201d The Holy Spirit is working upon human minds. Those upon who the Spirit lays the burden of labor, and who are of good report in the church, encourage them to enter new fields. Let the work of the Lord go forward with power. Let the people be encouraged to prepare the way of the Lord and to make straight in the desert a highway for our God.",
