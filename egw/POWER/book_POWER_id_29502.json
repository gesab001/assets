    "word": "Teach the students that their life is a talent to be highly appreciated, and to be dedicated to the Lord. Teach them that they are to work in Christ's lines. Students, your life is God's property. He has entrusted it to you that you may carefully study how you can best honor and glorify him. You are really the Lord's; for he created you. You are his by redemption; for he gave his life for you. Who was it that paid the price of the ransom for your deliverance from Satan? It was the only begotten Son of God. He was the Majesty of heaven, and for His sake you should appreciate every power, every organ, every sinew and  muscle. Preserve every portion of the living machinery, that you may use it for God. Preserve it for Him.",
