    "word": "I cannot tell you how many letters came to me across the broad Pacific, when I was in Australia, asking for counsel. What did Christ promise His disciples if they would believe in Him as their personal Saviour? \"Lo, I am with you alway,\" He said, \"even unto the end of the world\" [Matthew 28:20]. Again He says, \"I am at thy right hand to help thee\" [see Psalms 16:8]. Think of how many promises He has given us, which we may grasp by the hand of faith. When we go to the Source of power, we know that we shall receive that intelligence and wisdom which comes from the pure source, which is not mixed with anything of humanity. As we pray, it is our privilege to know that God wants us to pray, to ask Him for help. \"Ask, and ye shall receive\" \n\n\n               -165- \n\n[John 16:24]. It is for you to believe that you will receive. He wants us to become acquainted with Him, to speak to Him, to tell Him of our difficulties, and obtain an experience in asking of One who never misjudges and never makes a mistake.",
