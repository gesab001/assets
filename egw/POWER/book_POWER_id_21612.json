    "word": "Our interests and powers are to be enlisted in the work of proclaiming Christ and him crucified, preparing the way for his second appearing. Lift him up, the Man of Calvary. Place yourselves in the divine current, where \n\n\n                        - 35 - \n\nyou can receive the heavenly inspiration, for you may have it; then point the weary, the heavy-laden, the poor, the broken-hearted, perplexed soul to Jesus, the Source of all spiritual strength. Be faithful minute-men to show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Tell it with pen and voice, that Jesus lives to make intercession for us. Time is passing; the end is near. We must work while it is day. You can unite with the great Master-Worker; we can follow the self-denying Redeemer through his pilgrimage of matchless love on earth. Jesus came to magnify the law and make it honorable. He died to exalt the law of God, testifying of its changeless character; and as we proclaim God's law, we may look unto Jesus, and be comforted with the assurance, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" The same Jesus that walked with his disciples, that taught them upon earth, that toiled and suffered in his human nature, is with us in his divine power. He is at our right hand to help us in every emergency. Let us lift up Jesus, and reveal the Bible foundation for our faith.",
