    "word": "We are living in perilous times. There is need of all the strength, support, and grace that our faith can grasp, in order that everyone may make straight paths for his feet, lest the weak be turned out of the way. I see dangers on the right and on the left. Satan is stirring his agents with intense power from beneath, urging those who cooperate with the powers of darkness to make as difficult as possible the path of all who believe the truth for this time. As finite agents, it behooves us to consider carefully the way of our paths, lest our feet shall stumble on the dark mountains of unbelief.",
