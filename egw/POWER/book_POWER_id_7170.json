    "word": "37\nFIRST THOUGHT OF THE RESURRECTED.\u2014As they [the righteous] are called forth from their deep slumber they begin to think just where they ceased. The last sensation was the pang of death; the last thought, that they were falling beneath the power of the grave. When they arise from the tomb, their first glad thought will be echoed in the triumphal shout: \u201cO death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\u201d [1 Corinthians 15:55].\u2014GC 550.",
