    "word": "Let us be hopeful and courageous. Despondency in God's service is sinful and unreasonable. He knows our every necessity. He has all power. He can bestow upon His servants any measure of efficiency that their case demands. His infinite love and compassion never weary. With the majesty of Omnipotence He unites the gentleness and care of a tender shepherd. We need have no fear that He will not fulfill His promises. He is eternal truth. Never will He change the covenant that He has made with those that love Him and continue in His love. His promises to His church stand fast forever. He will make her an eternal excellence, a joy of many generations.",
