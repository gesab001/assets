    "word": "Some ministers like Edwin Jones can never take a position and hold it sensibly. He will regard matters in an intense light. He will gather up little points of seeming difference and act as though he would stake his soul upon their verity and strength. He cannot discern that he can serve God with power and purpose too in dwelling on the large treasures of subjects in God's storehouse and feed the flock of God. All must stand shoulder to shoulder and step by step, keeping rank and file in perfect order. When there is no real variance in ideas, his naturally extravagant ideas, his fruitful imagination places things of difference in the strongest light which he can put them in, and he leads minds to miscalculate, \n                                                                           647\nand carry things in so strong a manner that he does positive harm. He confuses minds, he buries the simplest and most essential truths by his strong expressions, his extravagant imaginations so that his labors on this Coast are really a failure. They do more harm than they can possibly do good. Now what to do with cases of this character is a question. I believe him to be perfectly honest, but there is such a strength of imagination, such wonderfully strong expressions that his brethren are really afraid to put him to labor anywhere.",
