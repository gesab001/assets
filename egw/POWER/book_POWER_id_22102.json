    "word": "The Need of Thoroughness and Growth \n                   of the Ministry. \n\n\n     While some ministers carry but little burden, and go light-loaded, others are pressed as a cart beneath sheaves, because they realize the responsibility of the work. While these are wearing, there are others who are not expanding, whose souls are not enlarged by the Spirit of God, and who are not growing at all. They are simply drifting. They do not lack capability, but they are not willing to train their ability to do the highest service for the Master. Thus some laborers are worked nearly to death, while others are weak in moral power and feeble in experience, because they do not feel the importance of growing in grace.",
