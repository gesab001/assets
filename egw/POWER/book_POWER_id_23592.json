    "word": "Appetite exerts a controlling influence in the world. Unlawful indulgence in appetite and passion paralyzes the brain power, and deadens all the moral sensibilities and perceptions. But we have all been bought with a price, even with the precious blood of the Son of God, and we have no right to abuse our powers by the selfish gratification of lust. \"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.\" 1 Peter 1:18, 19. \"For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" 1 Corinthians 6:20. We should keep ourselves in a condition to render to God the most perfect service possible. With an eye single to His glory, we should seek to live in harmony with the laws of our being. \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\" 1 Corinthians 10:31.",
