    "word": "12. A Healthful Religious Experience.--\"I know whom I have believed.\" He [Paul] does not live under a cloud of doubt, groping his way in the mist and darkness of uncertainty, complaining of hardship and trials. A voice of gladness, strong with hope and courage, sounds all along the line down to our time. Paul had a healthful religious experience. The love of Christ was his grand theme, and the constraining power that governed him (RH Sept. 8, 1885).",
