    "word": "There are those who will, through hasty, unadvised moves, betray the cause of God into the enemy\u2019s power. There will be people who will seek to be revenged, who will become apostates and betray Christ in the person of His saints. All need to learn discretion; then there is danger on the other hand of being conservative, of giving away to the enemy in concession. Our brethren and sisters should be very cautious in this matter for the honor of God. . . . The two armies will stand distinct and separate, and this distinction will be so marked that many who shall be convinced of truth will come on the side of God\u2019s commandment-keeping people.\u2014Manuscript 6, 1889.",
