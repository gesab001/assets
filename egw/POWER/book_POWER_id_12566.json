    "word": "The religion of Jesus softens whatever is hard and rough in the temper, and smooths whatever is rugged and sharp in the manners. It makes the words gentle and the demeanor winning.

A kind, courteous Christian is the most powerful argument that can be produced in favor of Christianity.",
