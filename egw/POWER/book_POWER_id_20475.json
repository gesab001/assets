    "word": "It was Christ, \u201cthe Angel of the covenant,\u201d who had revealed Himself to Jacob. The patriarch was now disabled, and suffering the keenest pain, but he would not loosen his hold. . . . He must have the assurance that his sin was pardoned. . . . The Angel tried to release Himself; He urged, \u201cLet me go, for the day breaketh\u201d: but Jacob answered, \u201cI will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\u201d Had this been a boastful, presumptuous confidence, Jacob would have been instantly destroyed; but his was the assurance of one who confesses his own unworthiness, yet trusts the faithfulness of a covenant-keeping God. Jacob \u201chad power over the Angel, and prevailed.\u201d . . .",
