    "word": "Christians must be light-givers, holding forth the words of life. They are exhorted by the apostle to the highest achievements of piety. The world will not be convinced by what the pulpit teaches, but by what the church lives. The path to heaven is dark or bright, just in proportion as the church gives forth a clear and strong, or doubtful, fitful light. The preacher in the desk announces the theory of the gospel, but the practical piety of the church demonstrates the power of truth, showing its real value.",
