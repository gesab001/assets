    "word": "By wrong habits, he is making of himself a complete wreck. His neglect to cultivate pure, clean, healthful principles, in order that harmonious action may be preserved, that he may be a sound man, will leave him in the control of habits that will ruin his peace. Happiness he cannot have. For a time he is elated under the stimulus of alcohol, but it is followed by \n\n\n                                 -133- \n\nsluggish movements of the brain. His indulgence in unnatural habits has destroyed the harmonious action of all the parts of the being. His years of taxing study are lost, for he has ruined himself.
