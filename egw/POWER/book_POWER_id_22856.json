He felt willing to suffer any death for his Lord. Peter saw that John was following, and a desire came over him to know his future, and he \"saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.\" Peter should have considered that his Lord would reveal to him all that it was best for him to know, without inquiry on his part.

The future of both John and Peter was in the hands of their Lord, and obedience in following him was the duty required of each.",
