    "word": "Gospel Is Cure for Sin-originated Maladies.--When the gospel is received in its purity and power, it is a cure for the maladies that originated in sin. The Sun of righteousness arises \"with healing in His wings\" (Malachi 4:2). Not all that this world bestows can heal a broken heart, or impart peace of mind, or remove care, or banish disease. Fame, genius, talent--all are powerless to gladden the sorrowful heart or to restore the wasted life. The life of God in the soul is man's only hope.--MH 115 (1905).",
