    "word": "God wants heart-work. The unselfish purpose, the pure, elevated principle, the high and holy motive, God will accept. His grace and power will work with these efforts. All who realize that it is the work of God to prepare a people for his coming, will find in their disinterested efforts opportunities where they can do tract and missionary labor. But there may be too much means expended and too much time occupied in making matters so fine and so minute that the heart-work is neglected, and a dry form preserved.",
