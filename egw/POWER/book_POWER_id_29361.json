    "word": "It was presented to me that there were poor men whose only means of obtaining a livelihood was their brain work. There are men who have not grown up with our institutions, and been benefited by the instruction which God has given from time to time, business men who will not incorporate in their business management the religion and spirit of Christ. They would separate religion, in a large degree from their business; therefore, even the Publishing Association should not be an all-controlling power. Individual talent and individual right must be respected. Should rules be established and arrangements entered into to invest the benefits of personal talent in the Publishing Association, other important interests would be crippled. Men would at times have a controlling power in connection with the Publishing Association who would not have compassion, and guard the interests of those in poverty and distress. There would be one iron rule, after the policy of the world rather than after the spirit of Christ, to bear upon all. The principles established would mean more to others than to us, therefore, we must be guarded in every decision.",
