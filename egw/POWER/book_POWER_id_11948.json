    "word": "OUR CHARACTERS MAY BE TRANSFORMED.\u2014The change we need is a change of heart, and can only be obtained by seeking God individually for His blessing, by pleading with Him for His power, by fervently praying that His grace may come upon us, and that our characters\n95\nmay be transformed. This is the change we need today, and for the attainment of this experience we should exercise persevering energy and manifest heartfelt earnestness. We should ask with true sincerity, \u201cWhat shall I do to be saved?\u201d We should know just what steps we are taking heavenward.\u2014(Selected Messages, bk. 1, 187.)",
