    "word": "It was not part of the mission of Christ to exercise His divine power for His own benefit, to relieve Himself of\n43\nsuffering. This He had volunteered to take upon Himself. He had condescended to take man's nature, and He was to suffer the inconveniences, ills, and afflictions of the human family. He was not to perform miracles on His own account; He came to save others. The object of His mission was to bring blessings, hope, and life to the afflicted and oppressed. He was to bear the burdens and griefs of suffering humanity.",
