They should realize that it is their duty to promote the happiness one of another. If we will be learners, Christ will be our Teacher. He will train us to make manifest His goodness, mercy, and love. Every soul who will become consecrated to Him will be a channel through whom His love can flow, will be an agent cooperating with divine intelligences, and will find his own happiness increased as he seeks to impart happiness to others.

Each one forms a part of the great world of humanity, and through our individual influence we are linked to the universe.",
