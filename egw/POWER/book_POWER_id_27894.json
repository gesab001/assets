    "word": "Great and precious promises are to be kept before God's people that they may have every confidence in God. Then let no decision be made by this Conference to get in the way of the work of the Lord, give Satan's agents a chance to be provoked and present the rash ones as the representatives of our people. They will have power to present these matters in an exaggerated light, that in the place of these persons removing prejudice and enlightening minds, the prejudice is strengthened and deepened, and the case of God's people made far worse, and our means of bringing the truth before the people who are in darkness is cut off.",
