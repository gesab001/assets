    "word": "The Saviour will reflect upon these self-sacrificing women the light of His countenance, and this will give them a power that will exceed that of man. They can do in families a work that men can not do, a work that reaches the inner life They can come close to the hearts of those whom men can not reach. Their work is needed. Discreet and humble women can do a good work in explaining the truth to the people in their homes. The word of God thus explained will do its leavening work, and through its influence whole families will be converted. 9T 128, 129.",
