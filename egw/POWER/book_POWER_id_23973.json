    "word": "Christ will soon come the second time in power and great glory, not as He appeared the first time, when he wept over Jerusalem as the western sun was about to set. Christ was a Sun and a Light to that people, but that Light was about to be withdrawn because of the stubbornness of those whom Christ had come to redeem. The disciples expected to see Jesus rejoice over the city as He approached it, but what a disappointment when they saw His anguish of soul and His tears, and heard His broken utterances as He spoke these solemn words: \"If thou hadst known, even thou, . . . the things which belong unto thy peace!\" Luke 19:42.",
