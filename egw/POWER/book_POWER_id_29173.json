    "word": "The theories that lead to unbelief in the Word of God, and to a lack of the faith that works by love and purifies the soul, are \n\n82. \n\ntheories of the enemy. They may be very pleasing, and very attractive, but they develop into strange doctrines, which unsettle faith in the past experience of God's people, and take away the foundation pillars. These theories have come in amongst us, and have been a seductive power, robbing some of the faith that enables human beings to see where they are living in the history of the world. They are false theories, leading away from the truth into subtle errors.",
