    "word": "It is not safe for us to linger to contemplate the advantages to be reaped through yielding to Satan\u2019s suggestions. Sin means dishonor \n301\nand disaster to every soul that indulges in it; but it is blinding and deceiving in its nature, and it will entice us with flattering presentations. If we venture on Satan\u2019s ground we have no assurance of protection from his power. So far as in us lies, we should close every avenue by which the tempter may find access to us.",
