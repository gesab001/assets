    "word": "If Bro. Gage was, with his good qualifications, well balanced and faithful as foreman of the Office, his labor would be of great value to the Office, and he could earn double wages. But for the past years, considering his deficiency, with his unconsecrated influence, the Office could better afford to do without him, even if his services could be had for nothing. Bro. and sister Gage have not learned the lesson of economy. The gratification of the taste and desire for pleasure and display has had an overpowering influence upon them. Small wages would be of more advantage to them than large, for they would use all, were it never so much, as they pass along. They would enjoy as they go, and then when affliction draws upon them, would be wholly unprepared. Twenty dollars a week would be laid out about the same as twelve. Had Bro. and sister Gage been economical managers, denying themselves, they could ere this have had a home of their own, and besides this, means to draw upon in case of adversity. But they will not economize as others have done, upon whom they have sometimes been dependent. If they neglect to learn these lessons, their character will not be found perfect in the day of God.",
