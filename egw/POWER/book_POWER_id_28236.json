White. \n                                                                -\n \n                               (Continued.) \n                                                                -\n \n     What more can I say than I have said to impress upon our churches, and especially upon the church at Battle Creek, the eternal loss they are liable to in not arousing and putting to use the executive ability that God has given them? If the members of the churches would but put to work the powers of mind that they have, in well-directed efforts, in well-matured plans, they might do a hundredfold more for Christ than they are now doing. If they went forth with earnest prayer, with meekness and lowliness of heart, seeking personally to impart to others the knowledge of salvation, the message might reach the inhabitants of the earth. How many more messages of reproof and warning must the Lord send to his chosen people before they will obey? I tell you in the name of the Lord Jesus, who gave his life for the life of the world, that as a people we are behind our privileges and opportunities. What rich feasts have been provided for the people of Battle Creek! What opportunities have been given them! The people have been convinced that they should be laborers together with God, but have they been converted to the idea! The dangers of their course, the duties required at their hands, have all been presented; earnest appeals have been made to their understanding and to their conscience, and light has been given them so that they are without excuse. They can have no cloak for their sinful neglect, but the Lord does not urge men and women to the work by presenting to them flattering inducements. They can work for him only as they work willingly, giving hearty co-operation.",
