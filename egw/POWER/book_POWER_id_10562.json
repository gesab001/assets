    "word": "A lamp, however small, if kept steadily burning, may be the means of lighting many other lamps. Our sphere of influence may seem narrow, our ability small, our opportunities few, our acquirements limited; yet wonderful possibilities are ours through a faithful use of the opportunities of our own homes.

From our homes will flow streams of healing, bringing life, and beauty, and fruitfulness. \n\n\n                      *      *      *      *      *",
