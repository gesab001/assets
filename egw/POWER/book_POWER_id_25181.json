    "word": "We arrived at Emporia about seven o'clock. We engaged an omnibus to take us to the campground, about two miles. Four powerful horses were put before the bus and we were carried speedily to camp. All seemed glad to meet us. We pitched our tent and one and another brought us a piece of bedding, so we had a passably comfortable bed.--Ms. 4. 1879, pp. 4, 5. (Diary entry.)",
