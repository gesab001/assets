    "word": "MR No. 989 - Jesus, Comforter of the Afflicted\n\n     We are sorry to learn of your affliction. If we were anywhere within reach, we would visit you. Your daughter has been with us, more or less, for a few weeks. It seems like being at home [having] your daughter and Brother Farnsworth, Elders Haskell and Starr [with us]. Your daughter has told us of your protracted sickness. We can sympathize with you, and pray for you, and this is all that it is in our power to do. Christ said to Nathanael, in answer to his question, \"How knowest Thou me?\" \"Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee\" [John 1:45]. We see here that Christ saw Nathanael before Nathanael saw Christ.",
