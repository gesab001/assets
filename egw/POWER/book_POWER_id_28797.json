    "word": "In humility all are to become living, eloquent commentaries on the words that God hath spoken: \"God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.\" There is power for all \n\n\n                             -170- \n\nwho will seek it. Let us yield our God given faculties to Him who is our sanctification and our redemption. We shall have faith, if we have strong confidence in God.",
