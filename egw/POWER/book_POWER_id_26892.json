    "word": "The school here seems to be moving smoothly. Brother Butcher has sold out, and we intend to go to Vacaville if the roads are not too bad. I have two powerful horses that can take me across the country. We have had much rain, and it has made the roads bad in some places. The last I heard of Elder Whitney was that he was some better, and yet they entertained little hope of his recovery. I now must close my letter. I have written this after having written much today, so if you see mistakes, as I know you must, excuse me. Love to you all in Jesus Christ. \n\n\n\n\n\nEllen G. White Estate \nSilver Spring, Maryland \nApril 18, 1991. Entire Letter.",
