    "word": "Chap. 2 - Consolidation of the Publishing Work\n\n\n Important Principles in Institutional \n                Organization \n\n\n     The subject of consolidating our publishing work, to bring it under one management, has been presented to me, and I have been shown what the outcome would be. It would result in bringing all the publishing houses under the control of a man-made power at Battle Creek, which already has far to extensive a rule. It will be urged that since the publishing interest in Battle Creek is under the supervision of the General Conference, matters are placed on a different basis, and that the objections to consolidation are removed. But the same influences that have been leading away from the principles upon which our publishing institutions were founded, are still working. There is a change of name, but to a great degree the management is the same. It is no time for any institution among us to act out the principles of Rome in seeking to bring everything under its own control. . . .",
