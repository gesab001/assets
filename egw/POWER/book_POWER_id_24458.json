    "word": "\"Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit.\" We are ordained unto God to bear fruit. Was this not our experience when we were led down into the water and baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost? What did that mean?--It meant that the three great powers in heaven were pledged to keep us so long as we remain one with Christ, united to the vine.--Ms 37, 1908, p. 6.
