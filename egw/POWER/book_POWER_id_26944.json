    "word": "I have a message to bear to the people. Come out from the world and be ye separate. How then shall we become, as Christ has declared, a light unto the world? In the customs and ambitious practices of the world, we have no part. In their selfish ideas, we take no part. But in this very coming out, in separating from their idolatrous practices, we are witnessing to the truth. In the world, and yet not of the world. It is our work as Christians to manifest to the world a power of true godliness. We are to obey the injunction of Christ to deny ourselves, to take up the cross, and follow Him.",
