Those who come to the institution are to see that in it the fear of the Lord is known to be the beginning of wisdom. When the banner of truth is no longer the honored, respected banner of the institution, the Lord will withdraw from the institution His keeping power. Letter 41, 1900, pp. 3, 5, 7, 9.
