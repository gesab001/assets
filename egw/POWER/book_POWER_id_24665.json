    "word": "MR No. 459 - The Whites in Colorado\n\n     The mountain scenery of Colorado can never be described so that the imagination can gather distinct and correct ideas of this country. It is wonderful! It is marvelous! The scenery of the grand old mountains, some bald and others covered with trees! Instinctively the mind is awed and deep feelings of reverence bow the soul in humiliation as the imagination gathers a sense of the power of the Infinite. I would not be deprived of the privilege of seeing what I have of the mountain scenery of Colorado for considerable.--Letter 12, 1872, pp. 2, 3. (To Edson and Emma White, July 31, 1872.) \n\nReleased November 10, 1975.",
