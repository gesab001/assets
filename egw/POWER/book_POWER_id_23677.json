    "word": "The messengers that God sends are as light in a dark place. Through Christ, God is establishing a kingdom in this world. As God's people reveal Him in good works, they become the light of the world. As they work under Christ's counsel, and bear a living testimony to the truth, they will be sustained against the power and craft of Satan, which will increase as we near the time of Christ's second appearing. God's witnesses are to hold firmly to the word of the Lord, which is to shine amid the moral darkness till the very close of this earth's history.",
