    "word": "As Christ sent His disciples forth He gave them their commission: \"When He had called unto Him His twelve disciples, He gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease\" [Matthew 10:1]. This is just as verily a part of the work of those who proclaim the gospel message as is ministering to the spiritual needs of the being. Christ's messengers are to act in His stead in behalf of their fellow-men. In this age of the world, when Satan is stirred by a power from beneath to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, the Saviour is waiting to cooperate with His servants.",
