    "word": "It was an insult to God when David numbered Israel. God\u2019s rebuke rested upon him, for he made himself as God, as though he could tell the strength of the armies of Israel by their numbers. \u201cThis is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d God looks not on the numbers of Israel for the success of His work. His armies number thousands of thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. These cooperate with the people who will connect with God to be channels of light.\u2014Manuscript 17, 1898.",
