    "word": "Perseverance in the acquisition of knowledge, controlled by the fear and love of God, will give the youth increased power for good in this life; and those who make the most of their opportunities to reach high attainments will take these attainments with them into the future life.

The ability to appreciate the glories that \"eye hath not seen, nor ear heard\" (1 Corinthians 2:9), will be proportionate to the attainments reached.",
