    "word": "There is no reason why the Huntsville School and farm should show so little improvement. The Lord looks upon the neglect and charges it to the men who have failed to do their work. It is time that the Board awoke to their duty. The true application of the gospel removes all this spiritual apathy. The Lord calls for fresh power to be brought in by a change of men. No longer let the years pass without new capabilities being brought in\u2014men who will introduce new methods and who will work with determined missionary spirit for the colored people. This school should be enlarging. This can be done and should be done.",
