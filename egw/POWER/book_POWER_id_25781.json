    "word": "Satan well knows that all his strength, together with that of his angels and evil men, is but weakness when opposed to the faithful, united servants of the great King, even though they may be few. In order to overcome the people of God, Satan will work upon elements in the character which have not been transformed by the grace of Christ; he will make these the controlling power of the life. Unless these persons are converted, their own souls will be lost, and others who looked up to them as men led of God will be destroyed with them because they become guilty with them. Satan endeavors to create suspicion, envy, and jealousy, leading men to question those things that it would be for their souls' interest to believe. The suspicious ones will misconstrue everything. They will call an atom a world, and a world an atom. If this spirit is allowed to prevail, it will demoralize our churches and institutions.",
