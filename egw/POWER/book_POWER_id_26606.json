    "word": "But there are no impossibilities with God. The riches of the earth belong to God. The gold and the silver are His, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. Everything that He has committed to men is simply entrusted to them that they may act as His stewards.

How carefully we should examine ourselves that we may understand for whom we are putting our talents out, and whether they are yielding usury for their rightful owner.",
