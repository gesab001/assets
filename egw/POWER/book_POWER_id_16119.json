    "word": "I was shown that when God sent his angels anciently to minister or communicate to individuals, when they learned that it was an angel they had seen and talked with, they were struck with awe, and were afraid that they should die. They had such exalted views of the terrible majesty and power of God, they thought to be brought into such close connection with one direct from his holy presence, would destroy them. I was referred to Judges 6:22, 23; 13:21, 22; Joshua 5:13-15. If angels were thus feared and honored because they came from the presence of God, with how much greater reverence should God be regarded? Many of those who have been converted through the influence of the 1854 movement, need to be converted anew. This class must unlearn before they can learn aright, else the poisonous weeds of error will grow rank, and root out the precious seeds of truth.",
