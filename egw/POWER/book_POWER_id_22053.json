    "word": "\"A second trial would be of no avail to those whose moral sense is so perverted that they can not see their danger. If after they have long held the truth, if sanctifying power has not established the character in piety, virtue, and purity, let them be disconnected with the missions without delay; for through these Satan will insinuate the same lax sentiments in the minds of those who ought to have an example of virtue and moral dignity. Anything that approaches love-sick sentimentalism, any intimation of commonness should be decidedly rebuked. One who is guilty of encouraging this improper familiarity should not only be relieved of responsibilities which he was unworthy to bear, but should be placed under censure of the church, and that censure should remain upon him until he give evidence in spirit and deportment, that he sees the sinfulness and heart corruption, and repents, like any other guilty sinner, and is converted. Then God for Christ's sake will heal him of his transgression.",
