    "word": "Shun running into temptation. But when temptations surround you, and you cannot control the circumstances which expose you to them, then you may claim the promise of God, and with confidence and conscious power exclaim, \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\" There is strength for you all in God. But you will never feel your need of that strength which alone is able to save you, unless you feel your sinfulness and weakness. Jesus, your precious Saviour, now calls you to take your position firmly upon the platform of eternal truth. If you suffer with him, he will crown you with glory in his everlasting kingdom. If you are willing to sacrifice all for Christ, then he will be your Saviour. But if you choose your own way, you will follow on in darkness until it is too late to secure the eternal reward. \n                                                                           59",
