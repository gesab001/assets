    "word": "The Power of Association [TESTIMONIES FOR THE CHURCH, VOL. 4, PP. 587-591 (1881).] \n\n\n     In our institutions, where many are laboring together, the influence of association is very great. It is natural to seek companionship. Everyone will find companions or make them. And just in proportion to the strength of the friendship, will be the amount of influence which friends will exert over one another for good or for evil. All will have associates, and will influence and be influenced in their turn.",
