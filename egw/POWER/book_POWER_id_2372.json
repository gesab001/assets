    "word": "The love which Christ diffuses through the whole being is a vitalizing \n217\npower. Every vital part\u2014the brain, the heart, the nerves\u2014it touches with healing. By it the highest energies of the being are roused to activity. It frees the soul from the guilt and sorrow, the anxiety and care, that crush the life forces. With it come serenity and composure. It implants in the soul, joy that nothing earthly can destroy\u2014joy in the Holy Spirit\u2014health-giving, life-giving joy.",
