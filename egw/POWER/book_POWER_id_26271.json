    "word": "How much care, anxiety, and wearing of the physical and mental powers they might save me in my old age, and the souls who are being deceived, when I am still in the field of battle discharging the very duties the Lord has laid upon them, to correct the wrong course of their own action. They are doing the very work Satan would have them do, which labor comes upon me, which will have to be undone if I act conscientiously, because they do not understand what is truth through which they must be sanctified. I esteem all the Lord's precepts concerning His work as being the right way, and that His plans are not to be broken up by human wisdom and human devising.",
