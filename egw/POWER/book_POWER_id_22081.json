Through the merits of Christ we are blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things in Christ. It is our privilege to draw nigh to God, to breathe in of the atmosphere of his presence. If we keep ourselves in close union with the common, cheap, sensual things of this earth, Satan will interpose his shadow, so that we shall fail to discern the blessedness of the promises and assurances of God, and so shall fail to be strengthened to attain to a high spiritual standard. Nothing short of abiding in the presence of Christ will bring peace, freedom, courage, and power.",
