    "word": "Emotions Are as Changeable as Clouds.--But shall we wait till we feel that we are cleansed? No; Christ has promised that \"if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9). You are proved of God through the Word of God. You are not to wait for wonderful emotions before you believe that God has heard you; feeling is not to be your criterion, for emotions are as changeable as the clouds. You must have something solid for the foundation of your faith. The word of the Lord is a word of infinite power upon which you may rely, and He has said, \"Ask, and ye shall receive.\" Look to Calvary. Has not Jesus said that He is your advocate? Has He not said that if you ask anything in His name you shall receive? You are not to depend on your own goodness or good works. You are to come depending upon the Sun of righteousness, believing that Christ has taken away your sins and imputed to you His righteousness.--ST, Dec. 12, 1892. (1SM 328.)",
