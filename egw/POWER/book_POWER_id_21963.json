    "word": "Every one who becomes a child of God will reveal genuine holiness. Christ said, I sacrifice myself, that they may be sacrificed to the glory of God. Self-glory, whenever cherished, spoils the figure. For the church's good, the members must follow Christ's example of suffering, whether it means shame, imprisonment, or death. \"God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God. . . .Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\"",
