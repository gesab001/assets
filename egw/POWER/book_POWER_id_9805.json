    "word": "Lower Propensities to Be Under Control.--\"We are laborers together with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). Man is to work out his own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in him both to will and to do of His good pleasure. God gives man physical and mental powers. None are needless. Not one is to be misused or abused. The lower propensities are to be kept under control of the higher powers.--Lt 139, 1898.",
