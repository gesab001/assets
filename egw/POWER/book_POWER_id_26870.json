    "word": "The Lord alone can touch the hearts of those who hear. We want to have more workers who are in vital connection with God. We want the power of God to rest upon the human agents. Without Christ we can do nothing. There is a wonderful interest awakened in all the region round about. We need human instrumentalities to cooperate with the heavenly agencies in order to set forth the pure, unadulterated truth that the minds of inquirers after truth may be divested of all unscriptural superstitions, idolatrous views, and feelings. It is only thus that the Holy Spirit can reshape the character. Human instrumentalities possess no power or holiness of their own. The agency employed is powerful and efficacious only as God shall make it so. The treasure of the truth is in earthen vessels.",
