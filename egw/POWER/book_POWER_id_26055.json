    "word": "The church is in great need of purification. There are sins which are unrepented of and unconfessed. The poison of sin must be cleansed from the church. Many have been so deceived, their principles are so corrupted, that they have no pleasure in the word of God, and it has no power over their lives. God will test character. In the day of final judgment, when every man shall be judged according to the deeds he has done in the body, nothing will seem to have existence but character and the law of God. Man will be stripped of everything but the character he has formed. All will be seen to be either righteous or unrighteous.",
