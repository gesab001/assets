    "word": "When the attention of the man who is honest in heart is drawn to the truth of the Bible, he reads, marks, learns, and inwardly digests its teachings. He comes to God in prayer. He sees the wonderful sacrifice made in his behalf in the words of the prophet: \"He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief: . . . He was despised, and we esteemed Him not. . . . He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed. . . The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all\" (Isaiah 53:3, 5, 6). Conviction comes to his heart, and he is troubled, for he sees that he is under condemnation. He feels the power of the truth in His soul. Then the light which the Spirit of God sheds upon the convicted mind comes to him, and he sees the meaning of the Word as he never saw it before. As the blood propelled from the heart circulates through the body, carrying life and vigor to the extremities, so the truth received into the heart diffuses itself through the inner man, bringing the thoughts and affections and powers into obedience to Christ. If the heart is submitted to the will of Christ, the great Master Builder will in due time perfect the whole being.",
