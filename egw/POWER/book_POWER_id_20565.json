    "word": "The coming of the Lord is to be preceded by \u201cthe working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,\n263\nand with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.\u201d And the apostle John, describing the miracle-working power that will be manifested in the last days, declares: \u201cHe doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do.\u201d No mere impostures are here foretold. Men are deceived by the miracles which Satan's agents have power to do, not which they pretend to do.\u2014GC 553.",
