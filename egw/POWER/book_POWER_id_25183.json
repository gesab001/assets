    "word": "Another resolution was passed that might have been laid upon the table, i.e., the one in reference to training all licentiates before permitting them to enter the ministry. This was to be an absolute rule, and notwithstanding all I had to say against this resolution it was carried. It was not right for the conference to pass it. It was not in God's order, and this resolution will fall powerless to the ground. I shall not sustain it, for I would not be found working against God. This is not God's way of working, and I will not give it countenance for a moment.--Letter 22, 1889, pp. 10, 11. (February 12, 1889.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. July 13, 1981",
