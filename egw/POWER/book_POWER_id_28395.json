    "word": "I have just returned from the second morning meeting at six o'clock. There were twenty-six present yesterday morning and twenty-four today. Heavy frost last night, and the ground was white this morning. The Lord bestowed His blessing upon me in giving me power in prayer, and the Holy Spirit rested upon us. We were all encouraged and blessed. Fourteen good testimonies were borne after I had spoken to them clearly and pointedly in \n                                                                           1409\nshowing them what they might be and what they might do for the Lord in co-operating with Him in the great work of unselfish labor in seeking to save the souls perishing out of Christ. The Lord gave me words to speak, I praise the Lord for His Holy Spirit to convict, to convert, to comfort and to bless. I then had the privilege of listening to fourteen testimonies. The Lord will do His part if the human agent will submit to the control of the Holy Spirit. If we consecrate to God body, soul and spirit, He will do just as He said; He will be found of all those who seek Him diligently. With the presence and blessing of God we shall certainly improve our talents. I sought to impress upon the young that every provision, God had made. That they should individually be found in Christ, wanting in nothing. A stammering, humble prayer, if offered in faith, and an appeal made to the sinner, if full of love, if not positively and critically correct in language, if it carry with it the spirit of Jesus Christ, is wholly acceptable to God. Individually we may, if we will, be a power for God, if our hearts are contrite, meek and lowly. We cannot have light and truth to increase with us unless we let it shine.",
