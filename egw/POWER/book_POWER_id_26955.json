    "word": "Before the Review and Herald building was destroyed I thought of taking these books in my hands and of having them reset. But conditions have changed. The Review and Herald has moved to Washington. I want to see things so adjusted that the book work will be taken hold of intelligently, conducted with fairness and equity to all concerned. \"Equity\" means a great deal. I want to see the Review and Herald standing on the true foundation, where all who have an interest in it are doing all in their power to establish unity with other branches of the work. If they do not care to have the plates, then we will have it printed elsewhere, but we must have no issues in any matter if we can avoid it.",
