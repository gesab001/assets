    "word": "\u201cThat evening the burden left us who had come to the place, and was rolled upon the brethren and sisters of Waukon, and they labored for each other with zeal and with the power of God upon them. Countenances that looked sad when we came to the place, now shone with the heavenly anointing. It seemed that angels from Heaven were passing from \n333\none to the other in the room, to finish the good work which had been commenced. Bro. L., who had in discouragement left the work to which God had called him, and had begun to work at his trade, cried out that he had laid up his hammer, and had driven the last nail. He was again at liberty to labor in the gospel field. We soon bade farewell to the brethren in Waukon, and started on our homeward journey.",
