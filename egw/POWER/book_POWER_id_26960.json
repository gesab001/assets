    "word": "The men handling sacred things do not feel the reverence and awe \n\n                                     -455- \n\nthat they should. They do not speak with trembling of the things of God. This is the sure result of a lack of personal piety. They take very little time to seek God's counsel in humble contrition of soul. Earnest heart-searching, constant reliance upon God, is not revealed by the atmosphere that surrounds the soul. Men in positions of trust are fast losing the sense of the preciousness and sanctity of sacred things. Unless they feel the converting power of God, they will not, cannot, be one with God. They will not keep the way of the Lord, but like the Pharisees in the days of Christ, they will teach for doctrine the commandments of men.",
