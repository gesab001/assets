    "word": "The greatest responsibility rests upon the church at Battle Creek to live and walk in the light, and preserve their simplicity and separation from the world, that their influence may tell with convincing power upon those who are strangers to the truth who attend our meetings. If the church at Battle Creek are a lifeless body, filled with pride, and are exalted above the simplicity \n                                                                           17\nof true godliness, leaning to the world, their influence will be to scatter from Christ, and make the most solemn and essential truths of the Bible of no force. This church have opportunities to be benefited with lectures from the physicians of the Health Institute. They can obtain information upon the great subject of health reform if they desire it. But the church at Battle Creek, who make great profession of the truth, are far behind other churches who have not been blessed with the advantages they have had. The neglect of the church to live up to the light which they have had upon health reform is a discouragement to the physicians, and to the friends of the Health Institute. If the church would manifest a greater interest in the reforms, which God himself has brought to them, to fit them for his coming, their influence would be tenfold what it now is.",
