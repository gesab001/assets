    "word": "Chap. 2 - Higher Education.\n-\n\n     The term \"higher education\" is to be considered in a different light from what it has been viewed by the students of the sciences. The prayer of Christ to his Father is full of eternal truth. \"These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may also glorify thee; as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" \"For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\" The power and soul of true education is a knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"",
