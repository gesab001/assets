    "word": "My brother and sister, we need to keep before us the example of Christ's perfection. When we allow our minds to dwell upon the imperfections of others, our own souls become filled with the leaven of evil. In our endeavors to represent the truth for this time to the world, we shall meet with many difficulties, but if we will keep heart and mind fixed upon the precious Saviour, if we talk of His love and power, the perplexities will pass away, and we shall become happy in the assurance of a Saviour's love. We are not dependent upon the world and its changeableness. He in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, is our joy and crown of rejoicing, our peace, our power, our satisfaction. Then let us rejoice, whatever may happen, within and without. \n\n\n                                    -273-",
