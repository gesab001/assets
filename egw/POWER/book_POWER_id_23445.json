    "word": "The weakest follower of Christ has entered into alliance with infinite power. God can do very little with men of learning, because they feel no need of leaning upon Him who is the source of all wisdom; therefore, after a trial, he often sets them aside for men of inferior talent, who have learned to rely upon God, whose souls are fortified by goodness, truth, and unwavering fidelity, and who will not stoop to anything that will leave a stain upon the conscience.",
