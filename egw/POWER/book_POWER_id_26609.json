    "word": "We are to preach Christ and Him crucified as the sinner's only hope. To ministers and people I would say: Give yourselves no rest until you find the truth as revealed in the past through holy men of old. Then obtain your life-power from the One who came from heaven to John to show him the things that would be seen in these last days. As you consecrate yourselves to God, and with all the powers of the mind seek to understand the Word, you will unearth deeply hidden treasures, which will come forth as shining truths, clear as polished crystal. By no human devising can we, in our own strength, bring forth these treasures from God's great storehouse of truth. We must read and study and write in the light of heaven.",
