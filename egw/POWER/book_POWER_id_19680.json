    "word": "All heaven enters into copartnership with those who come to Christ for eternal life, submitting themselves to Him as those who have made a surrender of all to God. God requires His servants to stand under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel, striving in His power to keep the principles of truth pure and uncorrupted. They must never step aside from the path of self-denial and humility which every true Christian must travel. As they thus cooperate with God, Christ is formed within, \"the hope of glory\" (Colossians 1:27). Clad in His meekness and lowliness they find their highest joy in doing His service. Earthly ambition gives way to a desire to serve the Master.",
