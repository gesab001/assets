    "word": "Everything that God could do has been done for the salvation of man. In one rich gift He poured out the treasures of heaven. He invites, He pleads, He urges; but He will not compel men to come unto Him. He waits for their cooperation. He waits for the consent of the will, that He may bestow upon the sinner the riches of His grace, reserved for him from the foundation of the world. . . . The Lord does not design that human power should be paralyzed; but that by cooperation with God, man may become a more efficient agent in His hands. . . . The Lord holds out to man the privilege of copartnership with Himself.--The Messenger, Apr. 26, 1893.",
