    "word": "All who study the life of Christ and practice His teachings will become like Christ. Their influence will be like His. They will reveal soundness of character. As they walk in the humble path of obedience, doing the will of God, they exert an influence that tells for the advancement of the cause of God and the healthful purity of His work. In these thoroughly  converted souls the world is to have a witness to the sanctifying power of truth upon the human character. --Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 96, 97. (1900)",
