    "word": "MR No. 1278 - Workers To Be Transformed by God and Reveal Christlike Tenderness\n\n     Are you preparing yourselves to do the work that God has given you to do? Let the love of Christ abide in your hearts, my brethren. Let the oil of divine love soften and subdue your words. Seek for the Holy Spirit, humbling yourselves before God. You certainly need to surrender yourselves to Him for purification and sanctification. Pray for the heavenly Power which alone can quell the quick rising passion and check the hasty words. Put away all self-seeking.",
