    "word": "Labor in Settlements of Farmers.--In many States there are settlements of industrious, well-to-do farmers, who have never heard of the truth for this time. Such places should be worked. Let our lay members take up this line of service. By lending or selling books, by distributing papers, and by holding Bible readings, our lay members could do much in their own neighborhoods. Filled with love for souls, they could present the message of present truth with such power that many would be converted.
