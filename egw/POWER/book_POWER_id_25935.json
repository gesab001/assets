    "word": "After listening to Christ the doctrines of the priests and rabbis were dry and painful to the ears of the people.

Christ stood forth in His humility, yet in dignity and majesty, as one born to command. A power attended Him wherever He went, and hearts were melted into tenderness. An earnest desire was created to be in His presence, to listen to the voice of Him who uttered truths with such solemn melody.",
