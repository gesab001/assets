    "word": "The world is rapidly filling up the measure of their iniquity. O may the Lord give me much of His love and grace and power to meet and rebuke the powers of darkness. We must keep the way of the Lord, looking unto Jesus, who is the Author and the Finisher of our faith. We are not to allow one discouraging word to pass our lips. But we can praise the Lord that we can believe and trust in Jesus. He is the Light, and in Him is no darkness at all.",
