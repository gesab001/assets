    "word": "Let every believer closely examine himself to ascertain what are his weak points. Let him cherish a spirit of humility and plead with the Lord for grace and wisdom and for the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Let him cast away all self-confidence. . . . Self-confidence leads to a lack of watchfulness. . . . Those who walk humbly before God, distrustful of their own wisdom, will realize their danger and will know the power of God's keeping care.",
