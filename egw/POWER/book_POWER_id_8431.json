    "word": "By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave us an example of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey. It was Christ who from the bush on Mount Horeb spoke to Moses saying, \"I AM THAT I AM. . . . Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you\" (Exodus 3:14). This was the pledge of Israel's deliverance. So when He came \"in the likeness of men,\" He declared Himself the I AM. The Child of Bethlehem, the meek and lowly Saviour, is God \"manifest in the flesh\" (1 Timothy 3:16) (The Desire of Ages, p. 24). \n                                                                           84",
