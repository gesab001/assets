    "word": "It was Christ, by the power of His word, that caused the refreshing stream to flow for Israel. \"They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ\" (1 Corinthians 10:4). He was the source of all temporal as well as spiritual blessings. Christ, the true Rock, was with them in all their wanderings. \"They thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them.\" \"They ran in the dry places like a river\" (Isaiah 48:21; Psalm 105:41).",
