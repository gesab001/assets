    "word": "Chap. 9 - John in Exile\n\n     The wonderful success which attended the preaching of the gospel by the apostles and their fellow laborers increased the hatred of the enemies of Christ. They made every effort to hinder its progress, and finally succeeded in enlisting the power of the Roman emperor against the Christians. A terrible persecution ensued, in which many of the followers of Christ were put to death.

He had a testimony of power, which his adversaries could not controvert, and which greatly encouraged his brethren.",
