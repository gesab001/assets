    "word": "Every Position of Faith Will Be Examined \n\n\n     Our people have been regarded as too insignificant to be worthy of notice, but a change will come. The movements are now being made. The Christian world is now making movements which will necessarily bring the commandment-keeping people of God to notice. There is a daily suppression of God's truth for the theories and false doctrines of human origin. There are plans and movements being set on foot to enslave the consciences of those who would be loyal to God. The lawmaking powers will be against God's commandment-keeping people. Every soul will be tested. Oh that we would as a people be wise for ourselves and by precept and example impart that wisdom to our children.",
