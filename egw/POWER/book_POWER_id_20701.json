    "word": "When God's people place the gift of speech under the influence and control of the Holy Spirit, thousands will hear the message that God is love; that He \"so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\" (John 3:16). His heart of infinite love embraces every human being. His love is an inexhaustible wellspring of joy and peace. It is as enduring as eternity. It is the fountain opened for Judah and Jerusalem. From its unfailing supply every soul may be satisfied. This love is the life of God, working with transforming power in the soul, perfecting Christian character, making human beings partakers of the divine nature. Through Christ this living stream of love and life flows to the world. . . .",
