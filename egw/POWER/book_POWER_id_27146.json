    "word": "As I stood before you Monday and spoke to you, the power of the Lord came upon me. The light previously given me flashed upon my mind. I had to speak. I knew that there must be a different mold put upon the work. I have been shown of the Lord that there must be a setting [of] things in order. There is not harmony between the workers sent as missionaries from America. There are envious feelings [as to] which shall be the greater. The Lord is ready to work for His people if they will come where He can safely bless them, seeking to answer the prayer of Christ that His disciples may be one as He is one with the Father.",
