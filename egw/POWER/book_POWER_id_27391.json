    "word": "In Christ \"ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into\" (1 Peter 1:8-12). The angels communicated the prophecy to men, but did not see it unfolding as now we see it. Every generation has realized the power and glory of God, but especially has this generation most clearly seen and realized the fulfillment of prophecy.",
