    "word": "Lift the Standard Higher. \n\n     There has been marked presumption manifested by those who claim to be the children of God. O, how much better to pass the time of our sojourning here in fear,--not in fear that the power of God is not sufficient for us, not that one of his good promises may fail; but in fear of our own sinful hearts. \"Fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.\" We must lift the standard higher, and still higher, and in and through the grace of Christ we must attain unto it.",
