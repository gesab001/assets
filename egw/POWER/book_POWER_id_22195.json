    "word": "What is the cause of this wonderful, marked indifference to the eternal interest. It is the indulgence of sin, while the light which condemns sin is shining upon them. Sin is reproved, yet they will not be corrected. They continue daily to practice their iniquity. God reproves, but they harden their hearts against the warnings. They do not face right about. I have written testimonies for individuals. I have stood upon my feet at Battle Creek, when burdened and nearly fainting, and presented the true condition of the people professing to keep the commandments of God. I have felt the power of God upon me in great measure, while speaking, warning, and entreating. Yet I know of but one or two who have been reproved that have faced right about. The rest pass on nearly as before. Especially has this been the case in the Office. But very little effort has been made to meet the mind of God by a thorough reformation, and setting things right by restitution.",
