    "word": "Individual Judgment Not Supreme--There have ever been in the church those who are constantly inclined toward individual independence.  They seem unable to realize that independence of spirit is liable to lead the human agent to have too much confidence in himself, and to trust in his own judgment rather than to respect the counsel and highly esteem the judgment of his brethren, especially of those in the offices that God has appointed for the leadership of His people.  God has invested His church with special authority and power, which no one can be justified in disregarding and despising; for he who does this despises the voice of God.  Those who are inclined to regard their individual judgment as supreme, are in grave peril.  It is Satan's studied effort to separate such ones from those who are channels of light, through whom God has wrought to build up and extend His work in the earth.  To neglect or despise those whom God has appointed to bear the responsibilities of leadership in connection with the advancement of the truth, is to reject the means that He has ordained for the help, encouragement, and strength of His people.  For any worker in the Lord's cause to pass these by, and to think that his light must come through no other channel than directly from God, is to place himself in a position where he is liable to be deceived by the enemy, and overthrown.--Gospel Workers, pp. 443, 444.",
