    "word": "O that they had humbled their hearts in penitence and contrition! Then the divine Shekinah would have poured its precious, glorious light upon the Lord's instrumentalities, and every heart could have been made to rejoice. If they had walked in his way and kept his statutes, the Lord would have confirmed them in their position, and would have given them his grace and wisdom. Prosperity would have attended them just as long as they walked in humility, taking Christ as their pattern. Their prosperity would not have been as the fluctuations of human power. O, why do not men look into the mirror of God's word, and read their character? Why do they not heed the divine instruction with reference to the friends they make, the intimacies they form, that mold and fashion the character? \n                                                                           1232",
