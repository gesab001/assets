    "word": "Christ commenced the work of redemption just where the ruin began. He made provision to reinstate man in his Godlike purity, if he accepted the help brought him. Through faith in His all-powerful name--the only name given under heaven whereby we may be saved--man could overcome appetite and passion, and through his obedience to the law of God, health would take the place of infirmities and corrupting diseases. Those who overcome will follow the example of Christ by bringing\n75\nbodily appetites and passions under the control of enlightened conscience and reason.",
