    "word": "The Saviour was presented to John under the symbols of the \u201cLion of the tribe of Juda,\u201d and \u201ca Lamb as it had been slain.\u201d Here the whole work of redemption was expressed. These symbols represent the union of omnipotent power and self-sacrificing love. As the Lion of Judah, Christ will defend His chosen ones and bring them off victorious, because they accepted Him as \u201cthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d Christ the slain Lamb\u2014who was despised, rejected, the victim of Satan\u2019s wrath, of human abuse and cruelty\u2014how tender was His sympathy with His people who were in the world! And according to the infinite depths of His humiliation and sacrifice as the Lamb of God will be His power in glory as the Lion of Judah, for the deliverance of His people.",
