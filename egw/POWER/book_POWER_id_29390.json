These were little boxes in which family members (parents and children) put money. The contents would go to help the blacks in the South.\nNovember 11, 1904\nTo My Brethren in America:\n     I have a message for you: It is the duty of those in all parts of America to have a special regard for the men who are giving the powers of heart, mind, and soul to the work in the Southern field. This field is a responsibility that does not rest upon the men and women only who are engaged in the work there. None should feel that they have no burden to carry in reference to this field. The wrongs that have existed in the past must not be repeated. Not one word of discouragement should be spoken to anyone engaged in the work. This field must be worked. Every grace is needed.",
