    "word": "I saw that you could have the salvation of God, if you seek earnestly enough for it. I did not see that God was displeased by your marriage; by consecrating all to God, seeking the Spirit and power of God, your united efforts could better glorify God than you could separately. But there is danger of your living to each other; and if there is not an entire interest and an entire care for the paper, the Lord will remove you and have some one whose whole interest is swallowed up in the work. God wants that the only paper in the land bearing his solemn truth should come out right. A lack of the Spirit of God, or interest, is felt in the paper. If the salvation of God is with the one that writes for the paper, the same spirit will be felt by the reader. A piece written in the Spirit of God angels approbate, and impress the same upon the readers. But a piece written when the writer is not living wholly for the glory of God, not wholly devoted to him, angels feel the lack in sadness. They turn away and do not impress the reader \n                                                                           30\nwith it because God and his Spirit are not in it. The words are good but it lacks the warm influence of the Spirit of God.",
