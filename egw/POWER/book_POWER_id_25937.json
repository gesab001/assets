    "word": "Every soul must count the cost. Not one will succeed but by strenuous effort. We must spiritually exercise all our powers, and crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts. Crucifixion means much more than many suppose. We are to heed every word of counsel, and not be indifferent in words and actions. Teach these lessons in the family circle. We are not to be off our guard, but to watch and pray lest we enter into temptation.",
