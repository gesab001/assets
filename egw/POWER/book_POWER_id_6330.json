    "word": "To a friend of the Reformation Luther wrote: \u201cWe cannot attain to the understanding of Scripture either by study or by strength of intellect. Therefore your first duty must be to begin with prayer. Entreat the Lord to deign to grant you, in his rich mercy, rightly to understand his Word. There is no other interpreter of the Word but the Author of that Word himself. Even as he has said, \u2018They shall all be taught of God.\u2019 Hope nothing from your study and the strength of your intellect; but simply put your trust in God, and in the guidance of his Spirit. Believe one who has made trial of this matter.\u201d Here is a lesson of vital importance to those who feel that God has called them to present to others the solemn truths for this time. These truths will stir the enmity of Satan, and of men who love the fables that he has advised. In the conflict with the powers of evil, there is need of something more than strength of intellect and human wisdom.",
