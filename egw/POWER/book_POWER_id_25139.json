    "word": "When your minister is called away to some other place to labor, you can speak words of encouragement and blessing to one another. If you have that living faith which it is the privilege of every believer to possess, you will not hold your minister here to labor for you when there is greater need of his ministry elsewhere. Let the light shine where you are. Lay hold of the power that there is in Christ, and learn to overcome through the merits of His blood and the word of your testimony.",
