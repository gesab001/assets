    "word": "Chap. 17 - Accompanied by Angels\n\n     Ministry of Holy Angels.--We need to understand better than we do the mission of the angels. It would be well to remember that every true child of God has the co-operation of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and power attend the meek and lowly ones who believe and claim the promises of God. Cherubim and seraphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at God's right hand, \"All ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.\"--The Acts of the Apostles, p. 154. (1911)",
