The young will carry with them just the influence they received in their home life and school education. God holds teachers responsible for their work as educators. They must learn daily in the school of Christ, in order to uplift the youth who have had a lax training at home, who have not formed studious habits, who have little knowledge of the future immortal life, for which the highest price was paid by the God of heaven in giving his only begotten Son to live a life of humiliation and die a most shameful death, \"that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
