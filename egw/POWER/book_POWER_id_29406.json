    "word": "Teachers are to bring into the schoolroom a softening, subduing influence. In their daily habits they are to be an example of propriety. In their dress they are always to be neat and tidy. Children are naturally quick to imitate; and as they see habits of order and cleanliness, industry and Christian integrity, exemplified in the daily life of their teacher, their own lives will be powerfully influenced for good. Excellent results will appear.",
