    "word": "I want to speak a few more words to you about helping one another. Not all are able to grasp ideas quickly. If you see that a fellow-student has difficulty in understanding his lessons, explain them to him. Be patient and persevering, and by-and-by his hesitancy and dullness will disappear. He will gain courage and strength to endure trial. And in the effort to help others, you, too, will be helped. God will give you power to advance your studies. He will cooperate with you in your efforts to help your fellow-students, and in heaven the words will be spoken of you, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\"",
