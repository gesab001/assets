    "word": "The things of this world would be enjoyable, were it not for the curse of sin; but crime, sorrow, suffering, and death meet us everywhere. Property, and even life itself, is not safe. Upon the most beautiful portions of the earth, in the valleys, on the mountains, in the crowded cities, in the wilderness, or upon the waters of the great deep, there is danger and death. The restless, surging masses of humanity have forgotten their Creator; transgression of God's law has brought discord, misery, and desolation upon our world; and yet, in their blindness and madness, men continue to transgress. They refuse to listen to the voice of God, inviting them to find peace in him. Kings, statesmen, the mighty ones of the earth, are powerless to give peace and rest to the soul. It is only in obedience to God's law that true happiness can be found. We must submit our will to God if we would have his divine and eternal harmony in our souls.",
