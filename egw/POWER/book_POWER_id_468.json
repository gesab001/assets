As He went from place to place, He comforted the suffering and healed the sick. Then He placed before them the great truths in regard to His kingdom. This is the work of His followers. As you relieve the sufferings of the body, you will find ways for ministering to the wants of the soul. You can point to the uplifted Saviour and tell of the love of the great Physician, who alone has power to restore. --Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 233, 234. \n                                                                           17",
