    "word": "One talent\n     If you have received only one talent, instead of burying it, say, \u201cI have but one talent, and I must make the most of it. I will be faithful in the little things, because the Word declares, \u2018He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\u2019 I must use to the very best advantage that which is given me. I must not waste one jot or tittle of my powers in the gratification of appetite or pride of appearance. In my family I must be a faithful teacher, training my children for the future, immortal life. I must teach them to be honest and truthful, kind and patient. I myself must be all that I desire my children to be; for in speaking of His disciples, Christ said, \u2018For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified.\u2019\u201d",
