    "word": "We are to be partakers of knowledge. As I have seen pictures representing Satan\u2019s coming to Christ in the wilderness of temptation in the form of a hideous monster, I have thought, How little the artists knew of the Bible! Before his fall Satan was next to Christ, the highest angel in heaven. How foolish then to suppose that he approached Christ in the wilderness in any such form as is given him in the illustration The Game of Life. Some have seen that picture. After the Saviour had fasted forty days and forty nights, \u201che was afterward an hungered.\u201d Then it was that Satan appeared to Him. He came as a beautiful angel from heaven, claiming that he had a commission from God to declare the Saviour\u2019s fast at an end. \u201cIf thou be the Son of God,\u201d he said, \u201ccommand that these stones be made bread.\u201d But in Satan\u2019s insinuation of distrust, Christ recognized the enemy whose power He had come to the earth to resist. He would not accept the challenge, nor be moved by the temptation. . . .",
