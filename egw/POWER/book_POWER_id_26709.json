    "word": "The Lord will not much longer allow Dr. Kellogg to pursue the course of deception that he has pursued for years. He will take his case in hand. He has borne long with him, but the medical missionary work, so long controlled by him, shall not always bear the marks of his defection. God would have made Dr. Kellogg a man after His own mind, but Dr. Kellogg refused to place himself under God's control. His crooked ways and deceptive works are a great dishonor to the truth. I have seen that Satan's power over him has not been broken.",
