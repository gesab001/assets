    "word": "The salvation made sure to the human race through the sacrifice of Christ was intended alike for all races and nationalities. There are some of all nationalities who are never inclined to draw in even cords with their fellow men. They want to be a ruling power. And unless the power of God is recognized and appreciated, and believers work intelligently for the accomplishment of God's purpose for all mankind, God will leave them to their own ways, and will use other instruments through which to accomplish His plans. And those who refuse to do the work laid upon them will finally be found on the enemy's side, warring against order and discipline.--Letter 244, 1908, pp. 1, 2. (To Those Recently Assembled at the Oakwood School, Huntsville, Alabama, Aug. 23, 1908.)",
