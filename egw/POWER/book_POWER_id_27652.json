    "word": "We need not feel anxious and troubled, as though the work was in our hands alone to manage. The Lord is standing at the helm. The Infinite has His hand on the machinery. If we humbly do our work with fidelity, the Lord will take care of the results. Have faith in God. This faith will enable us to have perfect trust and to look upon every movement in God's own light. Nothing that is taking place or that can take place need to excite in us fearful apprehensions, for God the great Master \n                                                                           72\nWorker has charge of His own work; and if man will not interfere, but leave the work to God's own control, He will do this work well. Now, Christ would have you who minister in sacred things to be holy as He is holy. Do not forget that your power is in God. Be sure that if God has called you to open His Word to the people, He has called you to purity and goodness.",
