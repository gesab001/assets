    "word": "Now the Lord will not be pleased with those men, whom He hath appointed to do a certain work, who take on many lines of work and carry them until they become so wearisome that it breaks their strength.

Warnings have been coming, but they have been unheeded, but a few who may now seek to bridge the gulf that stands so offensively before God must haste slowly, else the standard bearers will fail, and who will take their place?",
