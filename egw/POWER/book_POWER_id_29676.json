    "word": "Let the members of the church in Graysville seek earnestly for the converting power of God upon their hearts. Let them seek to be brought under the softening, subduing influence of His Holy Spirit, to free them from the spirit of fault-finding, and to make them of one mind. When men are submissive to God, He can use them effectively in His great work.",
