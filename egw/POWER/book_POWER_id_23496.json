    "word": "Bro. L-----, it was a sacrifice for you to leave your farm, you enjoyed your life there. You did not come to Battle Creek from choice. You had no knowledge of the work in connection with the publishing interest. But you was determined to do the best you could, and you have in many respects done well.

Now my dear Bro. this is all wrong. This you must overcome or the enemy will gain the victory over you.",
