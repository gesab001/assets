    "word": "Following God's Will Versus Gain and Life Itself.-- Those who give themselves up to the sorcery of Satan \n\n702 \n\nmay boast of great benefit received thereby, but does this prove their course to be wise or safe? What if life should be prolonged? What if temporal gain should be secured? Will it pay in the end to disregard the will of God? All such apparent gain will prove at last an irrecoverable loss. We cannot with impunity break down a single barrier which God has erected to guard His people from Satan's power.--5T 199 (1882).",
