    "word": "The Lord has a very special work to do for all who shall become citizens of His kingdom. Here are many young people associating together day after day in labor and in study, and in all things their conduct should reveal that they are controlled by the Spirit of God. They are to receive an education that will result in full consecration to God. And their own conversion is not the end of this education; they are to learn how to win others to the truth. This they will best accomplish by a life that reveals the transforming power of truth. Christ is to be formed within the hope of glory.",
