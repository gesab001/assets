    "word": "The ark of God's testament, covered by the mercy seat was seen in His temple. What does this ark contain?--The law of God. Moses was directed to make an ark, in which was to be placed the law of God, written with His own finger upon the tables of stone. This law God gave for the guidance of his people, and it was stamped with the assurance, staked upon His almighty power, that He had entered into covenant relation with them. Today God makes a covenant with all who will take their stand as loyal subjects of His kingdom, reverencing the law that occupies so prominent a position, beneath the mercy seat.",
