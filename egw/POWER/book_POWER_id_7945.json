    "word": "The way in which Christ worked was to preach the Word, and to relieve suffering by miraculous works of healing. But I am instructed that we cannot now work in this way, [MIRACLES WILL ACCOMPANY THE MINISTRY OF GOD'S PEOPLE UNDER THE LOUD CRY (SEE CHAPTER 14), BUT THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE SIGNIFICANCE THEY DID IN CHRIST'S DAY. THE PERFORMING OF MIRACLES WILL NO LONGER BE A PROOF OF DIVINE ENDORSEMENT.] for Satan will exercise his power by working miracles. God's servants today could not work by means of miracles, because spurious works of healing, claiming to be divine, will be wrought.--2SM 54 (1904).",
