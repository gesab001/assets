    "word": "We must now do all in our power to seek a personal consecration to God. It is not more mighty men, not more learned men and smart men, that we need in the presentation of the truth for this time, but men who have a knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. Personal piety will qualify any worker; for the Holy Spirit takes possession of the worker, and the truth for this time becomes a power because his every-day thoughts and all his activities are running in Christ's lines. He has an abiding Christ, and the humblest soul linked with Jesus Christ, is a power, and his work will abide. May the Lord help us to understand his divine will, and do it heartily, unflinchingly, and then there will be joy in the Lord.                      Mrs. E. G. White. \n\n                                               -",
