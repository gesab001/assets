    "word": "Ruling the Spirit \n\n     There is a wonderful power in silence. When impatient words are spoken to you, do not retaliate. \n                                                                           136\nWords spoken in reply to one who is angry usually act as a whip, lashing the temper into greater fury. But anger met by silence quickly dies away. Let the Christian bridle his tongue, firmly resolving not to speak harsh, impatient words. With the tongue bridled, he may be victorious in every trial of patience through which he is called to pass.",
