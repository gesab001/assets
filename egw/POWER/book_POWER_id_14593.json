    "word": "God will have a people zealous of good works, standing firm amid the pollutions of this degenerate age. There will be a people who hold so fast to the divine strength that they will be proof against every temptation. Evil communications in flaming handbills may seek to speak to their senses and corrupt their minds; yet they will be so united to God and angels that they will be as those who see not and hear not. . . . The youth may have principles so firm that the most powerful temptations of Satan will not draw them away from their allegiance. \n                                                                           144",
