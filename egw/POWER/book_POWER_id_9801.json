    "word": "A Harp of a Thousand Strings.--It is not only the privilege but the sacred duty of all to understand the laws \n\n374 \n\nGod has established in their beings. . . . And as they more fully understand the human body, . . . they will seek to bring their bodies into subjection to the noble powers of the mind. The body will be regarded by them as a wonderful structure, formed by the Infinite Designer, and given in their charge to keep this harp of a thousand strings in harmonious action.--HR, Sept, 1871. (ML 148.)",
