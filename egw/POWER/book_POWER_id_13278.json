    "word": "Righteousness Found in Christ \n\n     Then come, and seek, and find. The reservoir of power is open, is full and free. Come with humble hearts, not thinking that you must do some good work to merit the favor of God, or that you must make yourself better before you can come to Christ. You are powerless to do good, and cannot better your condition. Apart from Christ we have no merit, no righteousness. Our sinfulness, our weakness, our human imperfection make it impossible that we should appear before God unless we are clothed in Christ's spotless righteousness. We are to be found in Him not having our own righteousness, but the righteousness which is in Christ. Then in the name that is above every name, the only name given among men whereby men can be saved, claim the promise of God, saying, \"Lord, forgive my sin; I put my hands into Thy hand for help, and I must have it, or perish. I now \n                                                                           334\nbelieve.\" The Saviour says to the repenting sinner, \"No man cometh unto the Father, but by me\" (John 14:6), \"and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out\" (John 6:37). \"I am thy salvation\" (Psalm 35:3).",
