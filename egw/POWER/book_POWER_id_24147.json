    "word": "You have good impulses, and you awaken hope and expectation in the minds of your parents; but so far you have been powerless to resist temptation, and Satan exults in your readiness to do just as he wills. Often you make statements which inspire your parents with hope, but just as often you fall, because you will not resist the enemy. You can not know how it pains your father and mother when you are found on Satan's side. Many times you say, I cannot do this and I cannot do that, when you know that the things you say you cannot do are right for you to do. You can fight against the enemy, not in your own strength but in the strength God is ever ready to give you. Trusting in His word you will never say, I can't.",
