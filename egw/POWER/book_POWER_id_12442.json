    "word": "Each House Stands as Independent Body.--Warnings have been given me that it is not wise to consolidate the Pacific Press with the Review and Herald publishing house. Time will convince all that this matter is too serious a thing to be trifled with. The Battle Creek publishing house is not to be the only power among Seventh-day Adventists. It must stand largely alone. The Pacific Press should not be made to fear the influence of the power invested in the publishing house at Battle Creek. The Lord has His own purpose to accomplish through these institutions.",
