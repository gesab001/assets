But through the power of the incarnation of Christ, God manifest in the flesh, the strength of God is revealed in gentleness and beauty. To \"as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\" By this power \n\n\n                                   -292- \n\nwe may overcome our evil tendencies and so modify our imperfect dispositions that the will of God may be fulfilled in us.",
