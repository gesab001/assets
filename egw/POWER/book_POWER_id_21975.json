    "word": "Recently, in visions during the night season, a representation passed before me. Among God's people there seemed to be a great reformatory movement. Many were praising God. The sick were healed, and other miracles were wrought. A spirit of intercession was seen, even as was manifested before the great day of Pentecost. Hundreds and thousands were seen visiting families, and opening before them the Word of God. Hearts were convicted by the power of the Holy Spirit, and a spirit of genuine conversion was manifest. On every side, doors were thrown open to the proclamation of the truth. The world seemed to be lightened with a heavenly influence. Great blessings were received by the true and humble people of God. I heard voices of thanksgiving \n                                                                           4\nand praise, and there seemed to be a reformation such as we witnessed in 1844. Yet some refused to be converted. They were not willing to walk in God's way. And when, in order that the work of God might be advanced, calls were made for liberal free-will offerings, some clung selfishly to their earthly possessions. These covetous ones became separated from the company of believers.",
