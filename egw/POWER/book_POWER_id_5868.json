    "word": "Claim the promises of God. The Lord will do all for you that he did for Daniel, if you will co-operate with him as Daniel did. You may be conquerors through humble, earnest trust in your Redeemer. As delegated messengers to whom is assigned a special work, he wants you to become men of spiritual power. It is the privilege of God's ministers to become men of moral power and efficiency in all the offices they are called to fill. Every day they may praise God for the fresh tokens of his love and blessing.",
