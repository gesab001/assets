    "word": "In my dreams last night I was speaking to a company of young men. I asked them to sing, \"Almost Persuaded.\" Some present were deeply moved. I knew that they were almost persuaded, but that if they did not make decided efforts to return to Christ, the conviction of their sinfulness would leave them. You made some confessions, and I asked you, \"Will you not from this \n\n\n                                    -166- \n\ntime stand on the Lord's side?\" If you will receive Jesus, He will receive you. \"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\" You need not be discouraged. Come to the Saviour, saying, \"In my hand no price I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling.\"",
