    "word": "Three Messages Linked Together \n\n\n     The third angel is represented as flying in the midst of heaven, symbolizing the work of those who proclaim the first, second, and third  angels' messages; all are linked together. The evidences of the abiding,  ever-living truth of these grand messages, that means so much to us, that have awakened such intense opposition from the religious world, are not extinct. Satan is constantly seeking to cast his hellish shadow about these  messages, so that the remnant people of God shall not clearly discern their import, their time and place; but they live, and are to exert their power  upon our religious experience while time shall last. Letter 1f, 1890, pp. 5, 6. (To Brethren in Responsible Positions, November, 1890.)",
