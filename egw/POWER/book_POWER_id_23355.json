    "word": "Battle Creek, Mich., Nov. 5, 1889. \n     Brother Daniels: Your case has again been presented before me so clearly that I understand your danger, and I cannot hold my peace, for I have a care for your soul. I am not at liberty to tell you all that has been shown me concerning you; sufficient now is the fact that you have not an eye single to the glory \n\n\n                        [66] \n\nof God; your course of action is not in harmony with the Spirit of Christ. If the Lord Jesus were working upon you at all times and in all places, the fruits of righteousness would appear; but the fruits you bear are frequently of such a character as to declare distinctly that your works are not wrought in God, that the Spirit of God does not have a controlling power to subdue and sanctify your nature, and place Christ's mould upon you. Your powers have at times been unselfishly used to glorify God; but when your own spirit prevails, the very blessings God has given you are perverted to serve your selfish purposes.",
