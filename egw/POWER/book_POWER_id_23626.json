    "word": "We must not strive to mold people to our own ideas and inclinations and practises. By unselfish, consecrated lives, through the power of the Holy Spirit working on our minds, we are to reveal, not our own ways and wills, but the power of the love of him who gave himself for us, that we \n\n\n                        -2- \n\nshould be drawn out of and away from our own traits of character to the perfection of Christ's character. He died that we should cultivate the attributes of his character, and elevate, purify, and gladden the hearts and lives of others. All who are connected with the work of God need to have sanctified hearts, where Christ can abide. This means that there is a positive necessity of your closely examining yourselves, whether you be in the love of Christ. If you are individually attending to your soul's interest, you will have a sense of your own shortcomings, and will not sow the seed that Christ calls tares. If the truth you profess to know in theory is in your heart, you will reveal the truth as it is in Jesus. In every sphere of action you will represent his character. Our maxim should be, \"Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.\" This is the great restoring influence of all our moral ills. With any lower incentive than to honor and glorify God, the principles become full of disease. Little by little self strives for the mastery, and the man will never rise to moral rectitude in word and action.",
