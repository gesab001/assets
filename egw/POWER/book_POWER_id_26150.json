    "word": "Seventh-day Adventists need to search the Scriptures, that they may know the reasons of their faith. Christ says, \"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of Me.\" We are living in the close of this earth's history. Let no one say in his heart, \"My Lord delayeth His coming.\" Prophecy is fulfilling. Soon Christ will come with power and great glory. We have no time to lose. Let the message sound forth in earnest words of warning. \n\n\n                                   -347-",
