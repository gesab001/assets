    "word": "When Jesus said the harvest was great and the laborers were few, He did not urge upon His disciples the necessity of ceaseless toil. . . . He tells His disciples that their strength has been severely tried, that they will be unfitted for future labor unless they rest awhile. . . . In the name of Jesus, economize your powers, that after being refreshed with rest, you may do more and better work.",
