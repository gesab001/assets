    "word": "Christ does not use force or compulsion in drawing men to Him. But while truth was being proclaimed, the hearts of those who professed to be children of God were barricaded against it, and those who had not been so highly privileged, those who were not clothed with the garment of self-righteousness, were drawn to Christ. Their minds were convinced and quickened into activity, and light and truth vibrated through the universe. It was the plan of redemption, which was to call forth the intellect, to thrill the soul, and prepare it for the great power of God, which is salvation to all who believe--a truth so large, so deep, so full and complete, it could be the center of all truth hitherto revealed, presenting in a more exalted manner that which had been buried beneath a mass of rubbish and error. The work of Christ was to replace old truths in the framework of the gospel, and by bringing clearly to view neglected obligations, renovate the world.",
