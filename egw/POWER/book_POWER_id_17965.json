    "word": "I have seen a device representing a bullock standing between a plow and an altar, with the inscription, \"Ready for either\"--willing to swelter in the weary furrow or to bleed on the altar of sacrifice. This is the position the child of God should ever be in--willing to go where duty calls, to deny self, and to sacrifice for the cause of truth. The Christian church was founded upon the principle of sacrifice. \"If any man will come after Me,\" says Christ, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\" He requires the whole heart, the entire affections. The exhibitions of zeal, earnestness, and unselfish labor which His devoted followers have given to the world should kindle our ardor and lead us to emulate their example. Genuine religion gives an earnestness and fixedness of purpose which molds the character to the divine image and enables us to count all things but loss for the excellency of Christ. This singleness of purpose will prove an element of tremendous power.",
