    "word": "It is a matter of deep concern to us whether or not we are perfecting a Christian character, growing in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. If we are daily learners in the school of Christ we shall be daily obtaining an experience in Christian life, and we shall not be self-sufficient and self-exalted. We shall be as humble as little children, and there will be a nourishing power in our words which will drop as the dew. The fruits of righteousness, sown in peace of them that make peace, will then appear.",
