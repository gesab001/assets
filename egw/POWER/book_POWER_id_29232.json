    "word": "In assuming human nature that He might reach to the very depths of human woe and misery, and lift man up, Christ has shown what estimate He places upon the human race. In this work everything was at stake. Satan claimed to be the lawful owner of the fallen race; and with what persistent efforts did he seek to overthrow Christ through his subtlety! It was only by most desperate conflict with the powers of Satan that Christ could accomplish his purpose of restoring the almost obliterated image of God in man, and place his own signature upon his forehead. It was a desperate battle; for Satan had so long worked in league with human intelligences as to about completely intercept every ray of light shining from the throne of God upon the human mind. The cross of Calvary alone could destroy the works of the devil. In that wondrous sacrifice all eyes were called to \"behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.\" The love of Christ kindles in the heart of all who continue to behold him.",
