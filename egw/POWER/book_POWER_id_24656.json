    "word": "A great apostasy originally began in a denial of the love of God, as it is plainly revealed in the Word. Provision was then made whereby fallen man might have a powerful revelation of the love of God, and be given an opportunity to return to his allegiance to Jehovah. \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" \"I lay down My life for the sheep,\" say Christ. \"The bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world,\" Here is a revelation of the power mighty to save \"to the uttermost.\" God is light and love.--Letter 172, 1907, pp. 2, 3. (To P. T. Magan, May 15, 1907.)",
