    "word": "Then let us take up our work just where we find it, without one word of repining, imagining nothing can come but that strength will come proportionate to the trial. Our children are in the hands of God. Our faith must awaken to grasp the promises and we not repine, we not be mournful, for then we dishonor God. We must encourage a cheerful, hopeful frame of mind. Our present peace must not be disturbed by anticipated trials, for God will never leave nor forsake one soul who trusts in Him. God is better unto us than our fears. If we would encourage a diligent remembrance and recital of our mercies, counting up instances in which God has wrought for us, has been better to us than our fears, in which He has interposed His power and His grace when sorely perplexed, sustained us when falling, comforted us when sorrowing, we would see that it is unbelief to distrust God or be filled with anxiety. Let mercies be remembered and enjoyed daily. We must live by faith daily. . . . Rejoice in God always. Today praise God for His grace, and continue to praise Him every day.--Letter 11a, Feb. 19, 1884, to Elder and Mrs. Uriah Smith.",
