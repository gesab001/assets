    "word": "9 T.--164-166 \n     In order to be purified and to remain pure, Seventh-day Adventists must have the Holy Spirit in their hearts and in their homes. The Lord has given me light that when the Israel of today humble themselves before Him, and cleanse the soul-temple from all defilement, He will hear their prayers in behalf of the sick, and will bless in the use of His remedies for disease. When in faith the human agent does all he can to combat disease, using the simple methods of treatment that God has provided, his efforts will be blessed of God.  {TSDF 195.10}  \n     If, after so much light has been given, God's people will cherish wrong habits, indulging self and refusing to reform, they will suffer the sure \n\n196 \n\nconsequence of transgression. If they are determined to gratify perverted appetite at any cost, God will not miraculously save them from the consequences of their indulgence. They \"shall lie down in sorrow.\" Isaiah 50:11.  {TSDF 195.11}  \n     Those who choose to be presumptuous, saying, \"The Lord has healed me, and I need not restrict my diet; I can eat and drink as I please,\" will ere long need, in body and soul, the restoring power of God. Because the Lord has graciously healed you, you must not think you can link yourselves up with the self-indulgent practices of the world. Do as Christ commanded after His work of healing,--\"go, and sin no more.\" John 8:11. Appetite must not be your god.",
