    "word": "My mind is deeply impressed by the Spirit of God. Instruction is given to me in clear lines. Our work is not left in the hands of finite men. God rules, and he will turn and overturn. He will not allow his work to be carried forward as it had been. His medical missionary work is not to be ruled, controlled, and molded by one man, as for some years it certainly has been. The exercise of such a power, if continued, will mar the work, and will be the certain ruin of the man exercising control. God will work with the men entrusted with large responsibility, if they will take the Lord's way as humble obedient servants, waiting wholly upon him. But if any man sets himself up as being above God, and takes the work under his finite supervision, the watchmen standing on the walls of Zion must discern the danger and take heroic action to save the man and the cause.",
