    "word": "The words that Jesus spoke to His disciples, saying that the fields were white for the harvest, are addressed to every genuine Christian. We also are to look upon the fields, and see the necessities of men. The disciples were encouraged as they saw the readiness of the Samaritans to receive the truth. They had regarded this field as a very hard field, and yet they saw men acknowledging the words of the Master, and believing on Him for themselves. This lesson is for our encouragement as well, and while there are many who will not yield to the convicting power of God's Spirit, there are also many who are hungering for the words of light and salvation. Many will receive the truth, and testify as did the Samaritans that Christ is the Saviour of the world. In their turn they will become sowers of the seed of truth. We are to lift up our eyes and look upon the fields that are white already for the harvest. For years we have passed by the Southern field, and have looked upon the colored race, feebly deploring their condition; but our eyes have been fastened upon more promising fields. But now God's people should lift up their eyes and look upon this destitute field that has not been worked. The missionary spirit must prevail if we form characters after the pattern, Christ Jesus. We are to love our neighbors as ourselves, and the colored people, in the sight of God, are our neighbors. It is not enough for us merely to look on and deplore the discouraging appearance of the field, and then pass by on the other side and do nothing. Unitedly and interestedly we must take hold of the work. We are not only to look upon the fields, but we are to reap, and gather fruit unto life eternal. \n                                                                           60",
