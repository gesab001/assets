    "word": "Dr. Kellogg is acting over the same experience, and Bro. Murphy, Bro. Hall, and others, suffer him to do this. They are in many respects machine men. They have powers of mind, but these are becoming weakened because they do not exercise their reasoning faculties, but prefer to use Dr. Kellogg's mind in simple matters. Bro. Hall has his position, but the Dr., as far as thinking and planning are concerned, has the work to do himself. Dr. Kellogg should never have encouraged these men to depend upon him to be mind and brains for them. He has served tables too much. There should be a Superintendent who possesses breadth of thought and independence of judgment, that will use the powers of his own brain, and grow in capacity and judgment, becoming every year more and more capable of \n\n\n                            -21- \n\nbearing responsibilities. It is a sin and a shame to call the mind of Dr. Kellogg to so many little matters, and he does these men a wrong in allowing it. He cannot grasp his arms around the entire Institution. He must train his helpers to be self-reliant, independent, wise generals, in place of acting as general over everything himself. These men have important faculties given them of God, to be used and to be strengthened by use. Dr. Kellogg has larger responsibilities to take his time and engage his powers, and every ounce of burden should be lifted from him that can be. There ought to be, today, self-reliant men of enduring energy, thinking and planning and working at all the common matters without bringing one of them to the notice of the Doctor.",
