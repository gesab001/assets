    "word": "Battle Creek, Friday, January 2, 1891 \n\n     My heart was drawn out in earnest supplication to God at the family altar that His grace and His power might stir us to vigilance and earnest effort and zeal in doing the work He has placed in our hands, individually feeling our great responsibility. Oh, that every member of our family may be imbued with the spirit of the Master who went about doing good! I cannot feel rest in spirit until the members of my own family are doing the whole will of God. How my heart longs after them day and night!",
