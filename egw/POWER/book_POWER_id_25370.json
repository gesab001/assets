    "word": "To every one of us are spoken the words of Paul to Timothy: \"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine\" (1 Tim 4:16). Self must first be brought into close connection with Christ. We are to work for Him with vigilance and solicitude, with strong, persevering effort, with self-denial and self-sacrifice, determined in word and deed to represent Him who works through human beings to achieve glorious results. As we labor thus, divine power will be revealed in our efforts. God will work through us to will and to do of His good pleasure. Divine love will be revealed in thought, word, and action.--Letter 97, 1902. \n\nWhite Estate, Jan. 6, 1983",
