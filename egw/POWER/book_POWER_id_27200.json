    "word": "After the passing of the time in 1844, I remember we were a sorrowful little company. There was a little boy who had twenty-five cents, and he threw it into the mud puddle, because he said he would not need it, for the Lord was coming. And afterward he was seen hunting in the mud puddle for his twenty-five cents. I thought, How many of us would do just like that. There was one brother who had been out praying with others, and he began to say in a loud voice, \"Great, great, great is the Lord; and greatly to be praised.\" I think he repeated that over many times, and his face was shining. Before he finished, the power of God was upon us. While it is true that we were disappointed, yet we had the blessing of God.",
