    "word": "When the Lord gives us a work to do, if we do it in his fear, it will be wholly acceptable to God. Not one jot or tittle of his promises will fail to those who act their part with fidelity, who live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. We are to believe and obey the commandments of God. I have to fight many battles with the powers of darkness, that I may not yield to infirmities, and give up aggressive warfare for the cause of truth. I praise God that I have been enabled to look to Jesus, and go forward in my work when my feelings were opposed to the effort; and I bear testimony to the glory of God that his promises have not been like sliding sand to my feet, but as solid rock and a sure foundation. None of his words have failed.",
