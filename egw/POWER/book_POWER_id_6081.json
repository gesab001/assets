    "word": "So men have argued, till policy has taken the place of faithfulness. Sin is allowed to go unrebuked. When will be heard once more in the church the voice of faithful rebuke, \"Thou art the man\"? [See 2 Samuel 12:7.] If these words were not so rare, we should see more of the power of God. The Lord's messengers should not complain of their efforts' being fruitless until they repent of their love of approbation, their desire to please men, which leads them to suppress the truth, and to cry, Peace, when God has not spoken peace.",
