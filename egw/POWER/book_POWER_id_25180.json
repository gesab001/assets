    "word": "In Eastern Kansas, May 19, 1879--We had some trouble last night finding a camping ground. We had to accept a poor spot, at least one mile from Humboldt. Our tent was no sooner arranged, staked, and thoroughly ditched--as I determined it should be--than the storm struck us. It was a marked display of the power of God. The sun was shining in a portion of the sky and it was amber in the west. The other portions of the sky were black and threatening. The rain was pouring in torrents. Our tent proved a most welcome shelter.",
