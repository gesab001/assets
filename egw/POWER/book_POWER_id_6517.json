    "word": "Romanists declare that \u201cthe observance of Sunday by the Protestants is an homage they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the [Catholic] Church.\u201d [\"PLAIN TALK ABOUT PROTESTANTISM,\u201d P. 213.] The enforcement \n449\nof Sunday-keeping on the part of Protestant churches is an enforcement of the worship of the papacy\u2014of the beast. Those who, understanding the claims of the fourth commandment, choose to observe the false instead of the true Sabbath; are thereby paying homage to that power by which alone it is commanded. But in the very act of enforcing a religious duty by secular power, the churches would themselves form an image to the beast; hence the enforcement of Sunday-keeping in the United States would be an enforcement of the worship of the beast and his image.",
