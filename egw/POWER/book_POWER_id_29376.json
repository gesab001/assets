    "word": "The Jews, in Christ's day, in the exercise of their own spirit of self exaltation, brought in rigid rules and exactions, and so took away all chance for God to work upon minds, until mercy and the love of God were entirely lost sight of in their work. It was this which caused rulers to lay upon the people the heavy burdens of which they justly complained, which our Saviour condemned. Do not follow in their track. Leave God a chance to do something for those who love him, and do not impose upon them rules and regulations, which, if followed, will leave them as destitute of the grace of God as were the hills of Gilboa, without dew or rain. Your very many resolutions need to be reduced to one third their number, and great care should be taken as to what resolutions are framed. Ours is missionary ground, having many advantages; and if wisely improved, a much larger number of workers would be fitted to go out into the field, as pastors and evangelists; but shortness of vision, and the narrowness of mind in some, have circumscribed the work. There is need of having vigorous efforts put forth in the churches in every conference. A living message, showing the living features of our times should be presented to them, not in a tame, lifeless style, but in the \n                                                                           406\ndemonstration of the Spirit, and in the power of God. Responsibilities must be laid upon individual members of the church. A missionary spirit should be awakened, and wise workers appointed as they are needed, who will be active pastors, making personal efforts to bring the church up to that condition where spiritual death will not be seen in all her borders.",
