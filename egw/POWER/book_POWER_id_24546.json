    "word": "The people who are preparing for the future eternal life must learn of God out of His word. All that would divert the mind from His service is to be recognized and put away. The story magazine, the novel, and the cheap, worthless literature is to be given up. The means thus saved can be spent in buying those publications that will bring heaven's light to those who read them. Every family should act a part in endeavoring to keep out of the home the worthless productions that are a power for evil to the youth, robbing them of the sense of the preciousness of the word of God which they should read and understand.",
