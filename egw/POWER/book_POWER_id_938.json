    "word": "The shout echoes from mountain and valley, \u201cHosanna to the son of David: . . . Hosanna in the highest.\u201d\u201cBlessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d. . . Those who have once been blind . . . are the first to lead the way in that wonderful procession. . . One whom He has raised from the dead leads the animal on which He is seated. The once deaf and dumb, with ears opened and tongues unloosed, help swell the glad hosannas. Cripples, with buoyant steps and grateful hearts, are now most active in breaking down the palm branches and strewing them in His path as their tribute of homage to the mighty Healer. The leper, who has listened to the dread words of the priest, \u201cUnclean,\u201d . . . is there. The widow and the orphan are there to tell of His wonderful works. The restored dead are there. Their tongues, once palsied by the power of Satan, take up the song of rejoicing. . . . The demoniac is there, not now to have the words wrenched from his lips by Satan\u2019s power. . . . On the crest of Olivet the procession pauses.\u2014Manuscript 128, 1899.",
