    "word": "A spirit has come in among us that is bold, defiant, persevering, to resist the Spirit of God. And I am bound not to kill myself unless the Lord directs me to do it in meeting and combating it. I shut myself up to my writings. But if I go to California this winter I should be at the camp meetings where my voice could reach the many and not have to meet the underhanded spirit cropping out here and there at different points, with less power of influence to check it, and with so few stanch men to stand with me. No; if I go to California it must be to attend their camp meetings. I should feel better out of the sight and hearing of Battle Creek and those who have not the least interest in me except as they want me to give influence to something they may say or do, or to put myself in the gap if there are disagreeable things to be attended to.",
