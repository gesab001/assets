    "word": "\"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\" Christ was empowered to breathe into fallen humanity the breath of life. Those who receive Him will never hunger, never thirst; for greater joy than that found in Christ there cannot be. Study the words spoken by the Saviour from the mount of blessing. How the divine nature shone through His humanity as His lips uttered the benedictions upon those who were the objects of His mercy and love! He blessed them with a fullness that showed that He was drawing from the inexhaustible store of the richest treasures. The treasures of eternity were at His command. The Father committed the riches of heaven to Him, and in the disposal of them He knew no bounds. Those who accept Him as their Saviour, their Redeemer, the Prince of life, He acknowledged before the heavenly host, before the worlds unfallen and before the fallen world, as His peculiar treasure. . . .",
