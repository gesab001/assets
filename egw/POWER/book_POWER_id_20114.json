    "word": "It was through suffering that Jesus obtained the ministry of consolation. In all the affliction of humanity He is afflicted; and \"in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succor them that are tempted.\" Isaiah 63:9; Hebrews 2:18. In this ministry every soul that has entered into the fellowship of His sufferings is privileged to share. \"As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.\" 2 Corinthians 1:5. The Lord has special grace for the mourner, and its power is to melt hearts, to win souls. His love opens a channel into the wounded and bruised soul, and becomes a healing balsam to those who sorrow. \"The Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort . . . comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.\" 2 Corinthians 1:3,4.",
