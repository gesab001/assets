    "word": "MR No. 506 - Linking Arms with the Arm of Satan\n\n     It has been presented to me that Satan is working in ways that man does not expect. At times he puts on the robes of an angel of light, and many receive him as such a being. If we will link ourselves closely with Christ, Satan will have no power to overcome us. As we draw near to God, He draws near to us, and lifts up for us a standard against the enemy.",
