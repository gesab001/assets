    "word": "Chap. 51 - United With the Living Vine\n[THIS\nARTICLE APPEARED IN THE SIGNS\nOF THE TIMES, DEC. 26, 1892.]\n\n     \"If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new\" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Nothing but divine power can regenerate the human heart and imbue souls with the love of Christ, which will ever manifest itself with love for those for whom He died. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. When a man is converted to God, a new moral taste is supplied, a new motive power is given, and he loves the things that God loves; for his life is bound up by the golden chain of the immutable promises to the life of Jesus. Love, joy, peace, and inexpressible gratitude will pervade the soul, and the language of him who is blessed will be, \"Thy gentleness hath made me great\" (Psalm 18:35).",
