    "word": "I was shown the case of Dr. Russell. If he is connected with the Health Institute he should be consecrated to God. Dr. Russell is in imminent danger of making shipwreck of faith. His heart has yielded to doubt and dark unbelief, which has taken so deep root in his heart that it disqualifies him for the position he now fills. He talks doubts, and while he gives expression so freely to unbelief, he can gain no strength \n                                                                           21\nof faith. If he talks unbelief, he will have unbelief. If he talks faith, he will have faith. He is not hypocritical, but he is not stable-minded. Satan needs no farther encouragement than Dr. Russell gives him to come in and tempt him. Satan desires him, that he may sift him as wheat. Dr. Russell gathers about his soul the dark clouds of unbelief by cherishing doubts, It is unfortunate for Dr. Russell that he lacks stability of character. He is vacillating, and cannot prosper unless he encourages firmness and steadiness of purpose. He enjoys change, His hope is large that he could engage in business on his own account if he had means, or he could do better elsewhere. It is in his power, if he could only see the peril in which he stands, as far as his spiritual prosperity is concerned, to close the door against the temptations of Satan, by having a contented mind.",
