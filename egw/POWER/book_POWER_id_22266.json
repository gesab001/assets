    "word": "It is Satan's work to talk of that which concerns himself; and he is delighted to have human beings talk of his power, of his working through the children of men. Through indulgence in such conversation, the mind becomes gloomy and sour and disagreeable. We may become channels of communication for Satan, through which flow words that bring no sunshine to any heart. But let us decide that this shall not be. Let us determine not to be channels through which Satan communicates gloomy, disagreeable thoughts. Let our words be not a savour of death unto death, but of life unto life.",
