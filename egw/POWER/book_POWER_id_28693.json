    "word": "I am instructed to say that we must not look to any human being for power or experience, depending on them for strength and guidance. Christ says, \"Look unto Me. I am the Light of the world. He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" I speak to those who claim to be children of God. Is it not time that we know the source of our strength and the source of our power? Shall we not, from this time forward, make a record more pleasing to the Lord? Scenes are presented to me that I can find no language to describe. Trials will come that will humble all hearts that are lifted up. Let no one feel that he is safe in following his own way, or in making man his trust. The Lord calls for men of experience, men who will carry responsibilities in His name and in His strength, men who will receive His grace with a realization of their accountability to impart it to others.",
