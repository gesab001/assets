    "word": "It would be difficult for a mind to continue in resistance to all these efforts, and O how happy I am to state that Brother Radley has come out, decided, firm, and true. He is now one of the leaders in the _____ Church, and is growing in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. He enjoys the meetings. His heart, I believe, is warming to the enterprise of building up the work. With all his powers of soul and influence he gladly cooperates in this great work of highest importance. We now expect that benevolence, and an earnest desire to do good to other souls will take the place of worldliness and narrow selfishness.",
