    "word": "In the power of God's grace you may obtain most precious victories. You are not to treat your life as a romance, but as a reality. You are to labor together with God in forming a character that He can approve. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\" Does the charge end there? No, no, thank God! \"For it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" You are to be a co-worker with Him in the saving of your soul. You are to will to do the will of God. Then do not spend your time and strength in murmuring, in talking unbelief and finding fault with God. Encourage confidence in Him. Speak kindly of Him. Honor Him who so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"",
