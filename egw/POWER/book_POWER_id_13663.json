    "word": "Chap. 51 - Attacks on Ellen White and Her Work\n-\n\n           Should We Keep Silent? \n\n     When man assails his fellow men, and presents in a ridiculous light those whom God has appointed to do work for him, we would not be doing justice to the accusers, or to those who are misled by their accusations should we keep silent, leaving the people to think that their brethren and sisters, in whom they have had confidence, are no longer worthy of their love and fellowship. This work, arising in our very midst, and resembling the work of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, is an offence to God, and should be met. And on every point the accusers [ADDRESSED TO CERTAIN ACCUSERS IN AUSTRALIA WHO HAD HAD SPECIAL EVIDENCE OF ELLEN WHITE'S WORK.--COMPILERS.] should be called upon to bring their proof. Every charge should be carefully investigated; it should not be left in any uncertain way, the people should not be left to think that it may be or it may not be. The accusers should do all in their power to lift every sign of reproach that cannot be substantiated.",
