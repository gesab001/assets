    "word": "At Paradise Valley I told the workers that they must do all in their power to honor and glorify God. God makes the impression upon hearts; it is not we who make it. If we work faithfully to glorify God, He makes the impression upon the people. He will lift up and strengthen every soul that seeks Him in sincerity. He will teach us how to lay hold of His promises, so that His grace shall abound in the soul.",
