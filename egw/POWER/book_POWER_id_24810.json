    "word": "Sabbath eve I had a great burden, such as I have borne before. I saw that Brother Evarts must give up his age-to-come, that he had lost the power of the third angel's message, and I saw that the accursed thing must be put out of the camp, or Israel would be sickly. That accursed thing was such views as I have mentioned that Henry Allen held. He was not at the meeting at Brother Evarts, being sick. After I had the vision and told it, Brother Evarts began to confess and break down before God. He gave up his age-to-come and felt the necessity of keeping the minds of all on the third angel's message. I had as solemn a view at that time as I ever had in my life.",
