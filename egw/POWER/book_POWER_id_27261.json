    "word": "God wants every one of us to support these German brethren who will work in the same neighborhood with English brethren. If every one of us should strive for that love which ought to dwell in the hearts of every one of us, we would be a power on earth such as not one of us conceives. No one knows this better than Satan. He tries to sow the seeds of envy and hatred, rather than love, in the hearts of the brethren.",
