    "word": "Before Jesus went forth to His final conflict with the powers of darkness, He lifted up His eyes to heaven, and prayed for His disciples. He said: \"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\" . . .",
