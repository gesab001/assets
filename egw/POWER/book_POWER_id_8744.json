    "word": "Improvement in Speech\n     Of all the gifts that God has bestowed upon men, none is more precious than the gift of speech. It is a talent that should be diligently improved. If sanctified by the Holy Spirit, it is a power for good. It is with the tongue that we convince and persuade; with it we offer prayer and praise to God; and with it we convey rich thoughts of the Redeemer's love. By a right use of the gift of speech, the canvasser can sow the precious seeds of truth in many hearts.",
