    "word": "Chapter 43 \u2014The Church on Earth\n\nGod has a church upon the earth who are His chosen people, who keep His commandments. He is leading, not stray offshoots, not one here and one there, but a people. The truth is a sanctifying power; but the church militant is not the church triumphant. There are tares among the wheat. \u201cWilt thou then that we . . . gather them up?\u201d was the question of the servant; but the master answered, \u201cNay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\u201d The gospel net draws not only good fish, but bad ones as well, and the Lord only knows who are His.",
