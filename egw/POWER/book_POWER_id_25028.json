    "word": "Our message is to be proclaimed with a loud voice, with power and assurance. In a most decided, positive manner we are to show that we have not changed our faith. Do not make it appear that there is no difference between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. Build yourselves up by increased purity of faith and Christlikeness of character, increasing in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, who is our righteousness and our sanctification. Let us show that we are a people who keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus Christ. Let the truth abide in the heart. Christ declared, \"I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth\" (John 17:19). Keep yourselves in the love of God by hearkening diligently to His commandments, looking for His keeping power, His mercy, expecting salvation through His grace.--Letter 110, 1902, pp. 7, 8, 10, 11. (To Dr. David Paulson, July 7, 1902.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. March 3, 1980",
