    "word": "We may learn precious lessons in this respect from the life and character of Timothy. From a child Timothy had known the Scriptures. Religion was the atmosphere of his home. The piety of his home life was . . . pure, sensible, and uncorrupted by false sentiments. . . . The Word of God was the rule which guided Timothy. He received his instruction, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little. And the spiritual power of these lessons kept him pure in speech and free from all corrupting sentiments. His home instructors cooperated with God in educating this young man to bear the burdens that were to come upon him at an early age. . . .",
