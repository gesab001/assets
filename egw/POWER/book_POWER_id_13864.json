    "word": "Psalm 104\n\n   14 (see EGW on Genesis 1:29, Vol. 1, p. 1081). A Harmony of Words and Works.--The words and works of the Lord harmonize. His words are gracious and His works bountiful. \"He causeth grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man.\" How liberal are the provisions He has made for us. How wonderfully He has displayed His munificence and power in our behalf. Should our gracious Benefactor treat us as we treat one another, where would we be? Shall we not strive earnestly to follow the golden rule, \"All things \n                                                                           1152\nwhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets\" (Letter 8, 1901).",
