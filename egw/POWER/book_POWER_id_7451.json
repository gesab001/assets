    "word": "The Piedmont valleys have been mentioned. I have been shown the \n151\npoverty that exists there; and yet in these valleys there are some of the most precious souls that are to be found anywhere. I have seen places there where our tracts and papers were scattered. A divine power seemed to accompany them. I have seen persons upon their knees with the tracts before them, the tears rolling down their cheeks as they read, for an answering chord had been touched in their hearts. They knew that what they read was truth, and that they ought to obey it. Whether these scenes have already taken place or are still in the future, I cannot say.",
