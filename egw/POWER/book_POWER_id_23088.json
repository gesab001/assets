    "word": "Those who will work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, will realize that it is God that worketh in them, to will and to do of his own pleasure. There should be thousands fully awake and in earnest in the work of God, who should be bright and shining lights. There should be thousands who \n                                                                           39\nknow the time in which we are living, and who wait not to be urged, but who are constrained by the power of God to diffuse light, to open to others the truth that is so distinctly revealed in the word of God. There is no time to lose. Men and women should be ministering in unenlightened communities in regions beyond. After they have awakened an interest, they should find the living preacher who is skilful in the presentation of the truth, and qualified to instruct families in the word of God.",
