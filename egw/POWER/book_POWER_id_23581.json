    "word": "The Brn. Lane commenced right in this work. In their labor they did not go among the churches, but went out into new fields. They commenced humble. They were little in their own eyes, and felt the necessity of their whole dependence being in God. These brothers are now in great danger of becoming self-sufficient, especially Elbert. In his discussion with opponents, the truth has obtained the victory, and Bro. Elbert has begun to feel strong in himself. As soon as he gets above the simplicity of the work, then his labors will not benefit the precious cause of God. Bro. Elbert should not encourage a love for discussions, but avoid them whenever he can. These contests with the powers of darkness in debate seldom result the best for the advancement of the present truth.",
