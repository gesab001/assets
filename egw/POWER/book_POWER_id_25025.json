We are never to plan our work in a way that calls for a prodigal outlay of means or for an undue taxation of the mental and physical \n\n\n                                   -388- \n\npowers. The worker who plans his work in this way does great harm to himself. He worries, and his mind is worn out by his anxiety to make everything appear to what he supposes to be the best effect, for he gets nervous if he cannot obtain all the means he needs to carry out his plans to his satisfaction.

He forgets that true success is dependent on the One who has said, \"Without Me ye can do nothing\" (John 15:5). The things that should have taken the first and highest control of the mind are lost sight of in the effort to make a striking impression. The common fire, not the sacred fire of God's kindling, is used.",
