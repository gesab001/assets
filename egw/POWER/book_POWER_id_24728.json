    "word": "Each angel is at his post, waiting for the cooperation of human channels to give efficiency and power to the truth in the restoration of fallen man. This was Christ's work; this is our work. The angels of God are to be regarded as ever present with the interested, consecrated worker, perpetually stimulating, strengthening, and encouraging the efforts of the laborers on earth. By the eye of faith we are fighting in view of the whole universe of heaven. There is plenty of help and strength for us in God, for the heavenly agencies are mighty. Their divine influence is with all we do and all we say to advance the glory of God.",
