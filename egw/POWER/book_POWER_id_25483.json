    "word": "Not one of us will be excused for practicing dishonesty and fraud in order to get into positions which we desire. We must learn the meekness and lowliness of Christ. We must reveal that we have borne the test and trial in the furnace until the image of the Lord is reflected in us. We will all reap that which we have sown. They that sow to the wind, will reap the whirlwind. Our capacities and powers are to be seen by the works we do. We can all do a work if we will put forth our energies in accordance with the principles of the Word of God.",
