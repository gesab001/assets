    "word": "I have been shown that in the Sanitarium at Battle Creek there is great need of walking humbly before God, for Satan is devising snares to take every mind that is not entirely surrendered to God, looking to God for light and wisdom daily. There are constant temptations for physicians to exalt science above the God who is the ruler of the universe. There is danger that the physicians will little by little leave the simplicity of Bible faith in the power of God. This has been presented to me for many years as an active agency to becloud the minds of those who are studying to become physicians, and many have fallen over this stone of stumbling, and many more will stumble, because they are not humble men as the Bible declares they must be. There has been presented to me in a very decided manner the danger to which our youth are exposed in associating with the educators in a medical institution and listening to their arguments. If the youth do not feel their daily dependence upon God, they will be deceived to their own ruin.",
