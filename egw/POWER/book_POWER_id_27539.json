    "word": "The history of Daniel is recorded for the special benefit of those who desire to place themselves in the best condition of physical soundness, that they may reach as high a standard of usefulness as Daniel reached. The first chapter of Daniel is one of the most forcible discourses on temperance that could be given. Read it, read it, and as you read, become wise, not in your own conceit, but wise like Daniel and his fellows, whose physical, mental and spiritual understanding increased with their sanctified resolution to adhere strictly to the principles of temperance in eating and drinking. These youth were greatly blessed in their effort to honor and please God by preserving their physical powers so that they would have mental strength, and so that God could mould and fashion them after the divine similitude. We read; \"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. . . . And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that kings inquired \n\n\n                                -12- \n\nof them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.\"",
