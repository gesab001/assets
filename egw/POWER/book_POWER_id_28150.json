    "word": "Believers have been accused, misrepresented and hated, for Christ's sake. They have passed through much tribulation. They have learned by experience, \"Marvel not if the world hate you.\" They cannot understand your motives. Christian character is something their eyes are too blind to discern, their touch too coarse to handle. Their soul powers are too much perverted \n                                                                           929\nto esteem the living heavenly light that shines into the Christian's mind and heart. This light is unknown to the world.",
