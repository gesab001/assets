    "word": "The sleeping disciples had been suddenly awakened by the light surrounding the Saviour. They saw the angel bending over their prostrate Master. They saw him lift the Saviour's head upon his bosom, and point toward heaven. They heard his voice, like sweetest music, speaking words of comfort and hope. . . . Again the disciples in their weariness yield to the strange stupor that overpowers them. Again Jesus finds them sleeping.",
