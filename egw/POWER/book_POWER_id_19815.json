    "word": "If talents are well improved, increased talents are the result. \"Unto every one that hath shall be given.\" . . . If Heaven's bestowed gifts are not appreciated and improved as God's intrusted capital--if they are buried in worldliness, in selfishness--these powers capable of blessing humanity decrease, and because the God of heaven is not sought after and glorified as the source of all these precious endowments, He is dishonored, and He cuts off the supply. In order to increase, to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, we must put to use by human effort our physical and intellectual powers.",
