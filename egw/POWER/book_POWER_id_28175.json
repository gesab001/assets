    "word": "I was searching through my writings before coming to this meeting, to see what I should take with me to Australia, and I found an envelope on which was written. \"Testimony given in regard to time-setting. June 21, 1851. Preserve carefully.\" I opened it, and this is what I found. It reads, \"A copy of a vision the Lord gave sister White June 21, 1851, at Camden, N. Y. The Lord showed me that the message must go, and that it must not be hung on time: for time will never be a test again. I saw that some were getting a false excitement, arising from preaching time, that the third angel's message can stand on its own foundation, and that it needs not time to strengthen it, and that it will go with mighty power, and do its work, and will be cut short in righteousness.",
