    "word": "Women to Consecrate Their Time to Service of God.--Women who are willing to consecrate some of their time to the service of the Lord should be appointed to visit the sick, look after the young, and minister to the necessities of the poor. They should be set apart to this work by prayer and laying on of hands. [THE ARTICLE IN WHICH THIS STATEMENT APPEARS IS ENTITLED \"THE DUTY OF THE MINISTER AND THE PEOPLE.\" IT IS A CALL FOR INVOLVEMENT OF THE LAITY IN THE CHURCH TO BECOME ACTIVE AND TO SHARE THE BURDENS OF THE MINISTER. SEE APPENDIX C.] In some cases they will need to counsel with the church officers or the minister, but if they are devoted women, maintaining a vital connection with God, they will be a power for good in the church. This is another means of strengthening and building up the church. We need to branch out more in our methods of labor. Not a hand should be bound, not a soul discouraged, not a voice should be hushed; let every individual labor, privately or publicly, to help forward this grand work. Place the burdens upon men and women of the church, that they may grow by reason of the exercise, and thus become effective agents in the hand of the Lord for the enlightenment of those who sit in darkness.--RH, July 9, 1895.",
