There, with holy calmness, the servants of the Lord set their feet upon the rock of His promises. During the struggle at Augsburg, Luther \u201cdid not pass a day without devoting three hours at least to prayer, and they were hours selected from those the most favorable to study.\u201d In the privacy of his chamber he was heard to pour out his soul before God in words \u201cfull of adoration, fear, and hope, as when one speaks to a friend.\u201d(The Great Controversy, 210.)",
