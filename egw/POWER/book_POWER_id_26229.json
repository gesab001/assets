    "word": "There is no such thing as a miracle, [they say]. The men chosen of God and precious will let God speak for Himself in regard to miracles, for the Lord will not work miracles to gratify human curiosity. Let the truth of God convert the man and he becomes as a little child, and bows in humble submission to the divine will--heart, mind, strength, and soul--in humble reverence for Jesus Christ and the Omnipotent Power. He is as a man born again. Mercy and the love of God are a controlling power. The beholding of the grace and glory of the Lord Jesus and his own littleness in contrast does not overwhelm him, for he \n\n\n                                 -128- \n\nbecomes changed as he is beholding and the impress is made upon his mind, \"He is my salvation; He is my covering.\" Christ's glory is transforming his character.",
