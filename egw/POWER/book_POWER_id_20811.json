    "word": "There is such a thing as being partaker of the divine nature. We shall all be tempted in a variety of ways, but when we are tempted we need to remember that a provision has been made whereby we may overcome. ... He who truly believes in Christ is made partaker of the divine nature, and has power that he can appropriate under every temptation. He will not fall under temptation or be left to defeat. . . .",
