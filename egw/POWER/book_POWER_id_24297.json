    "word": "True sanctification comes through willing obedience. We are distinctly and decidedly taught that the proper observance of the Sabbath brings a knowledge of what constitutes true sanctification. Reputation and even life itself might better be sacrificed than the truth of the word of God. God declares that when His Sabbath is honored as sacred and holy, it is to His people a sign between Him and them, whereby they may know that He is that doth sanctify them. \"Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you.\" God has set it apart to be devoted to holy service. It is His memorial of Creation. By His creative power God is distinguished from all other gods that are worshiped. The Sabbath is a public token by which the world may recognize the true and living God. If they obey Him and reverence His holy day, the Sabbath is a continual sign between Him and them, a pledge that He will recognize and fulfill His covenant.",
