    "word": "Some say, when an effort is made to enlighten then on this point, \"I will leave off by degrees.\" But Satan laughs at all such decisions. He says, \n\n\n                                     -6- \n\n\"They are secure in my power. I have no fear of them on that ground.\" But he knows that he has no power over the man who, when sinners entice him, has moral courage to say No, squarely and positively. Such a one has dismissed the companionship of the devil, and as long as he holds to Jesus Christ, he is safe. He stands where heavenly angels can connect with him, giving him moral power to overcome. He can truly advocate temperance; for, with a tobacco pipe in his mouth, he will not urge a liquor drinker to abstain from alcohol.",
