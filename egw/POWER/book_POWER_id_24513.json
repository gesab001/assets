    "word": "Then I was shown concerning the wicked who now die and are happy. I saw in their sickness and death if they should once realize their awful condition, they would die in such agony of mind and would make such appeals as would frighten some to profess the truth that did not love it, that never could be saved, and go through the time of trouble, and others would be deranged. And again if they felt their lost condition, it would show that \n\n\n                                    -171- \n\nSatan had not power enough over them to blind their minds so they could not feel their own condition. I saw that the wicked were Satan's lawful prey, and that they were completely deceived by him; therefore now is the time when there are no bands in the death of the wicked.",
