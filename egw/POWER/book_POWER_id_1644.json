    "word": "A tender spirit, a gentle, winning deportment, may save the erring, and hide a multitude of sins. The revelation of Christ in your own character will have a transforming power upon all with whom you come in contact. Let Christ be daily made manifest in you, and He will reveal through you the creative energy of His words,--a gentle, persuasive, yet mighty influence to re-create other souls in the beauty of the Lord our God.--Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, p. 129.",
