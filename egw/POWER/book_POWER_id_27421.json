    "word": "If you have received only one talent, instead of burying it say, \"I have but one talent, and I must make the most of it. I will be faithful in the little things, because the Word declares, 'He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much' (Luke 16:10). I must use to the very best advantage that which is given me. I must not waste one jot or tittle of my powers in the gratification of appetite or pride of appearance. In my family I must be a faithful teacher, training my children for the future, immortal life. I must teach them to be honest and truthful, kind and patient. I myself must be all that I desire my children to be; for in speaking of His disciples, Christ said, 'For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified'\" (John 17:19).",
