    "word": "Christ Our Example in Medical Missionary Work. Of His disciples Christ says, \"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\" In doing medical missionary work, we can have efficiency and power only by working as Christ worked. And we can be Christlike in word and deed only when His will is perfected in us. Then shall His righteousness go before us, and the glory of the Lord shall be our rearward.",
