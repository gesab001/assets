    "word": "How this is accomplished, Christ has shown us. By what means did He overcome in the conflict with Satan? By the Word of God. Only by the Word could He resist temptation. \"It is written,\" He said. And unto us are given \"exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature. . . .\" Every promise in God's Word is ours. . . . When assailed by temptation, look not to circumstances or to the weakness of self, but to the power of the Word. All its strength is yours.",
