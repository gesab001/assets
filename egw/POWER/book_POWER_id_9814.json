    "word": "Idleness Weakens Brain Power.--The reason the youth have so little strength of brain and muscle is because they do so little in the line of useful labor. \"Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
