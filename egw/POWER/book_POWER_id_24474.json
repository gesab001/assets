    "word": "Our lives must be hid with Christ in God. We must have a personal knowledge of Christ. Then only can we rightly represent Him before the world.

Their words will be imbued with the power of the Holy Spirit to soften and subdue the heart. It will be manifest that the words spoken are spirit and life.--Letter 352, 1908. (To Elder S. N. Haskell, December 16, 1908.)",
