    "word": "Let us take hold in faith. Let us pray. Let us believe. Let us act, and the Lord will encourage and strengthen us in the way. I want to see the salvation of God revealed in this meeting. He has power to give us. There is no lack of power on His part, but there is a lack of faith and of humility on the part of His people. Many of us would not know how to use that power if we were to receive it. Let us learn of the great Teacher, what it means to walk in humility, as Christ walked in humility.--Ms. 49, 1908. (MR 900.19)",
