    "word": "The revelation of His grace in humanity is an evidence of the power of the truth. Those who profess to follow Christ and yet do not reveal this grace . . . must know that their profession is a fraud. . . . A professing Christian cannot descend to the world's level without dishonoring the religion of Christ and making himself disloyal. Such a one is offensive to God. The Lord cannot own him as His disciple.",
