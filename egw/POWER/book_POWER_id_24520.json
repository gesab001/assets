    "word": "I have trembled for you; because the people were looking to you, and hanging upon your words and were not doing as they should have done,--they were not catching the precious rays of light that shone from the word of God. They were not cooperating with God, and did not feel the truth burning in their own hearts, that they might impart the same to others. Some have done this, but many have lost the freshness, the power and glory of the truth, because they did not let its light shine forth to those who were in darkness of error.",
