    "word": "My son, walk humbly with God. Your power and efficiency are in Jesus. The mighty tide of spiritual power will come upon the men \n\n106. \n\nwho preach the word, uplifting Jesus. This inspires in the hearer a living faith, which brings forth fruit abundantly. We want the truth spoken to human hearts by men that have been baptized with holy love for Christ, and for the purchase of His blood, men who are themselves thoroughly impressed with the truth they are presenting to others; and who are practicing the same in their own life. The word of God is sure, and every speaker should seek to link the hearer to Christ (read John 17:22-24; Ephesians 1:3-8).",
