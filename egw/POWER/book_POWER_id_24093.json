    "word": "Just so when infidel authors are studied. These men have sharp intellects, and their sharp ideas are presented, and the mind of the student is influenced by them; they are pleased with their brilliance. But where did those men obtain their powers of intellect? Where did they get their sharpness? From the fountain of all knowledge. But they prostituted their powers; they gave them as a contribution to the devil, and don't you think the devil is smart? Many are traveling in the devil's tracks in reading infidel authors. Satan is sharp, and they fall in love with his learning and smartness.--Ms 8b, 1891, pp. 3, 4. (Talk to teachers, Harbor Heights, Michigan, July 27, 1891.)",
