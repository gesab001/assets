    "word": "God\u2019s right to our service is measured by the infinite sacrifice He has made for our salvation. \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\u201d For our sake Christ lived a life of sorrow and privation. He was pure and holy, yet on Him was laid the iniquity of us all. . . . With a touch of His hand He healed the sick; yet He suffered grievous bodily pain. He cast out demons with a word, and delivered those bound by Satan\u2019s temptations; yet temptations such as have never beset anyone assailed Him. He raised the dead by His power; yet He suffered the agony of a most terrible death.",
