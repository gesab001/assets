    "word": "To those who are desirous of being efficient laborers in God's cause, I would say, if you are putting an undue weight of labor on the brain, thinking you will lose ground unless you study all the time, you had better change your views and your course of action. Unless greater care is exercised in this respect, there are many who will go down to the grave prematurely. This you cannot afford to do; for there is a world to be saved. . . . Everywhere, everywhere the truth is to stand forth in its glorious power and in its simplicity. Do not boast of what you know, but take your case to God. Say to him, I comply with the conditions.--Idem. p. 214. \n\n\n                     -28-",
