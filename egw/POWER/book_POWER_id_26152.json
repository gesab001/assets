    "word": "The tree of life was a type of the one great Source of immortality. Of Christ it is written, \"In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.\" He is the fountain of life. Obedience to Him is the life-giving, vivifying power that gladdens the soul. Through sin man shut himself off from access to the tree of life. Now, life and immortality are brought to light through Jesus Christ.",
