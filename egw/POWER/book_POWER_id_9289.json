    "word": "Let those who are sick do all in their power, by correct practice in eating, drinking, and dressing, and by taking judicious exercise, to secure recovery of health. Let the patients who come to our sanitariums be taught to cooperate with God in seeking health. \"Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.\" God made nerve and muscle in order that they might be used. It is the inaction of the human machinery that brings suffering and disease.--Letter 5, 1904.",
