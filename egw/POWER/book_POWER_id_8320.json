    "word": "\"As I contemplate the past year, I am filled with gratitude to God for His preserving care and loving-kindness. We are living in a perilous time, when all our powers must be consecrated to God. We are to follow Christ in His humiliation, His self-denial, His suffering. We owe everything to Jesus, and renewedly I consecrate myself to His service, to lift Him up before the people, to proclaim His matchless love.\"",
