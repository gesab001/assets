    "word": "These children never forgot the kind, gentle words that the Saviour spoke to them. The mothers were never tired of repeating these words. Both to mothers and children the occurrence was a constant wellspring of joy. Children, your father and mother are trying to do their best for you. They try to keep you from doing that which will displease the Lord Jesus. They present you to the Saviour, that He may keep you from all harm. Every day you are to remember that you are under the keeping power of Him who sees every action that you do and hears every word that you speak. You must seek to help yourselves by doing those things that will be pleasing in the sight of God, who is too pure and holy to regard with approval anything like falsehood or deception. You are old enough now to try to do right. . . .",
