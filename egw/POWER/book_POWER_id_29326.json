    "word": "Do not think that by placing your burdens on others, you can find relief. Come right to the Burden-bearer, and tell him about them. Believe that he is able and willing to meet the circumstances of your case. When in contrition you come to the foot of the cross, when you have faith in the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour, you will receive power through him. As you cast your helpless soul upon him, he gives you peace and joy and strength and courage. Then you are able to tell someone else how precious Christ is to you. You can say, \"I sought him, and found him precious to my soul.\"",
