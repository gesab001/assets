    "word": "P.S.--Will you please to read this in your churches? and will you make earnest effort to draw nigh to God that God may draw nigh to you? Will you urge upon the churches the searching of the Scriptures and the careful reading of the Testimonies? The warnings that have been given to arouse the churches to activity have not been regarded, and God holds the church guilty because of this neglect. You need the revival of the Spirit of God. You need in the several churches to greatly humble your souls before God, lest Jesus pass by and leave you no blessing. Now while mercy lingers, be in earnest. Make no delay, lest it shall be forever too late. The slumber of the world-loving men and women is deep. It will require a powerful effort to break up this frozen state of things and thaw out souls. May God help you to help yourselves. \n                                        Ellen G. White. \n\n\n     Basle, Switzerland. Dec. 27, 1886.",
