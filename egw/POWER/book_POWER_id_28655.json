    "word": "The Lord's servants are merely stewards. The Lord will work through them \n\n                                   - 91 - \n\nwhen they surrender themselves to Him to be worked by the Holy Spirit. When by faith men place themselves in the Lord's hands, saying, \"Here am I; send me,\" He undertakes this work. But men must get out of the Lord's way. They must not hinder His purposes by their devising. For years the Lord has had a controversy with His people because they have followed their own judgment, and have not relied on divine wisdom. If the workers get in God's way, hindering the advancement of the work, thinking that their brain power is sufficient for the planning and carrying forward of the work, the Lord will correct their error. By His divine spirit He enlightens and trains every worker. He shapes His own providences to carry forward His work according to His mind and judgment.",
