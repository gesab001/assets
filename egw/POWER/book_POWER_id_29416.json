    "word": "We should never desire it to be said that the truth we profess to believe gives us such characters as are indicated by the neglected appearance of things indoors and about the premises at the present time in the Huntsville School. The temper, the style, and the spirit of those in charge is revealed by the condition of things to be seen about the institution. The present state of neglect would indicate old habits retained, defects of character unimproved, and does not bespeak a perfect character, thorough conversion. There is too much of self and too little of the imprint of the thoroughness of Christ. Too many words are spoken that are not profitable, words that reveal the spirit of the world. The presentation now seen indicates that Christ is not formed within, the hope of glory. The exhortations and admonitions given in the past seem to have fallen powerless on the ears of those to whom they have been sent. Reformation they have neglected so long that some are dead in trespasses and sins.",
