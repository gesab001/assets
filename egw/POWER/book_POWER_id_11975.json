    "word": "It was not because of any outward evidence that the showers were about to fall, that Elijah could so confidently bid Ahab prepare for rain. The prophet saw no clouds in the heavens; he heard no thunder. He simply spoke the word that the Spirit of the Lord had moved him to speak in response to his own strong faith. Throughout the day he had unflinchingly performed the will of God and had revealed his implicit confidence in the prophecies of God\u2019s word; and now, having done all that was in his power to do, he knew that Heaven would freely bestow the blessings foretold. The same God \n138\nwho had sent the drought had promised an abundance of rain as the reward of rightdoing; and now Elijah waited for the promised outpouring. In an attitude of humility, \u201chis face between his knees,\u201d he interceded with God in behalf of penitent Israel.",
