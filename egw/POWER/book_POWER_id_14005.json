    "word": "\"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" This language can be used only by the Deity. All created things live by the will and power of God. They are dependent recipients of the life of the Son of God. However able and talented, however large their capabilities, they are replenished with life from the Source of all life. Only He who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light and life, could say, \"I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again.\" All the human beings in our world take their life from Him. He is the spring, the fountain of life (MS 131, 1897).",
