    "word": "On the \"March to Death.\"--That men may not take time to meditate, Satan leads them into a round of gaiety and pleasure seeking, of eating and drinking. He fills them with ambition to make an exhibition that will exalt self. Step by step, the world is reaching the conditions that existed in the days of Noah. Every conceivable crime is committed. The lust of the flesh, the pride of the eyes, the display of selfishness, the misuse of power, the cruelty, . . . all these are the working of satanic agencies. This round of crime and folly men call \"life.\" . . .",
