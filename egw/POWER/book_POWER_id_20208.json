    "word": "I would urge you . . . carefully to consider the self-denial and self-sacrifice that Christ has endured in your behalf, that you, if you choose, may have that happiness and peace in this life which He alone can give, and an eternity of bliss by and by. Then will you not become missionaries for Christ? Are you not willing to deny self for His sake? to consider how you can do Him service who has done such service for you in redeeming your soul from the power of sin and Satan? When upon earth, Christ said of Himself, \u201cI am among you as he that serveth.\u201d He did not strive to obtain the highest place; for He was meek and lowly in heart. He invites you to learn of Him, to wear His yoke\u2014the yoke of obedience to every precept of Jehovah.\u2014Youth\u2019s Instructor, Apr. 1, 1897.",
