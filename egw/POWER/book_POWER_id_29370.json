    "word": "Right Relations in the Work of God \n\n     Men, fallible men, are not to think it is their prerogative to control, to mark out, or to prescribe the labors of their fellow men. When God works upon the human instrumentality, let men be very careful how they intermeddle; for it is its process, the work of God is divine. The work of God has often been hindered by men considering that they had power to say, \"Go here\" or \"Go there\" \"Do this\" or \"Do that,\" without consulting the individual himself, or respecting his convictions as a laborer together with God. God has promised his presence to every believer; and let those who are in positions of authority, presidents of conferences and board councils, and everyone who has to do with the human mind, respect the individuality of mind and conscience. These workers are in copartnership with Jesus Christ, and you may interpose yourself so as to interfere with God's plans; for the human agent is under his special authority and dictation.",
