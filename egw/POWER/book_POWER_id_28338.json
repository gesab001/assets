    "word": "In Christ crucified we behold the manifestation of the wisdom and power of God, daily converting the soul and divinely adapted to meet all the obstacles and trials that come to us all in our daily experience. There is very little genuine faith in a personal Saviour who will help the soul in every emergency. Christ was crucified to take away our sins. Risen from the dead He is our Intercessor, our chosen and appointed Advocate, our Substitute and Surety in God's presence. Through His blood every soul may have access to God. In Him humanity and divinity are combined. It is enough; all sufficiency is provided for every soul. The follower of Christ is fitted for every work and every trial. In his desire for virtue and holiness he is opposed at every step by the synagogue of Satan, and he has to engage in a personal, spiritual conflict. \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high places\" [Ephesians 6:12, margin].--Letter 76, 1894. (Written to a sister in the church from Melbourne, Australia, in March 1894.) \n\nEllen G. White Estate Washington, D. C. October 5, 1983 \n\nEntire Letter Released",
