    "word": "One who would be a teacher of sacred things should not go forth to work with the people without a full assurance that he has the truth. He should not go forth feeling that perhaps the doctrines which he advocates may not all be substantiated by the Bible. Anything short of a full conviction that what he presents is truth will make his preaching powerless, unless he has the presumption to put forth mere assertions as conclusive evidence. This is unfair, and yet this has often been done by sharp debaters. You should give your authority to the people from God's Word. You should not believe any doctrine simply because another says it is truth. You should not believe it because Elder Smith, or Elder Kilgore, or Elder Van Horn, or Elder Haskell says it is truth, but because God's voice has declared it in His living Oracles.",
