    "word": "After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the disciples, clothed with the divine panoply, went forth as witnesses to tell the wonderful story of the manger and the cross. They were humble men, but they went forth with the truth. After the death of their Lord, they were a helpless, disappointed, discouraged company,--as sheep without a shepherd: but now they go forth as witnesses for the truth, with no weapons but the word and Spirit of God, to triumph over all opposition. Their Saviour had been rejected and condemned and nailed to the ignominious cross. The Jewish priests and rulers had declared in scorn, \"He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.\" But that cross, that instrument of shame and torture, brought hope and salvation to the world. The believers rallied; there hopelessness and conscious helplessness had left them. They were transformed in character, and united in the bonds of Christian love. Although without wealth, though counted by the world as mere ignorant fishermen, they were made by the Holy Spirit witnesses for Christ. Without earthly honor or recognition, they were heroes of faith. From their lips came words of divine eloquence and power that shook the world.",
