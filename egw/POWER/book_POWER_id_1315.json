    "word": "Will the students of our schools study, and endeavor to copy the life and character of Him who came down from heaven to show them what they must be, if they would enter the kingdom of God? I have borne you a message of the near coming of the Son of God in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. I have not presented before you any definite time, but have repeated to you the injunction of Christ himself, to watch unto prayer, \"For in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh.\" [Matthew 24:44.] The warning has come echoing down the ages to our time, \"Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning \n                                                                           115\nand the end, the first and the last. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\" [Revelation 22:12-14.]--Review and Herald, Aug. 21, 1888. \n\n                                               -",
