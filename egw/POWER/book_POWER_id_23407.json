    "word": "Many in Battle Creek have yielded to Satan's temptations until their hearts have become exceedingly hard. They are unsympathetic and critical, judging and condemning others, as though God had placed them, poor erring mortals, upon the judgment seat. There has not been in the cause of God a more hearty, earnest, thorough workman than Bro. Bell. Had his accusers felt as deep an interest in the prosperity of the cause of God, and applied their powers as has he, they would not have had time or disposition to condemn his work. They would better by far have sympathized with him.",
