    "word": "I have attended all but two morning meetings. At eight o'clock Bro. Jones speaks upon the subject of justification by faith, and great interest is manifested. There is a growth in faith and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. There are quite a number who have not had an opportunity to hear upon this subject before but they are taking it in, and are being fed with large morsels from the Lord's table. The universal testimony from those who have spoken has been that this message of light and truth which has come to our people is just the truth for this time and wherever they go among the churches, light, and relief, and the blessing of God is sure to come in. We have a feast of fat things and when we see souls grasping the light we are rejoiced, looking unto Jesus who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Christ is the great pattern; his character must be our character. All excellence is in him. Turning from man and every other model with open face we behold Jesus in all his glory. And their minds are filled with the grand and overpowering ideas of his excellency; every other object sinks into insignificance, and every part of moral discipline is lost which does not promote their likeness to his image. I see heights and depths that we may reach accepting every ray of light and going forward to a greater light. The end is near and God forbid that we shall be asleep at this time.",
