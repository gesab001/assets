    "word": "False prophets are described by Paul in his letter to Timothy: \"Men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers \n\n\n                                    -90- \n\nof God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof\" [2 Timothy 3:2-5]. Paul warns his son in the gospel, saying, \"This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck\" [1 Timothy 1:18, 19].",
