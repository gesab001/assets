    "word": "In order for men to be depended upon, there must be growth of powers, the exercise of every faculty, even in little things; then power is acquired to engage in larger responsibilities. Individual responsibility and accountability are essential. Do not shrink from bearing your share of responsibilities \n\n\n                                 -293- \n\nbecause there are risks to run and something to be ventured. Do not leave others to be brains for you. You must train your powers to put forth strength and vigor; then the entrusted talents will grow, as a steady, uniform, unyielding energy is exercised in bearing individual responsibility. God would have man add, day by day, little by little, to his stock of ideas, acting as if the moments were jewels, to be carefully gathered and discreetly cherished. He will thus acquire breadth of thought and strength of intellect. . . .",
