    "word": "Your teachers will do all that they can to help you. They will try to show you what you must do to inherit eternal life. They will try to show you how to become conversant with the living principles of truth, that you may stand before God and men on vantage ground. Will you cooperate with your teachers? Will you strive earnestly to become useful men and women? Christ is waiting to help you, and He is an all-powerful Helper. When God gave Him to our world, He gave all heaven. He placed in His hands every power, every facility of heaven, to give to those who receive Him. Christ came to our world to give us an example of what we may become, to show us that we may live a perfect life. He says to us, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" [Matthew 28:20].",
