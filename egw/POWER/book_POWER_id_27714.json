    "word": "Young men, you may have the truth on your side. When your heart and all your faculties are brought under the influence of truth, when \n                                                                           139\nyou bring the truth, with all its living, sanctifying principles, into your heart, you will have confidence to present it to others. Christ is then made unto you wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. We are laborers together with God, and Christ is by your side. You are yoked up with Him, He leading and guiding. Such a worker is as a sharp sickle in the harvest field. He does not use his God-given powers in debating. That is Satan's line. Pointing to the cross of Calvary, he cries, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" He urges sinners to behold eternal realities. He holds the telescope before his eyes, that by faith he may discern these realities. Like Moses, he endures the seeing of Him who is invisible. He does not seek ease or amusement. He does not visit the churches to be petted and waited upon, to jest and joke. He knows that there is stern, earnest work to be done. Those who are truly converted do not waste the precious moments in foolish conversation and making a mock of their brethren. By words that have a weight of influence for good they give full proof of their ministry. They deny self and lift the cross, and follow Jesus the crossbearer. They ardently desire to yoke up with Christ, to lift His burdens and partake of His sufferings.",
