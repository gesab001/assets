    "word": "My brother, you have not been as God planned you should be--growing up into the full stature of a man in Christ Jesus. . . . You have ceased to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth. Do you not realize that you have lost your vital connection with God? Unless the matter is opened before you, you cannot now see the great good you might have accomplished had you kept in vital touch with God. There are those you might have helped, blessed, and saved, had you employed your God-given powers to the best account. Today, the present moment, is yours. It may be your last opportunity, your last privilege, to speak and act as one who must give an account. . . . Your own neglect to improve and grow as God's husbandry has lost for you your influence and power. Will you remember that God holds in His hand your life, and the life of every member of your family and the family with whom you have united? . . .",
