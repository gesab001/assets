    "word": "16. For Christ's sake cease to prostitute your powers to the service of self. Put your undivided interest into the work that has been committed to your hands. Jesus is looking upon you to see what spirit you manifest in the little things of your earthly life. You are now determining what shall be your destiny hereafter, and heaven is worth everything to you. If you accept the grace of Christ, and the gift of his righteousness, you may show by a consistent life that Jesus is all in all to you. His service is reasonable, for he has redeemed you, and every power of your being belongs to him. You need not make a failure of your Christian life, for Christ has made abundant provision that your faculties may be rightly directed, that your character may be pure and elevated and noble.",
