    "word": "The work that lies before us is one that will put to the stretch every power of the human being.  It will call for the exercise of strong faith and constant vigilance. At times the difficulties that we shall meet will be most disheartening.  The very greatness of the task will appall us.  And yet, with God's help, His servants will finally triumph.  \"Wherefore,\" my brethren, \"I desire that ye faint not\" (Ephesians 3:13) because of the trying experiences that are before you.  Jesus will be with you; He will go before you by His Holy Spirit, preparing the way; and He will be your helper in every emergency.  -- 2SM 406-408.",
