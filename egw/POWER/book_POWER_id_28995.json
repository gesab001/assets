    "word": "Receiving and Giving \n\n     There must ever be an interchange of taking in and giving out, receiving and restoring. This links us up as laborers together with God. Not one expression of unbelief is to come from our lips under the hardest trial. Heaven is much nearer to earth when every soul who knows the truth, expresses it in word and action. The giving out ever expresses the truth, and increases the power of taking in. This is the lifework of the Christian. He that will lose his life will find it.",
