    "word": "If persons are as deserving to be separated from the church as Satan was of being cast out of Heaven, they will have sympathizers. There is always a class who are more influenced by individuals than they are controlled by the Spirit of God and sound principles; and they are, in their unconsecrated state, ever ready to take up upon the wrong side, and give their pity and sympathy to the very ones who least deserve it. These sympathizers have a powerful influence with others, and things are seen in a perverted light, and great harm is done, and many souls ruined. Satan, in his rebellion, took a third part of the angels. They turned from the Father \n                                                                           146\nand from his Son, and united with the instigator of rebellion. With these facts before us, we should move with the greatest caution. What can we expect in our connection with men and women with peculiar minds but trials and perplexity. We must bear this, and avoid the necessity of rooting up the tares, lest the wheat be rooted up also.",
