    "word": "If men could see for a moment beyond the range of finite vision, if they could catch a glimpse of the Eternal, every mouth would be stopped in its boasting.

When men have gone as far in scientific research as their limited powers will permit, there is still an infinity beyond what they can apprehend.",
