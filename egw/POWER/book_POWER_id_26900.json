    "word": "We must humble self today, tomorrow, and constantly. With a willing, sanctified heart we must co-operate with God. We are living in the time when Satan has come down in great power. He is walking about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. But the Lord is ready to take away the sin that hinders us from yoking up with Christ. If we wear the yoke of Christ, He will be our Emmanuel, \"God with us,\" supplying every weakness with His strength, every inefficiency with His power of success. But if we take glory to ourselves He removes His excellency from us, and we no longer ride prosperously.",
