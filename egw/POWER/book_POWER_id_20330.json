    "word": "God accepts those who crucify self, and makes them vessels unto honor. They are in His hands as clay in the hands of the potter, and He works His will through them. Such men and women receive spiritual power. Christ lives in them, and the power of His Spirit attends their efforts. They realize that they are to live in this world the life that Jesus lived\u2014a life free from all selfishness; and He enables them to bear witness for Him that draws souls to the cross of Calvary.\u2014Signs of the Times, Apr. 9, 1902.",
