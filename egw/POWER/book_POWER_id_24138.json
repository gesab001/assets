    "word": "I was shown, January 3, 1875, [IN THIS VISION, GIVEN JUST BEFORE THE DEDICATION OF BATTLE CREEK COLLEGE, ELLEN WHITE WAS SHOWN NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS BUT WAS ALSO GIVEN A VIEW OF THE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD WORK, FOR IT WAS IN THIS VISION THAT SHE SAW PRINTING PRESSES IN PUBLISHING HOUSES NOT YET ESTABLISHED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, WHICH YEARS LATER SHE RECOGNIZED AS SHE SAW THEM IN OPERATION.] the course you had been pursuing. You were bending your footsteps in the broad road that leads to death. You were being led captive by Satan at his will, and he was exulting in his power that he had over you. You had two ways before you--one way, which was the way to life, you knew was the way you should go; the other way was the wrong path, which you knew was wrong. You have, against light and knowledge, chosen the wrong way. You know that your course is not pleasing to God. You know that you are going contrary to the word of God. You are not obedient or respectful and you are following a course of folly. You are headstrong and very selfish, choosing your own pleasure.",
