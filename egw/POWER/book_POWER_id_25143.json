    "word": "The proclamation of the law upon Mount Sinai was a wonderful exhibition of the glory and majesty of God. How did this awful exhibition of God's power affect the people? They were afraid. \"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but \n\n\n                                 -331- \n\nlet not God speak with us, lest we die\" (Exodus 20:18, 19). They wanted Moses to be their mediator. They did not understand that Christ was their appointed Mediator, else they would certainly be consumed.",
