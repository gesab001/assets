    "word": "Adam fell. Christ has fulfilled His pledge to redeem the lost race. By His sacrifice we are laid under everlasting obligation to God. We are to serve Him with our whole hearts. \"Ye are not your own.... Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" To this end we will put to tax every power God has given us, and strengthen our capabilities to the utmost. The talents God has \n\n\n              -230- \n\nentrusted to us should be increased by cultivation and use. By faithfully using all our powers to God's glory, we shall be able to fulfill His purpose concerning us.",
