    "word": "We learned that Sabbath [Dec. 27] there had been a wonderful meeting similar to those we had in Brooklyn, Danvers, and in Washington. Nearly the whole congregation presented themselves for prayers, and among them, Brethren Prescott and Smith. The Extra in the Review and Herald [Dec. 23, 1890] was read, and the testimony of all was that the power of God attended the reading of the article. They said that this made a deep impression. Brother Olsen made some remarks inquiring why the power of God attended the presenting before them the testimony to the churches in that article when the person who wrote it was not present. He asked them to carefully consider that matter. Was it not the Spirit of God speaking to them in unmistakable voice in vindication of the testimonies, and the work He had laid upon Sister White? Professor Prescott made a confession dating back to Minneapolis, and this made a deep impression. He wept much. Elder Smith said that testimony meant him; said that he felt that it was addressed to him, but he stopped there and went no further. But both placed themselves as there repentant, seeking the Lord. \n                                                                           851\nWell, they said they had never had such a meeting in Battle Creek, and yet the work must be carried on, for it was just begun. Elder Olsen had appointments which he must attend, and Elder Loughborough had an appointment which he must fill. Professor Prescott went to Oregon to help locate their school. Brother Webber, another worker, had gone to help some other church. The Lord sent me here, I fully believe, and that threatened difficulty of the heart did not trouble me at all after we reached Battle Creek.",
