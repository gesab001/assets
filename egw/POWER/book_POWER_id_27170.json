    "word": "Christ in the mount proclaimed the far-reaching principles of the law of God to be carried out in every transaction of life. I worship the true and living God. His hands are over His creative works. Can you wonder that the devil wants to make void the law of God, the standard of His character? It will be the standard in the judgment when the books shall be opened, and every man judged according to the deeds that are done. And the names are written--what does He say?--\"Engraven upon the palms of my hands.\" The marks of the crucifixion have engraven them. They are His property, and you are God's by creation and by redemption. Then we want to know whether you are giving your whole heart to Him, whether you are serving Him with all the power and strength of your intellect; for on these great principles hang all the law and the prophets. The first four commandments define man's duty to His Maker--supreme love to God; the last six define the duty of man to his fellow man. What do we give to Satan when we concede the point that the \n\n\n                                       -235- \n\nlaw of God needs to be taken away? We give the whole creative universe a defective God, a God that made a law and it was so defective that He had to take it away. That is all Satan wants. Can we afford to be working on any side but that of God?",
