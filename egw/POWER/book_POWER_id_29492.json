    "word": "God is to be acknowledged for what he does not reveal of himself than from that which is open to our limited comprehension. If men could comprehend the unsearchable wisdom of God, and could explain that which he has done or could do, they would no longer give him reverence or fear his power. In divine revelation God has given to men mysteries that are incomprehensible, to command their faith. This must be so. If the ways and works of God could be explained by finite minds, he would not stand as supreme. \n\n\n                                   E. G. White. \n\n\n                                 -87-",
