    "word": "The men who close their eyes to the divine light are ignorant, deplorably ignorant, both of the Scripture and of the power of God. The Holy Spirits working is not agreeable to them, and they attribute its manifestations to fanaticism. They rebel against the light, and do all they can to shut it out, calling darkness light, and light darkness. They complain that the teachings of Christ cause undue excitement and fanaticism, which spoils those who receive them for the proper duties of life.",
