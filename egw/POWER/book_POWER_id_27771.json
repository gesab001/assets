    "word": "Christ had the power of recasting important truths, releasing them from the forms and customs in which they had been incased, which robbed them of life and vital power, and giving them back to the world in all their original freshness and force and in their sacred, elevated character. Himself the originator of truth, He could explain its true, far-reaching principles. He borrowed nothing from earthly intellect of the highest order. He Himself had created all the thought, all the talent, but the minds of men of the highest intelligence had been able to comprehend only a small part of the infinite whole.",
