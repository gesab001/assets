{"word": "When Henry White, our eldest son, lay dying, he said, \\93A bed of pain is a precious place when we have the presence of Jesus.\\94 When we are obliged to drink of the bitter waters, turn away from the bitter to the precious and the bright. In trial grace can give the human soul assurance, and when we stand at the deathbed and see how the Christian can bear suffering and go through the valley of death, we gather strength . . . and we fail not, neither are we discouraged in leading souls to Jesus.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "OFC", "page": 76}
