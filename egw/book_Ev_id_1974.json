{"word": "Lord's People Mainly Common People.--The Lord's people are mainly made up of the poor of this world, the common people. Not many wise, not many mighty, not many noble are called. God hath \"chosen the poor of this world.\" \"The poor have the gospel preached to them.\" The wealthy are called, in one sense; they are invited, but they do not accept the invitation. But in these wicked cities the Lord has many who are humble and yet trustful.--Manuscript 17, 1898. \n                                                                           566", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ev", "page": 565}
