{"word": "Of all men upon the face of the earth, those who are handling solemn truths for these perilous times should understand their Bibles, and become acquainted with the evidences of our faith. Unless they possess a knowledge of the word of life, they have no right to undertake to instruct others in the way to life. Ministers should give all diligence to add to their \\93faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity,\\94 [2 Peter 1:5-7.] Some of our ministers graduate when they have scarcely learned the first principles \n124\nof the doctrine of Christ. Those who are ambassadors for Christ, who stand in his stead, beseeching souls to be reconciled to God, should be qualified to present our faith intelligently, and be able to give the reasons of their hope with meekness and fear. Christ said, \\93Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me.\\94 [John 5:39.]", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GW92", "page": 123}
