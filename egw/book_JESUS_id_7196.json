{"word": "\"And so, Father, on this sad day, we leave these things in Thy hands, and pray that the great God who has guided, who has been with us, will guide every step of the way; guide us out of all the wilderness of doubt and trial; guide us to the land of perfect day, where there will be no more sin, no more sorrow, and where we shall bask in the smiles of our blessed Redeemer, who has conquered sin and therefore is victor over death. And grant, O our Father, that in  that great day, those assembled here may be among the number who shall live forever with the good who have gone and those who shall remain until Thy coming. We ask it all in Jesus' name. Amen.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 467}
