    "word": "In their disappointment some of the brethren give up to a feeling of impatience and desperation, as they see the selfishness and covetousness manifested by their teachers. The people are in advance of many of their ministers. If the ministers manifest a spirit of self-sacrifice and a love for souls, means will not be withheld from the cause. Let the ministers come up to the exalted standard as representatives of Christ and we shall see the glory of God attending the presentation of truth, and souls will be constrained to acknowledge its clearness and power. The cause of God must be made primary.",
