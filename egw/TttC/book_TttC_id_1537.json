    "word": "The good work wrought for the church at Battle Creek last fall, the thorough reform and turning to the Lord by physicians, helpers, and managers at the Health Institute, and the general agreement of our brethren and sisters in all parts of the field relative to the great object of the Health Institute and the manner it should be conducted, to which is added the varied experience of more than one year, not only in the wrong course, but also in a right direction, give me more confidence that the health reform and the Health Institute will prove a success than I ever had before. I still fondly hope to see the Health Institute at Battle Creek prospering and in every respect the institute shown me. But it will take time to fully correct and outgrow the errors of the past. With the blessing of God this can and will be done.",
