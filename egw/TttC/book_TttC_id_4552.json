    "word": "My brethren, God calls upon you as His followers to walk in the light. You need to be alarmed. Sin is among us, and it is not seen to be exceedingly sinful.

Walking in the light, running in the way of God's commandments, does not give the idea that we can stand still and do nothing. We must be advancing.",
