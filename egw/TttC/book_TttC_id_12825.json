    "word": "\"Laborers Together With God\" \n\n     The ear of the Lord is open to the cries of those who are in His service. He has promised: \"I will guide thee with Mine eye.\" Psalm 32:8. Walk humbly with God, and ask Him to make your course of duty plain. When He speaks to His representatives and asks them to be laborers together with Him, they will do the same kind of work that Jesus announced as His work when He stood up to read in the synagogue at Nazareth. He opened the book of the prophet Esaias and read: \"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.\" Isaiah 61:1. \n                                                                           203",
