    "word": "Chap. 76 - The Cause in the East\n\n     The fanaticism which raged in years past has left its desolating effects in the East. I saw that God tested His people upon time in 1844, but that no time which has since been set has borne the special marks of His hand. He has not tested His people upon any particular time since 1844. We have been, and still are, in the patient waiting time. Considerable excitement was created by the 1854 time, and many have settled it that that movement was in the order of God because it was quite extensive and some were apparently converted by it. But such conclusions are not necessary. There was much preached in connection with the time in 1854 that was reasonable and right. Some who were honest took truth and error together, and sacrificed much of what they possessed to carry out the error, and after their disappointment they gave up both truth and error, and are now where it is very difficult for the truth to reach them. Some who endured the disappointment have seen the evidences of present truth, and have embraced the third angel's message, and are striving to carry it out in their lives. But where there is one who has been benefited by believing the 1854 time, there are ten who have been injured by it; and many of these are placed where they will not be convinced of the truth, though it be presented before them ever so clearly.",
