    "word": "The Glory of the Cross \n\n     The revelation of God's love to men centers in the cross. Its full significance tongue cannot utter; pen cannot portray; the mind of man cannot comprehend. Looking upon the cross of Calvary we can only say: \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16.",
