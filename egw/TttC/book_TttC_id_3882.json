    "word": "A true shepherd will have an interest in all that relates to the welfare of the flock, feeding, guiding, and defending them. \n                                                                           229\nHe will carry himself with great wisdom and will manifest a tender consideration for all, being courteous and compassionate to all, especially to the tempted, the afflicted, and the desponding. Instead of giving this class the sympathy that their particular cases have demanded and that their infirmities have required, you, my brother, have shunned this class, while you have drawn largely upon others for sympathy. \"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.\" \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.\" \"But made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.\" \"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not Himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me.\"",
