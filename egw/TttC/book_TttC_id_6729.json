    "word": "Christians will be in this world \"an holy nation, a peculiar people,\" showing forth the praises of Him who hath called them \"out of darkness into His marvelous light.\" This light is not to grow dim, but to shine brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. Christ's standard-bearers are never to be off duty. They have a vigilant foe who is waiting and watching to take the fort. Some of Christ's professed watchmen have invited the enemy into their stronghold, have mingled with them, and in their efforts to please have broken down the distinction between the children of God and the children of Satan.",
