    "word": "Extract from a letter written in 1899, from Cooranbong, N. S. W., Australia--It is God's design that those fields which have abundant facilities shall share their advantages with more needy fields. The principle is ever to be followed in all our institutions. God requires that there be less planning for buildings in places where the work is already established, and that means be sent to fields where, for lack of facilities, the laborers work at a great disadvantage. \n\n\n                                                       (153)",
