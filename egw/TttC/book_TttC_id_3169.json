    "word": "These zealous searchers after truth risked their capital of strength and their all in the work of defending the truth and spreading the light.

These men of investigating minds have brought out arguments and made them so plain that a schoolboy may understand them. How easy now for men to become teachers of the truth, while they shun self-sacrifice and self-denial.",
