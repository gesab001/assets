    "word": "When the Pharisees and Sadducees flocked to the baptism of John, that fearless preacher of righteousness addressed them: \"O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.\" These men were actuated by unworthy motives in coming to John. They were men of poisonous principles and corrupt practices. Yet they had no sense of their true condition. Filled with pride and ambition, they would not hesitate at any means to exalt themselves and strengthen their influence with the people. They came to receive baptism at the hand of John that they might better carry out these designs.",
