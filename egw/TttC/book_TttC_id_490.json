    "word": "Then I was directed to these words: \"Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.\" I saw that God is not in all the riches that are obtained.
