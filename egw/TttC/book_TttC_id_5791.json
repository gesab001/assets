    "word": "God has been true to Brother D, and he should respond to His merciful dealings, notwithstanding man has shown so little of tenderness and the feelings of common humanity. It is Brother D's privilege to hide in Christ from the strife of tongues, and to feel that exhaustless sources of gratitude, contentment, and peace are open to him and accessible every moment. Had he earthly treasures without limit, he would not be as rich as he may now be in the privilege of being on the side of right and of drinking to the full of the streams of salvation.",
