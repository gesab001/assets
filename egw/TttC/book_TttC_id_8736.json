    "word": "Brethren, with the beloved John I call upon you to \"behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" What love, what matchless love, that, sinners and aliens as we are, we may be brought back to God and adopted into His family! We \n                                                                           740\nmay address Him by the endearing name, \"Our Father,\" which is a sign of our affection for Him and a pledge of His tender regard and relationship to us. And the Son of God, beholding the heirs of grace, \"is not ashamed to call them brethren.\" They have even a more sacred relationship to God than have the angels who have never fallen.",
