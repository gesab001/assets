    "word": "\"Followers of God, as Dear Children\" \n\n     Every truly converted soul can say: \"I am but a little child; but I am God's child.\" It was at infinite cost that provision was made whereby the human family might be restored to sonship with God. In the beginning, God made man in His own likeness. Our first parents listened to the voice of the tempter and yielded to the power of Satan.

The promise of a Deliverer was given. \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman,\" God said to the serpent, \"and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\" Genesis 3:15.

All that had been lost by yielding to Satan could be regained through Christ.",
