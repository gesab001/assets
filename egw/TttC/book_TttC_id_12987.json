    "word": "Where shall we be before the thousand generations mentioned in this scripture are ended? Our fate will have been decided for eternity. Either we shall have been pronounced worthy of a home in the everlasting kingdom of God or we shall have received sentence of eternal death. Those who have been true and faithful to their covenant with God; those who, remembering Calvary, have stood firmly on the side of truth, ever striving to honor God, will hear the commendation: \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" But those who have given God only halfhearted service, allowing their lives to be conformed to the ways and practices of the world, will hear the sad words: \"Depart from Me; I know you not.\" \n\n\n                                                  (253)",
