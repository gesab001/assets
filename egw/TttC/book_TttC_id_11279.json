    "word": "In answer to the Lord's inquiry, \"Whom shall I send?\" Isaiah responded, \"Here am I; send me.\" Isaiah 6:8. You, my brother, my sister, may not be able to go into the Lord's vineyard yourself, but you may furnish the means to send others. Thus you will be putting your money out to the exchangers; and when the Master comes, you will be able to return to Him His own with usury. Your means can be used to send forth and sustain the messengers of God, who by voice and by influence will give the message: \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" Matthew 3:3. Plans are being made for the advancement of the cause, and now is your time to work.",
