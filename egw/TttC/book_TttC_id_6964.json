    "word": "Professor ----- would have served you well had he not been flattered by some and condemned by others. He became confused. He had traits of character that needed to be suppressed. In their enthusiasm some have given him undue confidence and praise. You have placed the man where it will be difficult for him to recover himself and find his true position.

He had newly come to the faith, and was not prepared for the developments which have been made.",
