    "word": "I was shown that you seek to throw the result of your wrongs upon others, but as a watchman God holds you responsible. You have most humble confessions to make in -----, -----, -----, and other places where your influence has been exerted in opposition to God's servants. Brother and Sister B have been greatly injured by this fanaticism. They have been embarrassed temporally as well as spiritually, and nearly ruined by this deception of Satan. Brother G, you have run to great lengths in this sad fanaticism; your body has been affected as well as your mind, and you now seek to charge it all upon others. You have not a true sense of your position and course in the past. You are free to confess that which others have done, and that which you did not do; but you have failed to confess that which you did do.",
