    "word": "At this time we received earnest requests to attend the convocation meetings in the West. As we read these touching appeals we wept over them. My husband would say to me, \"Ellen, we cannot attend these meetings. At best I could hardly take care of myself on such a journey, and should you faint, what could I do? But, Ellen, we must go;\" and as he would thus speak, his tearful emotions would choke his utterance. In return, while pondering on our feeble condition, and the state of the cause in the West, and feeling that the brethren needed our labors, I would say: \"James, we cannot attend these meetings in the West--but we must go.\" At this point, several of our faithful brethren, seeing our condition, offered to go with us. This was enough to decide the matter. In our new carriage we left Greenville August 29 to attend the general gathering at Wright. Four teams followed us. The journey was a comfortable one and very pleasant in company with sympathizing brethren. The meeting was one of victory.",
