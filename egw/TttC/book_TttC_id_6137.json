    "word": "In a vision of the night he sees a mystic ladder, its base resting upon the earth and its top reaching above the starry host to the highest heavens. Angel messengers are ascending and descending this ladder of shining brightness, showing him the pathway of communication between earth and heaven. \n                                                                           466\nA voice is heard by him, renewing the promise of mercy and protection and of future blessings. When Jacob awoke from his dream, he said: \"Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.\" He looked about him as if expecting to see the heavenly messengers; but only the dim outline of earthly objects, and the heavens above, brilliant with the gems of light, met his earnest, wondering gaze. The ladder and the bright messengers were gone, and the glorious Majesty above it he could see only in imagination.",
