    "word": "\"Thursday we arose at 4 a.m. It had rained in the night and was still raining, yet we ventured to start to ride to Bellows Falls, a distance of twenty-five miles. The first four miles was exceedingly rough, as we took a private track through the fields to escape steep hills. We rode over stones and plowed ground, nearly throwing us out of the sleigh. About sunrise the storm cleared away, and we had very good sleighing when we reached the public road. The weather was very mild; we never had a more beautiful day to travel. On arriving at Bellows Falls, we found that we were one hour too late for the express train, and one hour too early for the accommodation train. We could not get to St. Albans until nine in the evening. We took seats in a nice car, then took our dinner, and enjoyed our simple fare. We then prepared to sleep if we could.",
