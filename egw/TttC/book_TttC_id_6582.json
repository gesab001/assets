    "word": "The Son of God came to this world to leave an example of a perfect life. He sacrificed Himself for the joy that was set before Him, the joy of seeing souls rescued from Satan's grasp and saved in the kingdom of God. \"Follow Me\" was Christ's command. Those who follow His example will share in the divine work of doing good and will finally enter into the joy of their Lord.",
