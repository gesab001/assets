    "word": "Our ministers are not doing their whole duty. The attention of the people should be called to the momentous event which is so near at hand.

When the signs predicted begin to come to pass, the waiting, watching ones are bidden to look up and lift up their heads and rejoice because their redemption draweth nigh.",
