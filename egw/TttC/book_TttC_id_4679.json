    "word": "When the cases of all come in review before God, the question, What did they profess? will not be asked, but, What have they done? Have they been doers of the word? Have they lived for themselves, or have they been exercised in works of benevolence, in deeds of kindness and love, preferring others before themselves, and denying themselves that they might bless others? If the record shows that this has been their life, that their characters have been marked with tenderness, self-denial, and benevolence, they will receive the blessed assurance and benediction from Christ: \"Well done\" \"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Christ has been grieved and wounded by your marked selfish love and your indifference to the woes and needs of others.",
