{"word": "Satan represents God's law of love as a law of selfishness. He declares that it is impossible for us to obey its precepts. The fall of our first parents, with all the woe that has resulted, he charges upon the Creator, leading men to look upon God as the author of sin, and suffering, and death. Jesus was to unveil this deception. As one of us He was to give an example of obedience. For this He took upon Himself our nature, and passed through our experiences.\"In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren\" (Hebrews 2:17).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "LHU", "page": 83}
