    "word": "Mothers set the example of pride for their children, and, by so doing, sow seed that will spring up and bear fruit. The harvest will be plenteous and sure. That which they sow, they shall reap. There will be no failure in the crop. I saw, parents, that it is easier for you to teach your children a lesson of pride, than a lesson of humility. Satan and his angels stand right by your side to make the act of yours, or the word that you speak to them, effectual to encourage them to dress, and in their pride to mingle with society that is not holy. O parents, you plant in your own bosoms a thorn that you will often feel in anguish. When you would counteract the sad lesson you have taught your children, you will find it a hard thing. It is impossible for you to do this. You may deny them things that would gratify their pride, yet it still lives in the heart, longing to be satisfied; and nothing can kill this pride but the quick and powerful Spirit of God. When this finds its way to the heart, it will work like leaven there and root it out.",
