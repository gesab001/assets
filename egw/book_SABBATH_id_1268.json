{"word": "On Sunday Elder J. H. Waggoner spoke with great freedom in the forenoon to a good congregation, on the subject of the Sabbath. Three excursion trains poured their living freight upon the grounds. The people here were very enthusiastic on the temperance question. At 2:30 P.M. I spoke to about eight thousand people on the subject of temperance viewed from a moral and Christian standpoint. I was blessed with remarkable clearness and liberty, and was heard with the best of attention from the large audience present.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "LS", "page": 222}
