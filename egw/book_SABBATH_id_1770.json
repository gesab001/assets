{"word": "Sabbath, June 14. We had meetings long to be remembered. Sabbath forenoon Brother [J. N.] Loughborough talked. I talked in the afternoon. The Lord helped me. I then called them forward. Thirty-five responded. They were mostly young men and women, and old men and women. We had a most precious meeting. Some who had left the truth came back with repentance and confession. Many were starting for the first time. The Lord was there Himself. This seemed to break down the prejudice and melting testimonies were borne. We had a recess, and then began again, and the good work went on. . . .", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "3SM", "page": 86}
