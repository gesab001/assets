    "word": "My heart aches every time I think of you; my soul is sad indeed. Every soul is precious, because it has been purchased \n                                                                           624\nby the precious blood of Jesus Christ. I sometimes think that we do not place anything like a correct value upon the purchase of the blood of Jesus--the redemption of the soul. When I consider the infinite price paid for the redemption of individual souls, I think: \"What if that soul is finally lost? What if he refuses to be a learner in the school of Christ and fails to practice meekness and lowliness, and will not wear the yoke of Christ?\" This, my brother, has been your greatest failure. If you had taken less counsel of yourself and made Jesus your counselor you would now be strong in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. You have not yoked up with Christ; you have not been imbued with His Spirit. Oh, how much you need the divine mold upon your character!",
