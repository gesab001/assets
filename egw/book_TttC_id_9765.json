    "word": "In the records of Genesis we see the patriarch at the hot summer noontide resting in his tent door under the shadow of the oaks of Mamre. Three travelers are passing near. They make no appeal for hospitality, solicit no favor; but Abraham does not permit them to go on their way unrefreshed. He is a man full of years, a man of dignity and wealth, one highly honored, and accustomed to command; yet on seeing these strangers he \"ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground.\" Addressing the leader he said: \"My Lord, if now I have found favor in Thy sight, pass not away, I pray Thee, from Thy servant.\" Genesis 18:2, 3. With his own hands he brought water that they might wash the dust of travel from their feet. He himself selected their food; while they were at rest under the cooling shade, Sarah his wife made ready for their entertainment, and Abraham stood respectfully beside them while they partook of his hospitality.

And to Abraham the counsels of heaven were opened, and he was called \"the friend of God.\"",
