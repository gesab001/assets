{"word": "God Has Given Rules.--The father is the lawmaker of the household; and, like Abraham, he should make the law of God the rule of his home. God said of Abraham, \"I know him, that he will command his children and his household\" (Genesis 18:19). There would be no sinful neglect to restrain evil; no weak, unwise, indulgent favoritism; no yielding of his conviction of duty to the claims of mistaken affection. Abraham would not only give right instruction, but he would maintain the authority of just and righteous laws.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "2MCP", "page": 765}
