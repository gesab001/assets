    "word": "God calls upon us to come into harmony with the divine pattern. He calls upon us, while it is called Today, to repent and be reconverted; and then His Spirit will dwell in us richly, and there will be transformations of character little dreamed of. As His Spirit works with your spirit, there will be manifest a saving grace by which we shall be deeply convicted of the wonderful transformation that is taking place in your character. Others will notice it, and be influenced thereby. Thus a constant and progressive work will be going on in the church. Oh, my dear brethren and sisters, let us all come into line. We cannot afford to be out of line now--it is too late in the day.",
