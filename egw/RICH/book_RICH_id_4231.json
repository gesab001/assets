    "word": "The ability to enjoy the riches of glory will be developed in proportion to the desire we have for these riches. How shall an appreciation of God and heavenly things be developed unless it is in this life? If the claims and cares of the world are allowed to engross all our time and attention, our spiritual powers weaken and die because they are not exercised. In a mind wholly given to earthly things, every inlet through which light from heaven may enter, is closed. God's transforming grace cannot be felt on mind and character. The talents which should be used in active piety, are ignored and neglected. How then can a response be made when the invitation is heard, \"Come; for all things are now ready\" (Luke 14:17)? How is it possible for a man to receive the commendation, \"Well done, good and faithful servant,\" when he has been disobedient, unthankful, unholy? He has trained the mind to disregard God's plainest requirements, to dislike religious things. He loves the things of earth more than the things of heaven.",
