    "word": "We want to retain Christian fellowship and love in our midst. Remember that Christ has said, \"By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples if ye have love one for another.\" Can we take this all in? How much has Christ loved us? He denied Himself, and was willing to endure every sacrifice that we might have eternal life. For our sakes He became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich, and He says, \"Love one another as I have loved you.\" Then let us put Satan out of our hearts and invite Christ to come in. If we allow envy and hatred in our hearts, Christ cannot abide there.",
