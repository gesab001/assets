    "word": "PH128 - Backsliding in Health Reform (1908)\n\n\n           Sanitarium, Cal., March 29, 1908. \n     I am instructed to bear a message to all our people on the subject of health reform, for many have backslidden from their former loyalty to health reform principles, the light that God has given is being disregarded. A true reformation needs to take place among the believers in Washington in the matter of healthful living. If the believers there will give themselves unreservedly to God, he will accept them. If they will adopt in the manner of eating and drinking the principles of temperance that the light of health reform has brought to us they will be richly blessed. Those who have received instructions regarding the evils of the use of flesh meats, tea and coffee, and rich and unhealthful food preparations, and who are determined to make a covenant with God by sacrifice will not continue to indulge their appetites for food they know to be unhealthful. God demands that the appetites be cleansed and self-denial be practised in regard to these things which are not good. This is a work that will have to be done before his people can stand before him a perfect people.",
