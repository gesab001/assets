    "word": "The Christian sees the Saviour ever before him, and by beholding, he becomes changed into the same image, from glory to glory. He bears the signature of God.

He will never let go; for the truth holds him.--Manuscript 84, 1905, pp. 2, 3. (\"That Your Joy May Be Full,\" August, 1904.) \n\n\n                                   -381-",
