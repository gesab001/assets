While we hold to this position, the testimony of the True Witness applies to our cases its rebuke, \"And knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\" Those who feel rich and increased with goods and in need of nothing, are in a condition of blindness as to their true condition before God, and they know it not.--Review and Herald, August 7, 1894.",
