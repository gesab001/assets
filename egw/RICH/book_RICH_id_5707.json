    "word": "When God gave Jesus, He gave us all the riches and treasures of heaven in one gift, and He says, Impart these riches to everyone that needs them. Then let us come and ask Him. Ask, and ye shall receive. Teach your children to pray from their very babyhood; teach them to lift their little voices to God in prayer. He is their Maker; He is the One that can make their hearts happy; He is One that can give them contentment; He is One that can give them virtue; He can reshape even the tendencies that have been transmitted to them by unwise parents.",
