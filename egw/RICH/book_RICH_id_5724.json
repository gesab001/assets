    "word": "Truth is being constantly unfolded by the Holy Spirit. [The Christian] receives with meekness the engrafted word, and he gives the Lord all the glory, saying, \"God hath revealed them to us by His Spirit.\" \"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God\" [1 Corinthians 2:12]. The Spirit that reveals also works in him the fruits of righteousness. Christ is in him \"a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.\" He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich clusters of fruit to the glory of God.",
