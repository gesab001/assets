    "word": "Why should not our joy be full-- full, lacking nothing? We have an assurance that Jesus is our Saviour, and that we may draw freely from Him. We may partake freely of the rich provision that He has made for us in His Word. We may take Him at His word, believe on Him, and know that He will give us grace and power to do just as He bids us. He has given us every assurance, and He will fulfill all that He has promised.",
