    "word": "Tell to others the blessed truths of His Word, and in obeying the words of Christ, continue in His love. How He urges us by the love We bear to Him to keep His commandments. He does this, not to urge us to do impossible things, but because He knows what it means to keep His Father's commandments. He wants every soul that heareth His invitation to say the same to others, and to receive His richest gifts, for He knows that in keeping the commandments of God, we are not brought into servile bondage, but are made free through the blood of Jesus Christ. \"And in keeping of them [His commandments] there is great reward\" (Psalm 19:11).",
