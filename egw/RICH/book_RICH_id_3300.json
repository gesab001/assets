    "word": "Organize and Prepare for Effective Work.--We need to work in the interests of temperance reform, and to make this question one of living interest. This is one way in which we may become fishers of men. A good work is being done in the circulation of our literature. Form yourselves into companies for the prosecution of a vigilant work. Learn to speak in such a way that you will not give offense. Cultivate gentleness of speech. Let the grace of Christ dwell in you richly, speaking to one another encouraging words. I make an earnest appeal to all our people, Come into line, come into line.--Manuscript 99, 1908.",
