    "word": "The Lord expects His people to have faith in the living God who made all things. The chosen people of God will be proved and tried before they are pronounced good and faithful servants, worthy to inherit eternal life with its endowment of heavenly riches. \"Unto you who believe, He is \n\n\n                                   -240- \n\nprecious,\" the apostle writes, \"but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner\" (1 Peter 2:7). Those who believe in Christ will be exalted with their great Head. But to those who do not appreciate Christ, He is a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. The reason is given--they are disobedient. Addressing the obedient, the apostle says, \"Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people: that ye should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous light\" (1 Peter 2:9). The Lord brought Israel out of bondage, desolating the fertile land of Egypt to accomplish His purpose, to teach them the first and highest lesson--that God was their God, the only true and living God, and that in Him they must trust.",
