    "word": "My brother and sister, light has been given me for you during the past night. You are to stand firmly to carry forward your appointed work--a work that will be blessed of God if you will walk humbly with Him. You have raised up a church in Richmond; you are not to be drawn from your work in that place. Continue to labor for those who appreciate your humble, earnest efforts. God will give you precious victories. If you follow on to know the Lord, you will know His goings forth are prepared as the morning. Keep fast hold upon your Saviour. He was in sympathy with humanity wherever He found men and women hungering for the Word. I hope you will have courage in the Lord as you draw nigh to the needy and the afflicted as well as to those who possess worldly advantages. \n\n\n                                     -386-",
