    "word": "Those who were shown me clamorous for the earthly crown, were those who will resort to any means to acquire property. They become insane upon that point. Their whole thoughts and energies are directed for earthly riches. They trample upon the rights of others, and oppress the poor and the hireling in his wages. If they can take advantage of those who are less shrewd, and poorer than they, and manage to increase their riches, they will not hesitate a moment to oppress them, and even see them brought to beggary.",
