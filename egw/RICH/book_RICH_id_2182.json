    "word": "Now if we will follow on, and if we will not backslide a step or two every now and then, and have to gather up our forces and go on -- it is better to gather up our forces than to remain in a backslidden condition and keep on backsliding, but I wish that we did not lose so much time and so much strength -- we may know more of God and more of heaven, and become better acquainted with the precious truth and the rich blessings that God has for us if we will only comprehend them. He has prepared wonderful things for us.",
