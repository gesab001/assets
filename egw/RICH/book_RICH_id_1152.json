    "word": "The prophecy of Revelation 13 declares that the power represented by the beast with lamblike horns shall cause \"the earth and them which dwell therein\" to worship the Papacy--there symbolized by the beast \"like unto a leopard.\" The beast with two horns is also to say \"to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast;\" and, furthermore, it is to command all, \"both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\" to receive \"the mark of the beast.\" . . .",
