    "word": "We came to Oakland last Monday to attend the General Conference. The conference proper does not open until Friday, but the preliminary councils had already begun when we arrived. In this meeting there will be many important questions to consider. We shall require the wisdom that God alone can give. We have been praying that the Lord will richly bestow His grace upon us. We need His leadership at every step. We must follow closely in the footprints of Jesus. He says, \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" I have been deeply impressed that there must be much less talk, much less criticism, and much more earnest soul-hunger for the words of Bible truth.",
