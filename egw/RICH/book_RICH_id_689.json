    "word": "Only Way to Manifest Gratitude \n\n     The Lord does not need our offerings. We cannot enrich Him by our gifts. Says the psalmist: \"All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.\" Yet God permits us to show our appreciation of His mercies by self-sacrificing efforts to extend the same to others. This is the only way in which it is possible \n                                                                           19\nfor us to manifest our gratitude and love to God. He has provided no other.--R. & H., Dec. 6, 1887.",
