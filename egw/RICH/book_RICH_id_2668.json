    "word": "When God's people are one in the unity of the Spirit, all of Phariseeism, all of self-righteousness, which was the sin of the Jewish nation, will be expelled from all hearts. The mold of Christ will be upon each individual member of His body, and His people will be new bottles into which He can pour His new wine, and the new wine will not break the bottles. God will make known the mystery which hath been hidden for ages. He will make known what are the \"riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory\" (Colossians 1:27) [verses 28, 29 also quoted].",
