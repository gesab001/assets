    "word": "Parents should take time daily for Bible study with their children. No doubt it will require effort and planning and some sacrifice to accomplish this; but the effort will be richly repaid. As a preparation for teaching His precepts, God commands that they be hidden in the hearts of the parents. \"These words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart,\" He says: \"and thou shalt teach them diligently\" (Deuteronomy 6:6, 7). In order to interest our children in the Bible, we ourselves must be interested in it. To awaken in them a love for its study, we must love it. . . . All that God's Word commands, we are to obey. All that it promises, we may claim.--Education, pp. 186-189.",
