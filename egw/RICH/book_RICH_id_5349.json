    "word": "Learn by Searching the Scriptures--The law of God cannot be made void by the law of a nation. When the law is trampled in the dust, the sacredness of the commandments of God will be vindicated by those who are loyal to Him. We are to make no railing accusation against the nations, for this would close our way so that we could not set the light before the people. Every objection raised against the commandments of God will make a way for the advancement of truth and enable its advocates to present its value \n\n\n                                     -142- \n\nbefore men. There is a beauty and force in the truth that nothing can make so apparent as opposition and persecution. When this is revealed, many will be converted to the truth. Many who profess the truth do not know its preciousness, nor realize the richness of the assurances God has given. And they will not understand this until they are pressed into places of difficulty. But then they will understand what the Saviour means when He says, \"I will manifest Myself unto them.\" (See John 14:21.) When surrounded by those who have not the love of God, the Christian will realize how precious it is to have communion with God and to obtain views of eternal redemption.",
