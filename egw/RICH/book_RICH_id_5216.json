    "word": "Jesus loved righteousness and hated iniquity. What is righteousness? It is the satisfaction that Christ gave the divine law in our behalf. He bore the test on every point on which the sinner must bear it.

Righteousness means being good and doing good. He was just and right. As children of God are we developing a character that is Christlike? Are we individually working daily at the trade of being a Christian, and through the rich impartation of the gift of the gift of the Spirit of God, are we making straight paths for our feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way?
