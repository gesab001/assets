    "word": "Edson, I feel a deep interest for your prosperity, and I know that your only safe course is to break away from every business transaction, and put your mind and soul into the exposition of the word. Be determined that you will not fail nor be discouraged. If you trust \n\n104. \n\nin the Lord moment by moment, if you search the scriptures with earnest prayer, you will have opened to you the richest treasures from the word of God. In humility, as a learner in the school of Christ, you will learn His meekness and lowliness of heart. God is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than parents are to give good gifts unto their children. I am sure that there is a heaven full of the richest enduring treasures to be freely given to all who will appropriate them to themselves, and becoming enriched thereby will impart freely to others. I know this to be truth. I have many things to say; my heart is full of thankfulness. I often awake in the night season praising the Lord that He has given me the measure of health I now enjoy, and that His hand, in loving, pitying tenderness, has laid hold upon you, my son, and placed your feet upon the Solid Rock. And in this I see how much can be done in saving other poor souls that are ready to perish.",
