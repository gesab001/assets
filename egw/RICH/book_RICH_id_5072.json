    "word": "Some of the time spent in the discussion of business matters should have been spent in earnestly seeking the Lord for divine power and guidance to cleanse their souls from sin and be converted. It has been presented to me that the Lord had rich blessings for His people in Washington. In the publishing work, in the sanitarium, there was a rich spiritual experience that the leading men should have obtained but they did not. But much time was occupied in dealing with difficult problems that should not have been touched until by humiliation of heart and by prayer the converting power of God had been realized. The Holy Spirit was waiting for confessions to be made, but with many there was a blindness as to their true spiritual condition. Confessions should have been made with that humility which results from an abhorrence by the individual of his unconverted soul. --Letter 162, 1909, pp. 1, 2. (To \"Our Responsible Men in Washington,\" Dec. 1, 1909.)",
