    "word": "Let the eye be fixed on the Son of Righteousness. Do not make your dear, loving, heavenly Father a tyrant; but see His tenderness, His pity, His large, broad love and His great compassion. His love exceeds that of a mother for her child. The mother may forget, \"yet will I not forget thee, saith the Lord.\" Oh, my dear, Jesus wants you to trust Him. May His blessing rest upon you in a rich measure, is my earnest prayer.",
