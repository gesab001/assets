    "word": "\"He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him\" [verse 21]. Here is a promise for which I do not know how to express my gratitude. The divine assurance contained in these words, we are to appropriate in our families, so that the life and the health of ourselves and our families shall reflect the love of Christ. We want this in all its richness and greatness. In the words that I have just read, we have God's promise that the highest of all power is at our command. We need to have a higher conception of the will of God concerning us.",
