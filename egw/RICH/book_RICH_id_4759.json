    "word": "Jesus paid an infinite price to redeem the world, and the race was given into the hands of Jesus. They became his property. He sacrificed his honor, his riches, and his glorious home in the royal courts, and became the son of Joseph and Mary. Joseph was one of the humblest day laborers, and Jesus worked, and lived a life of hardship and toil. When his ministry commenced, after his baptism, he endured nearly six weeks of agonizing fast. It was not merely the gnawing pangs of hunger which made his sufferings inexpressibly severe, but it was the guilt of the sins of the world which pressed so heavily upon him. He who knew no sin was made sin \n                                                                           19\nfor us. With this terrible weight of guilt upon him because of our sins he withstood the fearful test upon appetite, love of the world, love of honor, and pride of display which leads to presumption. These three great leading temptations, Christ endured, and overcame in behalf of man, working out for him a righteous character because he knew man could not do this of himself. He knew that upon these three points Satan was to assail the race. He had overcome Adam, and designed to carry forward his work to completion in the ruin of man. Christ entered the field in man's behalf to conquer Satan for him because he saw man could not overcome on his own account. Christ prepared the way for the ransom of man by his own life of suffering, self-denial, self-sacrifice, his humiliation, and, finally, his death. He has brought help to man that he may, in following his example, overcome on his own account, as Christ has overcome for him.",
