    "word": "Paul greatly desired to see the Colossians enjoying to the full the blessings of the gospel. He longed to be with them to speak to them words of encouragement, that their hearts might be comforted, \"being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God.\" The Word of God is full of consolation, and presents great possibilities and advantages, which we should strive to appreciate. Through faith in Christ we may reach the highest standard in Christian perfection.",
