    "word": "When God gave His Son to the world, He made it possible for men and women to be perfect by the use of every capability of their beings to the glory of God.

As they would empty themselves of self, and learn to walk in humility, leaning on God for guidance, men would be enabled to fulfill God\u2019s high purpose for them.",
