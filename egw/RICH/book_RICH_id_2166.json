    "word": "The infinite treasures of truth have been accumulating from age to age. No representation could adequately impress us with the extent, the richness, of these vast resources. They are awaiting the demand of those who appreciate them. These gems of truth are to be gathered up by God\u2019s remnant people, to be given by them to the world; but self-confidence and obduracy of soul refuse the blessed treasure. \u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d Such love cannot be measured, neither can it be expressed. John calls upon the world to behold \u201cwhat manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\u201d It is a love that passeth knowledge.",
