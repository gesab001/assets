    "word": "The Sydney Sanitarium Will Advance God's Work in Australia--We are now in California, and yet our interest in the work in Australia is not diminished. I am just as desirous now that the work in Australia shall go forward as I was when I was there. The work of the Lord in that place is in no way to decrease because we are not there. We feel an earnest desire that the work on the sanitarium shall advance as fast and as solidly as possible. I hope that you will help all you possibly can by gifts and by loans. Do \n\n\n                                     -225- \n\nthis for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, and a rich blessing will be granted you.",
