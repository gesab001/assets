    "word": "Let all who love God and His cause come to the rescue of His institutions in Europe. I am stirred by the Spirit of the Lord to sound an alarm for Christ's sake, and remind those who profess to believe the Word of God \n\n\n                                 -227- \n\nof their privileges and responsibilities and of their duty to the brethren who have been used by God to do a good work. You will lose a rich blessing if you fail now to do your work as God's helping hand in relieving the Denmark Sanitarium.",
