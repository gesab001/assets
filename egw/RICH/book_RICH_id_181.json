    "word": "You will go through this world but once. Then do not choose as companions young men or young women who will lead you in wrong paths. Turn away from these tempters, for they are Satan\u2019s helping hand, used by him to beguile souls to dishonor God. . . . Do not give the enemy any advantage. Study the history of Daniel and his fellows. Though living where they were met on every side by the temptation to indulge self, Daniel and his companions honored and glorified God in their daily life. They determined to avoid all evil, to refuse to place themselves in the enemy\u2019s path. And with rich blessings God rewarded their steadfast loyalty.",
