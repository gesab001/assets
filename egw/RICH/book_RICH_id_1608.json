    "word": "\"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, the whole body shall be full of light.\" This says, \"thine eye,\" not some other person's eye. The rich experience that it is our privilege to have, we lose when we expect someone else to do our seeing for us and guide us in our spiritual experience as if we were blind. We must have a single eye to God's glory, a single and persistent purpose to leave self and the preferences of others out of the question. . . .",
