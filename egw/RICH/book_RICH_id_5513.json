If those who have received many talents feel the need of keeping proportionately near the Saviour, of keeping closely yoked up with Christ, if they understand that they must live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, their endowments will be used in such a manner that they will be a rich blessing to their fellow men.

They have made rules and resolutions and agreements with their fellow men, only to change and break them, to promise and not perform. Yet notwithstanding their failure to practice well-defined, Christian principles, they have been anxious for more power, anxious to take more responsibilities.",
