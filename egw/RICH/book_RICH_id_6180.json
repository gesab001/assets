    "word": "There has been a mistake all round; and it is a great work to come back from every wrong path and choose the right. The Lord has honored men by allowing them to unite with his work; but to manifest sympathy for the tempted, to encourage them in an evil course by showing confidence in them will not help the wrong-doer or enrich the experience of those who by their course become partakers of their evil deeds. Those men who should have stood firm as a rock to principle, spoiled their influence by succumbing to temptation when brought into a strait place. The saving power of Christ was not with them. Christ's sympathy was not impaired by his sinlessness. It was his steadfast adherence to righteousness and truth that made him a power of grace to redeem. All emergencies will call the faithful ones to action. All combinations of difficulties which arouse us to seek God's help are really working together for good to those who love God, and who will maintain their integrity at all hazards. When emergencies force men to a decision, and the ones who act their part unselfishly, bravely, are called to resist the working of evil men, they are obtaining a clearer self-knowledge. They see the necessity of standing steadfast to pure, unadulterated principles, if they would save the souls ready to perish. Such a sympathy Christ had when he rebuked wrong. \n\n\n                              -150-",
