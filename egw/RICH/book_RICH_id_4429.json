    "word": "What will the laborers together with God do? Wherein lies their ability and efficiency? Those who are workers together with God will work in Christ's lines. Imbued with the spirit of Christ, they will rise to their true dignity and responsibility. The church is not to fold her hands in security and say, \"I am rich, and increased in goods, and in need of nothing.\" The followers of Christ are not to trust to past experience, and fail to go on to perfection. In so doing, the church will meet with defeat and ruin. Upon what shall she depend? Wholly and entirely upon God--Letter 89, Sept. 18, 1894, to Edson and Emma White.",
