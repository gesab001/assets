The money expended in bicycles and other needless things must be accounted for. As God's people you should represent Jesus; but Christ is ashamed of you. My heart is pained, I can scarcely restrain my feelings when I think how easily our people are led away from practical Christian principles to self-pleasing.

How many believe His word?",
