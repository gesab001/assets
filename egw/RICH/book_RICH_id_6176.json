    "word": "Brother Irwin, take hold of the work of health reform. If any of the ministers have the idea that the medical missionary work is gaining undue preponderance, let them take the men who have been working in these lines with them into their fields of labor, two here and two there. Let the ministers receive these medical missionaries as they would receive Christ, and see what work they can do. See if, in this way, you can not bring some of heaven's vital current into the churches. See if there is not a class who will grasp the education they need so much, see if they will not hear the testimony, \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (not aside from Christ), (by grace are ye saved): and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places (not in independent atoms) in Christ Jesus.\". . . . \n\n\n                                     (Signed) Mrs. E. G. White \n\n\n                                  -125-",
