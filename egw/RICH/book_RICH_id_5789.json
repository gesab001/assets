    "word": "It is Satan's work to misrepresent the Father and His Son, to misrepresent truth and gloss over error, making it appear as truth. But connected with God, we may distinguish between the genuine and the spurious. Light will dispel darkness. Why should we not avail ourselves of God's gracious promises, returning the glory to Him in heartfelt thanksgiving? Christ died for us that we might enter into possession of eternal riches. With hearts filled with gratitude to God, let us use the opportunities He has placed within our reach, that we may be fitted and prepared for the mansions Jesus has gone to prepare for those who love Him. If we fail through indolence, unbelief, worldliness, or covetousness, we shall suffer irreparable loss, for we shall lose an eternity of bliss. I tell you in the fear of God that day by day we are forming characters that will decide our destiny for weal or for woe.",
