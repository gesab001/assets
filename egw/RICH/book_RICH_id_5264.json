    "word": "The wicked are not to be supported and God's chosen passed by, and the Lord does not give into the hands of Sabbathkeepers the work of supporting the disobedient and transgressors of His law, while the needy, suffering ones of God's people are left without provision because of wrong conceptions of duty. We are not called upon to make it a special business to reward the disobedient and transgressors of God's law who continue in sin, and who are educated to look for help to those who will sustain them. We shall find a rich blessing when we do our duty to the Lord's suffering, needy ones. We should not pass them by and reward the unholy and sinful, as it has been represented to me has been done, and is being done, in Chicago. God's work is a high and important work, one above every other work, and it is to be carried to all parts of the world.",
