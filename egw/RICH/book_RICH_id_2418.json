Angels are watching with intense interest to see how man is dealing with his fellow men. When they see one manifest Christlike sympathy for the erring, they press to his side and bring to his remembrance words to speak that will be as the bread of life to the soul. So \u201cGod shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.\u201d Philippians 4:19. Your testimony in its genuineness and reality He will make powerful in \n313\nthe power of the life to come. The word of the Lord will be in your mouth as truth and righteousness.",
