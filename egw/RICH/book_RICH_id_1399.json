    "word": "This contest, though conducted upon a stage comparatively obscure, serves to \u201cshow us the kind of men that formed the rank and file of the army of the reformers. When we confine our attention to such brilliant centers as Wittenberg and Zurich, and to such illustrious names as those of Luther and Melancthon, of Zwingle and Oecolampadius, we are apt to be told that these were the leaders of the movement, but the subordinates were not like them. Well, we turn to the obscure theater of Sweden, and the humble names of Olaf and Laurentius Petri\u2014from the masters to the \n244\ndisciples\u2014what do we find? Not illiterate, sectarian, noisy controversialists\u2014far from it; we see men who had studied the Word of God, and who knew well how to wield the weapons with which the armory of the Bible supplied them; scholars and theologians, who won an easy victory over the sophists of the schools, and the dignitaries of Rome.\u201d",
