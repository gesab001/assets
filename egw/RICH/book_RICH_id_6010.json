    "word": "(64) It is not being rich in the wealth of this world that increases our value in God's sight. It is the meek and contrite that the Lord acknowledges and honors. Read the fifty-seventh of Isaiah. Study this chapter carefully for it means much to you. I will make no comments upon it. If you will study it carefully, and prayerfully, you will become wise unto salvation.",
