    "word": "\"For the Lord is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.\" \"O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him\" . . . \"The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.\" Here are promises, rich and abundant, upon condition that you cease to do evil and learn to do well. Then set your aim in life high, as did Joseph and Daniel and Moses; and take into consideration the cost of character-building, and then build for time and eternity.",
