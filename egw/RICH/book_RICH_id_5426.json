    "word": "You cannot set aside the light God has sent to shine upon your pathway, and yet walk in its rays. You are to deal justly, never oppressing your fellow-men. We must study God's word to find out His way. No one who does this in sincerity will walk in darkness. Those who are trying to secure means by speculating in mines or land might better cease this work, and find some steady, honest business. Those who encourage the thirst for gaining riches by speculation will extinguish the light God has set for his feet. If he makes money fast, he will spend it unwisely, and this prodigality will be his ruin. He must continue to make largely in order to keep up his habit of living. Thus many are drawn into the gambling hells to gain money fast enough to meet expenses.",
