    "word": "Grief\n \n\n     The minister offers grief counselees a special, significant hope.--Pain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. In the home of the redeemed there will be no tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning. \"The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.\" One rich tide of happiness will flow and deepen as eternity rolls on.--9T 286.",
