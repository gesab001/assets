    "word": "Again and again I have been shown the high attainments which the Lord's people may reach, but many have talked the truth, have preached the truth, while they were not sanctified through the truth. They did not bring the truth into their daily life and weave the principles of the truth into their characters. That they might be moulded and fashioned as clay in the hands of the potter to become vessels of honor, there was needed in those assembled under that tent, a deep heart work, repentance of sin, abandonment of self. This meeting was indeed precious. I was strengthened to labor in that meeting. I heard the confessions of E.P. Daniels and his wife. I heard their earnest supplications to God. I know that the spirit of God was doing its work upon \n                                                                           58\ntheir hearts. I heard them testify that the Lord had given them a blessing such as they had never before received. They declared that they were indeed receiving afresh the converting power of God, and many testimonies of confession, and of victories gained were then made. Could our eyes have been opened, we could have seen Jesus in our midst with his holy angels. Many felt his grace and his presence in rich measure. With hearts broken by the Spirit of God, confessions of sins were made and precious testimonies of faith were given that declared that Jesus had pardoned their sin and spoken peace to their souls. This season marked by so much of the power of God to those present, we could never forget. How thankful I felt that the Lord had given me strength to remain till the close of that meeting. He gave me a spirit of supplication. My faith fastened upon the promises of God, and our prayers were answered, for there was the revealing of his presence, and his power.",
