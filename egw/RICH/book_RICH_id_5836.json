    "word": "Many have asked me if I was not getting rich by the sale of my books. Far from it. I invested about 3000 dollars in the new edition of Vol. IV. I own the plates, and it was agreed that I should receive fifteen cents a copy on the books. Then the publishers represented to me how little the publishing houses made in handling the books, and I finally consented to accept twelve and a half cents, being assured that they would throw their interest and energy into circulating the book, and that the large editions sold would bring me back all that I had invested, and much more, to help pay the expense of publishing other works, which were in preparation. But soon after I consented to take twelve and a half cents, Bible Readings came from the press, and it was decided to carry that book almost exclusively, until the market was supplied. Thus instead of giving Vol. IV an equal chance with Bible Readings, the managers allowed it no place at all.",
