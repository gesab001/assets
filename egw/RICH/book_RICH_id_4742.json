    "word": "What condescension it was on the part of Christ to work a miracle to satisfy hunger! He relieved the hunger of one hundred sons of the prophets, and again and again since then, though \n\n\n                     -23- \n\nnot in such a marked and visible way, he has worked to relieve human weakness. If we had clearer spiritual discernment, so that we could recognize more readily God's merciful, compassionate dealings with his people, what a rich experience we would gain. We need to look beneath the surface. We need to study more than we do into the wonderful working of God. He has worked with men who are not united with us in acknowledging the truth, but whose hearts he will ofttimes move to favor his people. The Lord has his men of opportunity, like the man who brought the food for the sons of the prophets.",
