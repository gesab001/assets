    "word": "All who follow Christ will work as he worked. They will not live to please themselves. Instead of living to show their love for themselves by absorbing means to flatter their own vanity, they will show that they have on the wedding garment, the robe of Christ's righteousness, and that they are conveying to others the invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb. The knowledge of the rich repast of truth, the redemption Christ offers to the world, will be proclaimed in the message they bear and in the wedding garment which they wear, testifying to the atoning death of Christ, which has provided for them the marriage feast.",
