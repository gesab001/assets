    "word": "This work God would have us do. Christ's example must be followed by those who claim to be his children. Relieve the physical necessities of your fellow men, and their gratitude will break down the barriers, and enable you to reach their hearts. Consider this matter earnestly. As churches you have had an opportunity to work, as laborers together with God. Had you obeyed the word of God, had you entered upon this work you would have been blessed and encouraged, and would have obtained a rich experience. You would have found yourselves, as the human agencies of God, earnestly advocating a scheme of saving, of restoration, of salvation. This scheme would not be fixed, but progressive, moving on from grace to grace, and from strength to strength. \n                               Mrs. E.G. White. \n                                                                -",
