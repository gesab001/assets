    "word": "Heaven recognizes the loyalty of the soul that is struggling to do the will of God, and to grow into the likeness of Christ. Each has to win his way by struggles and efforts to elevation of character and noble attainments. Jesus has divine help to give every one of us in our aspirations to seek to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. God is ready to give abundant grace, and the door of the heart must be open to receive. Open the door and let the Saviour in. Then we must teach this, reveal it in our lives. What rich promises we have, how deep, how full, how abundant! If we do not grasp them, we meet with a great loss, and those with whom we associate also meet with a loss.",
