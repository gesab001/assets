    "word": "The Lord permitted fire to consume the Sanitarium building and thus removed the greatest objection to fulfilling His purpose. Then a large building, different in design, but capable of accommodating as many patients, was erected on the same site as the old building. Since the opening of this institution a very large number of people have come to it. Some of these are patients, but some are merely tourists. But the large number at the Sanitarium is no evidence that it is the will of God that such a condition of things should be. Our Sanitariums were not designed to be boarding places for the rich people of the world.",
