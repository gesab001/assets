    "word": "Again at Brooklyn, New York, (January 9, 1891) I had a deep, earnest desire for the Lord to work with His people. Oh, how my heart was drawn out in wrestling prayer to God that He would manifest His power on the Sabbath day and greatly bless His people. He did all this and far more than I had asked. It seemed that a tidal wave of the glory of the Lord swept over the congregation, and many, many souls were filled with a rich blessing of God, \n\n\n                                    -312- \n\nand this occasion to them was one never to be forgotten. They bore testimony that the power of God thrilled through and through them. Some persons were as pale as death, but their countenances were shining with the glory of God. This church had been newly raised up, and was in need of encouragement. Oh, bless the Lord, bless the Lord! Oh, my soul! for the great goodness and mercy of God!",
