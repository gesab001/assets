    "word": "Every church-member should cherish the spirit of sacrifice. In every home there should be taught lessons of self-denial. Fathers and mothers, teach your children to economize. Encourage them to save their pennies for missionary work. Christ is our example. For our sake He became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich. He taught that all His followers should unite in love and unity to work as He worked, to sacrifice as He sacrificed, to partake of His sufferings, that they may be partakers of His glory.",
