    "word": "The workers at the Review and Herald office will not enter into the kingdom of heaven, unless their character reflects the character of Christ. The heart must receive the divine current, and let it flow out in rich streams of mercy and grace to other hearts. All who would win souls to Christ must be winsome. A word to the wise is sufficient. \n                                                       Ellen G. White",
