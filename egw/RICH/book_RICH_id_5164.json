    "word": "If his wife possessed physical and mental health he would be better prepared to bear the burdens already resting upon him. . . . You should not suffer Dr. Lay to urge you, Dr. Byington, or any other doctor under the sun, to move in the dark. There is too much backwater now to make any very extensive moves. Dr. Lay has well done to move out in this great work, but he can bear no heavier burdens. In his desire to see the work grow he may urge matters faster than can be well carried forward with the best results to the glory of God.--Letter 8, 1867. (To Brother Aldrich, August 20, 1867.)",
