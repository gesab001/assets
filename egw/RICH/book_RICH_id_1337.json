    "word": "God's servants are to stand as minutemen, ready for service at a moment's notice. My brethren, from hour to hour opportunities to serve God will open before you. These constantly come and go. Be ever ready to make the most of them. That chance to speak in the hearing of some needy soul the word of life may never again offer itself; therefore let no one venture to say, \"I pray thee have me excused.\" Lose no opportunity to make known to others the unsearchable riches of Christ; for an opportunity once neglected may pass forever beyond recall. \n\n[196]",
