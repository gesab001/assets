    "word": "All things are possible to him that believeth. We need not try to lead ourselves. He leads, He guides, He sanctifies through the truth. We need now, just now, to surrender self, and all its worries and perplexities. If we live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God, we possess the richest grace mortals can have. But if we look on the dark side, and talk unbelief, we shall have plenty of unbelief. Throw this rubbish overboard, and taking the oars of faith, row as for your life. Do not think of self, but of Christ. Draw nigh to God, and then you will draw nigh to one another. You will love as brethren. Remember that Jesus intercedes for erring souls.",
