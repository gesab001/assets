    "word": "The prophet Nathan's parable of the ewe lamb, given to King David, may be studied by all. . . . While he was following his course of self-indulgence and commandment breaking, the parable of a rich man who took from a poor man his one ewe lamb, was presented before him. But the king was so completely wrapped in his garments of sin, that he did not see that he was the sinner. He fell into the trap, and . . . passed his sentence upon another man, as he supposed, condemning him to death. . . .",
