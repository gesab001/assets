    "word": "My apron was made out of an old silk dress which once belonged to Anna White, and I had worn it two years. I had on a merino cape which cost 60 cents \n\n\n                                     -32- \n\nper yard, with a bit of velvet around the edge. This is the only unnecessary article about my dress. A sister made the cape and put on the velvet to keep the lining from sagging. This constituted my \"rich dress\" at Knoxville. I generally purchase good clothing and then take good care of it, and it lasts me some time.",
