    "word": "If as Christ's followers we walk in companionship with Him, we will work the works of Christ. In our time it requires no small amount of labor to impress the minds of those who believe the truth with the fact that we are not to stop where we are, as though there were no more knowledge for us to gain. We have seen only the glimmerings of divine glories and the infinitude of knowledge and wisdom. We have been, as it were, working on the surface of the mine, when rich golden ore is beneath to reward the toilsome effort of the worker who will dig for it. We may think we have it all, but there is precious ore still to be found. The shaft must be sunk deeper and still deeper in the mine, and the result will be glorious treasure.",
