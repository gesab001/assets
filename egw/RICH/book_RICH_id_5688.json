    "word": "Tuesday morning we again stepped on board the cars. It was raining. We reached South Lancaster. Here we remained over two Sabbaths. I spoke 14 times. The burden of labor was upon me. The Lord gave me precious tokens of His love and His rich grace. The difficulty came with great force again upon me--pain in my head--but the Lord did not leave me comfortless. He gave me His grace to bear my affliction. Tuesday I was still afflicted and was delayed a day, but spoke to the students Wednesday in the academy with much freedom and left that noon. It was pouring down rain.",
