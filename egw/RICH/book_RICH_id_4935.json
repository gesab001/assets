    "word": "I saw that if Brn. Aldrich and Walker continue occupying the post they do, they should devote their entire interest and energies to the work of the Office. One of them can do the work at the Office which both now do in connection with their other matters. And the work would be better done by one fully devoted to the work, than by both with their interest and time divided as it now is. God would have those who labor in the Office receive a good support. But these brethren, with their interest and time divided as it has been, have not earned all the wages they have received from the Office. I was shown that those brethren have not the just claims on the Association for favors, as Brn. Amadon and Smith, who have been connected with the work for fifteen years, and who, at its commencement, labored several years for only the most economical food and clothing. These have invested time, labor and interest, in the cause, with very small wages. Within a few years, their wages have been gradually raised. The cause is a part of their very being. It would be like parting with life, to separate their interest from the work. If Brn. Aldrich and Walker \n                                                                           14\nshould be favored, these should be favored much more.",
