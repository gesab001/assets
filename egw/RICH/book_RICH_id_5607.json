    "word": "The people of God should not fill their minds with theories which Christ never taught when enshrouded in the pillar of cloud or when as a man among men He taught in the streets and synagogues of Judea. There is a rich abundance of precious truths in God's Word--truths which are of vital consequence to the people of God, truths which will fill the mind with fragrant thoughts of heavenly things and provide a solid foundation for character building. Discard fables and vain imaginings. Present only the words, \"It is written.\" Let Jesus take possession of mind and heart. Let those who teach be sure that the Word of Christ dwells in them richly. Let them instruct church members and students in the lessons of the Saviour.",
