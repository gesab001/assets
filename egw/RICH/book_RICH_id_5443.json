    "word": "Brethren and sisters, if you are workers together with God there is no excuse for your not working to help, not only those whom you fancy, but those who need your help to correct their errors. I have been shown that many have not the Spirit of Christ. The very work He has given them to do they have not done. And they will continue to neglect this work unless the converting power of God is felt on their poor hearts. Then they will be rich in good works.",
