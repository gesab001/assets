    "word": "The nobleman wanted to see the fulfillment of his prayer before he should believe; but he had to accept the word of Jesus that his request was heard and the blessing granted. This lesson we also have to learn. Not because we see or feel that God hears us are we to believe. We are to trust in His promises. When we come to Him in faith, every petition enters the heart of God. When we have asked for His blessing, we should believe that we receive it, and thank Him that we have received it. Then we are to go about our duties, assured that the blessing will be realized when we need it most. When we have learned to do this, we shall know that our prayers are answered. God will do for us \u201cexceeding abundantly,\u201d\u201caccording to the riches of His glory,\u201d and \u201cthe working of His mighty power.\u201d Ephesians 3:20, 16; 1:19.\u2014(The Desire of Ages, 200.)",
