    "word": "Just as surely as you are converted every day, you will be fruit-bearing branches--branches full of rich clusters of fruit. And what kind of fruit? \n\n\n                                    -71- \n\nThe fruits of the Spirit, which are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, kindness, meekness, faith, temperance, and godliness. These are the clusters which grow on that tree. If every one of us is converted, if we remain in connection with the Vine stock every day, we shall bear the fruits of His character.",
