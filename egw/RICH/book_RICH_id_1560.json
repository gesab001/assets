    "word": "Jesus demands of those who would be his followers an entire surrender of all that they have, all that there is of them. In this he does not ask more than he has given. Did he not leave all his riches, his glory, his honor, in order to save men? Did he not strip himself of his robes of royalty, and humiliate himself to take man's nature, that through his poverty and humiliation we might be made rich? Should we then be unwilling to give all that we have and are to him, and to suffer, if need be, humiliation and reproach for his sake? God forbid.",
