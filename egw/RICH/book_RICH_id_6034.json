    "word": "Should we not see in the world today medical missionaries who in all the features of their work are worthy of the name they bear? who aspire to the doing of deeds worthy of valiant soldiers of Christ? We are living near the close of the great conflict, when many souls are to be rescued from the slavery of sin. We are living in a time when to Christ's followers the promise especially belongs, \"Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.\" He who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, He who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light, bids us let our light shine brightly before men, that they may see our good works, and glorify our Father who is in heaven. In such rich measures has light been given to God's people that Christ is justified in telling them that they are to be the light of the world.--Unpub. MS. (MS. 134'03)",
