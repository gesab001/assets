    "word": "When Israel demanded a king to \u201cjudge us like all the nations,\u201d\u201cthe thing displeased Samuel.\u201d\u201cAnd Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.\u201d. . . Israel had become tired of pious rulers who kept God\u2019s purposes and God\u2019s will and God\u2019s honor ever before them according to God\u2019s instructions. They wanted a reformed religion that they might by external, flattering prosperity be esteemed great in the eyes of the surrounding nations. As they at one time hankered after the leeks and onions of Egypt, and murmured because they did not have everything to gratify their appetites, and declared their choice to go back into bondage rather than deny their appetites, so they now insulted God to His face in throwing off His wise rule. They were hankering after riches and splendor like those of other nations around them. . . .",
