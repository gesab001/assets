    "word": "Our Sanitariums are to be a blessing to high and low, rich and poor. Men and women are brought together in these institutions, and they become acquainted with one another. They learn to sympathize with their fellow-sufferers, and thus the partition wall between man and his fellowmen is broken down. Those who visit the sanitarium are to be taught the power of God in the restoration of the sick. This will make an impression on the mind that God is in the place.",
