    "word": "It is written: \"Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind.\" And again: \"He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\" Let us inquire: What would our Saviour have done in our circumstances? what would have been His efforts for the salvation of souls? This question is answered by the example of Christ. He left His royalty, laid aside His glory, sacrificed His riches, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might reach men where they were. His example shows that He laid down His life for sinners.",
