    "word": "I am instructed to present the rich and gracious assurance that by faith we may be partakers of the divine nature, having overcome the corruption that is in the world through lust. Christ has endured all the suffering and overcome all the temptation that we shall be called upon to endure and overcome. He knows what it means to be tried and tested. His experience in suffering with humanity has given Him a tender, sympathetic heart for all human suffering. He is willing to give grace to all who are tempted.",
