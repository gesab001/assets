    "word": "There have been sins among us as among ancient Israel, but thank God we have had an open door which no man can shut. Men may say, \"I forgive all the injuries you have done to me,\" but their forgiveness would not blot out one sin. But the Voice sounding from Calvary--\"My son, my daughter, thy sins be forgiven thee\"--is all-efficacious. That word alone has power and awakens the gratitude in the grateful heart. We have a Mediator. There is but one channel of forgiveness and that channel is ever open, and through that channel a rich flood of divine mercy and forgiveness comes pouring down to us. . . .",
