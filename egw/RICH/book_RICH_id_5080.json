    "word": "\"Ye are My witnesses\" (Isaiah 43:10), saith Jesus. \"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world\" [John 1:9]. Oh, arise and shine, all who believe the truth, for \"the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\" Let every soul humble himself before God, seeking Him in all meekness and lowliness of mind. Then the Lord will exalt you by giving you richly of His Holy Spirit. Mercy and the love of God will appear gloriously triumphant.-- Letter 110, 1893, pp. 1, 2, 6-8. (To A. T. Robinson, April 24, 1893.)",
