    "word": "Men are to be laborers together with Christ, but unless they strive most earnestly, unless they constantly behold Christ, they are in danger of not holding the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end. You have a work to do, but if you continue to load yourself down with perplexities, you will become unable to give the trumpet a certain sound. The Lord is looking upon us to see what we have made of ourselves, to see whether He can enrich us with His grace.",
