    "word": "MR No. 502 - Diet and the Spirituality of Ministers\n\n     It is the variety and mixture of meat, vegetables, fruit, wines, tea, coffee, sweet cakes, and rich pies that ruin the stomach, and place human beings in a position where they become invalids with all the disagreeable effects of sickness upon the disposition. The character becomes perverted, a depraved appetite is established, and a diseased religious experience is the result.--Letter 59, 1898, pp. 1, 2. (To Dr. and Mrs. Kellogg, July 26, 1898.)",
