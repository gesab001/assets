    "word": "I was right there in London when this excitement took place. It made me sad. . . . They had the right to do this, but I thought: . . .  Here we are looking for the Lord to come in the clouds of heaven. Do we keep Him in mind? If we really believe in Jesus, if we really believe in His coming, if we are abiding in Christ, we shall not be complaining about every little cross. We shall be thinking of what Christ our Saviour has done in our behalf. As we look at the cross of Calvary, our petty vexations will vanish from sight. Why should we not as Christians lift Him up, the Man of Calvary? Why, Christ laid aside His robes of glory, and for our sakes He became poor. He was rich, and He became poor, that through His poverty we might become rich.",
