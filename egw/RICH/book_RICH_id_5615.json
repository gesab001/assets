    "word": "The publishing house has its work and its position in the cause of God. Those connected with this institution are to remember that their time and talents are not to be occupied merely in the busy activities of this life. If they devote their abilities to a cheap, common business, they are bringing to the foundation wood, hay, and stubble. This kind of education will not improve the mind or manners of the workers. It will not do anything toward strengthening their faith or enriching their experience, but it will lead to the idea that the Echo office is a common workshop in which men and women engage in business from a financial standpoint.",
