    "word": "For All Sects and Classes \n\n     We are to invite everyone--the high and the low, the rich and the poor, all sects and classes--to share the benefits of our medical institutions. We receive into our institutions people of all denominations. But as for ourselves, we are strictly denominational; we are sacredly denominated by God and are under His theocracy. But we are not unwisely to press upon anyone the peculiar points of our faith.--Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, p. 109 (1902). \n\n\n                                                   (247)",
