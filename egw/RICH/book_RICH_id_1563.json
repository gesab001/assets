    "word": "Evening Meetings\n     As the meeting-room occupied by our people was small, and at a distance from the central part of the city, it was thought best to secure for our Sunday and evening services a hall in a more favorable location, and one capable of accommodating a larger audience. It is difficult in Copenhagen, as in all the cities of Scandinavia, to obtain a suitable place for meetings. The halls are mostly used for dancing, concerts, and theatrical entertainments, and they are rented at a high price. After some effort, however, the brethren secured a hall which they assured us would meet the requirements. What was our surprise, upon going to the place for service, to find it in the basement of a building, in the upper stories of which were halls for dancing, and places for drinking. The room was large enough to accommodate two hundred persons, but contained seats for only half as many. It was quite damp, the moisture at times being plainly seen on the walls. One evening, while I was speaking, some young men from the drinking halls above, half intoxicated, gathered about the windows of our hall, and by loud talking and laughing endeavored to interrupt the meeting. They even thrust their heads through an open window, shouting into the room. If it is necessary to speak in such places, we will do so cheerfully. If in this rich and beautiful city there is no suitable room where the truth can be presented to the people, we remember that there was no room in the inn at Bethlehem for the mother of Jesus, and that the Saviour of the world was born in a stable.",
