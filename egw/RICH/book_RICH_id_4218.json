    "word": "Christ's redeemed ones are His jewels, His precious and peculiar treasure. \"They shall be as the stones of a crown\"--\"the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints\" (Zechariah 9:16; Ephesians 1:18). In them \"he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.\" Christ looks upon His people in their purity and perfection as the reward of all His sufferings, His humiliation, and His love, and the supplement of His glory--Christ the great center, from whom radiates all glory.",
