    "word": "The Lord requires that each one, as their pattern of life, shall [be] drawn out in love to the perishing world. They are to go forth as God's \n\n\n                                    -194- \n\nwatchmen, representing the quickening, vivifying influence of the power of the truth. He withheld nothing; He gave His own self. \"He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.\" He endured the cross, despising the shame. Oh, the riches of the love of God is beyond our computation! Now the Lord expects [this love to be revealed] through the persevering efforts made in behalf of the salvation of souls ready to perish in their ignorance and unbelief and sin. We are individually under bonds to God to convey the message of truth, and His followers are to express to their fellow men that mysterious love which Christ expressed to a world. When they are thus imbued with His Spirit, they will be messengers to bear the life-giving message to the world, that Christ is waiting to receive them, to pardon their transgressions and sins. Many are saying, Oh, that I might find Him! They need the words and compassion and sympathy of one who has found Him precious to their souls.",
