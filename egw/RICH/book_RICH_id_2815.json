    "word": "Chapter 12 \n\n     1 (Philippians 3:8). Paul Taught by the Holy Spirit.--The apostle Paul, who had received many revelations from the Lord, met difficulties from various sources, and amid all his conflicts and discouragements he did not lose his trust and confidence in God. Under the special tuition of the Holy Spirit, his judgment was purified, refined, elevated, sanctified. The devisings of human beings and of the enemy against him were to him a means of discipline and education, and he declares that thus he gained most excellent knowledge, because he made the Lord Jesus his dependence. \"Yea doubtless,\" he declares, \"I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.\" How greatly this gospel enriches the garden of the soul, enabling it to produce most precious fruit (Letter 127, 1903)!",
