    "word": "There is much to be done in the cities of the South, in Greater New York, and in many other cities. Will you not join your father in his work for the great, needy Southern field? I wish you to feel that compliance with the wishes of your father is to be held above any other earthly obligation. Were I in your place, and should my father plead for my help in his work, I should feel that I was going contrary to God's will by refusing to work at his side. The words of the Lord Jesus were spoken to bless men and make them happy. He came to the world to bless all whom He could. In the place of using imperative command, He seems to lay aside the spirit of the legislator, and to strive to rescue from earthliness all that would accord with His purity and advance His work. Blessing after blessing flowed forth from His lips, as the gushing forth of a long-sealed current of rich life. Every sentence was a rich jewel from the treasure house of truth.",
