    "word": "When one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is cast out of the soul, the vacuum is filled by the inflowing of the Spirit of Christ. Such a one has the faith that purifies the soul from defilement. . . . He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich clusters of fruit to the glory of God. What is the character of the fruit borne?--The fruit of the Spirit is \"love,\" not hatred; \"joy,\" not discontent and mourning; \"peace,\" not irritation, anxiety, and manufactured trials. It is \"long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\"",
