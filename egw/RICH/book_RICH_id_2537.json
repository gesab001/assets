    "word": "The Old Testament is the ground where the seeds of practical godliness were first sown. This was repeated in Christ's words to His disciples. We have yet to learn that the whole Jewish economy is a compacted prophecy of the gospel. It is the gospel in figures. From the pillar of cloud, Christ presented man's duty to God and to his fellow men. His words to His appointed agencies, both in the Old Testament and in the New, point out plainly the Christian virtues. Through all His teaching He scattered the precious grains of truth. All will find these to be precious pearls, rich in value, if they will practice the principles laid down.",
