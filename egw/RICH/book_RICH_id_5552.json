    "word": "You have reported that I was dressed very richly at Knoxville. I had on an old velvet bonnet that I was wearing the second season. I washed the strings and placed them again on the bonnet. I had on a merino [MERINO IS A SOFT FABRIC MADE FROM THE WOOL OF A HARDY BREED OF SHEEP ORIGINALLY FROM SPAIN.] dress that was three years old, and the only other dress I wore on the journey beside my overdress was a dress [which cost] three shillings per yard when new. I had worn it out once, but before I left home for that journey [I] took it to pieces, turned it, and put it together again to finish on that journey. Why I took this trouble to turn it was that I might save the trouble of buying another dress, and yet look decent and orderly. My overdress was made out of an old debeige dress. By putting in front a breadth of another kind, I made it answer on that journey.",
