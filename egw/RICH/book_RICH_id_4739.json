    "word": "Move Forward Courageously \n\n     He who taught Adam and Eve in Eden how to tend the garden, desires to instruct men today. There is wisdom for him who drives the plow and sows the seed. Before those who trust and obey Him, God will open ways of advance. Let them move forward courageously, trusting to Him to supply their needs according to the riches of His goodness.",
