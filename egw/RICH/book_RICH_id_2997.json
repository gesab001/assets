    "word": "All those professing to be shepherds, who feel that to minister in word and doctrine, and bear the burdens and have the care which every faithful shepherd should have, is a disagreeable task, are reproved by the apostle: \"Not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.\" All such unfaithful shepherds, the chief Shepherd would willingly release. The church of God is purchased with the blood of Christ, and every shepherd should realize that the sheep under his care cost a priceless sum. They should be diligent in their labor, and persevering in their efforts to keep the flock in a healthy, flourishing condition. They should consider the sheep intrusted to their care of the highest value, and \n                                                                           116\nrealize that they will be called to render a strict account of their ministry. And if they are found faithful, they will receive a rich reward. \"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\"",
