    "word": "Then that which I had seen was explained to me as follows: The multitude which were shown me, who were so eagerly striving for the earthly crown, were those who love this world's treasure, and are deceived and flattered with its short-lived attractions. Some, I saw, who professed to be the followers of Jesus, are so ambitious to obtain earthly treasures, that they lose their love for Heaven, act like the world, and are accounted of Heaven as of the world. They profess to be seeking an immortal crown, a treasure in the Heavens; but their interest and principal study is to acquire earthly treasures. Those who have their treasures in this world, and love their riches, cannot love Jesus. They may think that they are right, and although they cling to what they have with a miser's grasp, you cannot make them see it, or feel that they love money more than the cause of truth, or the heavenly treasure.",
