    "word": "The Appeal of Unpromising Fields \n\n     The instruction the Lord has given me is that a field should not be shunned because it has objectionable features. This world was seared and marred by the curse, but still Christ came to it. He, the Son of the most high God, was made flesh, and dwelt among us. He willingly left His high command to take His place at the head of a fallen race, becoming poor, that through His poverty we might be made rich.--An Appeal for the Medical Missionary College, pages 11, 12.",
