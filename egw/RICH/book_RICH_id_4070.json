    "word": "But God will interfere to prevent the results of these too-strenuous ideas. The gospel is to harmonize the sinful race. It is to bring the rich and the poor together at the feet of Jesus.  {TSDF 49.10}  \n     But I wish to say that when the time comes that it is no longer safe to use milk, cream, butter and eggs, God will reveal this. No extremes in health reform are to be advocated. The question of using milk and butter and eggs will work out its own problem. At present we have no burden on this line.

As by the indulgence of appetite Adam fell, so by the denial of appetite Christ must overcome. \"And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He was afterward an hungered. And when the tempter came to Him, he said, Thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.' But He answered and said, 'It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\"",
