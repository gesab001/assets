    "word": "Heed the counsel of the true Witness. Buy gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich, white raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and eye-salve that thou mayest see. Make some effort. These precious treasures will not drop upon us without some exertions on our part. We must buy; \"be zealous and repent\" of our lukewarm state. We must be awake to see our wrongs, and to search up our sins, and to zealously repent of them.",
