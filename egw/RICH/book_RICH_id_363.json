    "word": "Learning by Doing \n\n     It is necessary to their complete education that students be given time to do missionary work--time to become acquainted with the spiritual needs of the families in the community around them. They should not be so loaded down with studies that they have no time to use the knowledge they have acquired. They should be encouraged to make earnest missionary effort for those in error, becoming acquainted with them, and taking to them the truth. By working in humility, seeking wisdom from Christ, praying and watching unto prayer, they may give to others the knowledge that has enriched their lives.--Counsels to Teachers, pp. 545, 546.",
