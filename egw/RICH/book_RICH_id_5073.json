    "word": "It is a departure from the ways of the Lord that brings perversity that will not be humbled or corrected. Many, when reproved for their wrong course, harden their hearts and continue to follow wrong principles. Holding fast their own wisdom as precious, they sullenly pursue their own way. This is the reason that the Holy Spirit is not manifested with greater power in our churches. If those who have been corrected by the Spirit of God would humble themselves before the Lord, and gladly reform, Christ would bestow upon them rich gifts, answering their contrite prayers, and helping them to understand themselves.--Ms 135, 1902.
