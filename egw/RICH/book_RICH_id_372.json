    "word": "Medical Evangelistic Tours \n\n     From the instruction that the Lord has given me from time to time, I know that there should be workers who make medical evangelistic tours among the towns and villages. Those who do this work will gather a rich harvest of souls, from both the higher and lower classes. The way for this work is best prepared by the efforts of the faithful canvasser.--Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 172.",
