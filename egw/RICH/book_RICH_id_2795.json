The spiritual necessities were not supplied to satisfy the people whom Christ had pledged His life to save by His grace and righteousness.  {5BC 1096.12}  \n     When the Lord is with the people who have knowledge and advantages in spiritual enlightenment, and when they impart that which they have received from God, they are fruit-bearing branches. They receive God's rich blessing, and are producers of fruit. As a sure result, in the hand of God and under the influence of the Holy Spirit they are mighty men. Constantly they represent before the world the great goodness of God, not only in spiritual lines, but in temporal lines as well. They shall prevail; for of a truth God is with them (MS 65, 1912).",
