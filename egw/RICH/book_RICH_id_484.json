    "word": "It is more than eighteen hundred years since Christ walked upon the earth as a Man among men. He found suffering and wretchedness abounding everywhere. What humiliation on the part of Christ! For, though He was in the form of God, He took upon Himself the form of a servant. He was rich in heaven, crowned with glory and honor, and for our sakes He became poor. What an act of condescension of the Lord of life and glory, that He might lift up fallen man.",
