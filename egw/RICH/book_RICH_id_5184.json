    "word": "Brethren Jones and Prescott you have expressed ardent faith and joy in the Lord. This you have a right to do. You may encourage souls who enlist in the army of the Lord to rejoice in the Lord, and to joy in the God of their salvation. You may encourage them to have their hearts aglow with the love of God, as they see how rich is His treasure of truth and grace for those who believe in Him. Impress upon them the fact that if they would keep fresh and \n\n\n                                   -205- \n\nstrong their first love, they must give to others who are not in the faith the knowledge which they have received; for as God works in them to will and to do of his good pleasure, they must work out their salvation with fear and trembling. Heavenly agencies are working with human agencies, and the doer of the word is justified before God. There can be no more pleasant tiding to ascend to God, than the tidings that sinners are turning from error to truth, from sin to righteousness. Every one must pray to God and believe that God is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.",
