Much every way: chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of God\" (Romans 3:1, 2). God had made the Jewish nation the repositories of His holy oracles. Had they been faithful stewards of the sacred trust, the Lord would have delighted in His people, and would have made them the praise of the whole earth. But they transgressed the law, and broke the covenant of God,. They had despised the riches of His goodness, His forbearance, His long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness \n\n\n                                   -374- \n\nof God leadeth to repentance, and in so doing they treasured up to themselves \"wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; Who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life: . . .

God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged\" (Romans 3:3, 4).--Letter 80, 1898. \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D.
