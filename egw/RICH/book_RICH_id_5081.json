    "word": "The burden of our message is the cross of Calvary. This is our warning and invitation. This is our encouragement to the sorrowing, the rich feast which we spread before the believers. Under the deep moving of the Spirit of God, we engage the attention of those not enlightened in regard to the truth for this time. With a longing desire they fix their gaze upon the cross of Calvary. We ourselves shall be so affected by the wondrous sight that we shall study the lesson more and more earnestly, and then we shall let wondrous love flow forth from sanctified lips. We will draw with Christ.",
