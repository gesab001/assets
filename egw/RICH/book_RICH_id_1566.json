    "word": "Swiss Scenery\n     Although the Swiss Republic contains twenty-two cantons, or States, and has a population of three million of people, it is not a large country, being only about half the size of the State of Maine. Besides this, it is estimated that two-thirds of its surface consists of lakes, rivers, and uninhabitable heights. Hence it will be seen that its rich valleys and habitable mountain sections support a dense population.",
