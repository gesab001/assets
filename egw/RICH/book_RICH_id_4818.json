    "word": "The eye of Jesus for a moment rested upon the glory presented before him; but he turned away, and refused to look upon the entrancing spectacle. He would not endanger his steadfast integrity by dallying with the tempter. When Satan solicited homage, Christ's divine indignation was aroused, and he could no longer tolerate his blasphemous assumption, or even permit him to remain in his presence. Here Christ exercised his divine authority, and commanded Satan to desist. \"Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\" Satan, in his pride and arrogance, had declared himself to be the rightful and permanent ruler of the world, the possessor of all its riches and glory, claiming homage of all who lived in it, as though he had created the world and all things that were therein. Said he to Christ, \"All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them; for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.\" He endeavored to make a special contract with Christ, to make over to him at once the whole of his claim, if he would worship him.",
