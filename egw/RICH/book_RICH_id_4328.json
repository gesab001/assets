    "word": "When Jesus said of the widow, She \u201chath cast in more than they all,\u201d His words were true, not only of the motive, but of the results of her gift. The \u201ctwo mites, which make a farthing\u201d have brought to God\u2019s treasury an amount of money far greater than the contributions of those rich Jews. The influence of that little gift has been like a stream, small in its beginning, but widening and deepening as it flowed down through the ages. In a thousand ways it has contributed to the relief of the poor and the spread of the gospel.",
