    "word": "The old sinful life is dead, the new life entered into with Christ by the pledge of baptism. Practice the virtues of the Saviour's character. Let His word \"dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him\" [verses 16, 17].",
