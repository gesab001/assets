    "word": "Walk softly before God, not in the strength of Dr. Kellogg. \"Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord that exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord\" [Jeremiah 9:23, 24]. The Lord has kept you by His power, and He will still keep you if you do not try so hard to keep and run yourself. God can guide you, my brother, beautifully and in perfect consistency in all things; but just as soon as you feel yourself superior to your brethren, and criticize them, you are out of your place, as they are out of their place in criticizing you. My brother, you must strive to work in perfect harmony with your brethren. The work is one the world over.",
