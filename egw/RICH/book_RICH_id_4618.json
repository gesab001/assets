    "word": "What I have just written opens to you the reason why there is not more vitality in our churches. The standard of the gospel ministry is lowered unto the dust. The elders of our churches and the ministers have not all been as branches of the Living Vine, drawing nourishment from Christ; they are not rich in spiritual knowledge and heavenly wisdom, but are dry and Christless. The words they speak in the desk may be good in \n\n\n                        - 25 - \n\nthemselves, but they are powerless because the heart of the speaker is not transformed by grace. The churches would do far better without such elders and ministers.",
