    "word": "Dear sister, I have not forgotten you, although I have not written you. I have often thought of you and prayed for you and the rest of the children, that you and their faith fail not. Do not mingle with the world; keep separate from them. If you mingle with them, you will surely lose strength. Seek to live near to God and to hold sweet communion with Him. Be diligent to make your calling and election sure. I believe God loves you and will save you if you hold fast whereunto you have attained. Everything and everyone is coming to naught but those who have this truth in them--the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. Remember, sister, if you would come off victorious you must overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony. We are in a glorious cause that will triumph and that will never come to naught. Eternal life we are striving for. It is not for any riches or honor in this world, but it is for a home in glory, an enduring substance the beauty of which will never wear away, and its glory will never vanish.",
