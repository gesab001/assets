    "word": "Bro. Rumery, your heart is not callous to the wants and necessities of others. You have generous impulses, and you love to accommodate. You will frequently do a kind act for a brother or a neighbor readily, but you make money your god, and are in danger of valuing Heaven less than you value your money. In money-getting there is always danger, unless the grace of God is the ruling principle of the soul. When Christian are controlled by the principles of Heaven, they will dispense with one hand, while the other gains. This is the only rational and healthy position a Christian can occupy while having, and still making, money. We would ask Bro. Rumery, What are you going to do with your money? You are God's steward. You possess talents of means, and can with them do much good. You can deposit in the bank of Heaven by being rich in good works. Bless others with your life. \n                                                                           38\n\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"",
