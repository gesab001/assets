    "word": "Will you, my ministering brethren, grasp the rich promises of God? Will you put self out of sight, and let Jesus appear? Self must die before God can work through you. I feel alarmed as I see self cropping out in one and another here and there. I tell you, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, your wills must die; they must become as God's will. He wants to melt you over, and cleanse you from every defilement. There is a great work to be done for you before you can be filled with the power of God. I beseech you to draw nigh to him that you may realize his rich blessing before this meeting closes.",
