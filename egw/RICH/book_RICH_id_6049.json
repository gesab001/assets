    "word": "Chap. 11 - A Deeper Experience\nBy Ellen G. White\n\nDear Brother and Sister Haskell: \n     Never did I see as now the necessity of thorough sanctification to God. We teach the truth, but do we practice it? Is the Word of God eaten by us? Do we drink the water of life in the rich current of love? Do we practice the Word of God by seeking for that perfect unity that should exist? \"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy Word is truth.\" We must have a deeper experience, which will lead us to let go self and hold fast to Christ.",
