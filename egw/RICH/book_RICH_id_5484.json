    "word": "The precious promises of God are full and rich and free. Oh, how precious they are to you in your affliction, when heart and flesh fail! It is true that all have not the same boldness and confidence when brought into deep affliction. And again, I am so glad that feelings are no criterion. The promises rich and full are yours. You can say in your sickness, \"The anchor holds.\" Faith and hope in the promises of God are steadfast.",
