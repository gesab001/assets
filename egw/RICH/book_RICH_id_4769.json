    "word": "But in order for us to fulfill God's purpose, there is a preparatory work to be done. The Lord bids us empty our hearts of the selfishness which is the root of alienation. He longs to pour upon us his Holy Spirit in rich measure, and he bids us clear the way by self-renunciation. When self is surrendered to God, our eyes will be opened to see the stumbling stones which our unchristlikeness has placed in the way of others. All these God bids us remove. He says, \"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another that ye may be healed.\" James 5:16. Then we may have the assurance that David had when, after confession of his sin, he prayed, \"Restore \n\n\n                     - 14 - \n\nunto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free Spirit. Then will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee.\" Psalms 51:12, 13.",
