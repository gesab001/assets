    "word": "We are offered an everlasting life insurance policy that assures us a life which measures with the life of the infinite God. We are to make manifest that we are not working for earthly riches and honor, but for a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. When we have been offered so much, shall we not with every power of the being strive to be overcomers? If such an effort made men and women miserable, if it caused them to feel that they were under condemnation, we could not appeal so strongly to you to take up the cross and follow the Saviour. But we know that the effort to run with patience the race set before you will bring happiness \n\n\n                               -201- \n\ninto your face, the sparkle of glad satisfaction into your eyes, and nobility into our soul. In this light look at the Christian's race. Grasp the hand of the Infinite, reached down to save you. He says, \"I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.\" Remember that in God you have a mighty Helper.",
