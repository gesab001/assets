    "word": "There is a declaration of the faith that is so diluted by man's natural traits of character that it has lost its saving virtue by losing its distinctive characteristic of Christlikeness. Although saying you are rich, you will find yourself in the end wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind and naked. When there is a haphazard belief and practice that is not after the lessons of Christ, then you have a faith that is vain. Your heart must either contain the treasures of goodness or the treasures of that which is evil. Out of the good treasure of the heart the receiver of truth brings forth good things. The one who claims to believe, and does not practice, brings forth evil things which wound, discourage, and destroy.",
