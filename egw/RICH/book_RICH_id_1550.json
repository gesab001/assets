    "word": "All who profess to be children of God should bear in mind that as missionaries they will be brought into contact with all classes of minds. There are the refined and the coarse, the humble and the proud, the religious and the skeptical, the educated and the ignorant, the rich and the poor. These varied minds cannot be treated alike;\n40\nyet all need kindness and sympathy. By mutual contact our minds should receive polish and refinement. We are dependent upon one another, closely bound together by the ties of human brotherhood.\n\n\"Heaven forming each on other to depend, \n A master or a servant or a friend,\nBids each on other for assistance call, \n Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all.\"",
