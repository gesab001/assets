    "word": "Jesus has presented to them the precious jewels of truth, the riches of His grace and salvation, the glistening white vesture of His own righteousness, woven in heaven's loom and containing not one thread of human invention. Jesus is knocking. Open the door of the heart, and buy of Him the precious heavenly treasure. Shall His pleadings fall upon ears that are dull of hearing, if not entirely closed? Shall Jesus knock in vain? \"See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh.\" If you will hearken, and open the door, He will come in and sup with you, and you may sup with Him. Will you respond, \"Come in, Thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest Thou without?\"",
