    "word": "When the church understands its position in the world, the missionary power of Christianity will be multiplied according to her light and knowledge. . . . A working church will be a living church. . . . While many are listeners, there are others who may go forth from our churches, not in their own strength, but in the strength of the Lord of Israel. Those who will not disseminate the light that God gives them, will not have increased light. God will not give idlers His rich grace to feed upon. He that will not work, neither shall he eat. . . .",
