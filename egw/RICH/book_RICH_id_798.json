    "word": "The Lord looks with pleasure upon the little children who deny themselves that they may make an offering to Him. He was pleased with the widow who \n                                                                           294\nput her two mites into the treasury, because she gave with a willing heart. The Saviour thought her sacrifice in giving all that she had of more value than the large gifts of the rich men, who made no sacrifice in order to give. And He is glad when the little ones are willing to deny self that they may become laborers together with Him who loved them, and took them in His arms and blessed them.--R. & H., Dec. 25, 1900.",
