    "word": "Every man, woman, and youth has an influence upon others. This influence we have from God. If flows from God to the human agent, and we are responsible for its use. \"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; if any man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity \n                                                                           1510\n(love), which is the bond of perfectness.\" Will we consider that this pure, unselfish love, one toward another, is the bond of perfectness in character? \"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father by him.",
