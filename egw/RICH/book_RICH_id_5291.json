    "word": "God will certainly bless wholehearted workers. If the Lord chooses your feet to do His work, give your feet to Him. With the feet you may hunt for souls. Christ says, \"If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love, even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.\" They may not be eloquent, but if they are connected with God, He will richly bless them. Their rugged, solid words, coming directly from the heart, are of great value, and are appreciated by the Lord.",
