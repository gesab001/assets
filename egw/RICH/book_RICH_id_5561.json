    "word": "Remember, the Master of the house became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich. We must be willing to be despised and trodden under foot here. We are soon to be exalted to a home in glory, a treasure in the heavens. Praise the Lord, we will go through and behold Him whom our souls admire. Press, press, dear sister, to the mark of the prize. Have faith in God. Endure trials; be patient in tribulations. Pray, pray much. Keep the victory above the powers of darkness.",
