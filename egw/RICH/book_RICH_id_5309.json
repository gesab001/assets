    "word": "Strange Imaginings of Those Who are Spiritually Asleep--Everyone who is asleep is subject to strange illusions. Judgment is not preserved, fancy holds control of the brain.

Strange thoughts come, which they never had before. Strange doubts crowd into the mind. The old landmarks seem indistinct and strange. Once they held to the pillars of the faith with a firm hand, but now their hands are slipping off. Pride and love of ambition possess the mind. There is a flattering of self that they are \"rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,\" while exactly the opposite is the condition of the church.",
