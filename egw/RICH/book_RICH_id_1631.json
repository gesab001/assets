    "word": "A beautiful illustration of that spirit of love and self-sacrifice which the grace of Christ implants in the heart is given in the experience of the Macedonian Christians. The apostle Paul writes of them: \"In a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. . . . Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God\" (2 Corinthians 8:2-5). And wherever the Spirit of Christ abides the same fruits will be manifested.",
