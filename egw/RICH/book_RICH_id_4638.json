    "word": "The Stewardship of Men. \n\n     God may entrust men with money and possessions, but because of this, they are not to lift themselves up. All they have, they hold in trust; it is lent them by God that they may develop a character like his. They are on trial. God wants to see whether they will prove themselves worthy of the eternal riches. If they use their Lord's goods to set themselves above their fellow men, they prove unworthy of a place in the kingdom of God. In the great reckoning day, they will hear the words: \"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?\"",
