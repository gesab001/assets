{
    "word": "\"Emmanuel, God with us,\" this means everything to us. What a broad foundation does it lay for our faith. What a hope big with immortality does it place before the believing soul. God with us in Christ Jesus to accompany us every step of the journey to heaven. The Holy Spirit with us as a comforter, a guide in our perplexities, to soothe our sorrows, and shield us in temptation. \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\"",
