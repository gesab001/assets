    "word": "How to Receive an Answer to Our Prayers \n     \"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am\" (Isaiah 58:9). Do you feel that your prayers are unanswered? Then do as Christ directs you. In His word He has declared it; by His Spirit He testifies to it. Will you follow the directions? Will you relieve the necessities of those around you? Will you work in behalf of the oppressed? Will you practice the life of Christ in seeking to save the souls ready to perish? In such work you will have the comfort of the grace of God in rich measure.",
