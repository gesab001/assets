    "word": "Those who have long borne the burden in the Office, those who have suffered when everything waded hard, are the ones to be especially considered and favored. Those who have listened to the admonitions in special cases where selfishness was exhibited, those who have seen the management Heaven has approved, have a better knowledge, and more correct judgment, of how things should be conducted in that Office, than Bro. Aldrich can have without greater experience. They have stood back and invested Bro. A. with too much authority. They should take responsibility upon themselves more than they have, and Bro. A. should consult with them, and defer his judgment to theirs. Instead of this, Bro. Aldrich has had his own way in almost everything, although his experience has been so short. He has been set and unyielding to pursue a course which he thought best, irrespective of the judgment of those he should regard. His office invests him with no such authority.",
