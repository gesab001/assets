    "word": "\"The apostle Paul exclaims, 'O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\" (Romans 11:33). But though 'Clouds and darkness are \n\n\n                                 -203- \n\nround about Him; righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne' (Psalm 97:2, R.V.). We can so far comprehend His dealing with us, and the motives by which He is actuated, that we may discern boundless love and mercy united to infinite power. We can understand as much of His purposes as it is for our good to know; and beyond this we must still trust the hand that is omnipotent, the heart that is full of love.",
