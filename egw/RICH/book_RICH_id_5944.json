If they would use this tact and zeal and careful thoughtfulness in an effort to gain \n                                                                           1496\nsomething for the Lord's treasury, how much would be accomplished. When men who are thoroughly selfish accept Christ, they will show that they have a new heart, and instead of grasping all that they can possibly obtain to benefit themselves, instead of making bitter, stunted sacrifices for the Lord, they will cheerfully do all that they can to advance His work. The spirit of grasping, which has been so largely developed, will die, and they will heed the words of Christ, \"Sell that ye have, and give alms.\" They will work as laboriously, with zeal and energy and earnestness, to build up the kingdom of God, as they have worked to obtain riches for themselves.",
