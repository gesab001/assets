    "word": "Every promise that is in God\u2019s book holds out to us the encouragement that we may be partakers of the divine nature. This is the possibility\u2014to rely upon God, to believe His Word, to work His works, and this we can do when we lay hold of the divinity of Christ. This possibility is worth more to us than all the riches in the world. There is nothing on earth that can compare with it. As we lay hold of the power thus placed within our reach, we receive a hope so strong that we can rely wholly upon God\u2019s promise; and laying hold of the possibilities there are in Christ, we become the sons and daughters of God. . . .",
