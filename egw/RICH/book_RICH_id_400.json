    "word": "Many have been taught that night air is positively injurious to health, and therefore must be excluded from their rooms. One autumn evening I was traveling in a crowded car. The exhalations from so many lungs and bodies rendered the atmosphere very impure, and caused a sickening sensation to come over me. I raised my window, and was enjoying the fresh air, when a lady in earnest, imploring tones, cried out, \u201cDo put down that window! You will take cold and be sick; the night air is so unhealthful!\u201d I replied, \u201cMadam, we have no other air than night air, in this car or out of it. If you refuse to breathe the night air, you must stop breathing.\u201d In the cool of the evening it may be necessary to guard against chilliness by extra clothing; but there should be a free circulation of pure air through the room during sleeping hours. The free air of heaven, by day or night, is one of the richest blessings we can enjoy.",
