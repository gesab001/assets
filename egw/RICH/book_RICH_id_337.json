    "word": "When the young man came to Jesus and said to Him, \"Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\" Jesus gave him his choice, to part with his possessions and have eternal life, or\n165\nretain them and lose it. His riches were of greater value to him than the heavenly treasure. The condition that he must part with his treasures and give to the poor in order to become a follower of Christ and have eternal life, chilled his desire, and he went away sorrowful.",
