    "word": "The Use of Nut Foods\n     Careful attention should be given to the proper use of nut foods. Some kinds of nuts are not so wholesome \n60\nas others. Do not reduce the bill of fare to a few articles composed largely of nut foods. These foods should not be used too freely. If they were used more sparingly by some, the results would be more satisfactory. As combined in large proportions with other articles in some of the recipes given, they make the food so rich that the system can not properly assimilate it. -Letter 135, 1902.
