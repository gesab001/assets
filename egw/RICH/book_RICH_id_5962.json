Paul writes to Timothy. \"Take heed unto thyself, and to the doctrine.

To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known to the church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" \n                                                                           1604",
