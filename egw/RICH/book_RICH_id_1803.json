    "word": "The Lord desires you to be soul-winners; therefore, while you should not force doctrinal points upon the people, you should \u201cbe ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\u201d 1 Peter 3:15. Why fear?\u2014 Fear lest your words should savor of self-importance, lest unadvised words be spoken, lest the words and manner should not be after Christ's likeness. Connect firmly with Christ, and present the truth as it is in Him. Work as Paul worked. Wherever he was, whether before scowling Pharisee or Roman authority, rich or poor, learned or ignorant, the cripple at Lystra or the convicted sinners in the Macedonian dungeon, he lifted up Christ as the One who hates sin and loves the sinner, the One who bore our sins that He might impart to us His righteousness.",
