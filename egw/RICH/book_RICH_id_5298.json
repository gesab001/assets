    "word": "As a people we are to bear God's sign by keeping the Sabbath. This is God's memorial and it is to receive our special attention. The rich men of the world build their residences in the most desirable places. Worldly thoughts occupy their minds. Worldly amusements, mirth, and merriment occupy their time. Selfish extravagance in dress and eating uses the money which should be given to God. Their brains are confused by the use of wine and this leads to great evils, for Satan is their counselor. Shall we choose to keep this class ever before us? The enemy would work through them to hedge up our way so that success shall not attend the Lord's work. In erecting our buildings we must keep away from the great men of the world, and then let them seek the help they need by moving away from their associates into more retired localities. Let their attention be drawn to a people who love and fear God. If the sanitarium is not near the houses of rich men they will not have opportunity to comment unfavorably upon it because it is understood to be a place which receives suffering humanity of all classes.",
