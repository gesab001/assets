    "word": "I know that the work of the sanitarium must be carried forward. During the two visits that I have made to the institution, I have realized that the Spirit of the Lord is in the sanitarium, and that the work is being carried on in a way that will glorify God. Those in the institution are doing all in their power to make it what the Lord desires it to be. Every morning worship is held in the parlor, and the patients are invited to attend. I have had most precious seasons of refreshing in attending these services. A portion of scripture is read, then there is singing, and earnest prayers are offered that the great Medical Missionary will let His health-giving presence bring light and comfort and peace. I have had the privilege of speaking to those assembled at these seasons of worship, and I myself have been comforted in the effort to help and encourage others. I testify that the blessing of the Lord has come to us in rich currents of love and hope and joy. I have realized the presence of the great Healer, and I know His power will be exercised upon the sick and suffering, to bless and heal. . . .",
