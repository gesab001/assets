    "word": "Let us not forget that in his conversion and sanctification man must cooperate with God. \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,\" the Word declares. \"For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\" (Philippians 2:12, 13). Man cannot transform himself by the exercise of his will. He possesses no power by which this change may be affected. The renewing energy must come from God. The change can be made only by the Holy Spirit. He who would be saved, high or low, rich or poor, must submit to the working of this power.",
