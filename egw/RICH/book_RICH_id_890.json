    "word": "Personal Qualifications of the Teacher.--The principles and habits of the teacher should be considered of greater importance\n87\nthan even his literary qualifications. If the teacher is a sincere Christian, he will feel the necessity of having an equal interest in the physical, mental, moral, and spiritual education of his scholars. In order to exert the right influence, he should have perfect control over himself, and his own heart should be richly imbued with love for his pupils, which will be seen in his looks, words, and acts. He should have firmness of character, then he can mold the minds of his pupils, as well as to instruct them in the sciences.",
