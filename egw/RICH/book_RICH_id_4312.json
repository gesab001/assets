    "word": "The value of this treasure is above gold or silver. The riches of earth\u2019s mines cannot compare with it. \u201cThe depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.\u201d\u2014Signs of the Times, Sept. 12, 1906.",
