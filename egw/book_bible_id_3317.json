Circumcision of No Value After the Cross.--[Titus 1:9-11, 13, 14 quoted.] There were those in Paul's day who were constantly dwelling upon circumcision, and they could bring plenty of proof from the Bible to show its obligation on the Jews; but this teaching was of no consequence at this time; for Christ had died upon Calvary's cross, and circumcision in the flesh could not be of any further value.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "6BC", "page": 1061}
