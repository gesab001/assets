{"word": "We must free ourselves from the customs and bondage of society, that, when the principles of our faith are at stake, we shall not hesitate to show our colors, even if we are called singular for so doing. Keep the conscience tender, that you may hear the faintest whisper of the voice that spake as never man spake. Let all who would wear the yoke of Christ show an inflexible purpose to do right because it is right. Keep the eye fixed on Jesus, inquiring at every step, \"Is this the way of the Lord?\" The Lord will not leave anyone who does this to become the sport of Satan's temptation.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "TDG", "page": 284}
