    "word": "MR No. 291 - The Work in the Large Cities\n\n     The words were spoken to me: \"Tell My people that time is short. Every effort is now to be made to exalt the truth. In the cities, large and small, the message is to be proclaimed. The third angel's message is to be united with the second angel's message, and is to be proclaimed with great power in our large cities. Thus will be given with a loud voice the message that is to prepare a people for the coming of the King.\" . . .",
