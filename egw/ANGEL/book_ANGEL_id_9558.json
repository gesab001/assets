    "word": "Ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands, were the heavenly messengers beheld by the prophet Daniel. The apostle Paul declared them \u201can innumerable company.\u201d Daniel 7:10; Hebrews 12:22. As God's messengers they go forth, like \u201cthe appearance of a flash of lightning,\u201d (Ezekiel 1:14), so dazzling their glory, and so swift their flight. The angel that appeared at the Saviour's tomb, his countenance \u201clike lightning, and his raiment white as snow,\u201d caused the keepers for fear of him to quake, and they \u201cbecame as dead men.\u201d Matthew 28:3, 4.",
