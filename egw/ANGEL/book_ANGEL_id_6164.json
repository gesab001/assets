    "word": "(Hosea 6:3; Joel 2:23, 28, 29; Zechariah 10:1; Revelation 18:1.) Pentecost Repeated With Greater Power.--It is with an earnest longing that I look forward to the time when the events of the day of Pentecost shall be repeated with even greater power than on that occasion. John says, \"I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.\" Then, as at the Pentecostal season, the people will hear the truth spoken to them, every man in his own tongue.",
