    "word": "Abraham's unselfish life made him indeed a \"spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men\" (1 Corinthians 4:9). And the Lord declared He would bless those who blessed Abraham, and that He would punish those who misused or injured him. Through Abraham's experience in his religious life a correct knowledge of Jehovah has been communicated to thousands; and his light will shed its beams all along the path of those who practice the piety, the faith, the devotion, and the obedience of Abraham.",
