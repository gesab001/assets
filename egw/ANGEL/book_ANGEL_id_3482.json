    "word": "God will always accept confession if the evil that has been done is repented of. Our heavenly Father makes the declaration, \"As I live, . . . I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked should turn from his way and live\" (Ezekiel 33:11). Over every sinner that repents the angels of God rejoice with songs of joy. Not one sinner need be lost. Full and free is the gift of saving grace. . . .",
