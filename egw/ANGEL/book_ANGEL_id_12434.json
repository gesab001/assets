    "word": "On our way to Los Angeles we called at Fresno, and spent the Sabbath there. I spoke to our people on Sabbath afternoon. We were unable to get accommodations on the train going from Fresno to Los Angeles Saturday evening, so we decided to spend Sunday in Hanford, visiting old friends. On arriving there we found a series of meetings in progress. We took dinner with Sister Grey, Sister Haskell's sister. She urged us so strongly to remain with her for three or four days and attend the meetings to be held in the different places near there, that we consented. Sister Grey gave us a very hearty welcome to her home, and we had a pleasant time there. She has, as you know, a large fruit ranch, and she has been successful in her work. She took us driving several times. It had been years since we visited Hanford, and I was glad to see our old friends again.",
