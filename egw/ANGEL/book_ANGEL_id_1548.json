    "word": "48\nChapter 3 - Women of Note in the New Testament\n\n     During the years of Christ's ministry on earth, godly women assisted in the work that the Saviour and His disciples were carrying forward. If those who were opposing this work could have found anything out of the regular order in the conduct of these women, it would have closed the work at once. But while women were laboring with Christ and the apostles, the entire work was conducted on so high a plane as to be above the shadow of a suspicion. No occasion for any accusation could be found. The minds of all were directed to the Scriptures, rather than to individuals. The truth was proclaimed intelligently, and so plainly that all could understand.\n--Evangelism, pp. 67, 68.",
