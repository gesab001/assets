    "word": "Medical Ministry Not to Take the Place of Evangelism.--Medical missionary work is not to take the place of the ministry of the Word. It is not to absorb the means which should be used to sustain the Lord's work in foreign fields. From wheresoever the money in the treasury shall come, it is the Lord's, and it is not to be used so largely in erecting buildings in America. The donations of the people are not to be sunk in lines of work which show little results. The truth is to be proclaimed, that the way of the Lord may be prepared. The trumpet must give no uncertain sound. . . .",
