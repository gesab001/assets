    "word": "The message that I have to bear to the church in Los Angeles is, Awake, and put on the whole armor of God. There is selfishness in the church that must be rooted out. Seek the Lord earnestly. Reveal in your lives the sanctifying power of the truth. Cooperate with the evangelist that the Lord has placed amongst you. God would have you work as fishers of men.",
