    "word": "The physician will find that it is for his present and eternal good to follow the Lord's way with suffering humanity. The mind that God has made He can mold without the power of man, but He honors men by asking them to cooperate with Him in this great work. When the Spirit of God works on the mind of the afflicted one, and he inquires for truth, let the physician work for the precious soul as Christ would work for it. Do not urge upon them any special doctrine, but point them to Jesus as a sin-pardoning Saviour. Angels of God will make impressions on the human mind. Some will refuse to be illuminated by the light which God would let shine into the chambers of the mind and into the soul temple, but many will respond to the light, and from these minds every form of deception and error will be swept away.",
