    "word": "And from what does this perverter of the Scriptures draw his conclusions?\u2014From a single sentence expressing David's submission to the dispensation of Providence. His soul \u201clonged to go forth unto Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.\u201d The poignancy of his grief having been softened by time, his thoughts turned from the dead to the living son, self-banished through fear of the just punishment of his crime. And this is the evidence that the incestuous, drunken Amnon was at death immediately transported to the abodes of bliss, there to be purified and prepared for the companionship of sinless angels! A pleasing fable indeed, well suited to gratify the carnal heart! This is Satan's own doctrine, and it does his work effectually. Should we be surprised that, with such instruction, wickedness abounds?",
