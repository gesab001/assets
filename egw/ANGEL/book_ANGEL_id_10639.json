    "word": "\"Give up the self-righteousness that you have been cherishing. If the Lord permits you to behold such a work as has been done in Los Angeles, seek with all humility to act your part. Not in your own strength, but in the strength of Christ, you are to ascend the ladder heavenward, round by round. Make diligent, thorough work in humbling yourselves, that the old habits and practises and all evil speaking may be put away. Draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you. Die to self; live to God.\"",
