    "word": "David's eldest brother, Eliab, whom God would not choose to be king, was jealous of David, because he \n                                                                           81\nwas honored before him. He despised David, and looked upon him as inferior to himself. He accused him before others of stealing away unknown to his father to see the battle. He taunts him with the small business in which he is engaged, in tending a few sheep in the wilderness. David repels the unjust charge, and says, \"What have I now done? Is there not a cause?\" David is not careful to explain to his brother that he had come to the help of Israel; that God had sent him to slay Goliath. God had chosen him to be ruler of Israel, and as the armies of the living God were in such peril, he had been directed by an angel to save Israel.",
