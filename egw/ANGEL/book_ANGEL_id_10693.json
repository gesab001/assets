    "word": "It is of the utmost consequence that we remember that we have a Shepherd who calls His sheep by name. The Good Shepherd condescended to pitch His tent amid human encampments, to teach His followers the way of life. \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,\" the chosen sheep of His pasture. In the prayer recorded in the seventeenth of John, the Good Shepherd identifies His interests with those of fallen humanity. Think of Christ, the adored of the angels, in the attitude of a suppliant. He was a mighty petitioner, seeking at the hands of the Father fresh supplies of grace, and coming forth invigorated and refreshed, to impart His lessons of assurance and hope. Look at His kneeling form, as in the moonlit hours He pours forth His soul to the Father. Behold the angels watching the earnest suppliant. His prayer rises to all heaven in our behalf. He is our Elder \n                                                                           44\nBrother, compassed with human infirmities, and in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.",
