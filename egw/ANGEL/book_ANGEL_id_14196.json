    "word": "At your recent camp meeting, was anyone appointed to present the interests of this line of work to our people? If this was not done, you lost a precious opportunity of placing large blessings within the reach of the people, and an opportunity of raising means for the relief of our institutions. My brother, let us encourage our people to take up this work without further delay. Let those who have had experience in the sale of health foods interest themselves in the sale of \"Christ's Object Lessons\" and \"Ministry of Healing\"; for here is food unto eternal life. Los Angeles has been presented to me as a very fruitful field for the sale of these books. I know that every household in the land would be benefited by their presence in the home.",
