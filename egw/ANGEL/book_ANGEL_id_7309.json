    "word": "The Lord had informed Moses that Aaron, his brother, three years older than himself, would come forth to meet him, and when he should see him, would be glad. They had been separated for many years. Angels of God had instructed Moses in regard to the work he should perform. Angels also were sent to teach Aaron to go forth and meet Moses, for the Lord had chosen him to be with Moses, and when he should meet his brother \n                                                                           197\nto listen to his words, for God had given Moses words to speak to him in regard to the part he should act in connection with the deliverance of Israel. \"And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. And the people believed. And when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.\"",
