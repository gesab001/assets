    "word": "Fair Treatment of Workers \n     Yours is not the only conference that is in this condition. The condition of Iowa makes angels weep; Wisconsin is years behind; and Illinois, in some respects, is at loose ends. The ministers that ought to be encouraged in the field, have no inducement. They cannot live upon the small wages allowed them. The Word of God declares, \"The hire of your labourers . . . is kept back by fraud\" (James 5:4). This is generally understood to apply to wealthy men who employ servants and do not pay them for their labor; but it means more than this; it applies with great force to those that are enlightened by the Spirit of God, who act out and work in any degree upon the same principle that these men do in hiring servants to do their work, and then grind them down to the lowest price.",
