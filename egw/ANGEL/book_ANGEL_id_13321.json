    "word": "There are lessons for us to learn from the experience of Philip and the Ethiopian. Angels of God saw the Ethiopian traveler reading the Scriptures as he rode in his chariot, and one of the disciples was sent to meet him. Philip said to the Ethiopian, \"Understandest thou what thou readest? And he said, How can I, except some man should guide Me?\" (Acts 8:30, 31.) Then Philip opened to him the Scripture. And when he had heard and believed, the Ethiopian asked, \"What doth hinder me to be baptized?\" (Acts 8:36.) After Philip had given his message, he was caught away by the Spirit, and the eunuch saw him no more. This experience should teach us that we have a God, and that angels, who are ministering spirits, are sent by Him to do a special work in the earth. The man who undertakes to step in between the angels and one whom God is seeking to instruct, is out of his place. He had better stand on one side, and let God work. God is able to work on human hearts, and to lay upon them the burden of opening the Scriptures to the people.",
