    "word": "MR No. 486 - Development of SDA Work in Germany\n\n     My Brother, I have sent letters to Elder Loughborough that I wish you to read. Our European missions are opening for laborers in every direction and there is not means in the treasury to support men in the field. My heart aches day and night so that I can seldom sleep later than half past three o'clock, thinking of the cities of Europe to be entered while the angels are holding the four winds for the message to go to all nations, tongues and people. If you could only see how poor the people are in Europe you would know just what to do with some of your means.",
