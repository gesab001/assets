    "word": "There is a work to be done by living human agencies, which they are slow to comprehend. They need to study the Scriptures, to search the Bible, with humble, teachable minds, that they may know their place in the work, and not move haphazard, but fall into line, keeping step with Jesus. \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\" Every talent with which God has endowed the human agent is now to be awakened, to be employed, not solely in worldly transactions, to buy and sell and get gain, not to use your God-given powers selfishly, greedily to make a place for yourself in the earth; no, you want now to consecrate every entrusted talent of means and ability, having yourself under the influence and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Not a word is to be spoken unadvisedly, to stir up the elements of opposition; not an action entered into to create any deeper enmity than exists in the hearts of the enemies of truth; and, moving with well-balanced minds, holding aloft the banner of truth, grace from God will be given, wisdom \n\n\n                          -21- \n\nwill be imparted, and angels of God will be commissioned to minister unto all who walk in humility of mind, trustingly accepting the truth as it is revealed, standing by their colors, but not creating persecution by unwise actions, but moving in the footsteps of Jesus. \"Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.\"",
