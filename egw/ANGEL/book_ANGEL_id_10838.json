Minds must be terribly befogged by Satan, that can listen to the voice of the seducer because he is a minister, and therefore break God's plain and positive commands, and flatter themselves that they commit no sin. Have we not the words of John: \"He that saith I know Him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him\"? What saith the law? \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\" The fact of man's professing to keep God's holy law, and ministering in sacred things, and taking the advantage of the confidence his position gives him to indulge his base passions, should, of itself, be sufficient for a woman professing godliness, to see that, although his profession was as exalted as the heavens, any impure proposal coming from him was Satan disguised through the minister, as an angel of light. I cannot believe that the word of God is abiding in the hearts of those who are so readily controlled, and yield up their innocency and virtue upon the altar of lustful passions.",
