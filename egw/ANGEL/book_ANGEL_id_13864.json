    "word": "I thank the Lord with heart and soul and voice that He has brought Loma Linda to our notice, that we might obtain it. I thank the Lord that He has sent you to help me carry out in (235) determined effort that which He designed should be a great blessing to us. Redlands will be a center, and so also will Loma Linda. A school will be established as soon as possible, and the Lord will open the way. I could not but think, as I read the notice of the people flocking into Los Angeles, if Loma Linda had not been sold to us, there would now be a ready sale for it. With all the buildings in connection with the main building, we have large advantages. If we will walk humbly with God, and do according to that which He has prospered us, we will have Christ as our friend and our helper. \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" These are the terms of our discipleship. Will we comply with them?",
