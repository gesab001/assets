    "word": "SING HEAVEN\u2019S SONG HERE.\u2014Jesus is soon coming, and our position should be that of waiting and watching for His appearing. We should not allow anything to come in between us and Jesus. We must learn here to sing the song of heaven, so that when our warfare is over we can join in the song of the heavenly angels in the city of God. What is that song? It is praise, and honor, and glory unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.\u2014Historical Sketches, p. 145 quoted in LHU 372.",
