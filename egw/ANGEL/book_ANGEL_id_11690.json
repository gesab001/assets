    "word": "Medical missions should be opened as pioneer agencies to prepare the way for the proclamation of the third angel's message in the cities of the South. . . . Industries can be started both in and out of the cities. There should be schools for the education of the colored people, as well as schools for the whites. In all these institutions, the white people should work for the whites, and the colored people for their own race. It may be found advisable for experienced white laborers to train those of our colored brethren and sisters who desire to work for their own people.--Ms 24, 1891, pp. 15, 16. (Diary, January 1-30, 1891.)",
