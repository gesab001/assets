    "word": "Wednesday morning, February 28, Sister White called me to her office room, and after going over some manuscript work relating to our cause in the Southern States, she dwelt on the \n\n\n                                  -592- \n\nimportance of our preparing the publishing proper historical compilations on important missionary enterprises that have been undertaken and carried forward under the special guidance of the Holy Spirit, by workers of large faith. She referred particularly to the story of the work in the South, the story of the earlier experience of our workers in Europe, and the story of the rise and development of the third angel's message in Australia. During the course of our conversation along these lines, Sister White abruptly turned the conversation toward Loma Linda matters, and said that some of the brethren have thought it rather strange that she should take so active a part in the matter of our brethren at Loma Linda securing control of the farming lands lying close by the institutions.",
