    "word": "If we have the truth, the work in these countries must enlarge. New fields will be continually opening, and the church must extend her efforts by entering these fields. The message must go, notwithstanding the hard times. We must make special efforts in this direction now, while the angels are holding the four winds. Soon the time to labor will be past. Who does not want to have a part in this closing work? All can do something. Those who cannot give themselves can give of their means, and all can pray not only that the Lord will raise up laborers, but that the treasury may be supplied with the necessary funds to extend the work. Pray, brethren, pray earnestly, that the hearts of some who are doing very little, and of others who have as yet done nothing, may be opened, and that the means that God has intrusted to them may be used to his glory. The work begun in weakness will be carried on to a glorious termination. The truth must go to all nations, tongues, and peoples, and that speedily.",
