    "word": "Jacob, in his vision of the ladder whose base rested upon the earth, and whose topmost round reached to the highest heaven, saw the God of heaven standing above this ladder of glorious brightness, and angels of God constantly ascending and descending upon it. This fitly represents the love and care of God for his children, and the constant communication there is between earth and heaven. It is also intended to impress us with the importance of walking circumspectly before God. Oh that I could say something to impress you with the offensive character of sin in God's sight!",
