Kress: \n\n\n     Soon after the Paradise Valley Sanitarium had been secured, the brethren at Los Angeles, after long search, decided to purchase a hotel property at Glendale, eight miles from the city. This property was offered at a price below its original cost, and within the reach of the conference. As everything seemed favorable, it was secured, and has since been refitted and opened as the Glendale Sanitarium. Some additions have been made to the old building.",
