    "word": "Jesus, your Redeemer, and all the holy angels are grieved at your hardness of heart. Jesus came to our world, and gave His own life to save these souls, and yet you who know the truth make so little effort to impart the blessings of His grace to those for whom He died. Such indifference and neglect of duty is an amazement to the angels. In the judgment you must meet the souls you have neglected. \n                                                                           19",
