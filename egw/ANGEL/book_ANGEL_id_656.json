    "word": "Pleasure in Bruising Souls--I am sorry that there are those in positions of trust who very sparingly cultivate the sympathy and tenderness of Christ.  They do not even cultivate and manifest love toward their brethren and sisters who are in the faith.  They do not exercise the precious tact that should bind and heal those who go astray, but instead they exhibit cruelty of spirit, that drives the wanderer still further into the dark, and makes angels weep.  Some seem to find a sort of pleasure in bruising and wounding souls who are ready to die.  As I look upon men who handle sacred truth, who bear sacred responsibilities, and who are failing to cultivate a spirit of love and tenderness, I feel like crying out, \"Turn ye, turn ye; for why will ye die?\"--Letter 43, 1895, p. 3 (June 14, 1895 to J. H. Kellogg).",
