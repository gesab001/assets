    "word": "Chap. 58 - The Education of Our Children\n\n     Dear Sister C: If God in His providence has established a school among our own people in -----, and if in place of sending your daughter where she would be in the society and under the influence of those who love the truth, you place her in ----- Seminary, where she will be associated with a worldly class who have no respect for God or His law, I ask you how you expect the Lord will work to counteract the evil influence that must surround her and which you have voluntarily chosen. Will He commission His angels to do the work which He has left for you to do? God does not work in that way; He expects us to follow the light He has given in His word.",
