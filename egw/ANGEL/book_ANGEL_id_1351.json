    "word": "A Soul-winning Ministry \n\n     Entire consecration of soul must be maintained as much by the teachers and superintendents of our Sabbath schools as by the ministers in our pulpits, for all alike are engaged in the work of bringing souls to Christ. Each in his place is to work, as did Christ, in the spirit of love, for the erring and impenitent. This is what Christ would see in the Sabbath school work. . . . The angels of God that behold the face of the Father in heaven are looking upon the children and youth, whom you, as living agents for God, are teaching the way of salvation. Think of this, superintendents and teachers; you are in the presence of heavenly angels, doing work the character of which \n                                                                           158\nwill testify to your fidelity or unfaithfulness to Christ. . . .",
