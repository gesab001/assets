The Lord has specified what should be done there. A grand work has been started, and it should by all means be sustained. It must not be hindered by neglect, but is to go forward in straight, clear lines. Brother Butler, and Brother Haskell and his wife, are laboring hard and earnestly, and are wrestling with many difficulties, and they must be given assistance. [FROM A COMMUNICATION TO THE GENERAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, JULY 20, 1905.]",
