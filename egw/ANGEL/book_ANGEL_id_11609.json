    "word": "Nimes, Oct. 17, 1886. Sunday afternoon Brother Ings spoke. There was quite a number present, and I had freedom in speaking in the evening. Mr. Gilly, the Evangelical minister, and preceptor of a school as well as an asylum for orphans and fallen women, was present and I was introduced to him. He reminds me of Dr. Lewis in size and features and deportment. Elder Bourdeau is very feeble and he needs much strength for the labor he has to perform.",
