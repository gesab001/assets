    "word": "The Millennial Judgment\n     During the thousand years between the first and the second resurrection, the judgment of the wicked takes place. Daniel declares that when the Ancient of\n288\ndays came, \u201cjudgment was given to the saints of the Most High.\u201d At this time the righteous reign as kings and priests unto God. John in the Revelation says, \u201cI saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.\u201d \u201cThey shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.\u201d It is at this time that, as foretold by Paul, \u201cthe saints shall judge the world.\u201d In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according to the deeds done in the body. Satan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and His people.\u2014SW, March 14, 1905.",
