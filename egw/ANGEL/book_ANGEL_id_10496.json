    "word": "Jesus speaks of His people as a brand plucked out of the fire, and Satan understands what this means. The infinite sufferings of the Son of God in Gethsemane and on Calvary were endured that He might rescue His people from the power of the evil one. The work of Jesus for the salvation of perishing souls is as if He thrust His hand into the fire to save them. Joshua, who represents God's people, is clothed in filthy garments, and stands before the angel; but as the people repent before God for the transgression of His law, and reach up by the hand of faith to lay hold on the righteousness of Christ, Jesus says, \"Take away the filthy garments from them, and clothe them with change of raiment\" (see Zechariah 3:4).",
