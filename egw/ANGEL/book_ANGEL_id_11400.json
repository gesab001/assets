    "word": "All the work of canvassing should be considered as evangelistic work. The Lord will give his grace to all who will seek for it in humility, and he will open ways for the dropping of seeds of truth into good soil. We have no time to lose, no hours or moments to devote to selfish pleasure. We, as workers together with God, are to labor with all interest and earnest energy to pull souls out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted with flesh. There have been presented before me the very many precious opportunities to save souls, which have been unheeded and lost. Let us now see how many souls we can save for our Saviour. \"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\"                    (Signed) E. G. White.",
