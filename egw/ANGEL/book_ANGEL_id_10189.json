    "word": "There is nothing so offensive to God as sin. Instead of making void the law of God by continuing in sin, every truly converted soul will be walking in the path of humble obedience to all of God's commandments.

It is the power of Satan that came to Adam and Eve in Eden, the deceiving, bewitching power of the fallen angel. . . .",
