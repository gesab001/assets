I saw that they had not seen their true state, and I prayed the angel to unfold it to them, that they might see themselves \n\n\n                                    -172- \n\nas God sees them. I saw that there was a lack of their studying their Bibles as they should, but let their minds run upon other things, and reading that did not profit. I saw that the Bible was the statute book that was to judge us in the last days, and that it should be studied much and carefully to know whether our lives will compare with the Word of God. I saw that if any should lose their love for the word of God, that they should not rest, but pray very earnestly for God to baptize them with His Spirit into an understanding of His Word that they may love it better than anything else.--Ms 5, 1851.
