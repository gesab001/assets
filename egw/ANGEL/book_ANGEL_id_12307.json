    "word": "No one of the angels could become a substitute and surety for the human race, for their life is God's; they could not surrender it. On Christ alone the human family depended for their existence. He is the eternal, self-existent Son, on whom no yoke had come. When God asked, \"whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\" Christ alone of the angelic host could reply, \"Here am I; send Me.\" He alone had covenanted before the foundation of the world to become a surety for man. He could say that which not the highest angel could say--\"I have power over My own life. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again\" [see John 10:18]. \n\n\n                                    -396-",
