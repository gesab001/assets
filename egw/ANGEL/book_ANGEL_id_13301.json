    "word": "Let every student gain a rich experience in having his life hid with Christ in God. Let every one perfect a Christian character. Remember always that the holy angels are watching over you, and that when the day is completed, you have either lived to the glory of God or else you have been defective and \n\n\n            -248- \n\nhave detracted from His glory. When tempted, resist the enemy. Realize constantly that you are receiving to impart, that you are consumers in order that you may become producers.",
