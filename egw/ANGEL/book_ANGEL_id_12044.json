    "word": "The Son of man will come in the clouds of heaven in his own glory and the glory of His Father, and of all the holy angels. There will be no lack of honor and glory. In that day the law of God is to be revealed in its majesty, and man, who has broken that law and stood in defiant rebellion against its holy precepts, will understand that that law which he has despised, discarded and trampled under foot is God's standard of character.--Ms 39, 1898, p. 6.
