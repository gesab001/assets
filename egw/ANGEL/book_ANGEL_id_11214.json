    "word": "EDUCATION IN THE FORMATION OF THE BEAST AND IMAGE.--THE EARLY REFORMERS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO HAVE THEIR OWN COURSES OF STUDY, TEXT-BOOKS, TEACHERS, METHODS, PRINCIPLES, ETC. THEY SEPARATED THEMSELVES COMPLETELY FROM THE POPULAR SCHOOLS OF THE DAY. IT REQUIRED COURAGE AND FAITH IN THOSE DAYS TO TAKE SUCH A STAND, AND IT WILL REQUIRE EVEN MORE COURAGE AND FAITH FOR THOSE WHO ARE PREPARING FOR TRANSLATION TO TAKE THE STAND WHICH THE TESTIMONIES ARE PLEADING FOR THEM TO TAKE. THEY KNEW THAT IF THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD GO TO THE SCHOOLS WHERE THE POPULAR EDUCATION WAS GIVEN THEY WOULD RECEIVE THE MARK OF THE \n\n\n                       -38- \n\nPAPACY, OR THE BEAST. THOSE WHO ARE LIVING UP TO THE LIGHT AT THE PRESENT TIME, WILL SEE, EVEN MORE CLEARLY, THAT IF THEIR CHILDREN CONTINUE TO GO TO THE POPULAR SCHOOLS, THEY WILL RECEIVE SUCH PRINCIPLES AS WILL COMPEL THEM TO ASSIST IN GIVING LIFE TO THE IMAGE TO THE BEAST. ANY ONE WHO HAS A KNOWLEDGE OF THE THIRD ANGEL'S MESSAGE, AND WHO WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXAMINE THE STUDIES AND METHODS OF THE POPULAR SYSTEM OF EDUCATION, CAN SEE THAT THE BOOKS ARE FILLED WITH THOSE ERRORS WHICH WILL OBLIGE THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVING THEIR EDUCATION FROM THEM TO TAKE THE DREADFUL STEP WHICH WILL BRING UPON THE WORLD A RELIGIOUS AND CIVIL DARKNESS, GREATER THAN HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN BEFORE.",
