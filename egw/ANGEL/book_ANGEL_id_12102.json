    "word": "With all his power, Satan pressed his temptations upon Christ, seeking to make Him turn aside from offering Himself as an oblation to God. But Christ looked upon a world of woe, and knew that if He failed, it would be lost. Shall He turn aside? No, no. An angel from heaven strengthened Him to firmly put aside the temptation, the intense desire to avoid drinking the cup. And as the wail of a lost world came up before Him, He cried in a voice full of the deepest decision, \"Nevertheless, not My will, but Thine be done\" (Matthew 27:39).--Letter 106, 1896, pp. 7-9.
