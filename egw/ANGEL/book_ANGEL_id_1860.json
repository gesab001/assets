    "word": "THE REMNANT OF THE GOSPEL CHURCH WILL HAVE THE GIFTS. WAR WILL BE WAGED AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS CHRIST. (REVELATION 12:17.) IN REVELATION 19:10, THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS IS DEFINED TO BE THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY. SAID THE ANGEL, \"I AM THY FELLOW SERVANT, AND OF THY BRETHREN THAT HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS.\" IN REVELATION 22:9, HE REPEATS THE SAME IN SUBSTANCE, AS FOLLOWS: \"I AM THY FELLOW SERVANT, AND OF THY BRETHREN THE PROPHETS.\" FROM THE COMPARISON WE SEE THE FORCE OF THE EXPRESSION, \"THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS IS THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY.\" BUT THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS INCLUDES ALL THE GIFTS OF THAT ONE SPIRIT. SAYS PAUL: \"I THANK MY GOD ALWAYS ON YOUR BEHALF, FOR THE GRACE OF GOD WHICH IS GIVEN YOU BY JESUS CHRIST; THAT IN EVERYTHING YE ARE ENRICHED BY HIM, IN ALL UTTERANCE, AND IN ALL KNOWLEDGE; EVEN AS THE TESTIMONY OF CHRIST WAS CONFIRMED IN YOU: SO THAT YE COME BEHIND IN NO GIFT; WAITING FOR THE COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.\" 1 CORINTHIANS 1:4-7. THE TESTIMONY OF CHRIST WAS CONFIRMED IN THE CORINTHIAN CHURCH; AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT? THEY CAME BEHIND IN NO GIFT. ARE WE NOT JUSTIFIED, THEN, IN THE CONCLUSION THAT WHEN THE REMNANT ARE FULLY CONFIRMED IN THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS, THEY WILL COME BEHIND IN NO GIFT, WAITING FOR THE COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST? \n\n  ROSWELL F.
