    "word": "When the third angel's message shall go forth with a loud voice and the whole earth shall be lightened with His glory, the Holy Spirit is poured out upon God's people. The revenue of glory has been accumulating for this closing work of the third angel's message. Of the prayers that have been ascending for the fulfillment of the promise--the descent of the Holy Spirit--not one has been lost. Each prayer has been accumulating, ready to overflow and pour forth a healing flood of heavenly influence and accumulated light all over the world.",
