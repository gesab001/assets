    "word": "\"When the workers become confused, let them drop upon their knees and plead with God to make clear the understanding of His truth, and the people will be impressed. If they keep in the line of humility the angels of God will impress hearts, and they will receive the truth, where otherwise they would not. These words were spoken to me distinctly: 'I will make the impressions. I will lead men to speak words of great import to the people, and these words will make their impression.'",
