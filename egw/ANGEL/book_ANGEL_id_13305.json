    "word": "Angels of God are here today, watching anxiously to see how you will receive the words of the gospel. And evil angels are here also, ready to do their wicked work upon the minds of all who will listen to their insinuations. If you have not found the liberty of Christ, if your heart is not emptied of all bitterness and wrath and malice and selfishness, it is time that you made diligent work for repentance. God is calling you. Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your heart.",
