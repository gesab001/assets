    "word": "Christ ascended on high, leading captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. When after Christ's ascension the Spirit came down as promised, like a rushing, mighty wind, filling the whole place where the disciples were assembled, what was the effect? Thousands were converted in a day. We have taught, we have expected, that an angel is to come down from heaven, that the earth will be lightened with His glory. Then we shall behold an ingathering of souls similar to that witnessed on the day of Pentecost.--Letter 25b, 1892 \n                                                                           52",
