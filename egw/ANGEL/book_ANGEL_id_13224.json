    "word": "There is a large church here. Our college has brought in many families, and these families ought to feel before God that they have a responsibility to guard the fort. If they are unfaithful and refuse to stand at their post of duty, who will do this for them? If they have not spirituality, if they have not piety, if they have not devotion, or discernment in regard to how they should conduct themselves and keep themselves separate from such influences as are continually arising in Battle Creek--right where God is at work and where His institutions are, where we may expect that the angels of God as guardians are around about us--those who will do nothing to help the church, why, just as soon as they can find a position outside of Battle Creek, we shall say amen to it. Better not be a burden to the church in this place.",
