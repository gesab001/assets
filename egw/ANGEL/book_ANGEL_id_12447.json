    "word": "Sister Marian Davis' death was felt very keenly by me. On our return from the East we found her very sick. About a week after our return she rallied, and for a few days we hoped for her recovery. But she failed very suddenly, and died October 25. We had planned to go to Los Angeles the day before, but felt that we must remain at home a day longer. We were very glad that we had decided thus, for the next morning at seven o'clock Marian lost consciousness, and she passed away at half-past four that day. She was buried in the St. Helena cemetery. On Friday morning we left home for southern California. On the way down I caught a severe cold, from which I have not yet recovered. \n\n\n                                   -254-",
