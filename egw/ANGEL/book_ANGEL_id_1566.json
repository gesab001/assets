    "word": "I was greatly pleased  with your letter, in which you gave me the history of your experience with the WCTU. When I read it, I said, \"Thank the Lord. That is seed-sowing which is of value.\" I am pleased, so much pleased. The Lord has certainly opened your way. Keep it open, if possible. A work can be accomplished by you. Preserve your strength for such efforts. Attend important gatherings when you can. These occasions will be very trying seasons, but when the Lord gives His loved ones a special work to do, He sends His angels to be round about them.",
