    "word": "Challenge to parents\n     Fathers and mothers, wherever you are, whether in your home or elsewhere, it is never right for you to speak one disrespectful word to each other. If you are harassed say, firmly, \u201cThis is from Satan. He wants me to perpetuate his words, his spirit, but I will not do it.\u201d Determine to speak in love; to cultivate patience, kindness, long-suffering, courtesy, and delicacy in dealing with one another. Why?\u2014Because you are a Christian; because you are preparing for the society of the heavenly angels; for a home in the \n28\nkingdom of glory, where no harsh, unkind, impatient words are ever spoken. Remember that it is Satan who leads men and women to speak unkindly to one another.",
