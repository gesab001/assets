    "word": "Extent of the Work. \n\n     \"God has qualified His people to enlighten the world. . . . They are to extend His work until it shall encircle the globe. In all parts of the earth, they are to establish sanitariums, schools, publishing houses, and kindred facilities for the accomplishment of His work. . . . The Lord's solemn, sacred message of warning must be proclaimed in the most difficult fields and in the most sinful cities,--in every place where the light of the third angel's message has not yet dawned. To every one is to be given the last call to the marriage supper of the Lamb.\"",
