    "word": "From the light that God has given me, I can say that not half of those who profess to believe the present truth have a thorough understanding of the Third Angel's Message. Many believe the truth because they have heard it preached by someone in whom they had confidence. When our people search the word of God for themselves, we shall hear less murmuring than we hear today. We need that faith that will lead us to study the Bible for ourselves, and take God at his word.",
