    "word": "\"And He shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee O Satan; even the Lord that hast chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a branch plucked out of the fire? Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel\" [Zechariah 3:1-3]. Joshua here represents the people of God; and Satan pointing to their filthy garments claims them as his property over which he has a right to exercise his cruel power. But these very ones have improved the hours of probation to confess their sins with contrition of soul and put them away, and Jesus has written pardon against their names.",
