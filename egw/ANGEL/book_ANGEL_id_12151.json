    "word": "Those who desire to see Jesus and dwell with Him in the heavenly courts must reveal the truth in the form of sound words. They must refrain from all foolish jesting and joking. You are living in the presence of angels who are appointed \n\n\n                                     -148- \n\nto lead you to right action, yet, knowing the truth of God as expressed in His Word, you fail. You are now making your choice as to whom you will pattern after. It is your privilege to follow that which is right, and by your example lead to right action on the part of others. If you take this course, the commendation of God will rest upon you.",
