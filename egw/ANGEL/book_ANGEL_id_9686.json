    "word": "The Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were given me, and an angel attended me from the city to a place that was bright and glorious. . . . Then I was taken to a world which had seven moons. There I saw good old Enoch, who had been translated. On his right arm he bore a glorious palm, and on each leaf was written \u201cVictory.\u201d Around his head was a dazzling white wreath, and leaves on the wreath, and in the middle of each leaf was written \u201cPurity,\u201d and around the wreath were stones of various colors, that shone brighter than the stars, and cast a reflection upon the letters and magnified them. On the back part of his head was a bow that confined the wreath, and upon the bow was written \u201cHoliness.\u201d Above the wreath was a lovely crown that shone brighter than the sun. I asked him if this was the place he was taken to from the earth. He said, \u201cIt is not; the city is my home, and I have come to visit this place.\u201d\u2014EW 39, 40.",
