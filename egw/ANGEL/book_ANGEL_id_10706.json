    "word": "Chap. 5 - Our Huntsville School as a Training\nCenter\n\n     It is cheering to know that in the Southern States of America a few faithful laborers have made a beginning here and there in giving the third angel's message to the colored race. It is also cheering to know that among our brethren and sisters in the more favored fields of America, there are warm hearts beating in sympathy with the hearts of those who have bravely borne a burden of labor for the colored people. The Lord has been working with and for the tried laborers in the South. There has been laid a foundation that will be as enduring as eternity.",
