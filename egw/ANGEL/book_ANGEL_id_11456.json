    "word": "Third Message Whole Gospel \n\n\n     A great work is to be done in setting before men the saving truths of the gospel. To present these truths is the work of the third angel's message. \n                                                                           58\n. . .The whole of the gospel is embraced in the third angel's message, and in all our work the truth is to be presented as it is in Jesus. . . . Let nothing lessen the force of the truth for this time. The third angel's  message must do its work of separating from the churches a people who will take their stand on the platform of eternal truth. Our message is a life and death message, and we must let it appear as it is, the great power of God. We are to present it in all its telling force. Then the Lord will make it effectual.
