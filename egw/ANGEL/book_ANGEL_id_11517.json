    "word": "A few years since, a man named B--, of Red Bluff, California, came to me to deliver his message. He said it was the loud cry of the third angel which was to lighten the earth with his glory. He thought God has passed all the leading workers and given him the message. I attempted to show him that he was mistaken. He said Seventh-day Adventists were Babylon, and when we told him our reasons and set the matter before him, that he was in error, he had great power come upon him,  and he certainly gave a loud cry. I sent to the office for Brother B--, and my son Willie who came in. Mr. B-- stood up under a power proclaiming the loud cry of the third angel's message, swelling louder and louder. We had much trouble with him; his mind became unbalanced, and he had to be placed in the insane asylum.",
