    "word": "* * * * *\n\n     Men who bring in these damnable heresies [the teachings of Spiritualism] will dare those who teach the word of God to enter into controversy with them, and some who teach the truth have not had the courage to withstand a challenge from this class, who are marked characters in the word of God. Some of our ministers have not had the moral courage to say to these men, \u201cGod has warned us in his word in regard to you. He has given us a faithful description of your character and of the heresies which you hold.\u201d Some of our ministers, rather than give this class any occasion to triumph or to charge them with cowardice, have met them in open discussion. But in discussing with Spiritualists they do not meet man merely, but Satan and his angels. They place themselves in communication with the powers of darkness, and encourage evil angels about them.",
