    "word": "The Lord has given us His grace to be developed in good works. We are to be so closely in the companionship of Christ that by beholding His image through His word we may represent Christ. In manifesting His tenderness and His love to all with whom we associate, we set forth Jesus Christ in practical good words and works, and are saying, This is the way, walk ye in it.\" We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\"--Ms 220, 1902. \n\nEllen G.
