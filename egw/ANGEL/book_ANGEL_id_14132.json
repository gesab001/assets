    "word": "But this [mighty] angel comes bearing no soft, smooth, message, but words that are calculated to stir the hearts of men to their very depths. That angel is represented as crying mightily with a strong voice, saying, \"Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.\" \"Come out of her, My people that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\" Are we indeed as the human agencies, to cooperate with the divine instrumentalities in sounding the message of this mighty angel who is to lighten the earth with his glory? . . . \n\n\n                                     (Signed) \n\n\n                                                Ellen G.
