    "word": "A and B will always be children, and will be restored by the power of the great restorer, when mortals shall have put on immortality. All their sad marks are obliterated. These marks are now a beacon of warning, repeating the history of what intemperance will do. He [the angel] turned to the eldest and said, \"Upon you rests a mighty responsibility to cooperate with heavenly \n\n\n                                    -210- \n\nintelligences and your mother, to counteract, as far as [lies] in your power, the traces left upon the family. God has given you precious intellect. You have advantage in every respect over A; but if you practice a life of disobedience and transgression, you will lose the future immortal life which will be given to A and B. Your light will go out in darkness, unless you are loyal and true to serve the Lord Jesus. Why are you not as is A, never able to increase in knowledge, never able to expand the intellect? It was no sin of his own that has left him a child in reason, always a child. This should be contemplated by you, and you should make very effort to reach a higher standard than you have yet done. . . .",
