    "word": "After these seven thunders uttered their voices, the instruction comes to John, as to Daniel, in regard to the little book: \u201cSeal up those things which the seven thunders uttered.\u201d. . . John sees the little book unsealed. . . . Then Daniel\u2019s prophecies have their proper place in the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages to be given to the world. The unsealing of the little book was the message in relation to time.",
