    "word": "An Important Place in Our Salvation.--Those who are not health reformers treat themselves unfairly and unwisely. By the indulgence of appetite they do themselves fearful injury. Some may think that the question of diet is not important enough to be included in the question of religion. But such make a great mistake. God's word declares, \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory \n                                                                           163\nof God.\" The subject of temperance, in all its bearings, has an important place in the working out of our salvation.-- Evangelism, page 265.",
