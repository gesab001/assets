Dear Brother Nicola:- \n\n\n     I was very much pleased to receive a letter from you regarding the sanitarium at Melrose. I have not been situated so that I could respond sooner. Early in April we were called upon to attend the dedicatory exercise of two of our S. Calif. sanitariums,-- at Loma Linda, near Redlands, and at Paradise Valley, near San Diego. We also visited the Glendale Sanitarium, near Los Angeles, and have just returned home.",
