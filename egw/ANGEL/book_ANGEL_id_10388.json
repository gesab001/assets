    "word": "In the Holiest I saw an ark; on the top and sides of it was purest gold. On each end of the ark was a lovely Cherub, with their wings spread out over it. Their faces were turned towards each other, and they looked downwards. [Exodus 25:18-22.] Between the angels was a golden censor. Above the ark, where the angels stood, was an exceeding bright glory, that appeared like a throne where God dwelt. [Exodus 25:20-22.] Jesus stood by the ark. And as the saints' prayers came up to Jesus, the incense in the censor would smoke, and He offered up the prayers of the saints with the smoke of the incense to His Father. [Revelation 8:3,4.] In the ark, was the golden pot of manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of stone which folded together like a book. [Hebrews 9:4.] Jesus opened them, and I saw the ten commandments written on them with the finger of God. [Exodus 31:18.] On one table was four, and on the other six. The four on the first table shone brighter than the other six. But the fourth (the Sabbath commandment,) shone above them all; for the Sabbath was set apart to be kept in honor of God's holy name. [Isaiah 58:13,14.] The holy Sabbath looked glorious--a halo of glory was all around it. I saw that the Sabbath was not nailed to the cross. If it was, the other nine commandments were; and we are at liberty to go forth and break them all, as well as to break the fourth. I saw that God had not changed the Sabbath, for He never changes. [Malachi 3:6.] But the Pope had changed it from the seventh to the first day of the week; for he was to change times and laws. [Daniel 7:25.]",
