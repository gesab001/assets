    "word": "In comparison with the millions of the world, God's people will be, as they have ever been, a little flock; but if they stand for the truth as revealed in His Word, God will be their refuge. They stand under the broad shield of Omnipotence. God is always a majority. When the sound of the last trump shall penetrate the prison-house of the dead, and the righteous shall come forth with triumph, exclaiming, \"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\"--standing then with God, with Christ, with the angels, and the loyal and true of all ages, the children of God will be far in the majority. . . .",
