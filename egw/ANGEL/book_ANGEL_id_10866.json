    "word": "We must be decided upon this subject; for the points he is trying to prove by Scripture, are not sound. They do not prove that the past experience of God's people was a fallacy. We had the truth; we were directed by the angels of God. It was under the guidance of the Holy Spirit that the presentation of the sanctuary question was given. It is eloquent for everyone to keep silence in regard to the features of our faith, in \n                                                                           16\nwhich they acted no part. God never contradicts Himself. Scripture proofs are misapplied if forced to testify to that which is not true. Another and still another will arise and bring in supposedly great light, and make their assertions. But we stand by the old land-marks. We are hindered in our work by men who are not converted who seek their own glory. They wish to be thought originators of new theories, which they present claiming that they are truth. But if these theories are received they will lead to a denial of the truth that for the past fifty years God has been giving to this people, substantiating it by the demonstration of the Holy Spirit. \n\n\n                   (Signed) Ellen G.
