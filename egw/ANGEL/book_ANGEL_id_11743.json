    "word": "MR No. 241 - On Sanctification\n\n     Brother and Sister Fairfield have a work to do to set their own house and hearts in order. Brother Fairfield's former experience in Campbellism has been unfortunate for him. He has brought along many things connected with that peculiar belief which he has ingrafted in the third angel's message. It has no part with that message. He has not seen and felt the necessity of the Spirit of God upon the heart to influence the life, the words and acts. He has made his religious experience too much of a form.",
