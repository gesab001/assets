    "word": "The voice of God is heard proclaiming that justice is satisfied. Satan is vanquished. Christ's toiling, struggling ones on earth are \"accepted in the beloved\" (Ephesians 1:6). Before the heavenly angels and the representatives of unfallen worlds, they are declared justified. Where He is, there His church shall be. \"Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other\" (Psalm 85:10). The Father's arms encircle His Son, and the word is given, \"Let all the angels of God worship him\" (Hebrews 1:6).",
