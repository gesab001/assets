    "word": "Dear brethren and sisters, if there are any of you that desire to say anything this afternoon, be free. Are you ready to rededicate yourselves to God? Christ is ready; He is waiting, watching, longing. Angels are in this room. Wicked angels are here, and holy angels are here. Which side shall gain the victory over your heart here today, my brother, my sister? These are the hours of the Sabbath; you cannot spend them any better than by clearing the King's highway. Remove the root of bitterness from your heart. Do not break off the top of it. Root it out lest, springing up again, many shall be defiled. You cannot afford to be content with half-hearted work. Dig it out by the roots, and then God will help you to be reconverted. \n\n\n                                      -378-",
