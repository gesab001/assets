    "word": "But many say that Jesus was not like us, that He was not as we are in the world, that He was divine, and therefore we cannot overcome as He overcame. But this is not true; \"for verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. . . . For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted\" (Hebrews 2:16-18). Christ knows the sinner's trials; He knows his temptations. He took upon Himself our nature; He was tempted in all points like as we are. He has wept, He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.",
