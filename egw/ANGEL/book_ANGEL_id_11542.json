One day he took us in to San Diego, and we crossed over the bay on the ferry to Coronado. Yesterday I rode out again to visit his sister, D. Johnson. I enjoy very much riding in the automobile. I had thought of riding forty miles next week to hold meetings at Escondido, but Willie urges me to return home, and we are planning to return next Tuesday. Letter 263, 1905, p. 4.
