    "word": "The Word has made the statement, \"I am the Lord that do sanctify you\" if you observe the Sabbath. This is the only true sanctification in the Scriptures--that which comes from God because of obedience to His commandments. Then we may know that the little companies assembled together to worship the Lord on the day which He has blessed and made holy, have a right to claim the rich blessings of Jehovah. He who has declared that His words are spirit and life, should have their faith in strong exercise that the Lord Jesus is an honored guest in their assemblies. \"Where two or three are met together in My name, there am I in their midst.\" If He is there, it is to enlighten and bless. Therefore as we assemble together, we all have a solemn sense of the presence of God, and know that the angels of God are in the assembly. The messengers of the gospel know by experience its truth, power and excellence. It is the hours of the Sabbath that are sacred and sanctified and holy, and every true worshiper who keeps holy the Sabbath, should claim the promise, \"That ye may know I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.\" \n\n\n                                    -348-",
