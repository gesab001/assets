    "word": "\"Loma Linda is to be not only a sanitarium, but an educational center. With the possession of this place comes the weighty responsibility of making the work of the institution, educational in character. A school is to be established here for the training of gospel, medical missionary, evangelists. In regard to the school, I would say, make it especially strong in the education of nurses and physicians. In medical missionary schools, many workers are to be qualified with the ability of physicians to labor as medical missionary evangelists. Make the schools especially strong for nurses and physicians.",
