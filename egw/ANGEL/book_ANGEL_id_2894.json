    "word": "In the typical system,\u2014which was a shadow of the sacrifice and priesthood of Christ,\u2014the cleansing of the sanctuary was the last service performed by the high priest in the yearly round of ministration. It was the closing work of the atonement,\u2014a removal or putting away of sin from Israel. It prefigured the closing work in the ministration of our High Priest in Heaven, in the removal or blotting out of the sins of his people, which are registered in the heavenly records. This service involves a work of investigation, a work of judgment; and it immediately precedes the coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; for when he comes, every case has been decided. Says Jesus, \u201cMy reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\u201d [Revelation 22:12.] It is this work of judgment, immediately preceding the second advent, that is announced in the first angel's message of Revelation 14:7: \u201cFear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his Judgment is come.\u201d",
