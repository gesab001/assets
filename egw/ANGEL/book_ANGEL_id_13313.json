    "word": "The time has about come when Satan will work miracles to confirm minds in the belief that he is God. All the people of God are now to stand on the platform of truth as had been given in the third angel's message. All the pleasant pictures, all the miracles wrought, are presented by the enemy in order that if possible the very elect shall be deceived. The only hope for anyone is to hold fast the evidences that have confirmed the truth in righteousness. Let these be proclaimed over and over again, until the close of this earth's history.",
