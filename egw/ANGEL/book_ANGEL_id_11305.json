    "word": "No one connected with the work should hold any worldly office, unless it be one necessary to the transaction of business among our people. The peculiar, holy character of our work is such as to separate us from the world. The acceptance of worldly offices leads to the world, which is displeasing to God. The worldly business carried on by Brn. Aldrich and Walker brings into the Office many to consult with them, and talk over business matters, which consumes their time, divides the interest in the work, and brings an influence into the Office which is worldly and corrupting, and which grieves the angels of God away from the place. As I viewed the scene, the Office, especially the counting room, it was more like a public place of worldly business, than that retirement and quiet necessary to encourage the presence of holy angels, and to properly conduct the work of God.",
