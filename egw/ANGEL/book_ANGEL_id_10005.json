    "word": "Peter was in prison, expecting to be brought forth next day to death; he was sleeping at night \u201cbetween two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.\u201d",
