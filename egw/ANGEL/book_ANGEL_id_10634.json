    "word": "This new sanitarium is beautifully situated. It is eight miles from Los Angeles, in a pleasant, fertile valley. On every hand may be seen orange and lemon groves. The institution is only two blocks from the Glendale post-office. It is in the country, and yet can be very easily reached from the city; for an electric car line from Los Angeles runs past the sanitarium grounds.",
