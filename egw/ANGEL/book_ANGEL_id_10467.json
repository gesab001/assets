    "word": "As Stephen stood face to face with his judges, to answer to the crime of blasphemy, a holy radiance shone upon his countenance. \"And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel\" (verse 15). Those who exalted Moses might have seen in the face of the prisoner the same holy light which radiated the face of that ancient prophet. The Shekinah was a spectacle which they would never again witness in the Temple whose glory had departed forever. Many who beheld the lighted countenance of Stephen trembled and veiled their faces; but stubborn unbelief and prejudice never faltered.--The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 294-296.",
