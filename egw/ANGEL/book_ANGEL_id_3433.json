    "word": "Here we find a representation of the people of God of today. As Joshua stood before the Angel, \u201cclothed with filthy garments,\u201d so we stand in the presence of Christ, clothed in garments of unrighteousness. Christ, the angel before whom Joshua stood, is now interceding for us before his Father, as he is here represented as interceding for Joshua and his people who were in deep affliction; and Satan now, as then, stands by to resist his efforts.",
