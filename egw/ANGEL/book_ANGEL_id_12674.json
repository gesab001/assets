    "word": "Sunday, after speaking, I was introduced to an evangelical minister, Mr. Gilley. He is preceptor of a school, and one who has acted the most prominent part in building and making an asylum for orphan children and fallen women. Tuesday we called upon Mr. Gilley and had a very pleasant interview. Wednesday he visited us at the home of Elder Bourdeau, by request, and gave me some very interesting facts in reference to the ancient buildings and objects of interest dating back as old as the days of Christ. This was valuable and interesting to me.",
