    "word": "The last two Sabbaths before leaving for Los Angeles, I spoke at the St. Helena Sanitarium to a room full of most interested listeners. Every time I speak at this place, I feel the deep moving of the Spirit of God. There are new hearers present every time, for fresh patients are always coming to the institution. Among my hearers there are most intelligent men--physicians, lawyers, judges--and they are interested in the words that the Lord gives me to speak.",
