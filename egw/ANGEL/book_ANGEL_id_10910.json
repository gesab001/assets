    "word": "This health institution has not been brought into favor simply because of the talent, skill, or wisdom of one man. It is because God has had faithful instrumentalities that have consented to be led by the Holy Spirit, and many influences have combined to bring about the prosperity of the Sanitarium. The time that has been spent in communing with God, in seeking his help before undertaking to relieve those who were in a critical condition, has brought angels to the side of the doctor and his assistants. You have succeeded according as you have trusted in God. He has been by your side just as verily as Christ was by the side of those who were suffering when he walked among them on earth. \n  1895. \n\n                                               -",
