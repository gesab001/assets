    "word": "The angel represented in prophecy as delivering this message, symbolizes a class of faithful men, who, obedient to the promptings of God's Spirit and the teachings of his word, proclaim this warning to the inhabitants of earth. This message was not to be committed to the religious leaders of the people. \n                                                                           200\nThey had failed to preserve their connection with God, and had refused the light from Heaven; therefore they were not of the number described by the apostle Paul: \"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night nor of darkness.\" [1 Thessalonians 5:4, 5.]",
