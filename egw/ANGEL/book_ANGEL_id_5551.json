    "word": "Chap. 36 - Literature Outreach by Adventists\n\n     Distribute Publications Like the Leaves of Autumn.--We must prepare ourselves for most solemn duties. A world is to be saved. The work is advancing in a most marvelous manner in foreign lands; and even within the shadows of our doors there are many, many opportunities for communicating to others the saving truths of the third angel's message. Publications are to be distributed like the leaves of autumn. [CHURCH MEMBERS WERE TO \"SELL OR GIVE AWAY OUR LITERATURE\" (MS 126, 1902), OR PROVIDE BY \"LENDING\" (9T 35), AS THE TRUTH WAS TO BE CARRIED TO THE HOMES OF NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS AND THE PROMISE WAS GIVEN, \"YOU WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN, WHICH WILL ABIDE IN THESE HOMES\" (MS 126, 1902).] This is the message that has been coming to us from the Lord for many years. In view of the great work to be done, how can anyone afford to waste precious time and God-given means in doing those things that are not for his best good or for the glory of God?--RH, July 19, 1906.",
