    "word": "Satan is only too well pleased to harass and destroy the souls of the young; therefore persons should be connected with these who have wisdom to deal \n\n\n                                    -330- \n\nwith tempted human minds. The words of Jesus to Peter are appropriate, \"Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.\" Jesus rejoices in spirit when he sees Satan repulsed from his commanding position to control the mind and will of the human agent. Many a youth is in imminent peril through manifold temptations, but Jesus Christ has the tenderest sympathy for them, and the Lord has sent His angels to protect and guard them from lives of wretchedness. Jesus Christ has purchased them, paying the ransom money for their souls. They are His property.",
