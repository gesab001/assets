    "word": "The Lord will be your helper, and if you trust Him, will bring you up to a noble, elevated standard, and will place your feet upon the platform of eternal truth. Through the grace of Christ, you can make a right use of your entrusted capabilities, and become an agent for good in winning souls to Christ. Every talent you have should be used on the right side. \n      Those of the youth \n     Who put on the whole armor of God, \n     Who will devote time every day to self-examination, \n     Who will seek the Lord in earnest prayer, and \n     Who will diligently study the Scriptures, \n      Will have the help of the angels of God, \n      And will form characters that will fit them \n      For the society of the redeemed in the kingdom of glory.",
