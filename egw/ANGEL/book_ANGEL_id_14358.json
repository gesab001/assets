    "word": "In the places where labor is to be put forth, advantages should be provided for the training of men and women, as well as the youth, to work in the Master's vineyard. All that can possibly be done with native help in the Southern field, should be done. A large amount of most hopeful evangelistic work can be carried on to good advantage, and thus much of the vineyard be worked, in order that fruit shall be borne. It is fruit that we want. Christ wants fruit to satisfy his hunger. The leaves may appear ever so inviting, but they are not satisfying. His divine soul hungers for fruit.",
