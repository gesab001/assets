    "word": "\u201cThe angels which kept not their first estate,\u201d God declares, \u201c. . . he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.\u201d The element of evil introduced into heaven by the first angels that fell will never again be allowed to enter heaven. But just so long as we live on this earth, we shall have to meet evil and battle against it. A battle is being fought with every soul. All who choose their own will and way and refuse to be converted to the Lord\u2019s way, Satan will use in his service. The knowledge they have acquired in divine things is then united with the knowledge that Satan uses to strengthen his side of the controversy. . . .",
