    "word": "After I had spoken many words to the people, I awoke. I looked from the window of the sleeper, and saw two white clouds. I feel asleep again, and in my dreams the words were spoken to me, Look at those clouds. Just such clouds enshrouded the heavenly angels who came to herald the birth of Christ to the watching shepherds. \"Lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shown round about them: and they were sore afraid. And \n\n\n                                    -258- \n\nthe angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.\"",
