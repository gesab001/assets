    "word": "On the morning of the day we left Washington, (June 11) I attended a meeting held in the seminary building, and spoke to the brethren assembled some very plain words concerning the destitute fields, and the great work that must be done in many places. I urged them not to hold the ministers at Takoma Park, because there is a work to be done all through our cities that have not heard the truth of the third angel's message. Some did not take willingly to the idea of losing Elder Prescott, but I spoke plainly to them.--Letter 98, 1909, pp. 1, 2. (To Elder J. E. White, June 16, 1909.)",
