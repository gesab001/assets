    "word": "Growth in Grace.--Says Paul, \"I die daily\" (1 Corinthians 15:31). Our natural inclination would be to be like the world, but there is the invitation, \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate\" (2 Corinthians 6:17). There is a reformation that we are to make. We are to be as clay in the hands of the potter. We are to be molded and fashioned, and we are to take on the very fashion and mold that God would have us. We are not to take on our own mold, but we must be working to please the God of heaven, working to regain the moral standard. God wants to fit us for a home in His kingdom and this is the time of our preparation. It is a time of character building, that we may have the right mold of character. God will do His part, angels  will do their part, and we are to understand that all heaven is interested in our salvation. . . .",
