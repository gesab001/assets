    "word": "I could hardly bear the sight of the sheep dying for the want of saving, present truth, while some who professed to believe the present truth were holding on to their property and were letting them die, by withholding the necessary means to carry forward the work of God. As it was held up before me, the sight was too painful, and I begged of the angel to take it away, and remove the painful sight from me. I saw that when the cause of God called for their property, they were sorrowful, as the young man was who had great possessions, and who inquired what he \n\n\n                                   -31- \n\nshould do to inherit eternal life. I saw that very soon the overflowing scourge would pass over, and sweep their possessions all away; and then it will be too late to sacrifice earthly goods, and lay up treasure in heaven.",
