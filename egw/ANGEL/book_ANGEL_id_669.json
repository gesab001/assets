    "word": "He who holds forth the Word of life is not to allow too many burdens to be placed upon him.  He must take time to study the Word and to examine self.  If he closely searches his own heart, and gives himself to the Lord, he will better understand how to grasp the hidden things of God . . . . The finances of the cause are to be properly managed by business men of ability; but preachers and evangelists are set apart for another line of work.  Let the management of financial matters rest on others than those set apart for the work of preaching the gospel . . . .",
