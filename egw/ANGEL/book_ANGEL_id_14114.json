    "word": "When the men, who have known and taught the truth, turn aside to human understanding, and mete out to deceived minds their own dish of fables, it is high time for those who have once been laborers in evangelistic work, but who have been drawn away into the management of restaurants, food stores, and other commercial lines of work, to come into line, study their Bibles diligently, and with the word of God in hand, dispense the Bible truth, the spiritual food, in cooperation with the heavenly angels. This work now calls loudly for workmen of divine appointment. Omnipotence will then say to the mountains of difficulty, Be thou removed and cast into the sea.",
