    "word": "There stood Jesus, meek and humble before the infuriated multitude, while they offered Him the meanest abuse. They spit in His face\u2014that face which they will one day desire to be hid from, which will give light to the city of God, and shine brighter than the sun\u2014but not an angry look did He cast upon the offenders. He meekly raised His hand, and wiped it off. They covered His head with an old garment; blindfolded Him, and then struck Him in the face, and cried out, Prophesy unto us who it was that smote thee. There was commotion among the angels. They would have rescued\n199\nHim instantly; but their commanding angel restrained them.\u20141SG 50, 51.",
