    "word": "A high religious standard has not always been maintained in our school. A majority of both teachers and students, are constantly seeking to keep their religion out of sight. Especially has this been the case since worldlings have patronized the College. Christ requires from all his followers, open, manly confessions of their faith. Each must take his position, and be what God designed he should be, a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. Every Christian is to be a light, not hid under a bushel or under a bed, but put on a candlestick, that it may give light to all that are in the house.",
