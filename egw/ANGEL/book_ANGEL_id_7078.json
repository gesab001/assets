They were filled with amazement as they saw that the great stone was rolled from the door of the sepulchre, and Jesus was risen. They hastened to the chief priests and elders with the wonderful story of what they had seen; and as those murderers heard the marvelous report, paleness sat upon every face.

For the sake of money the Roman guard sold their honor, and agreed to follow the counsel of the priests and elders.",
