    "word": "There is a great work to be done here in Europe. From the light that has been given me concerning the people in this part of the country, and perhaps all through Europe, there is danger, in presenting the truth, of arousing  their combativeness. There is little harmony between present truth and the  doctrines of the church in which many of the people have been born and  brought up; and they are so filled with prejudice, and so completely under  the control of their ministers, that in many cases they dare not even come to  hear the truth presented. The question then arises, \n150\nHow can these people be reached? How can the great work of the third angel's message be accomplished? It must be largely accomplished by persevering, individual effort; by visiting the people at their homes.",
