    "word": "The Lord would have the medical-missionary work be to the cause of truth as the hands and arms to the body. You [Dr. Kellogg] have tried to make the medical-missionary work the whole body, but in this you have not succeeded. Let this work occupy its appointed place, just as God designed it should. Let the ministers of the gospel and the medical-missionary workers blend in Christian unity. It is not the will of God that the medical-missionary work shall be all and in all. He designs that the evangelical work and the medical work shall blend in perfect unity. This can be, and every feature of the work can be complete in occupying its proper place in the body. . . .",
