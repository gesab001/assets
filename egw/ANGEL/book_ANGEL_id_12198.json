    "word": "Brother Prescott, your ministerial ability is needed in the \n     work that God requires shall be done in our cities. . . . I am \n     instructed to say to you that you are needed in the fields that are \n     opening for evangelistic work. When you make the Lord your trust, \n     and give to the people the message of truth, wonderful reformations \n     will be seen. (Ms 41, 1909.)",
