    "word": "WE ARE TO COOPERATE WITH GOD IN ANSWERING OUR PRAYERS.\u2014In the Word of God are represented two contending parties that influence and control human agencies in our world. Constantly these parties are working with every human being. Those who are under God\u2019s control and who are influenced by the heavenly angels, will be able to discern the crafty workings of the unseen powers of darkness. Those who desire to be in harmony with the heavenly agencies should be intensely in earnest to do God\u2019s will. They must give no place whatever to Satan and his angels.",
