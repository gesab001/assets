In announcing John's mission and work, the angel said: \u201cHe shall go before him [Christ] in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\u201d\u2014RH Aug. 2, 1898.",
