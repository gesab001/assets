    "word": "Again, when wicked men, inspired by envy and hatred, sought to remove him from the favor of King Darius, they could find no occasion against him except \u201cconcerning the law of his God.\u201d Therefore they laid a snare for him by prevailing upon the king to decree that whosoever asked a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of the king, should be cast into the den of lions. But the firm adherence to principle which Daniel had cultivated from a youth does not fail him now. Notwithstanding the decree of the king, he goes to his chamber three times a day, as is his custom, and with his windows open toward Jerusalem, prays to the God of heaven. Because of his faithfulness to God, he is cast into the den of lions, according to the king's decree; but does God forsake him? No, indeed. Holy angels are sent to minister unto him, and to close the lions\u2019 mouths that they shall do him no harm.",
