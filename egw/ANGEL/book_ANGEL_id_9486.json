    "word": "Those who enter the work as \u201ceye-servants\u201d will find that their work cannot bear the inspection of mortals or of angels. The thing essential for successful work is a knowledge of Christ; for this knowledge will give sound principles of right, [and] impart a noble, unselfish spirit, like that of our Savior whom we profess to serve. Faithfulness, economy, care-taking, thoroughness, should characterize all our work, wherever we may be, whether in the kitchen, in the workshop, in the office of publication, in the sanitarium, in the college, or wherever we are stationed in the vineyard of the Lord. \u201cHe that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\u201d\u2014Review and Herald, Sept. 22, 1891.\\",
