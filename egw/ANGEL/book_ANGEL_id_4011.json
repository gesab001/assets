    "word": "Christ had ascended to heaven in the form of humanity. The disciples had beheld the cloud receive Him. The same Jesus who had walked and talked and prayed with them; who had broken bread with them; who had been with them in their boats on the lake; and who had that very day toiled with them up the ascent of Olivet--the same Jesus had now gone to share His Father's throne. And the angels had assured them that the very One whom they had seen go up into heaven would come again even as He had ascended. He will come \"with clouds; and every eye shall see him.\" . . . Well might the disciples rejoice in the hope of their Lord's return.",
