    "word": "God's faithful builders were not toiling alone. While \"principalities and powers and wicked spirits in high places\" were leagued against them, the Lord did not forsake his people. Could their eyes have been opened, they would have seen as marked evidence of divine presence and aid as was granted to a prophet of old. When Elisha's servant pointed his master to the hostile army surrounding them, and cutting off all opportunity for escape, the prophet prayed, \"Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.\" [2 Kings 6:17.] And, lo, the mountain was filled with chariots and horses of fire, the army of Heaven stationed to protect the man of God. Thus did angels guard the workers in the cause of the Reformation. God had commanded his servants to build, and no opposing force could drive them from the walls.",
