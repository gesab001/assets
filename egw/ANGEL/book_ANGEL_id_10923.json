    "word": "Agents must be selected, chosen of God, for \n\n                      (3) \n\nspheres of labor appointed them and their work must be sustained by the prayers and the contribution of the disciples who may remain in their business stations, thus earning the means necessary to sustain those laboring to work out God's appointed plan. The work of a united, converted church, with prayer and fasting for the holy spirit of God to be revealed, will bring the angelic agencies very near. As the disciples \"ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.\" God will work just as much in our day, if we will individually co-operate with him. Each should labor to strengthen the faith of the other earnest workers. God does not give to any of us the commission to hinder and discourage any soul who can work interestedly under the supervision of the Great Head for the presentation of Bible truth, and the saving of souls ready to perish. We must labor now for the extension of the truth and as a result many souls will come to a knowledge of the truth in our hitherto unworked cities. The very choicest instrumentalities the church contains should be selected and sent forth, and sustained in extending missionary efforts.",
