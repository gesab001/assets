    "word": "We had a most precious meeting in Lynn, but especially so at Danvers. Last Sabbath all in the house save two--an aged colored man and a poor timid soul who dared not make the move--came forward for prayer. The angel of God was in our midst. The ministers sought the Lord, and their supplications were heard in heaven. Oh, how thankful I was that I was able to feed the flock of God through the grace given me. The churches are starving for the bread of life, and they grasp readily the truth presented. I cannot hold back and refuse to visit these places, for I know that I have a message for them from the Lord.",
