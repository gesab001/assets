    "word": "Correct all that is lax or careless in your speech or your habits. Do not pass this over as a matter of little consequence. Wherever you are, keep your room clean and tidy. Let no dirt or rubbish accumulate, \"lest the Lord pass by and see your uncleanness.\" Christ is pure and holy and undefiled. Do not grieve the heavenly angels by cherishing untidy, shiftless habits. It rests with yourselves to decide whether you will be accepted by the Lord as vessels unto honor, fit for his use.",
