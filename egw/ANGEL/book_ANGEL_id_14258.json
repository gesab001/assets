    "word": "Christ, the great Medical Missionary, is our example. Of Him it is written, that He\n69\n\u201cwent about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.\u201d He healed the sick and preached the gospel. In His service, healing and teaching were linked closely together. Today they are not to be separated. The nurses who are trained in our institutions are to be fitted to go out as medical missionary evangelists, uniting the ministry of the Word with that of physical healing.",
