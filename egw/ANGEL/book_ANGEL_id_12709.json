We find M. K. White much improved in health. She has gained ten pounds. Ella May White is not looking well. I am some anxious about her. She is troubled with catarrhal difficulty. We find the rooms pleasantly furnished with articles lent and picked up, so that we think it looks very homelike. But the stoves are insufficient to warm the rooms. I am cold all the time.",
