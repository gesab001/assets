    "word": "Christ Is Escorted Into the Father's Presence\n     There is the throne, and around it the rainbow of promise. There are seraphim and cherubim. The angels circle round Him, but Christ waves them back. He enters into the presence of His Father. He points to His triumph . . .\u2014those raised with Him, the representatives of the captive dead who shall come forth from their graves when the trump shall sound. He approaches the Father; and . . . says: Father, it is finished. I have done thy will, O my God. I have completed the work of redemption. If thy justice is satisfied, \u201cI will that they also, whom thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.\u201d\u2014YI Aug. 11, 1898.",
