    "word": "The brethren and sisters of the Southern California Conference have done much to help the three sanitariums in their territory, and our friends in the East have lent their assistance. In this they have done well. At the August (1908) camp-meeting in Los Angeles, our brethren pledged many thousands of dollars to the foreign missions. And Sister Gotzian, who has been a strong supporter of our California sanitariums, is desirous of transferring some of her means to the needy enterprises in Nashville, Madison, and Huntsville.",
