    "word": "I devoted Tuesday to writing. Tuesday evening I spoke in Stanmore to the people assembled in the tent. The Lord blessed me with great freedom and power. I knew the angel of God was by my side. The power of the Holy Spirit was upon me. I returned to my room so thankful to God. The night before I was so burdened I could not sleep; this night I was so grateful to God I could not sleep till one o'clock. I awoke at half past three in the morning.",
