    "word": "By the true follower of Christ every business transaction will be regarded as a part of his religion, just as prayer is a part of his religion. The study of the Scriptures will be considered a part of his religion, for by this he learns his orders. In the light of the Scriptures man regards himself as God's servant, employed to do His will. Sometimes he finds these orders opposed to that which he would choose, were the decision left to him, but he does not find fault with his work because of this. And as he seeks to carry out the will of the Master, angels of God are with him, to be his defense against the wiles of Satan. The word of God is to be our daily teacher. This is the only true source of comfort in all our trials, the only true source of encouragement and instruction in our labors.",
