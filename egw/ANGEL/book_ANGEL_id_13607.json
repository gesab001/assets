    "word": "The Lord has presented to me that there has been a manifest- distrusting of God. Has the Lord no mental or moral power in the men who abide where large interests have been established? Shall God's money be used in transporting from place to place those who show that they have no connection with him? The Lord says, \"Then that honor me I will honor.\" But in pleasing and glorifying the men whom God does not honor, you have dishonored God. Far better go single-handed, and trust in the arm of Jehovah, in the ministering angels whom he sends forth, than have those with you who have closed their hearts against the admonitions and warnings of the spirit of God, and thus against the Spirit itself. In every place where important interests have been established, there are men who love God, and have a measure of ability. These men need to be instructed how to use their talents. Let them carry the responsibilities that they can bear. Teach them to put their trust in God, and not in finite men, to become workers who can be depended upon. Do not lead them to think that they must in every emergency depend on men at a great distance. Let them seek the Lord for themselves.",
