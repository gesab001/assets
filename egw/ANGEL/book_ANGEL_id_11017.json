    "word": "In Christ's humiliation he descended to the very depths of human woe in sympathy and pity for fallen man, which was represented to Jacob by one end of the ladder resting upon the earth, while the top of the ladder, reaching unto Heaven, represents the divine power of Christ, grasping the Infinite, and thus linking earth to Heaven, and finite man to the infinite God. Through Christ the communication is opened between God and man. Angels may pass to and fro from Heaven to earth with messages of love to fallen man, and to minister unto those who shall be heirs of salvation. It is through Christ alone that the heavenly messengers minister to men.",
