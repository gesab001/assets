    "word": "Balak met Balaam, and inquired of him why he thus delayed to come when he sent for him; . . . Balaam answered, Lo, I am come unto thee. He then told him that he had no power to say anything. The word that God should give him, that could he speak, and could go no further. Balaam ordered the sacrifices according to the religious rites. God sent His angel to meet with Balaam, to give him words of utterance, as He had done on occasions when Balaam was wholly devoted to the service of God. \u201cAnd the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and . . . he took up his parable, and said, Balak, the king of Moab, hath brought me from Aram, . . . saying,\n109\nCome, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied?\u201d . . .",
