    "word": "Every true minister of Jesus Christ, every true worker in His cause, will banish from the mind, as impious, every thought of inherent merit. Even the heavenly angels take to themselves no praise. Through the heavenly courts, in one grand chorus, resounds their praise of the Creator: \"All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.\" [1 Chronicles 21:14.] Those who live on this earth should join the heavenly host in ascribing praise and glory to the Creator.--Letter 10, 1884, pp. 1, 2, 7, 8. (To Brother Matteson, May 3, 1884.)",
