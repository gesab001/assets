His word is pledged: \"Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.\" The promise . . . is made to all: \"If thou wilt keep my charge, . . . I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.\" Zechariah 3:7. Angels of God will walk on either side of them, even in this world, and they will stand at last among the angels that surround the throne of God.\" \n                                                                           325",
