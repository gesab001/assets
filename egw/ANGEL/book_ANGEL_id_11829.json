To us God has entrusted it, and we are accountable for the way we handle this sacred testing truth. If our defects of character betray us into sins which repulse souls and turn them from the truth, their blood will be upon our garments.--Letter 1, 1873, p. 10. (To Brother and Sister Canright, November 12, 1873.)",
