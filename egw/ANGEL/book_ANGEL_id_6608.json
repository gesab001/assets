    "word": "After the birth of Ishmael, the Lord manifested himself again to Abraham, and said unto him, \"I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant.\" Again the Lord repeated by his angel his promise to give Sarah a son, and that she should be a mother of many nations. Abraham did not yet understand the promise of God. His mind immediately rests upon Ishmael, as though through him would come the many nations promised, and he exclaims, in his affection for his son, \"Oh, that Ishmael might live before thee!\"",
