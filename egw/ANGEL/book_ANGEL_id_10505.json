    "word": "Satan is seeking continually to draw away the minds of men from God and His Word. He knows that if he can cause men to neglect the Word of God, he can soon cause them to depart from its precepts, and finally to forget their Maker. They will then take the suggestions and instructions of the adversary of God and man, and evil men and evil angels will form a confederacy against the God of heaven.",
