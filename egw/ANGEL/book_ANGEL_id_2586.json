    "word": "Our God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, declares: \"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me\" (Psalm 50:23). All heaven unite in praising God. Let us learn the song of the angels now, that we may sing it when we join their shining ranks. Let us say with the psalmist: \"While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being\" (Psalm 146:2).",
