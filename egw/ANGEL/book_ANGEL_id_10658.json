    "word": "The Glendale Sanitarium. \n\n                      Sanitarium, Cal., December 21, 1904. \n     We feel very grateful to God that our brethren and sisters in Southern California have secured a property near the city of Los Angeles, which is well adapted for sanitarium purposes. For a long time our people in that city have had messages from the Lord that there should be sanitariums near Los Angeles. For want of means the work has been delayed. But in September, a building at Glendale, nine miles from Los Angeles, was purchased, and is now being fitted up for work.",
