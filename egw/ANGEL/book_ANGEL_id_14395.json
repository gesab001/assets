    "word": "The law of God is to be magnified. Its claims must be presented by our workers, in our books and papers, and through the spoken word.

Our people are to be aroused to prepare the way of the Lord. The third angel's message--the last message of mercy to a perishing world--is so sacred, so glorious. Let the light go forth as a lamp that burneth. Mysteries into which angels have desired to look, which prophets and kings and righteous men desired to know, the church of God is now to unfold.",
