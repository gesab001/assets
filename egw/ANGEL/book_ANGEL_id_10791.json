    "word": "What is to be done? Shall the president of the General Conference carry the burden of the neglects of presidents and ministers, and weep between the porch and the altar, crying, \"Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thy heritage to reproach\"? Shall he feel that he is responsible for the deep sleep, the paralysis that is upon the people of God? If he works as he has done to arouse the careless and set in order the things that others have neglected, he will become unable to labor, and will go down to an untimely grave. Will the presidents of Conferences and the ministers of the people seek the Lord earnestly, put away their sins, empty their souls of their idols? or will they continue to go on half-hearted, neglecting solemn duties, while Satan triumphs, whispering to his evil angels, and to his human confederacy in evil, \"Hopeless, irredeemable bankruptcy\"? Let there be no more wasted hours, neglected duties, despised privileges. Open your eyes to what is taking place around you in the signs of the times. The warnings \n\n\n                        -22- \n\nof God have been given; why not heed them? Do not abandon yourself to despair, but heed the words of Christ, \"Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.\" When the eyesalve is applied, many will see as never before, their life of unfulfilled duties, and will be conscience-stricken. But the words of the inspired apostle present, now, just now, hope to those who have been lagging behind and now are trembling for the future. He says, \"Redeeming, the time, because the days are evil.\" Remember, all depends on the use you make henceforth of your intrusted talents. If you refuse to use your powers, they will surely become weak, and decay. God has given to every man his work.",
