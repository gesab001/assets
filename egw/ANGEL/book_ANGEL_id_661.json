    "word": "Position No Authority to Dictate--Every branch of the work of God is to have recognition.  \"He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.\" Ephesians 4:11, 12.  This scripture shows that there are to be different workers, different instrumentalities.  Each has a different work.  No one is required to lay hold of another's work, and, though untrained, try to do it.  God has given to each according to his ability.  One man may think that his position gives him authority to dictate to other workers, but this is not so.  Ignorant of their work, he would enlarge where he should retrench, and retrench where he should enlarge, because he can see only the part of the vineyard where he is working.--Testimonies, Vol. 8, pp. 170, 171.",
