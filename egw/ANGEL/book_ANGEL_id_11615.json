    "word": "Christ did not long remain silent in the grave, for a beloved angel came and rolled back the stone and Jesus walked forth from the tomb in triumph. After His ascent to His Father He revealed Himself again to His disciples. After this those that crucified Christ were astonished to see the boldness of the disciples and to hear the excellent instruction that they gave to the people, knowing them to be ignorant men; but they had been with Jesus and had learned of Him. These lessons of the apostles are handed down to us, and when we connect with God the light given to the apostles will be imparted to us.",
