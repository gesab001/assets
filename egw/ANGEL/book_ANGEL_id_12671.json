    "word": "When we have a camp meeting, the principal speakers are not to hurry back to the cities to attend to business matters connected with various lines of our work. Now is our time to give the message to the people. Over and over again I have been shown that camp meetings and open-air meetings should be held in Los Angeles and in various parts of the community round about.

A long line of meetings should be held in many other places. Camp meetings are to be held where the people are.",
