    "word": "Sister P, I saw that you had a too high opinion of your own judgment, too much exalted. Brother Pierce has listened and looked up to you as though your judgment was unerring. Just so long as you are all so closely shut in with yourselves, your usefulness is comparatively nothing. Your linking together is too close for your own good. Said the angel, Each one strike out on your own individual responsibility as to each other, yet relying wholly upon God for victory. Look away from each other; measure not yourselves by yourselves. Jesus is the Pattern; look to Him as the Example, not to each other. Lean wholly upon God.",
