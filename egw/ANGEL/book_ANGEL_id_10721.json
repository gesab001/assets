    "word": "The times in which we live have a peculiar importance. Countries hitherto closed to the gospel are opening their doors, and are pleading for the word of God to be explained to them. Kings and princes will open their long-closed gates, inviting the heralds of the cross to enter. The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few. Can the Christian, who has the world for his field, fold his hands in idleness, and leave the sheaves ungathered? Eternity alone will reveal the results of well-directed efforts put forth now. Let every family who claims to believe the third angel's message put forth earnest, untiring efforts to proclaim the truth.",
