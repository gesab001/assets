    "word": "NOTE 7. PAGE 275.--FOR A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF IMPORTANT POINTS IN THE THIRD ANGEL'S MESSAGE OF REVELATION 14:9-12, SEE NOTE 8. THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS THE LAST WARNING THAT MEN ON PROBATION WILL EVER RECEIVE, AS IT IS FOLLOWED BY THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN TO REAP THE HARVEST OF THE EARTH,--TO \"GATHER THE WHEAT INTO HIS GARNER,\" AND TO CAST THE CLUSTERS OF THE VINE OF THE EARTH INTO THE WINEPRESS OF THE WRATH OF GOD. SEE VERSES 14-20. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT IT IS GIVEN IN SUCH STRONG, SUCH TERRIBLE LANGUAGE OF THREATENING. THE WRATH WHICH IT DENOUNCES UPON THE WORSHIPERS OF THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE IS CONTAINED IN \"THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES; FOR IN THEM IS FILLED UP THE WRATH OF GOD.\" REVELATION 15:1. COMPARE CHAP. 16:1, 2. THAT WRATH \"IS POURED OUT WITHOUT MIXTURE;\" FOR THEN JUDGMENT FALLS UPON THE INCORRIGIBLE WITHOUT MERCY, BECAUSE OUR SAVIOUR WILL THEN HAVE FINISHED HIS PRIESTLY WORK, AND HE WILL COME, NOT TO OFFER SALVATION, BUT TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON THEM THAT KNOW NOT GOD, AND THAT OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL. 2 THESSALONIANS 1:6-9. \n                                                                           501",
