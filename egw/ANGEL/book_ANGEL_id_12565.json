    "word": "MR No. 1190 - A Vision Received in Oswego, New York, January 26,1850\n\n     Last Sabbath evening the Lord gave me a view of many things, which I will now try to relate. I saw the people of God--some were dormant and stupid; they were but half awake, and did not realize the time we were living in. I saw that the man with the \"dirt brush\" had entered, and some were in danger of being swept away. I begged of Jesus to save them--to spare them a little longer and to lift them up so that they could get a sight of their situation before it should be forever too late. The angel said destruction is coming like a mighty whirlwind. I begged of the angel to pity, to save, those who were attached to their possessions and were not willing to cut loose from them and distribute them to speed the messengers on their way to feed the hungry sheep, who were dying for the want of spiritual food.",
