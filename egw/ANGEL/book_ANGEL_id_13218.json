    "word": "Either the evil angels or the angels of God are controlling the minds of men. Our minds are given to the control of God or to the control of the powers of darkness, and it will be well for us to inquire where we are standing today--whether under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel or under the black banner of the \n\n\n                -58- \n\npowers of darkness. We must make every preparation in our power in order to resist the enemy of souls. Every provision has been made; everything in God's plan has been arranged so that man should not be left to his own impulses, to his own finite powers, to carry on the warfare against the powers of darkness in his own finite strength, because he would certainly fail if he were thus left to himself I thank the Lord that we have a power provided for us.",
