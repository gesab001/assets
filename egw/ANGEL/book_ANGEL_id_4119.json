Christ is revealed as the Redeemer and Deliverer of His people. Now indeed are the remnant \"men wondered at,\" as the tears and humiliation of their pilgrimage give place to joy and honor in the presence of God and the Lamb. \"In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely. . . . And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy\" (Isaiah 4:2, 3) (Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 475, 476). \n                                                                           378",
