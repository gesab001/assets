    "word": "What are God's purposes toward you? They are to take you, poor worms of the dust, and transform you, moulding your characters after the divine similitude, and fitting you to be the companions of angels, and to hold communion with God. But you have cunningly laid plans to do injury to the cause of God, to divert the means into selfish channels, knowing all the time that these plans would bring embarrassment upon the work of God. But this is all written in the books of heaven. You have chosen another school than the school of Christ. You are bending your footsteps in the road that leads to death and hell, and this is the reason I write to you at this time.",
