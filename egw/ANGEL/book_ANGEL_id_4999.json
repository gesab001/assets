    "word": "Envy and jealousy are diseases which disorder all the faculties of the being. They originated with Satan in paradise. . . . Those who listen to his [Satan's] voice will demerit others, and will misrepresent and falsify in order to build up themselves. But nothing that defiles can enter heaven, and unless those who cherish this spirit are changed, they can never enter there, for they would criticize the angels. They would envy another's crown. They would not know what to talk of unless they could bring up the imperfections and errors of others.",
