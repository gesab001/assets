    "word": "Even if we as laborers of God go beyond that which seems to be for the good of our health and strength, we may look to Him in confidence, casting our helpless soul upon Him, and realizing that He who Himself led a self-sacrificing life of toil on this earth will acknowledge our faithfulness, and will help us marvelously. When we come to hard places, the angels of God will be right impressions upon those with whom we are associated, and to whom we are ministering.",
