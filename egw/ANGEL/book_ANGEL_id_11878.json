    "word": "Shall we not seek to arouse the sluggish sensibilities of those who know the truth, and impress upon them their duty to practice it themselves, and to teach it to those who know it not. In this work the angels of God will cooperate with them, and those who are dead in trespasses and sins will be convicted and converted. The truth will become a living, working principle in their own hearts, and as they communicate to others that which they have received, the angels of God will communicate fresh and new light to the Christlike workers. Those who wish to know the reality of Bible truth in their own experience should impart it to the poor souls who are in the darkness of error.",
