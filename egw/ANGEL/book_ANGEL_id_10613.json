    "word": "The representation given me of the Berrien Springs meeting is similar to the picture presented in the third chapter of Zechariah. \"He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist \n                                                                           28\nhim.\" Compare this picture with the experience at Berrien Springs, where so many words were spoken in vindication of self and in condemnation of others.",
