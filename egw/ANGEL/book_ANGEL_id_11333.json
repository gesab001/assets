    "word": "In one of his precious lessons to his disciples, our Saviour described God's care for his creatures in these words: \"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\" He who stoops to notice even the little birds, has a special care for all branches of his work. All who are employed in the Sanitarium, be their position high or low, are under the eye of the infinite God. He sees whether their duties are performed with strict, integrity, or in a careless dishonest manner. Angels are walking unseen through every room of that institution. Angels are constantly ascending to Heaven, bearing up the record with joy or sadness. Every act of fidelity is registered; every act of dishonestly also is recorded; and every person is finally to be rewarded as his works have been. \n                                                                           44",
