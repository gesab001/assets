    "word": "MR No. 294 - Miscellaneous Manuscript Items\n\n     There is a work to be done in the places where the truth has never been proclaimed. In order to do this work, you need greater than human help. The Lord can take a worm to thrash a mountain. It is close communion with God that qualifies His messengers to subdue the opposition of the enemy. God calls for consecrated workers, who will be true to Him--humble men, who see the need of evangelistic work, and do not draw back, but do each day's work faithfully, relying upon God for help and strength.--Letter 43, 1905, p. 3. (To \"Dear Brethren and Sisters,\" January 29, 1905.)",
