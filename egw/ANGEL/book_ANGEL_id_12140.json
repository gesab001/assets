PRESCOTT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF BATTLE CREEK COLLEGE, WHO HAD FROM 1903 TO 1909 SERVED AS EDITOR OF THE REVIEW AND HERALD, AND WAS IN 1910 CARRYING LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES, AND A.G. DANIELLS, PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE, HAVING ESPOUSED THE SO- CALLED \"NEW VIEW\" OF THE IDENTITY OF THE \"DAILY\" OF DANIEL 8:13 (SEE SDA ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE, \"DAILY\"), WERE DRAWN INTO HEATED DISCUSSIONS WITH ADVOCATES OF THE \"OLD VIEW\" EXPOUNDED BY URIAH SMITH IN HIS MUCH-USED AND FRUITFUL BOOK THOUGHTS ON DANIEL AND THE REVELATION. THIS LED TO TWO PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING DEVELOPMENTS AS ELLEN WHITE SAW IT. FIRST WAS THAT WITH FORCES ENGAGED IN DIVISIVE CONTROVERSY, EVANGELISM, AND PARTICULARLY CITY EVANGELISM, WAS SERIOUSLY NEGLECTED. SECOND, THERE WAS TALK OF THE POSSIBLE REVISION OF BOOKS IN WHICH THE OLD VIEW WAS ADVOCATED, PARTICULARLY THE WIDELY SOLD THOUGHTS ON DANIEL AND THE REVELATION.",
