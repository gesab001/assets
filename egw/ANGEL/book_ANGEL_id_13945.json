Hill St., Los Angeles, Calif. \n\nDear Brethren: \n     I was very glad to receive your letter telling of your experience in Los Angeles. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and praise His holy name. This is a good work, and one which the Lord would have go forward in every conference. I am more thankful than I can express that Elder Reaser is coming out of the perilous darkness into the light.",
