    "word": "The time has come when we must expect the Lord to do great things for us. Our efforts must not flag or weaken. We are to grow in grace and in a knowledge of the Lord. Before the work is closed up and the sealing of God's people is finished, we shall have the out-pouring of the Spirit of God. Angels from heaven will be in our midst. . . . The present is the fitting up time for heaven, when we each must walk in full obedience to all the commandments of God. Letter 30, 1907, pp. 2, 3. (To Mr. N. D. Faulkhead, February 5, 1907.)",
