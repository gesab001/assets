    "word": "Christ's Grace Changes the Whole Man.--The apostle exhorts us, \"As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.\" The grace of Christ changes the whole man, making the coarse refined, the rough gentle, the selfish generous. It controls the temper and the voice. Its outworking is seen in politeness and tender regard shown by brother for brother, in kind, encouraging words and unselfish actions. An angel-presence, is in the home. The life breathes forth a sweet perfume, which as holy incense ascends to God.",
