    "word": "Oh, how Jesus is grieved with the unbelief, the distrust, the want of gratitude and the sinfulness of those who profess to be the advocates of the law of God! Will not this people understand [that through] their own course of worldliness, of selfishness, [they] have forfeited the mercies promised to the obedient? In view of the great benefits of the salvation brought to us through Jesus Christ, the whole heavenly host in the plains of Bethlehem broke forth into songs of praise, saying, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will toward men\" (Luke 2:14). Why is there not more praise and less complaining? Should not our hearts be filled with gratitude to God? If angels saw cause for anthems of praise, why should not the objects Christ came to save be filled with thankfulness? There \"are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\"",
