    "word": "God has His faithful witnesses, through whom He has given testimony to revive, to restore, to build up His people in the most holy faith. He has faithful sentinels who will warn the church against false theories and doctrines which would corrupt their faith, and would bring into the church distraction, discord, and strife. In every age the Lord has raised up watchmen to bear a faithful testimony to the generation in which they live. These faithful sentinels carried forward the work, and impressed upon others the necessity of consecrating all to God, and when they were called upon to lay off their armor and leave the work, there were other hands to carry it forward. Faithful souls have constituted the church of God on earth, and He has taken them into covenant relation with Himself, uniting His church on earth with His church in heaven. He has sent forth heavenly angels to minister to His church, and the gates of hell have not been able to prevail against His people.",
