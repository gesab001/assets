    "word": "Our medical missionary work in Los Angeles should be in a far more favorable position than it is. The Lord designs that much more shall be done in this city than has been done there. But I cannot speak freely about this at present; for fear that men will take advantage of what I say, and will endeavor, by my words, to vindicate wrong plans. Some of the brethren in Los Angeles have at times lacked spiritual discernment. They have not always been able to see what could be done by proper effort on their part. A large work has been done in some lines, but the methods followed have not been such as to bring glory to God in the saving of souls.",
