    "word": "In the night seasons messages have been given to me to give to you in Battle Creek, and to all our schools. While it is in the order of God that physical powers shall be trained as well as the mental, yet the physical exercises should in character be in complete harmony with the lessons given to the world and should be seen in the lives of Christians, so that in education and self-training the heavenly intelligences should not record in the books that students and the teachers in our schools are \"Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.\" This is the record now being made of a large number, -- \"Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.\" Thus Satan and his angels are laying their snares for your souls, and he is working in a certain way upon teachers and pupils to induce them to engage in certain exercises and amusements which become intensely absorbing, but which are of a character to strengthen the lower powers, and create appetites and passions that will take the lead and counteract most decidedly the \n\n\n                                 -70- \n\noperations and working of the Holy Spirit of God upon the human heart.",
