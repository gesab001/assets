    "word": "In times of discouragement, there are evil angels by our side. But angels of heaven are also with us, and as soon as we strike a note of praise to God, His angels shed their light about us, and the evil \n\n\n             -304- \n\nangels are driven back. Then we find our discouragement giving way to a feeling of hope and courage in the Lord. Shall we not, instead of fretting and complaining, use our voice to praise God? Then we shall see more of His salvation, and He will let His rich blessing rest upon us.-- Ms. 47, 1908.",
