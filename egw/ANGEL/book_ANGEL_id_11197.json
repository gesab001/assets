    "word": "Humble Men Laboring in Simplicity \n\n     There are men who will spend and be spent to win souls to Christ. In obedience to the great commission, many will go forth to work for the Master. Under the ministration of angels, common men will be moved by the Spirit of God to warn people in the highways and byways. They are to be strengthened and encouraged, and as fast as possible prepared for labor, that success may crown their efforts. . . .",
