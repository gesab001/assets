    "word": "Nothing but the truth of God can either make man savingly wise or keep him so. If there is an immortal life to be obtained; if a pure and holy character must be developed in order to gain entrance to the presence of the Lord and the society of the heavenly angels, then why do not teachers, physicians, and preachers act this in their example and by their teaching? Why are they not more zealous for the Master? Why do they not have more burning love for the souls for whom Christ died? If man is earnestly seeking for glory, honor, and immortality, his mind must naturally come into harmony with God's mind. The true disciple in the school of Christ, whose mind is in harmony with the mind of God, will be not only constantly learning, but also teaching, --constantly reflecting light, teaching upward and away from the common prevailing errors of this perverse and adulterous generation. Physicians, teachers, superintendents,--any one in office, and any helper, who shall neglect his solemn obligation in this matter, and persist in following selfish plans and ideas in precept and example, is a false guide,--a sign-board pointing in the wrong direction. \n     1888. \n                                                                           46",
