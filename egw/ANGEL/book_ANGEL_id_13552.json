    "word": "During the week of prayer we held meetings in a tent at North Fitzroy. Sabbath afternoon, December 31, I spoke with great freedom from Acts 10, dwelling especially upon the angel's message to Cornelius, \"He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius; and when he looked on him, he was afraid and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.\" The Lord gave me His Holy Spirit in large measure. The tent was full; some not of our faith were present who were attracted by the tent. We had a most precious meeting.",
