    "word": "After these seven thunders uttered their voices, the instruction comes to John as to Daniel in regard to the little book: \"Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered.\" These relate to future events which will be disclosed in their order. Daniel shall stand in his lot at the end of the days. John sees the little book unsealed. Then Daniel's prophecies have their proper place in the first, second, and third angels' messages to be given to the world. The unsealing of the little book was the message in relation to time.",
