    "word": "Christ was taken up into heaven in a cloud composed of living angels. The angels declared to the men of Galilee, \"Why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" This is the great event to be contemplated and talked of. The declaration of the angels was that He should come in the same manner as He went up into heaven.",
