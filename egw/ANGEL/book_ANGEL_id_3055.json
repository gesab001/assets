    "word": "NOTE 8. PAGE 435.\u2014REVELATION 14:6, 7, FORETELLS THE PROCLAMATION OF THE FIRST ANGEL'S MESSAGE. THEN THE PROPHET CONTINUES: \u201cTHERE FOLLOWED ANOTHER ANGEL, SAYING, BABYLON IS FALLEN, IS FALLEN, . . . AND THE THIRD ANGEL FOLLOWED THEM.\u201d THE WORD HERE RENDERED \u201cFOLLOWED,\u201d MEANS, IN CONSTRUCTIONS LIKE THAT IN THIS TEXT, \u201cTO GO WITH.\u201d LIDDELL AND SCOTT RENDER THE WORD THUS: \u201cTO FOLLOW ONE, GO AFTER OR WITH HIM.\u201d ROBINSON SAYS: \u201dTO FOLLOW, TO GO WITH, TO ACCOMPANY ANYONE.\u201d IT IS THE SAME WORD THAT IS USED IN MARK 5:24: \u201cAND JESUS WENT WITH HIM; AND MUCH PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM, AND THRONGED HIM.\u201d IT IS ALSO USED OF THE REDEEMED ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR THOUSAND, WHERE IT IS SAID: \u201cTHESE ARE THEY WHICH FOLLOW THE LAMB WHITHERSOEVER HE GOETH.\u201d REVELATION 14:4. IN BOTH THESE PLACES IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE IDEA INTENDED TO BE CONVEYED IS THAT OF GOING TOGETHER, IN COMPANY WITH. SO IN 1 CORINTHIANS 10:4, WHERE WE READ OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THAT \u201cTHEY DRANK OF THAT SPIRITUAL ROCK THAT FOLLOWED THEM,\u201d THE WORD \u201cFOLLOWED\u201d IS TRANSLATED FROM THE SAME GREEK WORD, AND THE MARGIN HAS IT, \u201cWENT WITH THEM.\u201d FROM THIS WE LEARN THAT THE IDEA IN REVELATION 14:8, 9, IS NOT SIMPLY THAT THE SECOND AND THIRD ANGELS FOLLOWED THE FIRST IN POINT OF TIME, BUT THAT THEY WENT WITH IT. THE THREE MESSAGES ARE BUT ONE THREEFOLD MESSAGE. THEY ARE THREE ONLY IN THE ORDER OF THEIR RISE. BUT HAVING RISEN, THEY GO ON TOGETHER, AND ARE INSEPARABLE.",
