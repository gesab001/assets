    "word": "The Lord is coming, and we must be ready! Every moment I want His grace\u2014I want the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness. We must humble our souls before God as never before, come low to the foot of the cross, and He will put a word in our mouths to speak for Him, even praise unto our God. He will teach us a strain from the song of the angels, even thanksgiving to our heavenly Father. We can do nothing of ourselves, but God wants to touch our lips with a living coal from off the altar. He wants to sanctify our tongues\u2014to sanctify our whole being.",
