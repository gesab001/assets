    "word": "A Balanced Program.--You feel a deep interest in the circulation of the health publications, and this is right; but that special branch is not to be made all-absorbing. The health reform is as closely related to the third angel's message as the arm to the body; but the arm cannot take the place of the body. The proclamation of the third angel's message, the  commandments of God, and the testimony of Jesus is the great burden of our work. The message is to be proclaimed with a loud cry, and is to go to the whole world. The presentation of health principles must be united with this message, but must not in any case be independent of it, or in any way take the place of it.--Letter 57, 1896.",
