    "word": "We are in danger of giving the Third Angel's Message in so indefinite a manner that it does not impress the people. So many other interests are brought in that the very message which should be proclaimed with power becomes tame and voiceless. At our camp-meeting a mistake has been made. The Sabbath question has been touched upon, but has not been presented as the great test for this time. While the churches profess to believe in Christ, they are violating the law which Christ Himself proclaimed from Sinai. The Lord bids us, \"Show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\" The trumpet is to give a certain sound.",
