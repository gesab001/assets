    "word": "Every child may gain knowledge, as Jesus did, from the works of nature and the pages of God's Holy Word. As we try to become acquainted with our heavenly Father through His Holy Word, angels will come near, our minds will be strengthened, our character will be \n106\nelevated and refined, and we shall become more like our Saviour. And as we behold the beauty and grandeur of the works of nature, our affections go out after God; while the heart is awed and the spirit subdued, the soul is invigorated by coming in contact with the Infinite through His marvelous works. Communion with God through humble prayer, develops and strengthens the mental and moral faculties, and spiritual powers increase by cultivating thoughts upon spiritual things.",
