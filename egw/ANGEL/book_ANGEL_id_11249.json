    "word": "Let us study the eighteenth chapter of Matthew. This chapter should enlighten our eyes. \"Take heed,\" says Christ, \"that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always \n\n\n                    -6- \n\nbehold the face of my Father which is in heaven. For the Son of Man is come to save that which was lost. How think ye? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety nine which went not astray. Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.\"",
