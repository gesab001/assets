    "word": "Ella May White, Grandma would be very much pleased could she see you this morning. I was very sorry to hear that you fell down the stairs. Was it the long back stairs or the short stairs? I think one of the good angels of the Lord was close by you to prevent your falling and breaking your limbs or killing you. These good angels are watching over you, else you might get into many difficulties.",
