    "word": "Daniel was a man to whom God had given great skill and learning, and when he fasted the angel came to him and said, \"Thou art greatly beloved.\" And he fell prostrate before the angel. He did not say, \"Lord, I have been very faithful to You and I have done everything to honor You and defend Your word and name. Lord, You \n                                                                           354\nknow how faithful I was at the king's table, and how I maintained my integrity when they cast me into the den of lions.\" Was that the way Daniel prayed to God?",
