    "word": "The friends of the truth will honor Him who is the Author and Finisher of their faith. Christ will prove Himself a physician in restoring the body as well as the soul. The workers together with God will yoke up with Christ, and place themselves, soul, body, and spirit, in right relation to God. Individuals and households will reveal the character of their faith by their dress, by their purity of speech, by their diligence in educating themselves and their children to be clean in the house, allowing no impurity in the home, no uncleanness on the premises, lest the Lord pass by and see their uncleanness. The Lord would have all things sweet about the home, that angels of God from the heavenly courts may be welcome guests, and not kept away by dirt and uncleanness.",
