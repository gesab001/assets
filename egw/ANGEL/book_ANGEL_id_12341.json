    "word": "MR No. 1030 - A Challenge to Consecrate, Decentralize, and Evangelize\n\n     Elder Daniells has written to me in regard to moving some old wooden building, which is now standing beside a brick building, and through which there might be danger of fire. He has also written in regard to putting up a new building in the place of the old building. He says that this will not cost more than $4,000. The removal of the old building may be necessary, but I could not advise the erection of another building, even though it costs only $4,000.",
