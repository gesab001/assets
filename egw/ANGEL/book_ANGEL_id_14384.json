    "word": "I was instructed to say to Brethren Magan and Sutherland, Do not lose your hold on God. The Lord has witnessed to the good work done by you at Berrien Springs, because you tried to follow out the instruction given you. The stand you took in Carroll House, Takoma Park, was witnessed by the angels of God. Your confessions covered the things that were brought to your mind, and the Lord blessed you. Since that time I have had increased confidence in you, and I want to say to you, \"My brethren, do not fail or be discouraged. I have confidence in you both, and I feel sure that the Lord will bless your efforts.\"",
