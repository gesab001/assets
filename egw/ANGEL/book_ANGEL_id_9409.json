    "word": "A great work is to be done. The truth is to be proclaimed with clear enunciation. We are to work in the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, walking humbly before God. We must send messengers throughout all the unworked fields, and the Lord will impress hearts. The first and second angels' messages went with the power of the Spirit, and those who in their proclamation walked and worked in humility were greatly blessed. Let us all wake up, and with great energy take hold of the work to be done.--Letter 88, Sept. 30, 1910, to Elder A. G. Daniells, president of the General Conference.",
