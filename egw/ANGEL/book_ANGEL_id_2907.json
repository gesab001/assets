    "word": "In Revelation 14, the first angel is followed by a second, proclaiming, \u201cBabylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, \n381\nbecause she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\u201d [Revelation 14:8.] The term Babylon is derived from Babel, and signifies confusion. It is employed in Scripture to designate the various forms of false or apostate religion. In Revelation 17, Babylon is represented as a woman, a figure which is used in the Bible as the symbol of a church, a virtuous woman representing a pure church, a vile woman an apostate church.",
