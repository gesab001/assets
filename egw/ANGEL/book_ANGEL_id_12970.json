    "word": "True believers are the light of the church and of the world. God has true messengers of healing in our world. They are those who are taught of God, who are imbued with His Spirit, ministers who experience the sanctification of the Spirit. Sons and daughters of God have a great work to do in the world. They are to be its light. They are to accept the Word of God as the man of their counsel, and impart it to others. They are to diffuse light. All who have received the engrafted Word will be faithful in giving that Word to others. They will speak the words of Christ. In conversation and in deportment they will give evidence of a daily conversion to the principles of truth. Such believers will be a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men, and God will be glorified in them.",
