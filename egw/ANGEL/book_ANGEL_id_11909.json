    "word": "Importance of Home School During Child's First Ten Years: \n     I am unable to sleep after half past twelve o'clock. In the night season I was presenting before the parents of the Los Angeles church a message given me by the Lord in regard to their sinful neglect to train their children from their very infancy to form characters that will meet the approval of God. Parents should regard nothing as of sufficient consequence to take the place of their work for their children.",
