    "word": "We are to have the truth planted in the heart, and teach it to others as it is in Jesus. The world is in a very solemn period; for souls are deciding what will be their eternal destiny.

The darkness which is covering the earth is deepening, but those who walk humbly with God have nothing to fear.",
