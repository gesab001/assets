    "word": "Attitude Teachers Should Manifest. \n\n     Teachers should work circumspectly. Those who are often with God in prayer, have holy angels by their side. The atmosphere that surrounds their souls is pure and holy; for their whole soul is imbued with the sanctifying influence of the Spirit of God. They should be learners every day in the school of Christ, that they may be teachers under the Great Teacher. They must learn of Christ, and become one with him in the work of training minds, before they can be efficient teachers in the higher education--the knowledge of God.",
