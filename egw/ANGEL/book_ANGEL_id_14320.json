    "word": "There are students who are suspended from school. They are in this action thrust upon Satan's battle-ground to cope with principalities and powers without armor or defense, to become an easy prey to Satan's devices. Let me speak a word to you in the name of the Lord. When there is a proper course taken, in cases where students seem so easily led astray, there will be found no necessity for suspension or expulsion. There is a right way, and the Spirit of the Lord must move the human agent or else there will be grave mistakes made. It is the nicest work that was ever entered upon by the human agent, the dealing with human minds. Teachers are to consider that they are not dealing with angels, but with human beings who have like passions as they themselves have. Characters are not formed in one mold. Every phase of character is received by (different) children as an inheritance. The defects and the virtues in traits of character are thus revealed. Let every instructor take this into consideration. Hereditary and cultivated deformity of human character, as also beauty of character, will have to be met, and much grace cultivated in the instructor as to know how to deal with the erring for their present and eternal good. Impulse, impatience, pride, selfishness, and esteem, if cherished will do a great amount of evil which may thrust \n\n\n                                -144- \n\nthe soul upon Satan's battle-ground without the wisdom to navigate his bark, but he will be in danger of being tossed about at the sport of Satan's temptations until shipwrecked.",
