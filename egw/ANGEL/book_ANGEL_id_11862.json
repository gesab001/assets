    "word": "The object of our meeting Wednesday night was to pray for Brother Hull, he being present. I had been very sick for above a week, threatened with fever, but I went to the meeting. In that meeting I was taken off in vision and shown many things. And the case of Brother Hull was shown me--that he had been mesmerized, charmed by a special agent of Satan. Already had Satan, I saw, claimed him as his prey. Already had evil angels telegraphed to Satan's agents upon earth that Brother Hull would soon leave the Seventh-day Adventists and join their ranks, and the spiritualist medium with whom he discussed must be all gentleness, and charm him and fascinate him. He was almost continually in the company of this spiritualist medium and Satan exulted at the conquest he had made.",
