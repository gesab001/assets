    "word": "The mind of God can be learned only from His Word. The Lord has sent His angels to guard those who are willing to be led in the ways of truth. He bids you take heed to your ways. There are souls living on the island who are daily receiving blessings from God, yet who do not as much as look heavenward and say, \"I thank Thee, Lord, for all the mercies I receive.\" All the love that God expresses for them, in sparing their lives, and in providing them with food and clothing, does not waken in them one grateful response. The precious word of truth is not stamped upon the soul. \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\" (Romans 10:10).",
