    "word": "In the last great day we shall be judged in accordance with what we have done. Christ will say, \"I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?\" (Matthew 25:42-44). Christ will then say, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me\" (verse 45). And Christ will say, \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels\" (verse 41).",
