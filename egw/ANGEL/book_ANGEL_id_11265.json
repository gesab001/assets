    "word": "The Distribution of Literature. \n\n     In the miracle of feeding the multitude with a few loaves and fishes, the food was increased as it passed from Christ to those who accepted it. Thus it will be in the distribution of our publications. God's truth, as it is passed out, will multiply greatly. And as the disciples by Christ's direction gathered up the fragments which remained, that nothing should be lost, so we should treasure every fragment of literature containing the truth for this time. None can estimate the influence that even a torn page, containing the truths of the third angel's message, may have upon the heart of some seeker after truth.",
