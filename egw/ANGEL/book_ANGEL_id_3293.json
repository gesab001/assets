    "word": "WE WILL KNOW ONE ANOTHER.\u2014God\u2019s greatest gift is Christ, whose life is ours, given for us. He died for us, and was raised for us, that we might come forth from the tomb to a glorious companionship with heavenly angels, to meet our loved ones and to recognize their faces, for the Christlikeness does not destroy their image, but transforms it into His glorious image. Every saint connected in family relationship here will know each other there.\u2014Letter 79, 1898 quoted in 3SM 316.",
