    "word": "Joseph was greatly afflicted to be separated from his father, and his bitterest sorrow was in reflecting upon his father's grief. But God did not leave Joseph to go into Egypt alone. Angels prepared the way for his reception. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, bought him of the Ishmaelites. And the Lord was with Joseph, and he prospered him, and gave him favor with his master, so that all that he possessed he intrusted to Joseph's care. \"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat.\" It was considered an abomination for a Hebrew to prepare food for an Egyptian.",
