    "word": "Had those who claim to believe the truth for these last days done as Daniel did, had they been determined to walk in all the light God caused to shine upon them, the great difficulties which have existed in Battle Creek would not have been. The great dearth of means would not have been. Had those who crowded into Battle Creek gone out and taken up evangelistic work, first for themselves, as did Daniel and his fellows, and then for others, the Lord would have given them wisdom and skill and understanding. But the light given was not lived out. The testimonies sent by the Lord in regard to health reform were made the subject of criticism. They were misused and abused by those who were determined to vindicate their own ideas and carry out their own plans.",
