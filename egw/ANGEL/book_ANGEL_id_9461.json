    "word": "\"Thy will be done in earth, as it is \n in heaven.\" Matthew 6:10. \n\n\n     The will of God is expressed in the precepts of His holy law, and the principles of this law are the principles of heaven. The angels of heaven attain unto no higher knowledge than to know the will of God, and to do His will is the highest service that can engage their powers.",
