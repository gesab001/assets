    "word": "11 (chs. 7:1-3; 16:13-16; 1:14; see EGW on Hebrews 9:24). Angel Hands Linked About the World.--John writes, \"I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne.\" Angels were united in the work of Him who had broken the seals and taken the book. Four mighty angels hold back the powers of this earth till the servants of God are sealed in their foreheads. The nations of the world are eager for conflict; but they are held in check by the angels. When this restraining power is removed, there will come a time of trouble and anguish. Deadly instruments of warfare will be invented. Vessels, with their living cargo, will be entombed in the great deep. All who have not the spirit of truth will unite under the leadership of satanic agencies. But they are to be kept under control till the time shall come for the great battle of Armageddon.",
