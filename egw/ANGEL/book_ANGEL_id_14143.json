I am most grateful to the Lord for making it possible for us to secure this property. It lies sixty miles east of Los Angeles, on the main line of the Southern Pacific Railway. It's name, Loma Linda, - Beautiful Hill - describes the place. Of the seventy-six acres comprised in the property, about thirty-four form a beautiful hill, which rises one hundred and twenty-five feet above the valley. Upon this hill the sanitarium building is situated.",
