    "word": "The earth was in a most desolate condition. Cities and villages, shaken down by the earthquake, lay in heaps. Mountains were moved out of their places, leaving large caverns. The sea had thrown out ragged rocks upon the earth, and rocks had been torn out of the earth, and were scattered all over its surface. The earth looked like a desolate wilderness. Large trees \n                                                                           212\nwere rooted up, and were strewn over the land. Here is Satan's home, with his evil angels, through the 1000 years. Here they will be confined, and wander up and down over the broken surface of the earth, and see the effects of his rebellion against God's law. The effects of the curse which he has caused, he can enjoy through the 1000 years. Limited alone to the earth, he will have no privilege of ranging around to other planets, to tempt and annoy those who have not fallen. Satan suffers in this time extremely. Since his fall his evil traits have been in constant exercise. He is then deprived of his power, and left to reflect upon the part he has acted since his fall, and to look forward with trembling and terror to the dreadful future, when he must suffer for all the evil he has done, and be punished for all the sins he has caused to be committed.",
