    "word": "O that all could behold our precious Saviour as He is, a Saviour. Let His hand draw aside the veil which conceals His glory from our eyes. It shows Him in His high and holy place. What do we see? Our Saviour, not in a position of silence and inactivity. He is surrounded with heavenly intelligences, cherubims and seraphims, ten thousand times ten thousand of angels. All these heavenly beings have one object above all others, in which they are intensely interested,--His church in a world of corruption.--Letter 89c, 1897.",
