    "word": "In the Lord's Prayer we have an example of a perfect petition. How simple, yet how comprehensive it is! This prayer should be taught to the children. Let all study carefully the principles contained in it. In response to the prayers of God's people, angels are sent with heavenly blessings. . . . Through daily prayer and consecration all may so relate themselves to their heavenly Father that He can bestow upon them rich blessings. . . .",
