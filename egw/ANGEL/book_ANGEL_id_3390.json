    "word": "Preparation for Loud Cry. \n     132. We as a people must make an advance move in this great work. Ministers and people must act in concert. God's people are not prepared for the loud cry of the third angel; they have a work to do for themselves which they should not leave for God to do for them. It is an individual work; one cannot do it for another.--T., V. I, p. 486. \n                                                                           37",
