    "word": "Now, my brother, I think it would be better if you did not put before the people so distinctly that you are an American and a missionary. I do not think it wise to present the sayings of men in reference to our own capabilities. Let nothing appear before angels or men savoring of self-exaltation, elevating yourself, that you are a smart man or a great man, and quote not the praises of men. But just go to work in the fear of God. Make no great spread, but keep self out of sight and let Jesus appear, and commence in a humble manner. It is not best to arouse in this country, and in such a place as Geneva, the special attention of the clergy. If you enter large halls and then have to come down to the smaller buildings, it will not have the best influence. It would be best to take the lowly seat and then come up higher.--Letter 24, 1885, pp. 1, 2. (To Daniel T. Bourdeau, November 23, 1885.)",
