    "word": "We have had a long, rather hard time getting home. We left Brother Daniells at 9 o'clock. He gave us the directions how to go, but we were lost. As we advanced, the road was impassable, so we decided to take the directions given us to go through Pope Valley, which brought us on Mountain ascent. It took us till night to cross the mountains, bringing us into Pope Valley after dark. The moon was shrouded in clouds, and we were apparently lost on the mountains, for there was not one signboard anywhere to show us our way. A man, Major Selwell, holding the office of postmaster in Montecello, appeared, going the same way as ourselves to Pope Valley. He took Sister Lockwood into his carriage, and we drove on. In many places it was very dangerous. This man seemed to us as an angel of God. He guided us and found a place for us to stay overnight at a farmhouse.",
