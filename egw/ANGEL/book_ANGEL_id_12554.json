    "word": "And God said concerning the king of Assyria, \"He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it. By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord. For I will defend this city, to save it for Mine own sake, for My servant David's sake. Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred four score and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses\" [verses 33-36].",
