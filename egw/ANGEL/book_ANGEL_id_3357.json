    "word": "A LITTLE LONGER.\u2014Christ is coming with clouds and with great glory. A multitude of shining angels will attend Him. He will come to raise the dead, and to change the living saints from glory to glory. He will come to honor those who have loved Him, and kept His commandments, and to take them to Himself. He has not forgotten them nor His promise. There will be a relinking of the family chain. When we look upon our dead, we may think of the morning when the trump of God shall sound, when \u201cthe dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:52.",
