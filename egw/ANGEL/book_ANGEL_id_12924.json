    "word": "Not long ago a building at Glendale, eight miles from Los Angeles, was purchased and fitted up for sanitarium work. Originally this building was an expensive one, costing the owners about forty thousand dollars. There are seventy-five rooms, many of which are arranged in suites, a small one for a bedroom and a larger one for a sitting room. There were two bathrooms on each floor, but they were not such as would be needed in giving treatments, and new treatment rooms have been added.",
