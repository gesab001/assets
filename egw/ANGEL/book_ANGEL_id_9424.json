    "word": "He hath purchased you with His own blood and, when you need His help, call upon Him and you will have it. It is then Jesus will stand up for you. Let your short, uncertain life be a continual preparation for the future immortal life. Temptation is allowed to come upon us to discover the character we possess and to improve our defects. There are continual solicitations to sin, which are disguised to deceive and allure the soul to ruin. Satan will transform himself into an angel of light and he is constantly plotting to rob God of His glory in the destruction of souls. . . . Hang your helpless soul on God. Follow the light given you of heaven.--Letter 42, Nov. 21, 1879, to Edson White.",
