    "word": "\"The road to Paradise is not one of self-exaltation but of repentance, confession, humiliation, of faith and obedience. The message to the Laodicean church is appropriate to the church at this time: \"And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write: These things saith the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the beginning of the creation of God: I know thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked; I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent.\" There are many who are priding themselves upon their spiritual riches, their knowledge of the truth, and are living in guilty self-deception. When the members of the church humble themselves before God by zealous, not half-hearted, lifeless action, the Lord will receive them. But he declares, \"I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy candlestick out of its place except thou repent.\" How long shall this warning be resisted? How long shall it be slighted?",
