    "word": "\"Now as to the question involved. Would there be danger, first, in securing a charter for the school that would open the way for the Loma Linda students to secure this advantage in worldly schools of completing their course, and becoming accredited physicians? Would such a plan lead away from the purpose of the school -- to qualify large numbers with the ability of physicians to labor as evangelists? The brethren generally seem to feel that it would be out of the question for us to think of equipping the Loma Linda College with facilities for giving a full medical course to qualify students to receive recognition by the State. Hence the suggestion of this compromise plan, which would keep the students under right influences for three years, while becoming well grounded in Bible study along with their scientific preparation. Then it is thought that if only the most capable were encouraged to go on and complete the full course as accredited physicians, and all others were encouraged to enter the work as evangelists, all might work out satisfactorily.",
