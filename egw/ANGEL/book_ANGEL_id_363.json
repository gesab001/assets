    "word": "Divinity flashed through humanity, and Satan was peremptorily repulsed. \u201cGet thee hence, Satan,\u201d Christ said. . . . It was enough. Satan could go no further. Angels ministered to the Saviour. Angels brought Him food. The severity of this conflict no human mind can compass. The welfare of the whole human family and of Christ Himself was at stake. One admission from Christ, one word of concession, and the world would be claimed by Satan as his; and he, the prince of the power of darkness would, he supposed, commence his rule. There appeared unto Christ an angel from heaven, for the conflict ended. Human power was ready to fail. But all heaven sang the song of eternal victory.\u2014Letter 116, 1899 (Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 94, 95).",
