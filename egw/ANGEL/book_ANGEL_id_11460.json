    "word": "Third Angel's Message Being Blanketed--1899 \n\n\n     The light came to me clear and distinct that the medical missionary work was absorbing too much, while a more definite work in special lines was being neglected, that you were gathering into your arms a class of work that is never ending, which was eclipsing the work that needs to be done in every city,--the proclamation of the soon coming of Christ. The third angel's message was being blanketed. Letter 55, 1899, pp. 2, 3. (To Dr. J. H. Kellogg, March 24, 1899.) \n\nWhite Estate Washington, D. C. September 10, 1944",
