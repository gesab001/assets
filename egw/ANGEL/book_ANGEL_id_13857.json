Sept. 9, 1905.) \n\n\n     We are so thankful that God has opened the way for us to secure such favorable locations for our institutions in Southern California. He brought first to our notice the buildings now occupied by the Fernando School. When some one wrote and told me of the buildings that were offered for sale at such reasonable prices, I replied, \"Lose no time in securing the property.\" The instruction given was obeyed and for two or three years a school has been conducted there. God calls upon you to take a greater interest in this school than you have in the past.",
