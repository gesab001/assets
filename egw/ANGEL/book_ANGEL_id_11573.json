    "word": "I understand that Elder Daniells has been chosen as president of the General Conference and Elder Irwin vice-president. This arrangement seems to be satisfactory to all. [IN THE PARAGRAPHS DELETED MRS. WHITE DISCUSSES EVANGELISTIC WORK IN THE LARGE CITIES.] . . . Elder Daniells has had a hard and trying place for many months, and besides, it is of no use to place the burden of the work of the presidency on one man. The light given me is that no less than three men should be united in this work. One man should not try to do all the work.--Letter 137, 1905, pp. 1, 2. (To Mrs. G. A. Irwin, May 18, 1905.)",
