Satan with all his agencies is working to hold God\u2019s people back from giving all their powers to His service. But as a people we are to be active and decidedly in earnest, improving every opportunity to increase our usefulness in religious lines. We are to be \u201cnot slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\u201d Possessing true godliness and knowledge of the Word of God, every church member may become a working agency, laboring with\n55\ndignity and confidence, yet with humble dependence, remembering the words of Christ to His first disciples, \u201cI send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\u201d We need to exercise wisdom in all our ways if we would work in the name and fear of God. Unfeigned faith is what we need, for faith is \u201cthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d",
