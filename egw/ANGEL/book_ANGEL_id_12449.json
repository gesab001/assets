    "word": "Brother Burden writes that since rain has fallen in such abundance in Los Angeles County, the property for which they paid $12,500 dollars could not be purchased for $20,000. Property has gone up one-third higher than it was before the rain came. We are so glad that our brethren were able to purchase the Glendale Sanitarium for so low a price. It is an imposing building, and is situated in a very pleasant location.",
