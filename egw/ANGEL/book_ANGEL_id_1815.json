When the plagues begin to fall, those who continue to break the holy Sabbath will not open their mouths to plead those excuses that they now make \n                                                                           66\nto get rid of keeping it. Their mouths will be closed while the plagues are falling, and the great Lawgiver is requiring justice of those who have had His holy law in derision and have called it \"a curse to man,\" \"miserable,\" and \"rickety.\" When such feel the iron grasp of this law taking hold of them, these expressions will appear before them in living characters, and they will then realize the sin of having that law in derision which the Word of God calls \"holy, just, and good.\"",
