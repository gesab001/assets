    "word": "\"Escape for Thy Life\" \n\n     The same angel who visited Sodom is sounding the note of warning, \"Escape for thy life.\" The bottles of God's wrath cannot be poured out to destroy the wicked and their works until all the people of God have been judged, and the cases of the living as well as the dead are decided. And even after the saints are sealed with the seal of the living God, His elect will have trials individually. Personal afflictions will come; but the furnace is closely watched by an eye that will not suffer the gold to be consumed. The indelible mark of God is upon them. God can plead that His own name is written there. The Lord has shut them in. Their destination is inscribed--\"God, New Jerusalem.\" They are God's property, His possession.",
