    "word": "As you go to Dora Creek my prayers shall follow you. This is an important mission and angels of God will accompany you. We are to watch and pray and believe and trust in God and look to Him every moment. . . . The Lord would have you pray and receive answers to prayer and have perfect faith in Jesus Christ. No really good thing will be withheld from them that walk uprightly. Believe in the bare Word of God and go not to worldly wise men for wisdom, for they receive not that wisdom which cometh from above.--Letter 154, 1894, p. 1. (To \"Brethren,\" November 5, 1894.)",
