    "word": "(Luke 13:24-30.) Fate of the Halfhearted Ones.--There are those who, though professedly serving God, are witnessing against Him. To them the message to the Laodicean church is given. Christ says to them, \"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.\" When the avenging angel shall pass through the land, Christ cannot say of them, \"Touch them not. I have graven them upon the palms of my hands.\" No; of these halfhearted ones He says, \"I will spew them out of my mouth. They are offensive to me\" (Letter 44, 1903).",
